Here’s why it is not that easy,Confiscating Russian state assets frozen by the United States and Europe could breach international law and set a dangerous precedent  experts say.,The United States and Europe have wrestled for months with the question of how to pay for Ukraine’s reconstruction from the war. As Russia pounds cities  factories and infrastructure in Ukraine  the estimated costs have swelled to $500 billion  with some experts citing numbers as high as $1 trillion.One solution seemed brilliant in its simplicity: What better way to foot the bill  and to make a moral point  than to make Russia pay?But that has proved far more difficult than first imagined  and it appears less and less likely. Experts warn that it would likely violate international law and potentially set a dangerous precedent for countries to take the assets of others.The money once seemed easily within reach; since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion  Western nations have frozen more than $330 billion in Russian Central Bank assets held abroad.Leaders of the Group of 7 nations  the world’s biggest economies  said this month that the frozen assets “will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine.” But they recognized “the need for the establishment of an international mechanism for reparation of damages  loss or injury caused by Russian aggression.”With the bulk of the sum  more than $217 billion  frozen in the European Union  the bloc’s top official  Ursula von der Leyen  promised last month during a conference devoted to Ukraine’s reconstruction to present “by the summer break” a legal way to use those Russian assets for Ukraine’s benefit.But her declaration caused uneasiness among bloc officials and diplomats who have been involved in months of discussions over the idea and found it increasingly complicated.What are the obstacles?AdvertisementExperts said that seizing Russian state assets outright carried significant legal and financial risks.Under international law  the assets could be seized through a vote in the UN Security Council  a ruling of the International Court of Justice or a postwar deal. None of those options seem very likely.Russia  a Security Council member  would veto any vote there. No deal can be achieved while the war is still going on. And no case has been brought before the court  and if it were  international law argues against confiscating the Russian Central Bank’s assets  an act that would be a breach of its sovereignty  legal experts said.AdvertisementThe International Court of Justice ruled more than a decade ago that Italian domestic courts had violated modern Germany’s sovereignty by ordering reparations related to Nazi-era forced labor.“In order to avoid risks for one single jurisdiction  it has to be a well-crafted  coordinated and orchestrated move between Western nations ” said Douglas Rediker  a senior fellow with the Washington-based Brookings Institution. “And that’s hard to get. The major issue is that central bank assets are supposed to be sacrosanct. It’s about state sovereignty.”In the United States  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Congress last month that confiscating Russian assets frozen in the United States would probably require a change to US law.European officials assessed in a confidential report  seen by The New York Times  that there was “no credible legal avenue allowing for the confiscation of frozen or immobilized assets on the sole basis of these assets being under EU restrictive measures.”Also in Explained | https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/how-russia-is-tackling-ukraine-counteroffensive-8861598/What are the options?AdvertisementAs the options have dwindled  the European Commission  the bloc’s executive arm  has focused on what it described as the safest solution.The latest idea is to use profits earned by Europe-based financial companies that are holding the assets and channel those profits to Ukraine. According to the commission  this option could generate about 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) per year.AdvertisementThat way  the sum of Russian assets initially frozen would be unaffected in case someday they need to be returned.Most of the frozen assets are held by Euroclear  a large Brussels-based financial services company that is a critical part of the plumbing of financial markets and deals with international transactions and safekeeping of assets for central banks and global commercial banks.AdvertisementBecause of sanctions  earnings related to the assets have been blocked from going back to Russia. Instead  the money from those transactions has been accumulating on Euroclear’s balance sheet  increasing it by about 125 billion euros since the war began.In keeping with regulatory requirements  Euroclear has invested the additional money and earned about 1.7 billion euros in the first half of the year  the company said last week.Under normal circumstances  the company would decide what to do with that money. But given the uncertainties generated by the war  the company’s board said it had decided to set those profits aside.Euroclear said it was concerned with minimizing “potential legal  technical and operational risks” that could come from the commission’s proposals.The company’s profits have already been taxed by Belgium  where it is based  per existing law  bringing in around $111 million  which Prime Minister Alexander de Croo vowed to transfer to Ukraine.But the European Commission’s proposal would substantially increase the takings from the profits  thereby increasing what could be transferred to Ukraine.Alternatively  some former Biden administration officials have proposed using Russia’s frozen assets creatively so that they can benefit Ukraine  without being directly transferred to it.One idea put forward by Daleep Singh  a former deputy national security adviser for international economics  is to place the immobilized assets into an escrow account that can be used by Ukraine as collateral for new bonds it could issue.If Ukraine can successfully repay the debt — over a period of anywhere between 10 and 30 years — then Russia could potentially have its frozen assets back.What are the lingering concerns?Even the latest EU idea  which the commission said would reduce legal and financial risks for Europe  has elicited concern from the European Central Bank and some of the bloc’s nations  which called for a more cautious approach.With the summer deadline now passed  any proposal for a new law to make use of the Russian assets has been postponed to the fall.Although the profits of Euroclear that would be taxed are not owned by Russia  officials worry about damaging the euro’s reputation and sending a signal to foreign investors that their money is not safe in Europe.Without international coordination  investors could turn to other regions and currencies  such as the US dollar or Chinese renminbi  to place their money.Also in Explained | Soldiers in Niger claim to have overthrown President Bazoum: What we knowAn internal report drafted last month by European officials  and seen by the Times  listed the ECB’s concerns. “The implications could be substantial according to the ECB ” the report said. “It may lead to a diversification of reserves away from euro-denominated assets  increase of financing costs for European sovereigns and lead to trade diversification.”About $2 trillion worth of global reserves are held in euros  the second most popular currency after the U.S. dollar.The commission argued that the risk was already taken when Ukraine’s allies decided to freeze the Russian assets and that under the proposed plan  those assets would remain intact and could potentially be recovered in the future  protecting Europe from any legal action by Moscow.Taxing the profits generated by investing the assets should “not affect the financial stability of the Union ” European officials wrote in the confidential report  and “would considerably reduce the legal risks.”President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine has repeatedly made the moral case for more decisive action regarding Russian assets  and his pleas have been echoed by Eastern European nations  like Poland  which have led the calls to punish Russia.“Potential aggressors must see this and remember that the world can be strong ” he said this year at a meeting with Yellen and chiefs of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.But Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said last month that any measure regarding the Russian assets had to be “absolutely watertight.”“We are defending a rules-based international order ” Schallenberg said in an interview with Bloomberg. “If any of these actions were to be lifted by a judge  it would be a diplomatic and economic disaster.”,negative,0.04,0.28,0.69,mixed,0.1,0.24,0.67,True,English,"['Europe', 'Russia', 'war', 'large Brussels-based financial services company', 'Ursula

28542,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/07/29/annual-reports-are-fast-becoming-political-treatises/,Annual reports are fast becoming political treatises,his year’s set of documents from European companies reveal some unexpected reactions to the events of 2022,What are the chances that a European company could describe the operating environment of the past year without mentioning the words “Russia”  “Ukraine” or “war”?You might think it would be impossible. But you would be wrong.Swiss insurer Helvetia has managed to do just that in its 2022 annual report  despite the invasion of Ukraine triggering roaring inflation  an energy crisis and disruption to supplies of everything from grain to fertiliser to metals.Even if Helvetia mentioned the war as a post-balance sheet event in its 2021 accounts  with a fleeting reference in 2022′s first-half results  failing to bring up the conflict in last year’s annual report seems like a glaring omission.READ MOREThe company’s take on 2022 is just one of several unexpected approaches used by European companies in their most recent annual reports. In stark contrast to Helvetia is Swedish online bank Avanza. In his letter to shareholders  Avanza’s chair and founder  Sven Hagströmer  urges Ukrainians and the west to “break the back of the Russian bear”  and describes the invading country as an “evil and unreliable power”.A niche Swedish bank run by an outspoken entrepreneur could be an outlier. Except that even Euronext  Europe’s biggest stock exchange group  has decided now is not the time for the usual corporate diplomacy when it comes to the region’s politics.In its annual report  Stéphane Boujnah  the European exchange’s chair and chief executive officer  stresses that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has demonstrated very clearly the need for reinforced European co-operation and a strengthened European Union”.German metals group Aurubis warns that Russia is “weaponising” energy  while Swedish property developer Fabege says that the war has “blurred the line between reality and fiction in an unreal and frightening way”.The emotional intensity of many of this year’s reports is understandable given the recent extraordinary events. But it raises the question of whether these documents are evolving as companies feel increasingly compelled to take political positions.Annual reports are not just financial summaries. They are “strategic” documents  carefully drafted to address a company’s perceived accountability to stakeholders  says Hendrik Vollmer  associate professor of accounting at Warwick Business School. In the past  companies tried to avoid appearing biased  he tells me. But as the definition of accountability has been extended – to environmental commitments  for example – “there has been something of a dam break”.Being accountable means taking a clear position on what needs to be done  according to Hagströmer. “Companies should be more outspoken politically. They are part of society ” he says.That view has become more common over the past decade as companies embrace corporate social responsibility. “If you go back to the 1980s or 90s  when companies talked about corporate social responsibility (CSR) they would donate money to build a stadium or support a sports team ” says Kaisa Snellman  associate professor of organisational behaviour at Insead business school. “Now CSR means that ... as a CEO  you are going to speak up. Sometimes it will offend your customers ...[or] your employees. And sometimes ... your investors.”In some respects  that may not be a bad thing. A recent study found that companies that came in highest or lowest on a well-known ranking of LGBTQ policies were rewarded by investors with share-price rises  while those in the middle were ignored. It was not about who had the most inclusive policies  but who had the clearest positions.“Not taking a position will make both sides hate you ” says London Business School assistant professor Aharon Cohen-Mohliver  co-author of the study. “People have to believe you are sincere and for that you have to bear some cost by using language that is very strong and clear.”There are obvious risks in taking public positions on these issues  as companies such as Disney have discovered. Yet Mohliver believes more companies will be willing to do so in future in order to differentiate themselves from rivals. “The more you see companies take a position on one side  the more the market opportunity increases for taking a position on the other side ” he says.[ Work Company culture is more important than money to many job seekers ]Meanwhile  Avanza’s Hagströmer has no intention of holding back. “What is going on in the world really affects markets ” he says. “If everybody is affected  why should it not be in annual reports? It’s the elephant in the room.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2023,neutral,0.09,0.58,0.32,negative,0.02,0.25,0.74,True,English,"['Annual reports', 'political treatises', 'London Business School assistant professor', 'Swedish property developer Fabege', 'biggest stock exchange group', 'Swedish online bank Avanza', 'Warwick Business School', 'Insead business school', 'post-balance sheet event', '2022′s first-half results', 'several unexpected approaches', 'usual corporate diplomacy', 'Stéphane Boujnah', 'chief executive officer', 'corporate social responsibility', 'many job seekers', 'recent extraordinary events', 'German metals group', 'The Financial Times', 'Work Company culture', 'Sven Hagströmer', 'Swiss insurer Helvetia', 'recent annual reports', 'Swedish bank', 'European exchange', 'associate professor', 'financial summaries', '2022 annual report', 'recent study', 'operating environment', 'roaring inflation', 'energy crisis', 'fleeting reference', 'glaring omission', 'stark contrast', 'Russian bear', 'invading country', 'unreliable power', 'outspoken entrepreneur', 'European co-operation', 'European Union', 'frightening way', 'emotional intensity', 'political positions', 'Hendrik Vollmer', 'environmental commitments', 'dam break', 'sports team', 'Kaisa Snellman', 'organisational behaviour', 'bad thing', 'known ranking', 'LGBTQ policies', 'share-price rises', 'inclusive policies', 'clearest positions', 'Aharon Cohen-Mohliver', 'obvious risks', 'public positions', 'one side', 'market opportunity', 'other side', 'European company', 'last year', 'past decade', 'strategic” documents', 'Now CSR', 'past year', 'clear position', 'European companies', 'chances', 'words', 'Ukraine', 'invasion', 'disruption', 'supplies', 'everything', 'grain', 'fertiliser', '2021 accounts', 'conflict', 'READ', 'letter', 'shareholders', 'chair', 'founder', 'Ukrainians', 'west', 'back', 'evil', 'outlier', 'Euronext', 'region', 'politics', 'need', 'Aurubis', 'reality', 'fiction', 'unreal', 'question', 'accountability', 'stakeholders', 'accounting', 'definition', 'example', 'something', 'part', 'society', 'view', '1980s', '90s', 'money', 'stadium', 'CEO', 'customers', 'employees', 'investors', 'respects', 'middle', 'sides', 'author', 'People', 'cost', 'language', 'issues', 'Disney', 'future', 'order', 'rivals', 'intention', 'world', 'markets', 'everybody', 'elephant', 'room', 'Copyright']",2023-07-29,2023-07-30,irishtimes.com
