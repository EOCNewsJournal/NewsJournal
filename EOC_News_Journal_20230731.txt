As Russia pounds cities  factories and infrastructure in Ukraine  the estimated costs have swelled to $500 billion (Rs 41.10 lakh crore)  with some experts citing numbers as high as $1 trillion.One solution seemed brilliant in its simplicity: What better way to foot the bill  and to make a moral point  than to make Russia pay?But that has proved far more difficult than first imagined  and it appears less and less likely. Experts warn that it would likely violate international law and potentially set a dangerous precedent for countries to take the assets of others.The money once seemed easily within reach; since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion  Western nations have frozen more than $330 billion (Rs 27.13 lakh crore) in Russian Central Bank assets held abroad.Leaders of the Group of seven nations  the world’s biggest economies  said this month that the frozen assets “will remain immobilised until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine.” But they recognised “the need for the establishment of an international mechanism for reparation of damages  loss or injury caused by Russian aggression.”With the bulk of the sum  more than $217 billion (Rs 17.84 lakh crore)  frozen in the European Union  the bloc’s top official  Ursula von der Leyen  promised last month during a conference devoted to Ukraine’s reconstruction to present “by the summer break” a legal way to use those Russian assets for Ukraine’s benefit.But her declaration caused uneasiness among bloc officials and diplomats who have been involved in months of discussions over the idea and found it increasingly complicated.What are the obstacles?Experts said that seizing Russian state assets outright carried significant legal and financial risks.Under international law  the assets could be seized through a vote in the UN Security Council  a ruling of the International Court of Justice or a postwar deal. None of those options seem very likely.Russia  a Security Council member  would veto any vote there. No deal can be achieved while the war is still going on. And no case has been brought before the court  and if it were  international law argues against confiscating the Russian Central Bank’s assets  an act that would be a breach of its sovereignty  legal experts said.The International Court of Justice ruled more than a decade ago that Italian domestic courts had violated modern Germany’s sovereignty by ordering reparations related to Nazi-era forced labour.“In order to avoid risks for one single jurisdiction  it has to be a well-crafted  coordinated and orchestrated move between Western nations ” said Douglas Rediker  a senior fellow with the Washington-based Brookings Institution. “And that’s hard to get. The major issue is that central bank assets are supposed to be sacrosanct. It’s about state sovereignty.”In the United States  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Congress last month that confiscating Russian assets frozen in the United States would probably require a change to US law.European officials assessed in a confidential report  seen by The New York Times  that there was “no credible legal avenue allowing for the confiscation of frozen or immobilised assets on the sole basis of these assets being under EU restrictive measures.”What are the options?As the options have dwindled  the European Commission  the bloc’s executive arm  has focused on what it described as the safest solution.The latest idea is to use profits earned by Europe-based financial companies that are holding the assets and channel those profits to Ukraine. According to the commission  this option could generate about €3 billion (Rs 27 126 990 crore) per year.That way  the sum of Russian assets initially frozen would be unaffected in case someday they need to be returned.Most of the frozen assets are held by Euroclear  a large Brussels-based financial services company that is a critical part of the plumbing of financial markets and deals with international transactions and safekeeping of assets for central banks and global commercial banks.Because of sanctions  earnings related to the assets have been blocked from going back to Russia. Instead  the money from those transactions has been accumulating on Euroclear’s balance sheet  increasing it by about €125 billion (Rs 11.31 lakh crore) since the war began.In keeping with regulatory requirements  Euroclear has invested the additional money and earned about €1.7 billion (Rs 15 394 180 crore) in the first half of the year  the company said last week.Under normal circumstances  the company would decide what to do with that money. But given the uncertainties generated by the war  the company’s board said it had decided to set those profits aside.Euroclear said it was concerned with minimising “potential legal  technical and operational risks” that could come from the commission’s proposals.The company’s profits have already been taxed by Belgium  where it is based  per existing law  bringing in around $111 million (Rs 912 crore)  which Prime Minister Alexander de Croo vowed to transfer to Ukraine.But the European Commission’s proposal would substantially increase the takings from the profits  thereby increasing what could be transferred to Ukraine.Alternatively  some former Biden administration officials have proposed using Russia’s frozen assets creatively so that they can benefit Ukraine  without being directly transferred to it.One idea put forward by Daleep Singh  a former deputy national security adviser for international economics  is to place the immobilised assets into an escrow account that can be used by Ukraine as collateral for new bonds it could issue.If Ukraine can successfully repay the debt — over a period of anywhere between 10 and 30 years — then Russia could potentially have its frozen assets back.What are the lingering concerns?Even the latest EU idea  which the commission said would reduce legal and financial risks for Europe  has elicited concern from the European Central Bank and some of the bloc’s nations  which called for a more cautious approach.With the summer deadline now passed  any proposal for a new law to make use of the Russian assets has been postponed to the fall.Although the profits of Euroclear that would be taxed are not owned by Russia  officials worry about damaging the euro’s reputation and sending a signal to foreign investors that their money is not safe in Europe.Without international coordination  investors could turn to other regions and currencies  such as the US dollar or Chinese renminbi  to place their money.An internal report drafted last month by European officials  and seen by the Times  listed the ECB’s concerns. “The implications could be substantial according to the ECB ” the report said. “It may lead to a diversification of reserves away from euro-denominated assets  increase of financing costs for European sovereigns and lead to trade diversification.”About $2 trillion (Rs 16 443 000 crore) worth of global reserves are held in euros  the second most popular currency after the US dollar.The commission argued that the risk was already taken when Ukraine’s allies decided to freeze the Russian assets and that under the proposed plan  those assets would remain intact and could potentially be recovered in the future  protecting Europe from any legal action by Moscow.Taxing the profits generated by investing the assets should “not affect the financial stability of the Union ” European officials wrote in the confidential report  and “would considerably reduce the legal risks.”President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine has repeatedly made the moral case for more decisive action regarding Russian assets  and his pleas have been echoed by Eastern European nations  like Poland  which have led the calls to punish Russia.“Potential aggressors must see this and remember that the world can be strong ” he said this year at a meeting with Yellen and chiefs of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.But Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said last month that any measure regarding the Russian assets had to be “absolutely watertight.”“We are defending a rules-based international order ” Schallenberg said in an interview with Bloomberg. “If any of these actions were to be lifted by a judge  it would be a diplomatic and economic disaster.”Monika Pronczuk and Eshe
