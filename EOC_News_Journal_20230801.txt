Interconnectors are power cables connecting different countries' electricity grids  as a means of improving energy security by expediting the transmission of energy internationally from where it is generated to where it is needed.As the world transitions to a NetZero future  and with recent stark reminders of the importance of energy security  interconnectors are recognised as a central component to countries' energy strategies as interconnected grids are more efficient and able to respond to market stress. As the world transitions towards a NetZero future  growing electricity demand and increased dependence on intermittent power sources requires grids that are strong  flexible  and interconnected.The nucleus of this platform is the Global InterConnection Group board which comprises: Edmund Truell (Executive Chairman) and non-executive directors Jennie Younger  Luke Webster  Richard Pinnock and Roger Le Tissier; and special advisers: Chris Sturgeon  Michael Ridley and Kari Stadigh. They oversee Global InterConnection Group's Advanced Cables and Global InterConnectors divisional boards and management  supported by a design  planning and operations division  Global InterConnection Group Services together with expert advisers and partners such as RTE International (the arm of Europe’s largest grid operator)  Afry  Aecom  and Red Penguin.Global InterConnectors is buying and building up a portfolio of European interconnectors. Its first project is Atlantic SuperConnection  which is developing a 1 708 km interconnector project  where the technical feasibility work has now been done to build a 1 800 MW interconnector between Iceland and the UK; and a valuable connection agreement secured near Hull  England.Advanced Cables is developing a 1 600 km/year capacity HVDC cable manufacturing facility in the North-East of England in two phases  with strong support from the UK government. Global InterConnection Group has signed a memorandum of understanding which paves the way for Advanced Cables to address the shortage of HVDC subsea cable  where demand far outstrips supply and order books are full for several years to come. The partner is then bringing to bear their world-class technology and experience.Further details are available at www.globalinterconnectiongroup.com.PRESSANDINVESTORINFORMATIONFor more information  please contact:Companyenquiriesto:chrissie.boyle@globalinterconnectiongroup.com orDisruptive@admina.ggFirst Floor  10 Lefebvre Street St Peter Port Guernsey GY1 2PEMediainquiriesto:James Culverhouse EQ James.culverhouse@eqcorp.co+44 20 7223 1100 / +44 7912 508 322WARRANTHOLDERREPRESENTATIONLETTER[ ]  2023For the Attention of:Global InterConnection Group LimitedVan Lanschot Kempen N.V.

Ltd.: Dividend announcement31.07.2023 / 15:36 CET/CESTThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.Haier Smart Home Co.  Ltd. Qingdao  Shandong Province  People's Republic of China Dividend announcement The Annual General Meeting of the company held on June 26  2023  resolved to pay for each D registered common share a dividend per share of EUR 0.0725221 gross dividend per share of EUR 0.0652699 less 10% withholding tax in China payable from August 25  2023 for financial year 2022. Those shareholders for whom shares in the company will be booked on August 24  2023  (date of record) are entitled to a dividend. The exchange rate of 1 EUR = 7.8172 RMB is based on the average exchange rate of a week immediately prior to the Annual General Meeting. The shares of the company will be listed in the sub-segment of the regulated market with additional post-admission obligations on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Prime Standard) on August 25  2023 “ex-dividend.” The payment of the dividend via Clearstream Banking AG is generally subject to the deduction of Chinese withholding tax of 10%. The Chinese withholding tax can generally be credited against the German income tax payable on Chinese income or be deductible for tax purposes when determining income. A domestic entity paying out the investment income (i.e.  as a rule  the respective custodian) will generally pay the dividends of a company domiciled in the People’s Republic of China to the shareholder  who is subject to unlimited tax liability in Germany  subject to the deduction of German withholding tax (final withholding tax). The withholding tax is generally 25% plus a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% (effective tax rate thus 26.375%) and  if applicable  plus church tax (depending on the individual’s religious denomination and state of residence). The gross dividend serves as the basis of assessment for the capital gains tax. The domestic paying agent is always obliged to deduct capital gains tax if the shareholders have not submitted a so-called non-assessment certificate or a so-called exemption order. Whether the dividend is actually taxable for the shareholder is irrelevant for the deduction of capital gains tax. It is therefore possible to refrain from deducting tax if  among other criteria the creditor of the investment income is a natural person with unlimited tax liability and this person proves to the domestic paying agent by submitting the original of a valid non-assessment certificate that he or she will probably not be assessed for income tax;the creditor of the investment income is a natural person with unlimited tax liability and has issued a valid exemption order. An exemption order is the creditor’s private written order to the withholding agent not to deduct capital gains tax up to the tax-free maximum amount of EUR 801 (or EUR 1 602 in the case of married couples/partners in life assessed jointly);the creditor of the investment income is a tax-exempt corporation or a domestic legal entity under public law;in the case of the creditor of the investment income  this is part of the business income and the investment income tax in the case of the creditor of the investment income would permanently be higher than the total income or corporation tax to be assessed due to the nature of its business. This must be proven by a certificate from the tax office responsible for the creditor;the creditor of the investment income is a corporation  association of persons or estate subject to unlimited tax liability in Germany that serves tax-privileged purposes. This could apply to associations  for example. The tax concession must be evidenced by a certificate from the tax office responsible for the creditor. For the individual requirements in each case  reference is made here to the provisions of German tax law (esp. Sec. 43 (2)  (3) in conjunction with Sec. 44a of the German Income Tax Act (EStG)). If it is not possible to withhold German withholding tax  the withholding agent  i.e. the domestic paying agent  must check whether the Chinese withholding tax levied in the amount of the withholding tax right under the German-Chinese double taxation agreement can be credited directly against the withholding tax in the withholding procedure. This possibility only exists insofar as the dividends are counted as income from capital assets  which is the case in particular for natural persons with shareholdings as private assets (Section 43a (3) sentence 1 EStG; BMF dated January 18  2016  BStBl. I 2016  p. 85  para. 202 in conjunction with the BMF dated March 31  2022  BStBl. I 2022  p. 328  para. 3). According to the overview of the Federal Central Tax Office (“BZSt”) on the rates of creditable foreign withholding taxes  the creditable Chinese withholding tax amounts to 10% if there is no exemption.1 If the Chinese withholding tax is credited against the capital gains tax by the paying agent  the capital gains tax will only be credited in the amount of the difference to a tax deduction of 25%. If the crediting of the Chinese withholding tax on the capital gains tax by the paying agent is not possible  the foreign tax cannot be credited in the deduction procedure at the level of the paying agent. The shareholder then has the option of obtaining relief in the assessment procedure. __________ 1 See https://www.bzst.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/EU_OECD/anrechenbare_ausl_quellensteuer_2023.pdf The taxation of dividends for persons with unlimited tax liability in Germany can be summarized as follows: 1. Natural persons who hold the D shares as part of their private assets for tax purposes: The gross dividend is generally subject to the special final withholding tax rate (25% plus the solidarity surcharge of 5.5% and church tax  if applicable). The tax liability is deemed to be satisfied by the proper deduction of the capital gains tax.In the context of the assessment  there is an option to tax the gross dividend at the standard tax rate via the so-called favorable tax assessment. In this case  the reduced German capital gains tax pursuant to Sec. 43a (3) sentence 1 EStG is to be credited without limitation against the income tax within the scope of Sec. 36 EStG. The Chinese withholding tax taken into account in the capital gains tax deduction via Sec. 43a (3) sentence 1 EStG is to be credited against the additional standard income tax payable on the added capital income (Section 32d (6) sentence 2 EStG).Actual income-related expenses are not deductible. For this purpose  the shareholder is granted a lump-sum savings allowance of EUR 1 000 or  in the case of married couples/partners in life assessed jointly  of EUR 2 000. 2. Natural persons who hold the D Shares as business assets for tax purposes or through a commercial partnership: The gross dividends are taxable at 60% under the partial income method. Related business expenses can be claimed at a tax-reducing rate of 60%.The German capital gains tax levied is creditable against income tax without limitation; even a refund is possible if no income tax is due (Sec. 36 (4) EStG).The Chinese withholding tax  which is not subject to any further reduction  must be credited against the income tax attributable to the foreign income from China within the limits of Sec. 34c EStG (so-called per-country-limitation  Sec. 68a EStDV). Thus  business expenses in economic connection with the dividend reduce the credit volume. If no income tax arises (e.g. due to domestic losses)  the Chinese withholding tax is not creditable; no refund is possible. Upon application  a tax deduction is possible in the tax return instead of a credit when determining the income.For trade tax purposes  dividends are generally recognized at 100% if the shareholding (in the nominal capital) was less than 15% at the beginning of the assessment period (January 1). 3. Corporate income tax entities (including corporations subject to corporate income tax): In the case of corporate income tax entities  the gross dividend is generally fully subject to corporate income tax  unless the participation was 10% or more at the beginning of the calendar year. If the participation comprises 10% or more  the gross dividends are effectively 95% exempt from corporate income tax.Operating expenses in connection with the dividends can generally be taken into account.The German capital gains tax withheld and remitted by the paying agent can always be credited against corporate income tax; even a refund is possible if no corporate income tax is due (Sec. 36 (4) EStG).The Chinese withholding tax  which is no longer subject to a reduction claim  must be credited against the corporate income tax attributable to the foreign income from China within the limits of Sec. 26 of the German Corporate Income Tax Act (KStG) in conjunction with Sec. 34c of the German Income Tax Act (EStDV) (the so-called per-country-limitation  Sec. 68a of the German Income Tax Ordinance (EStDV)). Thus  business expenses in economic connection with the dividend reduce the credit volume. If no corporate income tax arises (e.g. due to domestic losses)  the Chinese withholding tax is not creditable; no refund is possible. Upon application  a tax deduction is possible in the tax return instead of a credit when determining the incomeFor trade tax purposes  dividends must be recognized at 100% if the shareholding (in the nominal capital) was less than 15% at the beginning of the assessment period (January 1). In the case of foreign shareholders not resident in Germany  the Chinese withholding tax may  if applicable  be credited against any tax payable on the dividend in the relevant country in accordance with the national tax regulations of the relevant country or the provisions of a corresponding double taxation treaty. We would like to point out that the above explanations are of an overview nature and can therefore neither be a complete presentation of all national or international tax aspects  nor can they take the particularities of specific individual cases into account. Investors are advised to seek advice from a tax advisor on the specific tax consequences of their investment. Frankfurt/Main  July 2023On behalf of Haier Smart Home Co.

CIOA  an engineering company listed on Euronext Access  announces a se…,PRESS RELEASELa Garde  July 31th  2023CIOA TAKES LEGAL ACTION AGAINST JD EUROWAY AND ITS OFFICERSFOR BREACH OF CONTRACT AND BREACH OF TRUST.CIOA  an engineering company listed on Euronext Access  announces a series of legal actions it is taking against the Canadian financial group JD EUROWAY before the relevant authorities  including the Quebec Superior Court  the Canadian AMF (Autorité des Marchés Financiers)  FINTRAC and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).CIOA also intends to seek tortious liability against the officers of JD EUROWAY  in particular Fritz ZEPHIR  Michael BENSON and Myron LOUISY.In addition to JD EUROWAY's contractual default  these proceedings are the result of maneuvers by its named officers  which CIOA considers to be fraudulent and liable to multiple criminal charges  aimed at misappropriating assets  securities and valuables belonging to CIOA and its directors  for the benefit of the parties concerned.From late 2021 to early 2022  this Canadian fund  which declares USD 2.3 billion in assets under management with the SEC  has signed several financing contracts with CIOA  through its subsidiary LANDES Finance  totaling USD 165 million to support various programs in its development plan  including principally  one concerning the construction of 200 000 social housing units for employees of Ghana's public institution.As early as February 2020  JD EUROWAY declared that it had blocked  on behalf of CIOA  all the funds concerned in a trust account held by the JD EUROWAY BANCORP trust  also a subsidiary of JD EUROWAY  pending the constitution of guarantees by CIOA (pledge of securities held by the founders and majority shareholders of CIOA  as well as financial instruments).However  once these guarantees had been put in place  JD EUROWAY made repeated promises throughout 2022 to release an initial drawdown of USD 50 million  without ever meeting its commitments. JD EUROWAY then recently proposed amendments to CIOA  substantially modifying the nature and economy of the initial agreements. These new provisions were presented as a precondition for the release of the drawings provided for in the disbursement plan.Finally  a check for USD 5 million issued by the JD EUROWAY Trust  pending the release of the drawings requested by CIOA  was not paid by the bank expressly designated by JD EUROWAY. However  while American regulations allow trusts to issue checks  they also require them to deposit the equivalent amount of the checks they issue in escrow...This situation is seriously prejudicial to CIOA  whose business plan is largely based on the programs that were to be supported by this financing  and which is plunging CIOA into a period of uncertainty given the significant upstream investments made to prepare the programs linked to this financing.CIOA will do everything in its power to protect its interests and those of its shareholders.CIOA will continue to inform the public of future developments concerning this case  in accordance with its legal obligations.About CIOA:CIOA is a collaborative business engineering group that federates a network of co-developers around a shared resource platform  to deliver innovative solutions that improve people's lives in key areas of their existence: housing  work & enterprise  entertainment.Groupe CIOA : www.cioa.com - presse@cioa.com,negative,0.03,0.3,0.67,negative,0.01,0.15,0.83,True,English,"['Groupe CIOA', 'LEGAL ACTION', 'JD EUROWAY', 'ITS', 'OFFICERS', 'BREACH', 'CONTRACT', 'TRUST', 'Autorité des Marchés Financiers', 'collaborative business engineering group', 'JD EUROWAY BANCORP trust', 'Quebec Superior Court', 'multiple criminal charges', 'significant upstream investments', 'Canadian financial group', '200,000 social housing units', 'several financing contracts', 'JD EUROWAY Trust', 'engineering company', 'business plan', 'trust account', 'financial instruments', 'Canadian AMF', 'Canadian fund', 'La Garde', 'LEGAL ACTION', 'Euronext Access', 'relevant authorities', 'Exchange Commission', 'tortious liability', 'Fritz ZEPHIR', 'Michael BENSON', 'Myron LOUISY', 'contractual default', 'LANDES Finance', 'development plan', 'initial drawdown', 'initial agreements', 'new provisions', 'disbursement plan', 'American regulations', 'equivalent amount', 'future developments', 'legal obligations', 'resource platform', 'innovative solutions', 'key areas', 'Groupe CIOA', 'public institution', 'majority shareholders', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'ITS OFFICERS', 'US Securities', 'various programs', 'BREACH', 'series', 'FINTRAC', 'addition', 'proceedings', 'result', 'maneuvers', 'assets', 'valuables', 'directors', 'benefit', 'parties', 'late 2021', 'early 2022', 'management', 'subsidiary', 'construction', 'employees', 'Ghana', 'February', 'behalf', 'funds', 'constitution', 'guarantees', 'pledge', 'founders', 'place', 'promises', 'commitments', 'amendments', 'nature', 'economy', 'precondition', 'drawings', 'check', 'USD', 'bank', 'trusts', 'escrow', 'situation', 'period', 'uncertainty', 'everything', 'power', 'interests', 'case', 'accordance', 'network', 'developers', 'people', 'lives', 'existence', 'enterprise', 'entertainment', 'presse']",2023-07-31,2023-08-01,marketscreener.com

JD EUROWAY then recently proposed amendments to CIOA  substantially modifying the nature and economy of the initial agreements. These new provisions were presented as a precondition for the release of the drawings provided for in the disbursement plan.Finally  a check for USD 5 million issued by the JD EUROWAY Trust  pending the release of the drawings requested by CIOA  was not paid by the bank expressly designated by JD EUROWAY. However  while American regulations allow trusts to issue checks  they also require them to deposit the equivalent amount of the checks they issue in escrow...This situation is seriously prejudicial to CIOA  whose business plan is largely based on the programs that were to be supported by this financing  and which is plunging CIOA into a period of uncertainty given the significant upstream investments made to prepare the programs linked to this financing.CIOA will do everything in its power to protect its interests and those of its shareholders.CIOA will continue to inform the public of future developments concerning this case  in accordance with its legal obligations.About CIOA:CIOA is a collaborative business engineering group that federates a network of co-developers around a shared resource platform  to deliver innovative solutions that improve people's lives in key areas of their existence: housing  work & enterprise  entertainment.Groupe CIOA : www.cioa.com - presse@cioa.comThis publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: lJlyYcWXaZvHmGtpksaZamRjZ2llmZKXmWiayZZvlZ+VbXGRl2yWmMmYZnFimGhv- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Inside Information:- other releases Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/81339-cp-jdeurway-cp-claim-31072023-en_bad.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2023 ActusNews",negative,0.04,0.32,0.65,negative,0.01,0.12,0.87,True,English,"['Groupe Cioa Sa', 'LEGAL ACTION', 'JD EUROWAY', 'ITS', 'OFFICERS', 'BREACH', 'CONTRACT', 'TRUST', 'Autorité des Marchés Financiers', 'collaborative business engineering group', 'JD EUROWAY BANCORP trust', 'Quebec Superior Court', 'multiple criminal charges', 'significant upstream investments', 'Canadian financial group', 'next press releases', '200,000 social housing units', 'SECURITY MASTER Key', 'several financing contracts', 'Actusnews SECURITY MASTER', 'original press release', 'JD EUROWAY Trust', 'business plan', 'engineering company', 'trust account', 'financial instruments', 'other releases', 'Canadian AMF', 'Canadian fund', 'La Garde', 'LEGAL ACTION', 'Euronext Access', 'relevant authorities', 'Exchange Commission', 'tortious liability', 'Fritz ZEPHIR', 'Michael BENSON', 'Myron LOUISY', 'contractual default', 'LANDES Finance', 'development plan', 'initial drawdown', 'initial agreements', 'new provisions', 'disbursement plan', 'American regulations', 'equivalent amount', 'future developments', 'legal obligations', 'resource platform', 'innovative solutions', 'Groupe CIOA', 'key areas', 'public institution', 'majority shareholders', 'Regulated information', 'US Securities', 'various programs', 'OFFICERS', 'BREACH', 'series', 'FINTRAC', 'addition', 'proceedings', 'result', 'maneuvers', 'assets', 'valuables', 'directors', 'benefit', 'parties', 'late 2021', 'early 2022', 'management', 'subsidiary', 'construction', 'employees', 'Ghana', 'February', 'behalf', 'funds', 'constitution', 'guarantees', 'pledge', 'founders', 'place', 'promises', 'USD', 'commitments', 'amendments', 'nature', 'economy', 'precondition', 'drawings', 'check', 'bank', 'trusts', 'escrow', 'situation', 'period', 'uncertainty', 'everything', 'power', 'interests', 'case', 'accordance', 'network', 'developers', 'people', 'lives', 'existence', 'enterprise', 'entertainment', 'presse', 'publication', 'Full', 'PDF', 'cp', 'email']",2023-07-31,2023-08-01,marketscreener.com

Created in 2016  the …,Quadient S.A. (Euronext Paris: QDT  eligible for PEA-PME investing)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  announces today the renewal of its parcel locker joint venture in Japan with Yamato Transport. Created in 2016  the joint venture Packcity Japan is being renewed under an unchanged ownership with 51% of it being owned by Quadient and 49% owned by Yamato Transport.Packcity Japan was created with a visionary approach to launch and develop the first shared open network in the world  with an initial ambition to install 5 000 lockers in easily accessible places with high footfall by 2022. This target was reached as early as November 2019  with the network now encompassing nearly 6 800 lockers  demonstrating the successful development of parcel lockers to provide high quality and convenient delivery solutions to Japanese citizens. Additionally  it significantly reduces delivery costs for carriers and contributes to a greener e-commerce footprint.While the initial 7-year agreement was based on a rental fee model for most of the locker space  the growth  maturity and experience acquired in Japan as well as in other key geographies has led the business model to evolve towards a remuneration based on a fee per parcel. This more flexible model is in line with the business model now in place in other Quadient open networks and will allow for a reduced unit fee for carriers while maximizing volume usage.The renewal of the joint venture should also enable further expansion of the network with a strategy to increase density in specific urban areas  with presence in some of the best locations for consumer touchpoints  such as supermarkets  train stations and pharmacies. While the Tokyo area already benefits from the solid joint venture locker infrastructure for parcel delivery  other major Japanese cities offer significant potential for expansion of the open network  which is already receiving growing interest from additional partners. The aim is to increase the overall volume of parcels handled  stimulated in particular by the introduction of new services contributing to accelerate the adoption by end-users.Geoffrey Godet  CEO of Quadient said: “Japan has been a key market in Quadient’s parcel locker strategy for many years. The renewal of our joint venture with Yamato Transport is an important step that confirms the success of our business model and consolidates our position as a key player in this market. Bolstered by the positive results of our recent user survey  showing a strong 99% pickup satisfaction rate in Q1 2023  we remain committed to leading the way through innovation in the coming years  confident that demand for intelligent locker-based services will continue to increase and fuel our growth in Japan.”Quadient enjoys a leading position in parcel lockers on the Japanese market as well as in North America. The expertise acquired over the years  through the joint venture with Yamato Transport  the acquisition of Parcel Pending in the USA and the company's innovation efforts  has enabled Quadient to extend its business model and now accelerate its development in European markets  such as France and the UK.About Quadient®Quadient is the driving force behind the world’s most meaningful customer experiences.

(“Searchlight”)  a private Canadian-specialty pharmaceutical company  today announced the signing of a binding term sheet for a licensing agreement for the Canadian rights to Donesta®  an investigational medicine for the treatment of the symptoms of menopause.Under the binding terms  Searchlight will have the exclusive sales and marketing rights for Donesta® in Canada.

As a Canadian company with extensive experience in women’s health  Searchlight is ideally positioned to ensure optimized launch to provide rapid access to this differentiated-therapeutic candidate and generate maximum value for our shareholders.

Strong relationships built on trust and backed by results are integral to our strategic focus of bringing innovative products  such as this novel Estetrol-based hormone therapy  to the Canadian market. As a leader in women’s health in Canada  we’re excited to be able to deliver another option to help Canadian women address their unmet needs in managing the symptoms of menopause.”In 2022  Mithra announced topline efficacy results of the Donesta® Phase 3 clinical program  which demonstrated a meaningful reduction in vasomotor symptoms from baseline and compared to placebo  with all co-primary efficacy endpoints met with statistical significance.

The Group produces flexible packaging solutions for a diversified portfolio of blue-chip customers and local champions in the consumer and pharmaceutical industries.The Company would be sold for a price that yields net proceeds1 for Wendel of c.€1 097M  reflecting a multiple of 1.94 times Wendel’s total investment in Constantia Flexibles since 2015.The transaction net proceeds are €84 million above Constantia Flexibles’ valuation in Wendel’s net asset value (“NAV”) published before the transaction announcement  i.e. as of March 31  2023. Furthermore  additional proceeds generated by the Company’s ongoing assets disposals  could bring the proceeds up to €1 124 million  i.e. a valuation 11.0% higher than the NAV at March 31  2023  and 6.8% higher than the NAV at June 30  2023.The closing of the transaction should take place during the second half of 2023  subject to the satisfaction of the contractual conditions precedents  including the clearance by regulatory authorities.David Darmon  Wendel Group’s Deputy CEO  said: “The history of Constantia Flexibles within Wendel's portfolio highlights the validity of our long-term investor model  which has enabled us to support the Companyin its development. Constantia Flexibles has thus placed innovation at the heart of its growth model  enabling it to rise to the challenge of the circular economy without compromising on the functional requirements of its products. Under PimVervaat’s leadership all Constantia Flexibles teams demonstrated their commitment and resilience during the Covid-19 crisis  and coped brilliantly with the recent disruptions in the energy and commodities markets. They enabled the Company to deliver outstanding operational  financial and extra-financial performance.”PimVervaat  CEO of Constantia Flexibles  affirms: ""Our current position and success would not have been possible without Wendel's dedication and commitment. We are grateful for their supportive partnership over the years  which has enabled our growth and investments in our workforce  innovations  and sustainable offerings for the Consumer and Pharma markets. Working alongside Wendel has been a pleasure.""History of Wendel’s Investment in Constantia FlexiblesOn March 27  2015  Wendel finalized the acquisition of Constantia Flexibles for an enterprise value of €2.3 billion and invested €640 million in equity for a 73% stake in the Company  alongside the AREPO Foundation’s €240 million  or 27% investment. Subsequently  on September 22  2015  Wendel signed an agreement with Maxburg Capital Partners (“MCP”)  an investment company backed by the RAG Foundation  to syndicate a minority share of its investment in Constantia Flexibles. Accordingly  in November 2015  MCP acquired approximately 11% of the capital of Constantia Flexibles from Wendel for €101 million. Following this transaction  Wendel  the AREPO Foundation and MCP subsequently participated in a €50 million capital increase for Constantia Flexibles  each subscribing to a pro-rata stake  to finance the acquisitions of Afripack and Pemara. Following the capital increase and MCP’s investment in Constantia Flexibles  Wendel’s equity investment in Constantia Flexibles totaled €565 million. Wendel is the Company’s controlling shareholder  with 60.8% of the share capital.In 2017  Constantia Flexibles sold its Labels business to Multi-Color Corporation. This value-creating transaction gave the Company additional resources to bolster its growth strategy in the flexible packaging market  where it is a leader in segments such as confectionery foils  die-cut lidding  alu-container systems and pharma foil.Under its ownership  Wendel supported Constantia Flexibles in its external growth strategy  with 11 acquisitions in 10 countries.ESG achievements since 2015For more than 8 years  Wendel has supported Constantia Flexibles in its ESG challenges  and more specifically in the issues of the circular economy and the fight against climate change. As a result  since 2018 the Austrian group has had a greenhouse gas emissions reduction trajectory approved by the SBTi. 85% of its products are designed for recycling or have a recyclable alternative. Occupational safety has always been an absolute priority for Wendel  and special attention has been paid to this issue  resulting in continuous improvement  with the accident frequency rate falling from 13.4 in 2014 to 2.2 in 2022.The relevance of the in-depth work carried out by Wendel and Constantia is reflected in the Group's excellent extra-financial ratings  with an A- rating from the CDP and the Ecovadis Gold medal  ranking Constantia among the top 2% of companies in its sector.1 Net proceeds after financial debt  dilution to the benefit of the Company’s minority investors  transaction costs and other debt-like adjustmentsAgendaThursday October 26th  2023Q3 2023 Trading update – Publication of NAV as of September 30  2023 (after-market release)Thursday December 7th  20232023 Investor DayWednesday February 28  2024FY 2024 results – Publication of NAV as of December 31  2023  and Full-Year consolidated financial statements (post-market release)Thursday April 25th  2024Q1 2024 Trading update – Publication of NAV as of March 31  2024 (post-market release)Thursday May 16th  2024Annual General MeetingWednesday July 31  2024H1 2024 results – Publication of NAV as of June 30  2024  and condensed Half-Year consolidated financial statements (post-market release)Thursday October 24  2024Q3 2024 Trading update – Publication of NAV as of September 30  2024 (post-market release)Thursday December 5th  20242024 Investor DayAbout WendelWendel is one of Europe’s leading listed investment firms.

The Group produces flexible packaging solutions for a diversified portfolio of blue-chip customers and local champions in the consumer and pharmaceutical industries.The Company would be sold for a price that yields net proceeds1 for Wendel of c.€1 097M  reflecting a multiple of 1.94 times Wendel’s total investment in Constantia Flexibles since 2015.The transaction net proceeds are €84 million above Constantia Flexibles’ valuation in Wendel’s net asset value (“NAV”) published before the transaction announcement  i.e. as of March 31  2023. Furthermore  additional proceeds generated by the Company’s ongoing assets disposals  could bring the proceeds up to €1 124 million  i.e. a valuation 11.0% higher than the NAV at March 31  2023  and 6.8% higher than the NAV at June 30  2023.The closing of the transaction should take place during the second half of 2023  subject to the satisfaction of the contractual conditions precedents  including the clearance by regulatory authorities.David Darmon  Wendel Group’s Deputy CEO  said: “The history of Constantia Flexibles within Wendel's portfolio highlights the validity of our long-term investor model  which has enabled us to support the Company in its development. Constantia Flexibles has thus placed innovation at the heart of its growth model  enabling it to rise to the challenge of the circular economy without compromising on the functional requirements of its products. Under Pim Vervaat’s leadership  all Constantia Flexibles teams demonstrated their commitment and resilience during the Covid-19 crisis  and coped brilliantly with the recent disruptions in the energy and commodities markets. They enabled the Company to deliver outstanding operational  financial and extra-financial performance.”Pim Vervaat  CEO of Constantia Flexibles  affirms: ""Our current position and success would not have been possible without Wendel's dedication and commitment. We are grateful for their supportive partnership over the years  which has enabled our growth and investments in our workforce  innovations  and sustainable offerings for the Consumer and Pharma markets. Working alongside Wendel has been a pleasure.""History of Wendel’s Investment in Constantia FlexiblesOn March 27  2015  Wendel finalized the acquisition of Constantia Flexibles for an enterprise value of €2.3 billion and invested €640 million in equity for a 73% stake in the Company  alongside the AREPO Foundation’s €240 million  or 27% investment. Subsequently  on September 22  2015  Wendel signed an agreement with Maxburg Capital Partners (“MCP”)  an investment company backed by the RAG Foundation  to syndicate a minority share of its investment in Constantia Flexibles. Accordingly  in November 2015  MCP acquired approximately 11% of the capital of Constantia Flexibles from Wendel for €101 million. Following this transaction  Wendel  the AREPO Foundation and MCP subsequently participated in a €50 million capital increase for Constantia Flexibles  each subscribing to a pro-rata stake  to finance the acquisitions of Afripack and Pemara. Following the capital increase and MCP’s investment in Constantia Flexibles  Wendel’s equity investment in Constantia Flexibles totaled €565 million. Wendel is the Company’s controlling shareholder  with 60.8% of the share capital.In 2017  Constantia Flexibles sold its Labels business to Multi-Color Corporation. This value-creating transaction gave the Company additional resources to bolster its growth strategy in the flexible packaging market  where it is a leader in segments such as confectionery foils  die-cut lidding  alu-container systems and pharma foil.Under its ownership  Wendel supported Constantia Flexibles in its external growth strategy  with 11 acquisitions in 10 countries.ESG achievements since 2015For more than 8 years  Wendel has supported Constantia Flexibles in its ESG challenges  and more specifically in the issues of the circular economy and the fight against climate change. As a result  since 2018 the Austrian group has had a greenhouse gas emissions reduction trajectory approved by the SBTi. 85% of its products are designed for recycling or have a recyclable alternative. Occupational safety has always been an absolute priority for Wendel  and special attention has been paid to this issue  resulting in continuous improvement  with the accident frequency rate falling from 13.4 in 2014 to 2.2 in 2022.The relevance of the in-depth work carried out by Wendel and Constantia is reflected in the Group's excellent extra-financial ratings  with an A- rating from the CDP and the Ecovadis Gold medal  ranking Constantia among the top 2% of companies in its sector.1 Net proceeds after financial debt  dilution to the benefit of the Company’s minority investors  transaction costs and other debt-like adjustmentsAgendaThursday October 26th  2023Q3 2023 Trading update – Publication of NAV as of September 30  2023 (after-market release)Thursday December 7th  20232023 Investor DayWednesday February 28  2024FY 2024 results – Publication of NAV as of December 31  2023  and Full-Year consolidated financial statements (post-market release)Thursday April 25th  2024Q1 2024 Trading update – Publication of NAV as of March 31  2024 (post-market release)Thursday May 16th  2024Annual General MeetingWednesday July 31  2024H1 2024 results – Publication of NAV as of June 30  2024  and condensed Half-Year consolidated financial statements (post-market release)Thursday October 24  2024Q3 2024 Trading update – Publication of NAV as of September 30  2024 (post-market release)Thursday December 5th  20242024 Investor DayAbout WendelWendel is one of Europe’s leading listed investment firms.

The Company also reported financial results for the second quarter and the first half of 2023. The quarterly and half-year financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on July 28  2023.Recent Business DevelopmentsViaskin™ Peanut in 1 – 3-year-olds (original square patch) and Viaskin™ Peanut in 4 – 7-year-olds (modified circular patch) are separate product candidates with independent clinical and regulatory paths supporting two distinct Biologics License Applications (BLAs).DBV received Type C Meeting Written Responses from the FDA on the two supplemental safety studies  known as COMFORT. The COMFORT Toddlers safety study will enroll peanut allergic toddlers ages 1 – 3-years and will support the efficacy results generated from the EPITOPE Phase 3 pivotal study. The COMFORT Children safety study will enroll peanut allergic children ages 4 – 7-years and will support the efficacy results anticipated from the ongoing VITESSE Phase 3 pivotal study.The FDA agreed with a 6-month study duration and a 3:1 randomization (active:placebo) of approximately 400 subjects in the double-blind  placebo-controlled COMFORT Toddlers study. Both COMFORT studies will assess adhesion using the same tools and measurements that were established in VITESSE. Neither the COMFORT Toddlers study nor the COMFORT Children study will require an oral food challenge for participation.The feedback received is consistent with FDA’s position on COMFORT Children in 4 – 7-year-olds  as previously announced in December 2022.Both COMFORT studies aim to bring the total number of subjects on active treatment to approximately 600 participants in each age group  when added to their respective Phase 3 pivotal efficacy studies (i.e.  EPITOPE and VITESSE).“We are pleased to have received feedback from the FDA on key design elements for the COMFORT safety study protocols in 1 – 3 and 4 – 7-year-olds with peanut allergy ” said Daniel Tassé  Chief Executive Officer  DBV Technologies. “This continues the positive momentum DBV received in December 2022and April 2023 when we outlined our regulatory pathways for Viaskin Peanut in children and toddlers. We are actively enrolling subjects in the VITESSE Phase 3 study and were also honored to have our EPITOPE data published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May  with an accompanying editorial. The COMFORT Toddlers and COMFORT Children safety studies meet the FDA’s request for additional safety studiesin these patient populations.As we completethe final protocols  which we expect to share with FDA  we areactively progressingsite selection and contracting to enablethestartof the COMFORT safety studies as soon as final FDA protocol alignment is achieved.”Conference CallDBV will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Monday  July 31st  at 5:00 p.m. ET to report first half 2023 financial results and provide a corporate update.Participants may access this event via the below teleconferencing numbers and asking to join the DBV Technologies call:United States: 1-844-481-2866International: +1-412-317-1859A live webcast of the call will be available on the Investors & Media section of the Company’s website: https://www.dbv-technologies.com/investor-relations/.

The Company also reported financial results for the second quarter and the first half of 2023. The quarterly and half-year financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on July 28  2023.Recent Business DevelopmentsViaskin™ Peanut in 1 – 3-year-olds (original square patch) and Viaskin™ Peanut in 4 – 7-year-olds (modified circular patch) are separate product candidates with independent clinical and regulatory paths supporting two distinct Biologics License Applications (BLAs).DBV received Type C Meeting Written Responses from the FDA on the two supplemental safety studies  known as COMFORT. The COMFORT Toddlers safety study will enroll peanut allergic toddlers ages 1 – 3-years and will support the efficacy results generated from the EPITOPE Phase 3 pivotal study. The COMFORT Children safety study will enroll peanut allergic children ages 4 – 7-years and will support the efficacy results anticipated from the ongoing VITESSE Phase 3 pivotal study.The FDA agreed with a 6-month study duration and a 3:1 randomization (active:placebo) of approximately 400 subjects in the double-blind  placebo-controlled COMFORT Toddlers study. Both COMFORT studies will assess adhesion using the same tools and measurements that were established in VITESSE. Neither the COMFORT Toddlers study nor the COMFORT Children study will require an oral food challenge for participation.The feedback received is consistent with FDA’s position on COMFORT Children in 4 – 7-year-olds  as previously announced in December 2022.Both COMFORT studies aim to bring the total number of subjects on active treatment to approximately 600 participants in each age group  when added to their respective Phase 3 pivotal efficacy studies (i.e.  EPITOPE and VITESSE).“We are pleased to have received feedback from the FDA on key design elements for the COMFORT safety study protocols in 1 – 3 and 4 – 7-year-olds with peanut allergy ” said Daniel Tassé  Chief Executive Officer  DBV Technologies. “This continues the positive momentum DBV received in December 2022 and April 2023 when we outlined our regulatory pathways for Viaskin Peanut in children and toddlers. We are actively enrolling subjects in the VITESSE Phase 3 study and were also honored to have our EPITOPE data published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May  with an accompanying editorial. The COMFORT Toddlers and COMFORT Children safety studies meet the FDA’s request for additional safety studies in these patient populations. As we complete the final protocols  which we expect to share with FDA  we are actively progressing site selection and contracting to enable the start of the COMFORT safety studies as soon as final FDA protocol alignment is achieved.”Conference CallDBV will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Monday  July 31st  at 5:00 p.m. ET to report first half 2023 financial results and provide a corporate update.Participants may access this event via the below teleconferencing numbers and asking to join the DBV Technologies call:United States: 1-844-481-2866International: +1-412-317-1859A live webcast of the call will be available on the Investors & Media section of the Company’s website: https://www.dbv-technologies.com/investor-relations/.

These non-GAAP measures are included in internal management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Board of Heineken N.V.  as management believes that this measurement is the most relevant in evaluating the results. Heineken Holding N.V.’s half year report has not been audited nor reviewed by its external auditor.2 Organic growth shown  except for Diluted EPS (beia)  which is total growth.3 Includes acquisitions and excludes disposals on a 12 month pro-forma basis.Heineken Holding N.V. engages in no activities other than its participating interest in Heineken N.V. and the management or supervision of and provision of services to that company.During the first half of 2023  HEINEKEN focused on executing its EverGreen strategy to deliver superior and balanced growth in a fast-changing world while transforming its business to be future-ready. HEINEKEN is making progress  albeit some short-term challenges given the volatile economic context  with the slowdown of the economy in some countries and unprecedented inflation levels.HEINEKEN's focus has been on its EverGreen priorities  starting with its dream to shape the future of beer and beyond to win the hearts of consumers. HEINEKEN is also shaping the future with its ambition to become the best digitally connected brewer  raising the bar on sustainability and responsibility and evolving its culture  operating model and capabilities. At the same time  HEINEKEN is stepping up on productivity to fund the investments required for its brands  digitalisation  capabilities and sustainability  and improve profitability and capital efficiency.HEINEKEN's ambition is to deliver sustained superior growth with a healthy balance between volume and value growth. HEINEKEN aims to achieve this through launching winning beverage propositions in fast-growing consumer segments  building and scaling strong premium brands everywhere and further developing its advantaged geographic and portfolio footprint. This year  HEINEKEN front-loaded significant price increases  often leading the market  to offset unprecedented levels of commodity and energy inflation  which impacted consumer off-take.Revenue for the first half of 2023 was 17 436 million (2022: 16 401 million). Net revenue (beia) increased 6.6% organically; a combination of a 5.4% decline in total consolidated volume and a 12.7% increase in net revenue (beia) per hectolitre. The underlying price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 11.8%  principally driven by the strong inflation-led pricing  whilst mix was slightly positive driven by premiumisation. Currency translation negatively impacted net revenue (beia) by €91 million or 0.7%  mainly driven by the Nigerian Naira  the Egyptian Pound  the South African Rand  the Indian Rupee and the UK Pound Sterling  partially offset by a strong Mexican Peso. Consolidation changes had a positive impact to net revenue (beia) of €231 million  mainly driven by Heineken Beverages in Southern Africa and Beavertown in the UK.Beer volume for the first half of 2023 decreased 5.6% organically versus last year. The cumulative effect of pricing actions taken and a challenging economic backdrop led to a 7.6% organic decline in the second quarter. A disappointing performance in Vietnam and socio-economic volatility in Nigeria affecting consumer off-take accounted for over half of the decline in the first six months. The Americas region was impacted by a soft beer market  notably in the second quarter  combined with the continuing impact from OXXO mixing in Mexico. Volume in Europe performed broadly in line with HEINEKEN's expectations for the first six months. HEINEKEN gained or held market share in more than half of its markets.Beer volume 2Q23 Organicgrowth HY23 Organicgrowth (in mhl) 2Q22 HY22 Heineken N.V. 65.3 70.4 -7.6% 120.1 126.9 -5.6%Premium beer volume declined by 6.5%  driven by Vietnam and Russia. Outside these markets  premiumisation trends remain strong as premium volume grew by a low-single-digit  ahead of the total beer portfolio in aggregate and in more than half of HEINEKEN's markets. The growth was driven by Heineken®  further supported by the growth of Desperados  Birra Moretti  Beavertown  Bedele Especial and El Águila among others.Heineken® continued to lead HEINEKEN's portfolio and grew volume by 1.2% (2.1% excluding Russia) in the second quarter to close the first half with a 1.7% increase (3.7% excluding Russia). Growth was broad-based across 50 markets  most notably in China  Brazil  Mexico  Ethiopia  Panama  Portugal  Croatia and Algeria. Heineken® Silver is now present in 45 markets and grew volume by more than forty-five percent  led by China  Vietnam and Mexico. We continue to build Heineken® Silver across European markets and the launch in the USA shows promising early results as we scale distribution and reach more and more consumers.Heineken® volume 2Q23 Organicgrowth HY23 Organicgrowth (in mhl) Total 14.2 1.2% 26.3 1.7%Outlook StatementsHEINEKEN's EverGreen strategy is a multi-year and multi-faceted journey to future-proof the company and deliver superior  balanced growth for long-term value creation. HEINEKEN has executed its plans in line with its EverGreen priorities and HEINEKEN is making clear progress in building a premium portfolio  driving consumer-centric innovation  digitisation  sustainability and in improving productivity.In the second half of 2023  HEINEKEN expects significantly improved operating profit (beia) growth inclusive of:Lower pressure from inflation in input costs  transport and energy & water  from mid-teens in the first-half to low-teens in the second-half on a per hectolitre basisPricing starting to moderate with volume trends gradually improving to a low-single-digit declineAn improved outlook in Vietnam and Nigeria  relative to the significant disruption in the first halfA similar absolute level of investment in marketing and sales when compared to the first halfProductivity savings delivering at least €300 million  cumulatively well-ahead of the €2 billion gross savings target.Overall  HEINEKEN's updated expectation for the full year of 2023 is stable to a mid-single-digit operating profit (beia) organic growth. HEINEKEN also anticipate an average interest rate for the year of around 3.2% (2022: 2.8%). Other assumptions on CAPEX and effective tax rate are unchanged.Looking ahead  the unprecedented commodity and energy cost inflation in recent years will be partially reversed next year  easing the pressure on pricing. Together with the structural changes HEINEKEN is making with EverGreen  HEINEKEN is confident this will set HEINEKEN up for a balanced growth delivery in 2024  while HEINEKEN remains cautious about the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. HEINEKEN's strong cost and productivity efforts will continue and enable further support behind its growth agenda  fund investments behind EverGreen and contribute to operating profit growth. Therefore  HEINEKEN's medium-term guidance of superior  balanced growth with operating leverage over time remains unchanged.Translational Calculated Currency ImpactBased on the impact to date  and applying spot rates of 27 July 2023 to the 2022 financial results as a baseline for the remainder of the year  the calculated negative currency translational impact would be approximately €780 million in net revenue (beia)  €110 million at consolidated operating profit (beia)  and €30 million at net profit (beia).Interim Dividend 2023According to the Articles of Association of Heineken Holding N.V. both Heineken Holding N.V. and Heineken N.V. pay an identical dividend per share. HEINEKEN's dividends are paid in the form of an interim dividend and a final dividend. In accordance with its dividend policy  HEINEKEN fixes the interim dividend at 40% of the total dividend of the previous year. As a result  an interim dividend of €0.69 per share (2022: €0.50) will be paid on 10 August 2023. Both the Heineken Holding N.V. shares and the Heineken N.V. shares will trade ex-dividend on 2 August 2023.EnquiriesMedia Heineken Holding N.V.

We prioritised and delivered the front-loaded pricing required to offset unprecedented input and energy cost inflation.

Net revenue (beia) grew by 6.6% organically while our financial performance in the first half of 2023 was below expectations.

At the same time  we increased our investment in marketing and sales by €0.2 billion globally to drive future growth. Our premium portfolio  led by the Heineken® brand  continued its growth momentum outside Russia and Vietnam. Our digital platforms captured €5.2 billion of gross merchandising value  an increase of 36% vs. last year. We are advancing well on the integration of Distell and Namibian Breweries.

Box 28 - 1000 AA Amsterdam - The Netherlands Office address - Tweede Weteringplantsoen 21 - 1017 ZD Amsterdam Page 1 of 37 Heineken N.V. - Registered Office at Amsterdam - Trade Register Amsterdam No. 33011433MEDIA RELEASE Operational Review During the first half of 2023  we focused on executing our EverGreen strategy to deliver superior and balanced growth in a fast-changing world while transforming our business to be future-ready. We are making progress  albeit some short- term challenges given the volatile economic context  with the slowdown of the economy in some countries and unprecedented inflation levels. Our focus has been on our EverGreen priorities  starting with our dream to shape the future of beer and beyond to win the hearts of consumers. We are also shaping the future with our ambition to become the best digitally connected brewer  raising the bar on sustainability and responsibility and evolving our culture  operating model and capabilities. At the same time  we are stepping up on productivity to fund the investments required for our brands  digitalisation  capabilities and sustainability  and improve profitability and capital efficiency. SHAPE THE FUTURE OF BEER AND BEYOND Superior and balanced growth Our ambition is to deliver sustained superior growth with a healthy balance between volume and value growth. We aim to achieve this through launching winning beverage propositions in fast-growing consumer segments  building and scaling strong premium brands everywhere and further developing our advantaged geographic and portfolio footprint. This year  we front-loaded significant price increases  often leading the market  to offset unprecedented levels of commodity and energy inflation  which impacted consumer off-take. Revenue for the first half of 2023 was 17 436 million (2022: 16 401 million). Net revenue (beia) increased 6.6% organically; a combination of a 5.4% decline in total consolidated volume and a 12.7% increase in net revenue (beia) per hectolitre. The underlying price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 11.8%  principally driven by the strong inflation-led pricing  whilst mix was slightly positive driven by premiumisation. Currency translation negatively impacted net revenue (beia) by €91 million or 0.7%  mainly driven by the Nigerian Naira  the Egyptian Pound  the South African Rand  the Indian Rupee and the UK Pound Sterling  partially offset by a strong Mexican Peso. Consolidation changes had a positive impact to net revenue (beia) of €231 million  mainly driven by Heineken Beverages in Southern Africa and Beavertown in the UK. Beer volume for the first half of 2023 decreased 5.6% organically versus last year. The cumulative effect of pricing actions taken and a challenging economic backdrop led to a 7.6% organic decline in the second quarter. A disappointing performance in Vietnam and socio-economic volatility in Nigeria affecting consumer off-take accounted for over half of the decline in the first six months. The Americas region was impacted by a soft beer market  notably in the second quarter  combined with the continuing impact from OXXO mixing in Mexico. Volume in Europe performed broadly in line with our expectations for the first six months. We gained or held market share in more than half of our markets.

Outside these markets  premiumisation trends remain strong as premium volume grew by a low-single-digit  ahead of the total beer portfolio in aggregate and in more than half of our markets. The growth was driven by Heineken®  further supported by the growth of Desperados  Birra Moretti  Beavertown  Bedele Especial and El Águila among others. Heineken® continued to lead our portfolio and grew volume by 1.2% (2.1% excluding Russia) in the second quarter to close the first half with a 1.7% increase (3.7% excluding Russia). Growth was broad-based across 50 markets  most notably in China  Brazil  Mexico  Ethiopia  Panama  Portugal  Croatia and Algeria. Heineken®Silver is now present in 45 markets and grew volume by more than forty-five percent  led by China  Vietnam and Mexico. We continue to build P.O.

The Heineken® brand turns 150 this year  and was recognised once again at the Cannes Lions  the prestigious Festival of Creativity. Heineken® was awarded 12 Bronze Lions  7 Silver Lions and 1 outstanding Gold Lion for The Closercampaign. It was voted the #1 most creative brand in the alcoholic drinks category and #3 most creative brand of the year across all categories. Our world-class sponsorships are a unique vehicle to connect and reach consumers  and we were delighted to renew our partnerships with Formula One and Oracle Red Bull Racing.

Our LONO portfolio volume was stable for the first half  with double-digit growth in 15 markets including Brazil  Mexico  Spain  Panama and Bulgaria  offset by declines in Nigeria  France  Poland and Germany. The non-alcoholicbeer and cider portfolio grew volume by a mid-single-digit.Heineken®0.0 continued to grow  up by a mid-single-digit excluding Russia  and double-digit growth in Brazil and the USA. It was launched in China  completing the Heineken® line-up. Mexico grew non-alcoholic beer and cider volume close to forty percent  including the launch of Tecate 0.0. We continue to explore consumer-inspired innovations to enhance our non-alcoholic portfolio. Zagg  our malt-based energy drink introduced last year in Nigeria  is building distribution and gaining share in this fast-growing category. Hoppy Refresher  Lagunitas' hop-infused sparkling water  is off to an encouraging start after its launch last year  adding a refreshing new drink to the beverages category in the USA. Explore beyond beer Following the acquisition of Distell in South Africa  HEINEKEN is now the #1 player outside the USA in beyond beer alcohol  the fastest-growing space in alcoholic beverages. Our overall volume of flavoured beer and beyond beer alcoholic propositions grew to 6.8 million hectolitres in the first half. Desperados  the leading ""spirit beer"" for high-energy consumption occasions  grew volume by a low-single-digit  with continued momentum in Nigeria partially offset by price-driven temporary declines in core European markets. Cider volume grew to 2.7 million hectolitres following the integration of Savannah and Hunters in South Africa. Volume declined on an organic basis  driven by the UK  Vietnam and Australia. We are investing to further unlock new growth opportunities beyond beer for flavoured  moderate propositions to meet different consumer occasions. We are introducing several innovative product concepts locally to test and learn  directly with our consumers. This includes expanding our core brands into new demand spaces as well as experimenting with new brand propositions. For example  we launched Tiger Soju  a soju-infused beer in Vietnam and Singapore  and aim to reach 5 markets across the Asia Pacific region by the end of this year. Develop and expand our advantaged footprint We continue to build our geographical and portfolio footprint to enhance our long-term  sustained growth advantage. On an ongoing basis  we review our footprint to ensure it matches our growth ambitions within clear capital allocation criteria  seeking to build on our growth priorities and address value-diluting operations. On 26 April  HEINEKEN completed the acquisition of Distell Group Holdings Limited ('Distell') and Namibia Breweries Limited ('NBL')  which have been combined with Heineken South Africa into 'Heineken Beverages'  a HEINEKEN majority-owned business  to capture the significant future growth opportunities in Southern Africa with a significantly strengthened and complementary route-to-consumer. P.O. Box 28 - 1000 AA Amsterdam - The Netherlands Office address - Tweede Weteringplantsoen 21 - 1017 ZD Amsterdam Page 3 of 37 Heineken N.V. - Registered Office at Amsterdam - Trade Register Amsterdam No. 33011433MEDIA RELEASE Recent developments in Russia demonstrate that it is even more challenging for businesses to secure exit approval. In April we announced that an application had been submitted for approval and we continue to work hard to secure a transaction. While we work to exit Russia  the business remains financially ringfenced. We do not accept any financial gain from the ongoing operations  will not profit from the sale of the business and have taken an impairment loss to date of €201 million (€88 million in December 2022 and €113 million in June 2023) bringing the net carrying value to nil as of 30 June 2023. We remain fully committed to leaving Russia  however the timing of our exit is not in our control. On 3 July  HEINEKEN announced its intention to sell Vrumona  its soft drink producer in the Netherlands  to sharpen the focus on shaping the future of beer and beyond in the country. The transaction is valued at €300 million (12x EBITDA)  would be accretive to operating profit margin (beia) and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023. Other changes to our business and portfolio footprint include the disposal of a brand license in the UK in June and a soft-drink  juice and water business in Tunisia at the end of last year. BECOME THE BEST-CONNECTED BREWER Digitise our route-to-consumer HEINEKEN aims to become the best-connected and most relevant brewer for our customers. We have been stepping up our investments behind our digital transformation to build a future-ready HEINEKEN  especially strengthening our digital route-to-consumer capability. We continue to expand our business-to-businessdigital (eB2B) platforms. By the end of the first half we captured €5.2 billion in gross merchandise value  an increase of 36% versus last year  representing €10.4 billion in gross merchandise value over the last twelve months. We now connect more than 550 thousand active customers in fragmented  traditional channels  an increase of 31% versus the same period last year. We progressed with the migration of our eB2B platforms under a single brand name and identity: eazle  business made easy. Nine of our eB2B operations in Europe were added  to enable better features at scale  improved customer experience and increased efficiency. Data driven insights & foresights We are increasingly leveraging the power of data across our business  systematically building use cases to prove the value of the solutions we create before replicating them across our organisation. We are using artificial intelligence (AI) in a wide range of processes ranging from revenue management to predictive maintenance among others. For example  AIDDA  our AI application to advise sales  is able to generate product recommendations  predict customer churn  identify price discrepancies  and suggest optimal sales-routes among other features. Originally developed in Mexico  we are currently beginning to deploy it in other markets. Through our Connected Brewery programme we are now connecting and harnessing the data of 3 500 pieces of brewery equipment in 68 breweries. Analysing this data we have been able to improve the mashing process and automatically adjust parameters to reduce extract losses and optimise the machine set speeds on packaging lines to reduce imbalance issues driving productivity through increased output capacity and lower cost to operate. FUND THE GROWTH  FUEL THE PROFIT Our growth algorithm seeks to deliver superior  balanced growth enabled by investments in innovation  in the power of our brands  behind our digital transformation  in new capabilities and in making our business more sustainable. To fund these investments and mitigate the inflationary pressures  we are structurally addressing our cost base  driving productivity across all parts of our business as we progress towards a cost-conscious culture. It is now the fourth year of our productivity programme  and we remain firmly on track to deliver ahead of our €2 billion target. In the first half of 2023  we delivered c.€200 million of gross savings  enabling the increased investment behind marketing and sales. For example  in Nigeria we have continued to right-size our cost base lowering the break-even volume threshold of Nigerian Breweries by 20%  a major step in helping the business mitigate the challenging economic conditions  and providing a significant opportunity in periods of growth. Europe expects to deliver more than €200 million gross savings this year from its large-scale supply chain transformation programme. The benefits come from boosting operational excellence in all areas  taking non-value- added complexity out and transforming our production and logistics footprint in Europe  resulting in the announced closure of seven breweries to date. The savings of this year are skewed to the second half given the phasing of activity. P.O.

Overall  we expect a strong turnaround in operating profit (beia) growth in the second half and for the full year expect stable to a mid-single-digit operating profit (beia) organic growth.""Financial Summary1IFRS Measures € million Total growth BEIA Measures € million Organic growth2 Revenue 17 436 6.3% Revenue (beia) 17 423 5.5% Net revenue 14 524 7.7% Net revenue (beia) 14 514 6.6% Operating profit 1 611 -22.2% Operating profit (beia) 1 939 -8.8% Operating profit (beia) margin 13.4% Net profit 1 156 -8.6% Net profit (beia) 1 150 -11.6% Diluted EPS (in €) 2.04 -7.3% Diluted EPS (beia) (in €) 2.03 -12.0% Free operating cash flow -467 Net debt / EBITDA (beia)3 2.7x1 Consolidated figures are used throughout this report  unless otherwise stated.

We are making progress  albeit some short-term challenges given the volatile economic context  with the slowdown of the economy in some countries and unprecedented inflation levels.Our focus has been on our EverGreen priorities  starting with our dream to shape the future of beer and beyond to win the hearts of consumers. We are also shaping the future with our ambition to become the best digitally connected brewer  raising the bar on sustainability and responsibility and evolving our culture  operating model and capabilities. At the same time  we are stepping up on productivity to fund the investments required for our brands  digitalisation  capabilities and sustainability  and improve profitability and capital efficiency.SHAPE THE FUTURE OF BEER AND BEYONDSuperior and balanced growthOur ambition is to deliver sustained superior growth with a healthy balance between volume and value growth. We aim to achieve this through launching winning beverage propositions in fast-growing consumer segments  building and scaling strong premium brands everywhere and further developing our advantaged geographic and portfolio footprint. This year  we front-loaded significant price increases  often leading the market  to offset unprecedented levels of commodity and energy inflation  which impacted consumer off-take.Revenue for the first half of 2023 was 17 436 million (2022: 16 401 million). Net revenue (beia) increased 6.6% organically; a combination of a 5.4% decline in total consolidated volume and a 12.7% increase in net revenue (beia) per hectolitre. The underlying price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 11.8%  principally driven by the strong inflation-led pricing  whilst mix was slightly positive driven by premiumisation. Currency translation negatively impacted net revenue (beia) by €91 million or 0.7%  mainly driven by the Nigerian Naira  the Egyptian Pound  the South African Rand  the Indian Rupee and the UK Pound Sterling  partially offset by a strong Mexican Peso. Consolidation changes had a positive impact to net revenue (beia) of €231 million  mainly driven by Heineken Beverages in Southern Africa and Beavertown in the UK.Beer volume for the first half of 2023 decreased 5.6% organically versus last year. The cumulative effect of pricing actions taken and a challenging economic backdrop led to a 7.6% organic decline in the second quarter. A disappointing performance in Vietnam and socio-economic volatility in Nigeria affecting consumer off-take accounted for over half of the decline in the first six months. The Americas region was impacted by a soft beer market  notably in the second quarter  combined with the continuing impact from OXXO mixing in Mexico. Volume in Europe performed broadly in line with our expectations for the first six months. We gained or held market share in more than half of our markets.Beer volume 2Q23 Organicgrowth HY23 Organicgrowth (in mhl) 2Q22 HY22 Heineken N.V. 65.3 70.4 -7.6% 120.1 126.9 -5.6% Africa Middle East & Eastern Europe 9.6 9.8 -4.7% 18.6 19.6 -6.5% Americas 21.8 23.1 -5.7% 42.2 42.8 -1.5% Asia Pacific 11.0 13.1 -15.5% 21.3 24.6 -13.2% Europe 22.8 24.4 -6.4% 38.0 39.9 -4.8%Driving premiumisation at scale  led by Heineken®Premium beer volume declined by 6.5%  driven by Vietnam and Russia. Outside these markets  premiumisation trends remain strong as premium volume grew by a low-single-digit  ahead of the total beer portfolio in aggregate and in more than half of our markets. The growth was driven by Heineken®  further supported by the growth of Desperados  Birra Moretti  Beavertown  Bedele Especial and El Águila among others.Heineken® continued to lead our portfolio and grew volume by 1.2% (2.1% excluding Russia) in the second quarter to close the first half with a 1.7% increase (3.7% excluding Russia). Growth was broad-based across 50 markets  most notably in China  Brazil  Mexico  Ethiopia  Panama  Portugal  Croatia and Algeria. Heineken® Silver is now present in 45 markets and grew volume by more than forty-five percent  led by China  Vietnam and Mexico. We continue to build Heineken® Silver across European markets and the launch in the USA shows promising early results as we scale distribution and reach more and more consumers.The Heineken® brand turns 150 this year  and was recognised once again at the Cannes Lions  the prestigious Festival of Creativity. Heineken® was awarded 12 Bronze Lions  7 Silver Lions and 1 outstanding Gold Lion for The Closer campaign. It was voted the #1 most creative brand in the alcoholic drinks category and #3 most creative brand of the year across all categories. Our world-class sponsorships are a unique vehicle to connect and reach consumers  and we were delighted to renew our partnerships with Formula One and Oracle Red Bull Racing.Heineken® volume 2Q23 Organicgrowth HY23 Organicgrowth (in mhl) Total 14.2 1.2% 26.3 1.7% Africa Middle East & Eastern Europe 1.4 -4.9% 2.7 -15.3% Americas 5.6 2.8% 11.0 6.4% Asia Pacific 2.6 23.8% 4.9 20.1% Europe 4.7 -8.0% 7.8 -6.6%Pioneer choice in low & no-alcoholOur Low & No-Alcohol (LONO) portfolio empowers consumers seeking to enjoy a lower or no-alcohol content beverage by ensuring there is always a choice - everywhere and at any occasion. Our LONO portfolio volume was stable for the first half  with double-digit growth in 15 markets including Brazil  Mexico  Spain  Panama and Bulgaria  offset by declines in Nigeria  France  Poland and Germany.The non-alcoholic beer and cider portfolio grew volume by a mid-single-digit. Heineken® 0.0 continued to grow  up by a mid-single-digit excluding Russia  and double-digit growth in Brazil and the USA. It was launched in China  completing the Heineken® line-up. Mexico grew non-alcoholic beer and cider volume close to forty percent  including the launch of Tecate 0.0.We continue to explore consumer-inspired innovations to enhance our non-alcoholic portfolio. Zagg  our malt-based energy drink introduced last year in Nigeria  is building distribution and gaining share in this fast-growing category. Hoppy Refresher  Lagunitas' hop-infused sparkling water  is off to an encouraging start after its launch last year  adding a refreshing new drink to the beverages category in the USA.Explore beyond beerFollowing the acquisition of Distell in South Africa  HEINEKEN is now the #1 player outside the USA in beyond beer alcohol  the fastest-growing space in alcoholic beverages. Our overall volume of flavoured beer and beyond beer alcoholic propositions grew to 6.8 million hectolitres in the first half.Desperados  the leading “spirit beer” for high-energy consumption occasions  grew volume by a low-single-digit  with continued momentum in Nigeria partially offset by price-driven temporary declines in core European markets.Cider volume grew to 2.7 million hectolitres following the integration of Savannah and Hunters in South Africa. Volume declined on an organic basis  driven by the UK  Vietnam and Australia.We are investing to further unlock new growth opportunities beyond beer for flavoured  moderate propositions to meet different consumer occasions. We are introducing several innovative product concepts locally to test and learn  directly with our consumers. This includes expanding our core brands into new demand spaces as well as experimenting with new brand propositions. For example  we launched Tiger Soju  a soju-infused beer in Vietnam and Singapore  and aim to reach 5 markets across the Asia Pacific region by the end of this year.Develop and expand our advantaged footprintWe continue to build our geographical and portfolio footprint to enhance our long-term  sustained growth advantage. On an ongoing basis  we review our footprint to ensure it matches our growth ambitions within clear capital allocation criteria  seeking to build on our growth priorities and address value-diluting operations.On 26 April  HEINEKEN completed the acquisition of Distell Group Holdings Limited (‘Distell’) and Namibia Breweries Limited (‘NBL’)  which have been combined with Heineken South Africa into ‘Heineken Beverages’  a HEINEKEN majority-owned business  to capture the significant future growth opportunities in Southern Africa with a significantly strengthened and complementary route-to-consumer.Recent developments in Russia demonstrate that it is even more challenging for businesses to secure exit approval. In April we announced that an application had been submitted for approval and we continue to work hard to secure a transaction. While we work to exit Russia  the business remains financially ringfenced. We do not accept any financial gain from the ongoing operations  will not profit from the sale of the business and have taken an impairment loss to date of €201 million (€88 million in December 2022 and €113 million in June 2023) bringing the net carrying value to nil as of 30 June 2023. We remain fully committed to leaving Russia  however the timing of our exit is not in our control.On 3 July  HEINEKEN announced its intention to sell Vrumona  its soft drink producer in the Netherlands  to sharpen the focus on shaping the future of beer and beyond in the country. The transaction is valued at €300 million (12x EBITDA)  would be accretive to operating profit margin (beia) and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023.Other changes to our business and portfolio footprint include the disposal of a brand license in the UK in June and a soft-drink  juice and water business in Tunisia at the end of last year.BECOME THE BEST-CONNECTED BREWERDigitise our route-to-consumerHEINEKEN aims to become the best-connected and most relevant brewer for our customers. We have been stepping up our investments behind our digital transformation to build a future-ready HEINEKEN  especially strengthening our digital route-to-consumer capability.We continue to expand our business-to-business digital (eB2B) platforms. By the end of the first half we captured €5.2 billion in gross merchandise value  an increase of 36% versus last year  representing €10.4 billion in gross merchandise value over the last twelve months. We now connect more than 550 thousand active customers in fragmented  traditional channels  an increase of 31% versus the same period last year. We progressed with the migration of our eB2B platforms under a single brand name and identity: eazle  business made easy. Nine of our eB2B operations in Europe were added  to enable better features at scale  improved customer experience and increased efficiency.Data driven insights & foresightsWe are increasingly leveraging the power of data across our business  systematically building use cases to prove the value of the solutions we create before replicating them across our organisation. We are using artificial intelligence (AI) in a wide range of processes ranging from revenue management to predictive maintenance among others.For example  AIDDA  our AI application to advise sales  is able to generate product recommendations  predict customer churn  identify price discrepancies  and suggest optimal sales-routes among other features. Originally developed in Mexico  we are currently beginning to deploy it in other markets.Through our Connected Brewery programme we are now connecting and harnessing the data of 3 500 pieces of brewery equipment in 68 breweries. Analysing this data we have been able to improve the mashing process and automatically adjust parameters to reduce extract losses and optimise the machine set speeds on packaging lines to reduce imbalance issues driving productivity through increased output capacity and lower cost to operate.FUND THE GROWTH  FUEL THE PROFITOur growth algorithm seeks to deliver superior  balanced growth enabled by investments in innovation  in the power of our brands  behind our digital transformation  in new capabilities and in making our business more sustainable. To fund these investments and mitigate the inflationary pressures  we are structurally addressing our cost base  driving productivity across all parts of our business as we progress towards a cost-conscious culture.It is now the fourth year of our productivity programme  and we remain firmly on track to deliver ahead of our €2 billion target. In the first half of 2023  we delivered c.€200 million of gross savings  enabling the increased investment behind marketing and sales. For example  in Nigeria we have continued to right-size our cost base lowering the break-even volume threshold of Nigerian Breweries by 20%  a major step in helping the business mitigate the challenging economic conditions  and providing a significant opportunity in periods of growth.Europe expects to deliver more than €200 million gross savings this year from its large-scale supply chain transformation programme. The benefits come from boosting operational excellence in all areas  taking non-value-added complexity out and transforming our production and logistics footprint in Europe  resulting in the announced closure of seven breweries to date. The savings of this year are skewed to the second half given the phasing of activity.We continue to embed cost management in every aspect of our organisation  and are further maturing the cost and capital governance in our operations. Combined with a strong commitment and operating rhythm in our operating companies to systematically identify cost and capital initiatives  we are confident to deliver on our €400 million gross savings commitment for the next years to come.Operating profit (beia) decreased 8.8% organically  driven by the decline in our most profitable Asia Pacific region. The revenue growth and improvements in productivity were more than offset by the significant inflationary pressures in our input and energy costs and the front-loaded incremental investments to grow the power of our brands  digitalisation  capability and sustainability agendas. Despite lower volume  we continued with stepped-up investment in marketing and sales  broadly equivalent to the operating profit (beia) decline. Currency translation and consolidation impacts negatively impacted operating profit by €12 million and €14 million respectively  with offsetting effects between the regions. Operating profit margin (beia) came down to 13.4% driven by the organic performance and the dilutive effect from the consolidation impacts. Operating profit decreased further by 22.2%  mainly due to the impact from impairments recorded as exceptional items  including €113 million of further impairment charges related to Russia.Net profit (beia) decreased by 11.6% organically. The gains from lower minority interests  income taxes and higher profits from associates were partially offset by higher interest and other net financing expenses. Net profit decreased to €1 156 million driven by higher exceptional items  including the impairments referenced above and €70 million impact related to the one-off impact of the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira.For more details on the exceptional items on operating profit and net profit  please refer to page 13.RAISE THE BAR ON SUSTAINABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITYWe are building operational momentum across our Brew a Better World 2030 strategy focused on three areas: raising the bar on environmental sustainability  accelerating social sustainability and championing responsible consumption.Environmental: Path to zero impactTo reach net zero carbon in production (scope 1 and 2) by 2030  together with Signify  Nobian and Philips  we celebrated the opening of an onshore wind farm in Finland in June. The virtual power purchase agreement will generate renewable electricity to power 27 of our European production sites for the next ten years. We are also making strategic investments in low-carbon technologies. For example  in the first half of this year  we launched Project Circle  which uses technology that extracts high-quality proteins from spent grain and uses the remaining fibres as biofuel in our breweries. We also co-invested in FertigHy  a pioneering low-carbon fertiliser company  which in time will benefit farmers who provide grains we use in our brewing process.Regarding healthy watersheds  water efficiency was most improved in four countries: Brazil  Italy  Spain and Ethiopia with measures that included optimising cleaning processes and equipment upgrades. For water balancing  27 of our 32 sites in water-stressed areas are progressing on multi-year projects  including large-scale reforestation efforts in Vietnam and Nigeria.Social: Path to an inclusive  fair and equitable worldCurrently  28% of our senior managers are women and we aim to increase this figure to at least 30% by 2025 and 40% by 2030 on the path to gender balance. In the Netherlands  HEINEKEN received a LinkedIn Talent Diversity Champion Award for initiating and inspiring meaningful conversations around diversity  inclusion  belonging and equity.On our path to a fair and safe workplace  100% of our direct employees now earn a fair wage according to the Fair Wage Network  reaching our 2023 goal. We continue to make progress in providing fair living and working standards for third-party employees.Responsible: Path to moderate and no harmful useOur goal is for 100% of our markets to have a partnership in place to reduce the harmful use of alcohol every year. For example  in Italy  in partnership with the Italian Sommelier Association (ASPI)  we support a programme that incorporates responsible consumption training into the curriculum of 50 national hotel schools  which trained more than 2 000 students in 2023.In February  we proudly announced F1 driver Max Verstappen as our new Heineken® 0.0 ambassador. Max plays a leading role in our ‘When You Drive  Never Drink’ campaign as well as a new initiative called ‘Player 0.0’  a virtual racing experience that incorporates responsible consumption themes in the gaming space.GovernanceWe are mobilising in preparation for the European Union’s new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  which require a broad suite of new metrics to be tracked and reported as of 2024 for publication in 2025.Outlook StatementsOur EverGreen strategy is a multi-year and multi-faceted journey to future-proof the company and deliver superior  balanced growth for long-term value creation. We have executed our plans in line with our EverGreen priorities and we are making clear progress in building a premium portfolio  driving consumer-centric innovation  digitisation  sustainability and in improving productivity.In the second half of 2023  we expect significantly improved operating profit (beia) growth inclusive of:Lower pressure from inflation in input costs  transport and energy & water  from mid-teens in the first-half to low-teens in the second-half on a per hectolitre basisPricing starting to moderate with volume trends gradually improving to a low-single-digit declineAn improved outlook in Vietnam and Nigeria  relative to the significant disruption in the first halfA similar absolute level of investment in marketing and sales when compared to the first halfProductivity savings delivering at least €300 million  cumulatively well-ahead of the €2 billion gross savings target.Overall  our updated expectation for the full year of 2023 is stable to a mid-single-digit operating profit (beia) organic growth. We also anticipate an average interest rate for the year of around 3.2% (2022: 2.8%). Other assumptions on CAPEX and effective tax rate are unchanged.Looking ahead  the unprecedented commodity and energy cost inflation in recent years will be partially reversed next year  easing the pressure on pricing. Together with the structural changes we are making with EverGreen  we are confident this will set us up for a balanced growth delivery in 2024  while we remain cautious about the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Our strong cost and productivity efforts will continue and enable further support behind our growth agenda  fund investments behind EverGreen and contribute to operating profit growth. Therefore  our medium-term guidance of superior  balanced growth with operating leverage over time remains unchanged.Translational Calculated Currency ImpactBased on the impact to date  and applying spot rates of 27 July 2023 to the 2022 financial results as a baseline for the remainder of the year  the calculated negative currency translational impact would be approximately €780 million in net revenue (beia)  €110 million at consolidated operating profit (beia)  and €30 million at net profit (beia).Interim Dividend 2023HEINEKEN's dividends are paid in the form of an interim dividend and a final dividend. The interim dividend is fixed at 40% of the total dividend of the previous year. As a result  an interim dividend of €0.69 per share (2022: €0.50) will be paid on 10 August 2023. The shares will trade ex-dividend on 2 August 2023.EnquiriesMedia Investors Sarah Backhouse / Joris Evers José Federico Castillo Martinez Director of Global Communication Investor Relations Director Michael Fuchs Mark Matthews / Chris Steyn Global Corporate and Financial Communications Manager Investor Relations Manager / Senior Analyst E-mail: pressoffice@heineken.com E-mail: investors@heineken.com Tel: +31-20-5239355 Tel: +31-20-5239590Investor Calendar Heineken N.V.Trading Update for Q3 2023 25 October 2023 Full Year 2023 Results 14 February 2024Conference Call DetailsHEINEKEN will host an analyst and investor conference call in relation to its 2023 Half Year results today at 14:00 CET/ 13:00 GMT.
