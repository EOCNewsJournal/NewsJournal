The company sees demand in the construction industry remaining at a weaker level than in 2022 for longer than previously anticipated  especially in Europe and Asia.GUIDANCE FOR 2023On 27 June 2023  Robit Plc lowered its earnings guidance for 2023. Robit Plc expects its net sales for 2023 to be EUR 90–100 million and its comparable EBITDA profitability in euros to be EUR 3–6 million.According to the company’s previous guidance  Robit expected net sales in 2023 to increase and comparable EBITDA profitability in euros to remain unchanged or improve slightly from 2022 when assuming that there are no significant changes in the exchange rates from the level at the end of 2022.CEO ARTO HALONEN:Market demand in the second quarter was below the comparison period. Weakening market in the construction industry  especially in Europe and Asia impacted the financial performance in the quarter. Market demand in the mining industry remained at a good level  but the company was unable to compensate for the lost sales in Russia from other market areas. Orders received totaled EUR 22.8 million  down by 14.2 percent from the comparison period.Robit’s net sales for the quarter were EUR 24.4 million (31.0)  down 21.4 percent on the very strong corresponding period. In constant currencies  there was a decrease of 17.6 percent. The company’s net sales declined in all market areas. In the EMEA region  the decrease was 2.0 percent. Sales in the region were supported by an active mining segment and new customers and distributors. Demand in the construction industry in Europe was lower than in the comparison period. In the Asia region  the decrease was 30.8 percent. The construction industry’s relative share of net sales is higher in Asia than in the company’s other markets. Due to the closure of the Russian business  sales in the East region decreased by EUR 4.0 million compared to the comparison period and thus significantly contributed to the decrease in net sales. The company has several customer tests under way in the East region and sales in the region are expected to grow from H1 levels in the second half of the year. Measures to strengthen the company’s distributor network continued and during the quarter we announced  among other things  the signing of a distribution agreement with Sotreq  a strong player in the mining and civil engineering sector in Brazil.Net sales in the Top Hammer business decreased by 16.8 percent in the second quarter. In the Asia region  Top Hammer sales were clearly down. In South Africa a major rebuilding of the organization was done slowing down sales during the quarter but improving company’s capabilities to grow in the region in the future. Sales developed positively in Australia and EMEA. In the Geotechnical business  sales in the Americas increased  but sales in Europe  Geotechnical’s other main market  declined due to weaker demand in the construction industry. Net sales in the Down the Hole business decreased by 33.1 percent. The decline was particularly due to lower deliveries to certain customers in the Americas and Australasia.In the second quarter  comparable EBITDA was EUR 1.5 million (4.1)  clearly below the very strong corresponding period. However  the company was able to improve profitability from the first quarter of the year as a result of the implemented savings actions. Profitability was particularly affected by the low utilisation rate of Down the Hole manufacturing and the increase in the realised purchase prices of raw materials  which were partially compensated with an increase in the sales prices. The company continues cost reductions in procurement as well as market-specific price adjustments. Exchange differences caused by changes in foreign exchange rates also weakened the company’s EBITDA by EUR 0.6 million compared to the comparison period.As part of the company’s cost-savings programme  the decision was made to close production at the Perth plant. The plant’s production will be transferred to the company’s other plants. The Australian unit will focus on sales  maintenance and distribution in the local market. The estimated annual cost savings of the plan are around EUR 2 million and the costs related to the restructuring are expected to be around EUR 0.6 million. Overall  the company is targeting savings of around EUR 5 million from the 2022 level through the cost-savings programme  EUR 2-3 million of which is expected to be realised during this year. In order to strengthen cash flow  the company will continue the implementation of the Fit for Service programme  which focuses on the development of working capital management. As a result of the measures taken  the company’s cash flow from operations strengthened to EUR 3.4 million (1.4) in the second quarter.RESPONSIBILITYLost Time Incident Frequency (LTIF) developed positively in the review period  and the measures taken to improve safety bore fruit. A new tool for reporting safety findings  introduced last year  has increased the number of observations  which also improves safety awareness. In terms of emission intensity  the trend was negative  although the number of tonnes of CO2 has decreased.Emission intensity Waste Consultative sales hours per year LTIF Sustainable suppliers Sustainable distributors 06/2023 -10.6% 89% 754h 4.4 92% 77% 12/2022 -26.0% 90% 714h 6.4 92% 80% Target -50.0% >90% >1 000h 0.0 >90% >90%NET SALESNet sales by product areaIn 2023  company is reporting its net sales for three business units: Top Hammer  Down the Hole and Geotechnical.

The company obtained the consent of its main financier to the breach of the covenant on 22 March 2023. This leads to a higher financial cost and risk for the company. The company has hedged against interest rate risk with an interest rate swap agreement that entered into force on June 30  2023  and ends on June 30  2026.The geopolitical situation  which is growing tenser  poses a risk to the company’s business. The war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia affect the development of net sales and profitability especially in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine  which accounted for approximately 8 percent of the company’s sales in the 2022 financial year. The company is no longer operating in Russia in 2023.Other uncertainty factors include the exchange rate development  functioning of information systems  integration of corporate acquisitions  risks related to the security of supply and logistics as well as IPR risks. Fully transferring the increase in raw material costs to customer prices may pose a financial risk. Changes in export countries’ tax and customs legislation may adversely impact the company’s export trade or its profitability. Risks related to information security and cyber threats may also have a detrimental effect on Robit’s business. Potential changes in the business environment may adversely impact the payment behaviour of the Group’s customers and increase the risk of litigation  legal claims and disputes related to Robit’s products and other operations.CHANGES IN GROUP STRUCTUREThere were no changes in the Group structure during the review period.OTHER EVENTS IN JANUARY–JUNE 2023On 11 January 2023  Robit Plc announced that its VP  Global Sales and Management Team member George Apostolopoulos would be leaving his duties for new challenges outside the company by the summer of 2023.

The purpose of the share scheme is to align the owners’ and the key persons’ goals in order to increase the value of the company in the long term  to commit the key persons to the company and to encourage them to achieve the company’s key strategic goals as well as to provide them with a competitive long-term incentive scheme.The share scheme includes earning periods of one and two years. The first earning period of the share scheme comprises the year 2023. The reward for the earning period 2023 is divided into a guaranteed part and a performance-based part. The guaranteed part is 50% of the base share allocation defined for the participant. The performance-based part of the share allocation is determined by a bonus coefficient based on the company’s predetermined net cash flow from operating activities in the financial statements for 2023. The second earning period covers the years 2024–2025. The potential reward that may be paid under the share scheme for the two-year earning period is based on the company’s predetermined average earnings per share in the financial statements for 2024 and 2025. The share scheme’s potential reward for both earning periods will be paid in May 2026.The share scheme covers the CEO and approximately 20 key persons  members of the Management Team and high-potential employees. A participant in the share plan must have a valid employment or service contract in the company. The Management Team members included in the share scheme are subject to the ownership obligation  meaning that the Management Team member must own 50% of the net shares paid to them on the basis of the entire plan until their shareholding in the company corresponds to 50% of their annual salary.The Board of Directors decides on the earning potential of each key person in the target group. The total amount of share rewards payable on the basis of the earning periods 2023 and 2024–2025 corresponds to a maximum of 240 000 Robit Plc shares  which represents 1.1% of the company’s current share capital. The share reward  if earned  is a gross reward from which tax is withheld  and the net reward is paid to key personnel in shares. The purpose of the cash contribution is to cover the taxes and parafiscal charges arising from the reward. The company decides on the relative proportion of shares and money  for example on a country-by-country  individual or personnel group basis. The share scheme is dimensioned in such a way that the relative proportion of the share transfer taking place under all share schemes in force at the company will remain below 4% of the company’s shares.On 22 February 2023  Robit Plc announced that the company’s Annual Report  Corporate Governance Statement and Remuneration Report for 2022 had been published on the company’s website.On 4 March 2023  the company published a correction concerning Robit Plc’s invitation to the Annual General Meeting 2023.

Robit considers that the alternative figures give significant extra insight into the result of Robit’s operations  its financial position and cash flows.

BUSINESS ACQUISITIONSThere were no changes in the Group structure during the review period.8. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTINGThe amount of goodwill is reviewed at least annually in accordance with the IFRS provisions. The values of the goodwill testing variables are also revised if there have been material changes in business  competition  the market or other assumptions of goodwill testing. The company has three cash flow-generating units (Top Hammer  Down the Hole and Geotechnical). In the 30 June 2023 situation  the company has reviewed the assumptions used in goodwill testing  such as forecasts for the current and future years and changes in interest rates. Based on the review  no internal or external indication of goodwill impairment has been identified and thus additional impairment testing has not been considered necessary. The factors affecting goodwill items will be reviewed during the fourth quarter.9. DERIVATIVESThe company hedges the most significant net currency positions that can be predicted in time and volume and interest rate risk.There were no open currency derivatives at the end of the review period.On 8 June 2021  the company concluded a financing agreement of EUR 30 million and  in connection with this  an interest rate swap of EUR 10 million with an interest rate cap in order to hedge part of its exposure to fluctuating interest rates. The interest rate swap will take effect on 30 June 2023 and it will end on 30 June 2026. The company applies hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9. This effectively leads to the recording of interest expenses on a hedged floating rate loan at a fixed rate.The company’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term loans with floating interest rates that expose the Group’s cash flow to interest rate risk. The Group’s policy is to use  if necessary  a floating to fixed interest rate swap.Derivatives EUR thousand 30.6.2023 30.6.2022 31.12.2022 Interest rate swaps Nominal value 10 000 10 000 10 000 Fair value 935 515 848Attachment,neutral,0.1,0.89,0.01,mixed,0.16,0.26,0.58,True,English,"['ROBIT PLC HALF-YEAR REPORT', 'JANUARY', 'JUNE', 'SALES', 'PROFITABILITY', 'BEGINNING', 'THE', 'IMPROVEMENT', 'ROBIT PLC STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE', 'ROBIT PLC HALF-YEAR REPORT', 'global mining industry demand', 'active mining segment', 'several customer tests', 'Net cash flow', 'corresponding time period', 'strong corresponding period', 'other market areas', 'comparable EBITDA profitability', 'exchange rates', 'Market demand', 'construction industry', 'other markets', 'other things', 'MARKET OUTLOOK', 'Weakening market', 'net income', 'review period', 'operating activities', 'Key financials', 'significant changes', 'ARTO HALONEN', 'comparison period', 'financial performance', 'constant currencies', 'new customers', 'Russian business', 'second half', 'distributor network', 'distribution agreement', 'Net sales', 'current level', 'weaker level', 'good level', 'previous guidance', 'EMEA region', 'East region', 'Equity ratio', 'relative share', 'H1 levels', 'second quarter', 'earnings guidance', 'Asia region', '1 April–30 June', '1 January–30 June', '27 June', 'AUGUST', '11.10 A', 'BEGINNING', 'FURTHER', 'IMPROVEMENT', 'text', 'Figures', 'parentheses', 'euros', 'Percentages', 'thousands', 'brief', '5.5 percent', '6.0 percent', 'EBITA', '1.0 percent', '1.5 percent', '0.2 percent', '3.0 percent', '3.3 percent', '2.0 percent', '2.9 percent', 'end', '45.0 percent', 'EPS', 'Return', 'ROE', 'capital', 'ROCE', 'company', 'Europe', 'CEO', 'Orders', '14.2 percent', 'decrease', '17.6 percent', 'distributors', '30.8 percent', 'way', 'Measures', 'signing', '2022']",2023-08-01,2023-08-02,marketscreener.com

August 1st  2023. QEV Technologies  a fast- growing company that specialises in electric light commercial vehicles for corporate fleets and electric buses for public transport companies  and SPEAR Investments I  a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) launched by AZ Capital and STJ Advisors focused on becoming a valuable partner to afast-growingEuropean business  have successfully signed an agreement to combine their businesses which is expected to result in the listing of QEV N.V. on Euronext Amsterdam. QEV Technologies will maintain its fiscal residence  headquarters and operations in Barcelona (Spain)  following its recent successful tender with its JV partner for a former Nissan facility in the ""D-Hub"" (Decarbonization Hub) in Barcelona  Spain  a cutting-edge project in electric mobility strategically located in Barcelona's free trade zone that seeks to position Spain and Europe as a benchmark in sustainable automation  with an expected production capacity of 180 000 vehicles per year. The implied enterprise valuation for the transaction is EUR 209 million and the transaction already has EUR 23 million of capital to support the company's business plan  which foresees a four-fold increase in revenues by 2023 and aims to sell over 16 000 electric vehicles per year by 2027. QEV Technologies' pipeline of business includes both purchase orders and advanced negotiations to become a supplier of last mile electric vehicles with its ZEROID brand for large national and international companies  as well as for the supply of electric buses. Joan Orús  CEO at QEV Technologies explains: ""The market for electric light commercial vehicles and buses is accelerating at a rapid pace  as companies seek to electrify their fleets and to deliver their products and services in a sustainable way. QEV Tech has developed its expertise in electricmobility over a 10-year period and is now reaching an inflexion point as the electrification of global supply chains and transport networks has created a supply-constrained environment that we are seeking to serve with our experience in electric mobility and our highly competitive production capabilities."". Jorge Lucaya  co-CEO of SPEAR Investments  commented: ""QEV Technologies is the ideal business combination candidate. It combines technology expertise in electric mobility  with cost- competitive production capabilities and concrete orders. At SPEAR we see the market opportunity that QEV is serving as very attractive - the high utilisation of fleet vehicles makes the transition to light commercial vehicles compelling for fleets from a commercial perspective  and is lessbrand-driventhan consumer decisions in terms of electric vehicles. In addition  the large purchase orders of fleets allow customisations of those vehicles according to customer needs which also supports this transition."". John St. John  co-CEO of SPEAR Investments  commented: ""SPEAR has delivered on its objective of offering a route to capital markets for afast-growingprivate company that has proven much  but still has significant growth potential ahead of it  and combining it with capital and expertise to support that growth. We see QEV as having an exciting long term future ahead of it and are looking forward to supporting it in achieving its goals over the long term."". The capital provided by this transaction will allow QEV Technologies to continue to increase investment and accelerate the deployment of funds corresponding to  among other initiatives  the Strategic Project for the Recovery and Economic Transformation of the Electric and Connected Vehicle (PERTE_VEC) authorized by the European Commission and the Spanish Government. The cash inflow is comprised of a combination of non-redemption agreements with SPEAR's existing shareholders  the entry of new private investors through a PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) transaction  new investment from the company's existing investor  Inveready  and a backstop commitment from SPEAR's promote investors. The committed capital is expected to be further increased before closing of the proposed business combination. Under the terms of the proposed agreement  100% of QEV Technologies' existing shareholders are expected to remain invested in the company through the exchange of their shares for shares in the combined entity. Amongst these  Inveready and GAEA Inversion  the private equity vertical of the fund management firm  currently the largest investors in the company  will significantly increase their investment in QEV Technologies  which was initially made in 2021. The transaction is subject to the approval of the business combination by SPEAR's shareholders at an EGM  which will take place on September 27th  2023  after which QEV Technologies is expected to become a Euronext listed company.

BNP Paribas and J.P. Morgan have provided a standby underwriting for the full rights issue amount (less the amount of EPEI’s subscription commitment)  subject to usual conditions. Atos is very confident on the granting by its bank syndicate of the necessary loan waivers.

Shareholders’ equity was €7.8M  compared to €4.4M in previous year. Net debt stood at €(6.2)M compared to net debt position of €4.6M in previous year  and includes €1.7M of cash and €7.9M of financial debt.The Company conducted a review of its liquidity risk based on projections on all of its four activities: Gaming  Hardware  Licensing and Web3  excluding any external financing. Under this assumption  the Group considers that it can meet its future obligations and that it holds sufficient liquidity to continue its activities over the next 12 months. This consideration excludes potential future inorganic growth opportunities.The Group benefits from the flexibility provided by the proceeds raised with the convertible bonds issuance completed in June 2023 for an amount of (€30 M which comprised €16.3 M subscription by debt set-off and €12.9M in cash).Token UpdateAs previously disclosed  Atari terminated the license with the former joint venture that created and distributed the ATRI Token. Atari also disclosed plans to provide a claim for a new token for certain ATRI holders. As stated in subsequent disclosures on Atari.com  given the changing regulatory and commercial landscapes  as well as Atari’s strategic priorities  Atari is unable to create a new token. Instead  Atari has confirmed that ATRI holders are free to continue to trade their ATRI tokens and Atari will provide a claim to each eligible ATRI wallet holder identified in the snapshot on April 18  2022 for a share of a pool of a third-party token currently held by Atari. Atari will focus its resources on growing its activities across Games  Licensing and Hardware lines of business  and in Web3  with the development of the Atari Club and continued collaborations and partnerships.ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGThe Shareholders’ Annual Meeting is scheduled to be held on September 29  2023 and will be convened shortly.AVAILABILITY OF AUDITED ANNUAL AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 2022-2023 FINANCIAL YEARAnnual and consolidated financial statements for the 2022-23 financial year  ending March 31  2023 are available on the Company's website.About ATARIAtari is an interactive entertainment company and an iconic gaming industry brand that transcends generations and audiences.

Currency variations had a positive impact of +4.2% on the group growth with the US dollar and Russian ruble appreciating significantly.Against a backdrop of widespread inflation and heightened geopolitical tensions  which are having a major impact on the price of agricultural raw materials  packaging  energy and logistics  and with consumer spending under pressure  the group has once again demonstrated the resilience of its business by posting  on a like for like basis*  a growth in line with its latest objectives.Quarter 4 posted a growth of +4.0% on a like for like basis* and +5.2% on reported figures highlighting a slowdown in consumption at the end of the year and the mitigation of currency impacts.Despite this unfavorable and volatile environment  the Bonduelle Group confirms its objectives of improving current operating income and operating margin for the financial year.Global RevenueActivity by Geographic RegionTotal Consolidated Revenue(in € million) FY2022-2023 FY2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis* Q42022-2023 Q42021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis* Europe Zone 1 508.1 1 357.3 11.1% 11.6% 392.2 357.5 9.7% 9.5% Non-Europe Zone 898.1 845.3 6.3% -5.8% 198.5 203.9 -2.6% -5.6% Total 2 406.2 2 202.6 9.2% 5.0% 590.7 561.4 5.2% 4.0%Activity by Operating SegmentsTotal Consolidated Revenue(in € million) FY2022-2023 FY2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis* Q42022-2023 Q42021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis* Canned 1 126.3 958.4 17.5% 13.0% 265.8 232.1 14.5% 11.7% Frozen 278.8 238.4 17.0% 16.5% 66.8 56.9 17.4% 16.4% Fresh processed 1 001.1 1 005.9 -0.5% -5.4% 258.1 272.4 -5.2% -5.1% Total 2 406.2 2 202.6 9.2% 5.0% 590.7 561.4 5.2% 4.0%Europe ZoneThe Europe Zone  representing 62.7% of the business activity in FY 2022-2023  recorded a very strong growth of +11.1% on reported figures and +11.6% on like for like basis* and over Quarter 4 of +9.7% and +9.5% respectively.All technologies reported growth in value over the year  despite Quarter 4 marked by a downturn in retail.For the long life segment  canned-brand activities posted a drop in volume  but maintained their market share in declining markets  while the group private labels activities experienced a more limited decline  enabling them to meet the expectations of the various market segments. Driven by the year’s innovations  the frozen activity posted a growth in volume. Price increases  made necessary by the rise in various cost items  supported growth in value and enabled margins to be maintained. The food service activity  mainly frozen  confirmed its dynamism over the whole year  with a growth in volume  reinforced in value by price increases.More sensitive to the consumer environment  the ready-to-use fresh segment in retail also contributed to overall growth in value  with sales sustained by a good performance in ready-to-eat activity  with growth in volume thanks to the success of innovations and favorable weather conditions  on the other hand  the fresh cut salads showed a sharper decline.Non-Europe ZoneThe revenue of the Non-Europe Zone  representing 37.3% of the business activity over FY  recorded a growth of +6.3% on reported figures and -5.8% on a like for like basis*.In North America  the downturn in the ready to use fresh segment remained marked in retail  due to an unfavorable market trend returning to pre-Covid levels  an agronomic crisis linked to a plant disease that affected the entire sector  and the residual impact of the previous year's loss of references; the price rises made necessary by cost increases did not offset the volume declines recorded. As in the Europe Zone  the dynamic remains encouraging in the food service activity  with growing markets and the conquest of new customers.The reorganization of our sales teams  the overhaul of our commercial policy  the outcome of recent negotiations  the relaunch of our innovation policy and the stabilization of markets should enable us to achieve a recovery in sales volumes in the future.In the Eurasia zone  the canned activity  which is predominant in this area and impacted by the geopolitical context  posted an overall decline in volume  with the Globus brand preserving the brand’s significant market share in this region. The frozen activity  which is more marginal  posted for its part a significant decline. For safety reasons  the Russian frozen plant in Belgorod has been shut down for the 2023 harvest  with the processing activity being outsourced during this period.The export activity of the group also suffered the consequences of the inflationary and geopolitical environment  with heightened competition in certain regions with limited purchasing power and major delivery constraints  while continuing to expand with the introduction of Bonduelle's range of frozen products in Israel.Other significant informationArrival of Xavier Unkovic as CEO of the Bonduelle GroupThe Bonduelle Group announced  on May 22  2023  the appointment of Xavier Unkovic as Chief Executive Officer of the group.

This ambition involves each of its entities obtaining their certification one by one. FY 2022-2023 marks a major milestone with the certification of Bonduelle in Italy and Bonduelle Fresh Americas in the United States  together accounting for 37% of group revenue. The two Bonduelle Group entities are the first to meet B Lab's demanding social and environmental impact standards.

The B Corp certification process accelerates the commitment and mobilization of all the company's activities around the group's positive impact programs.2022-2023 OutlooksThe downturn in food consumption observed since Quarter 3 was confirmed  as expected  in Quarter 4  in a backdrop of continuing inflation.Despite this unfavorable environment  driven by its agility and the commitment of its employees  the Bonduelle Group confirms its objective of improvement of current operating income and margin for FY 2022-2023  compared with the previous financial year.* At constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis.

Most of the acquired shares will be cancelled.The opportunity to initiate the buyback program stems from the Group’s significant cash flow generation  its industry leading performance in a challenging macro-economic environment  and its future growth prospects which are not properly reflected in the current Teleperformance stock price.As a consequence of most of the acquired shares being cancelled  the dilution that would result from the completion of the Majorel acquisition  expected during the fourth quarter of the current year  would be partially offset.The amount allocated to this program  that is within the framework of the authorization given by the Shareholders’ meeting of Teleperformance of April 13  2023(1)  will allow the Group to maintain its financial flexibility  especially its ability to pursue other attractive acquisition opportunities. The program can be suspended or resized at any time depending on then prevailing conditions and other opportunities the Group may have.The share buyback program will be executed in one or several tranches. Teleperformance has executed a share buyback mandate with an investment service provider acting independently.Daniel Julien  Chairman and CEO of Teleperformance  said: ""With continued confidence in Teleperformance's short- and long-term growth and significant potential for value creation  the Board of Directors and management team strongly believe that Teleperformance’s shares represent an attractive investment opportunity at the current stock price  which we believe significantly undervalues our Group and its potential. Further  we believe the buyback program will be rewarding for Teleperformance’s long-term shareholders  without impacting our S&P credit rating or our acquisition opportunities.""Story continues--------------------------------(1) The description of the share buyback program is included in the Universal Registration Document for 2022 filed with the Autorité des marchés financiers on February 27  2023 (no.
