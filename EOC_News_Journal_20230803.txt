Has corporate travel spending made a full recovery from the pandemic? Are carbon budgets replacing financial budgets? Accor’s Masters of Travel advisory board meeting brought industry leaders from techn...,Is the business world still Zooming from home? Has corporate travel spending made a full recovery from the pandemic? Are carbon budgets replacing financial budgets?Accor’s Masters of Travel advisory board meeting brought industry leaders from technology  law  energy  engineering  and pharmaceuticals to Brussels to create a vision for business travel and corporate meetings post-pandemic. The delegates’ mission was to dig deep into the real value of travel  evaluating the demands it makes in environmental  social and governance (ESG) and what businesses need to prioritise in 2024 and beyond. The new Business of Travel report from Accor shares these findings along with new European and global data on business travel.The demand for business travel is back  with a return to in-person and corporate industry events under the provision that business needs are balanced with social and environmental considerations. All delegates agree the policy is now Purposeful Travel.Accor research found that business travel spending is down just 24% from 2019 and is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2024 (Deloitte). Accor’s recent global business travel survey aligns with this return to pre-pandemic spend  as 57% of respondents expect an increase on travel budget in 2024 vs 2023 spend. The same corporates place ‘traveller experience’ as the second most crucial consideration in 2024  following cost-savings in order of prominence. And 46% of respondents confirmed they were not likely to limit business travel for the rest of the year.Masters of Travel gives us an in-depth look at the state of play for business travel today. With businesses trying to strike a balance between productivity and purpose  it’s a time of great change and revaluation for the industry. What’s clear is that after a period of inactivity  delegates are eager to get on the road again. Being mindful of value  sustainability and striking a balance of work and leisure that ensures the wellbeing of employees  businesses can uplift revenue and reinvigorate the art of face-to-face. Saskia Gentil  SVP Sales  Europe & North Africa at AccorThe value of face-to-face is undeniable  with professionals estimating 25% more revenue when meeting in person. And the bottom line isn’t the only equation when workers need interaction with colleagues and associates for their mental health and job satisfaction. Every trip is carefully evaluated in terms of ROI and ROE – return on investment  and  increasingly  return on expectation - no return  no flight.Virtual meetings are an accepted part of the working landscape in ways that weren’t commonplace pre-Covid  but until the tech catches up and holograms can smile with feeling  deals are still being sealed with a handshake.Environmental concerns were front of mind for many. An Accor survey of corporate clients revealed that 54% put carbon emissions as their number one CSR priority  and “supplier sustainability performance for 2024 hotel sourcing and selection” was ranked as highly important in their booking decisions. The onus lies both on travellers and hosts  with both parties having to work together for more sustainable travel. More than 70%of Accor hotels have carbon measurement tools in place and delegates were happy to spend more per night for higher environmental credentials.Combining meetings with purposeful leisure time means travellers are staying longer  doing more  and going down a gear to make the most of their carbon output. While still in its infancy  delegates clearly value ‘bleisure’  as do their employees.Younger employees are more likely to combine business with pleasure via blended ‘bleisure’ trips  but the trend is increasingly prevalent across demographics. 67% of clients surveyed in an Accor poll extended their business trips in 2022. Travel bookers urge caution from an insurance standpoint  as partners and families are often not covered and grey areas exist when it comes to splitting invoices  dividing loyalty points and benefits.The wellbeing of business travellers should be of utmost importance. Consumers today understand that they need to own their health and immunity in a different way  said Emlyn Brown  global senior vice president of well-being at Accor. Our ability to deliver an authentic  holistic  and highly considered wellness offering is vital. He added: Four out of five of our guests  irrespective of age  demographics  or country  are taking a daily step to improve their well-being — so we need to meet and exceed that demand in all our brands no matter which one travellers are staying in.Masters of Travel delegates indicated loyalty programmes play a factor in enticing employees to travel for business too  with younger travellers seeking experiential rewards like concerts  drinks and even bicycle hire. ALL: Accor Live Limitless has over 95 partnerships offering rewards  services  and experiences beyond the stay.While tech is key to bookings across the board  technology must be people-centric  designed to improve the process and the human touch shouldn’t be far away.Sabine Toplak  VP Corporate & TMC Sales  Europe & North Africa at Accor  and Co-Host of Masters of Travel knows the world of corporate travel is changing quickly  and clients and hospitality businesses need to learn how to adapt. Insights gleaned will shape Accor’s thinking around travel  in order to fully understand what businesses are thinking so we can work collaboratively to create solutions to meet their objectives .To read the full report  visit Business of Travel 2023 — Accor European Travel Trends (accoreuropeantrends.com)About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries in 5 400 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

MVG already has Ebusco 2.2 and 3.0 buses in operation.SWM has ordered the low-floor articulated buses with a particularly large battery pack (>500 kWh) for MVG. Together with the lightweight design  which makes the Ebusco 3.0 18-metre as much as 5 tonnes lighter than its forerunner (the Ebusco 2.2 18-metre)  SWM can count on low energy consumption and high range. The buses are expected to cover some 60 000 km per year  good for savings of at least 55 000 kilograms of CO 2 and more than 90 000 grams of nitrogen per bus annually.The Ebusco buses are a familiar sight on the streets of Munich. SWM not only has Ebusco 2.2 buses in operation  but the Ebusco 3.0 also experienced its world premiere in the Bavarian capital. Meanwhile  the first Ebusco 3.0 has been running for over a year and a half on line 100 in Munich's city centre. There  the energy consumption of the 3.0 12-metre proves to be over 30 per cent lower compared to its predecessor (Ebusco 2.2). This makes the bus a very reliable choice in the switch to electric driving.Peter Bijvelds  CEO of Ebusco  comments: ""We are immensely proud of the trust shown by this order. The first Ebusco buses have already been on the road in Munich since 2017. In the past years  we have worked closely with SWM as an innovation partner  for example for the development of our lightweight construction and prototyping of platooning buses. The fact that SWM has now chosen the Ebusco 3.0 again proves that we are on the right track.""Ingo Wortmann  MVG-Chef  adds: ""Besides their innovative character  the Ebusco 3.0 vehicles are very reliable and especially economical. We are looking forward to adding 28 more 18-metre buses to our fleet and  among other things  making public transport in Munich even more sustainable.""",neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,positive,0.71,0.28,0.01,True,English,"['Stadtwerke München', 'Ebusco N', 'contract', 'Stadtwerke München', 'Münchner Verkehrsgesellschaft', 'large battery pack', 'low-floor articulated buses', 'low energy consumption', 'The Ebusco buses', '28 Ebusco 3.0 18-metre buses', 'first Ebusco buses', 'electric buses', 'platooning buses', 'charging systems', 'new contract', 'lightweight design', 'high range', 'familiar sight', 'world premiere', 'Bavarian capital', 'a half', 'city centre', 'reliable choice', 'electric driving', 'Peter Bijvelds', 'past years', 'innovation partner', 'lightweight construction', 'right track', 'Ingo Wortmann', 'innovative character', 'other things', 'public transport', 'Ebusco 2.2 buses', 'Ebusco 3.0 vehicles', '3.0 buses', 'Deurne', 'pioneer', 'frontrunner', 'development', 'delivery', 'MVG', 'operation', 'SWM', '>500 kWh', 'forerunner', '60,000 km', 'savings', '55,000 kilograms', '90,000 grams', 'nitrogen', 'streets', 'Munich', 'line', '3.0 12-metre', 'predecessor', 'switch', 'CEO', 'trust', 'order', 'road', 'example', 'prototyping', 'fact', 'fleet']",2023-08-02,2023-08-03,marketscreener.com

See Note 4 for a reconciliation from IFRS to benchmark figures.Full-Year 202 3 OutlookWe reiterate our group-level guidance for 2023 as shown in the table below. We continue to expect the group-level adjusted operating profit margin to increase in the fourth quarter of 2023 (compared to fourth quarter 2022) leading to a margin improvement for the full year. Divisional guidance (below) has been recast to reflect the new organizational structure.Full-Year 2023 Outlook Performance indicators 2023 Guidance 2022 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.1%-26.5% 26.1% Adjusted free cash flow** Around €1 200 million €1 220 million ROIC* 16.5%-17.0% 15.5% Diluted adjusted EPS growth** High-single-digit 8% *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2023 of €/$1.09. **Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (€/$ 1.05). Guidance reflects share repurchases of €1 billion in 2023.If the current U.S. dollar rate persists  currency will have a slightly negative effect on full-year 2023 results reported in euros. In 2022  Wolters Kluwer generated over 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2022 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average €/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 3 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS1.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We continue to expect 2023 restructuring costs to be in the range of €10-€15 million (FY 2022: €6 million). We continue to expect adjusted net financing costs2 in constant currencies to be approximately €40 million. We expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to be in the range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2022: 22.6%). Capital expenditure is expected to be at the upper end of our normal guidance range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2022: 5.4%). We expect the full-year 2023 cash conversion ratio to reduce to approximately 100% (FY 2022: 107%).Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term. The impact of discontinuing activities in Russia and Belarus is expected to be immaterial to the group’s consolidated financial results in 2023.2023 outlook by division (new five-division structure)Health: we continue to expect organic growth to be in line with the prior year and the adjusted operating profit margin to be stable.Tax & Accounting: we expect organic growth to be lower than in the prior year (FY 2022: 8% pro forma). The adjusted operating profit margin is expected to decline slightly compared to prior year (FY 2022: 32.6% pro forma).Financial & Corporate Compliance: we expect organic growth to be slightly lower than or in line with the prior year (FY 2022: 4% pro forma) and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve slightly (FY 2022: 36.7% pro forma).Legal & Regulatory: we expect organic growth to be in line with prior year (FY 2022: 4% pro forma) and the adjusted operating profit margin to increase for the full year (FY 2022: 14.5% pro forma).Corporate Performance & ESG: we expect organic growth to improve slightly from the prior year (FY 2022: 12% pro forma) and the adjusted operating profit margin to increase for the full year (FY 2022: 12.4% pro forma).Progress against 2022-2024 s trateg yAt the start of 2022  we introduced our 2022-2024 strategic plan  which has three strategic priorities:Accelerate Expert Solutions : we are focusing our investments on cloud-based expert solutions while continuing to transform selected digital information products into expert solutions. We are investing to enrich the customer experience of our products by leveraging advanced data analytics.we are focusing our investments on cloud-based expert solutions while continuing to transform selected digital information products into expert solutions. We are investing to enrich the customer experience of our products by leveraging advanced data analytics. Expand Our Reach : we are seeking to extend organically into high-growth adjacencies along our customer workflows and to adapt our existing products for new customer segments. We plan to further develop partnerships and ecosystems for our key software platforms.we are seeking to extend organically into high-growth adjacencies along our customer workflows and to adapt our existing products for new customer segments. We plan to further develop partnerships and ecosystems for our key software platforms. Evolve Core Capabilities: we are enhancing our central functions to drive excellence and scale economies  mainly in sales and marketing (go-to-market) and in technology. We plan to advance our environmental  social  and governance (ESG) performance and capabilities and to continue investing in diverse and engaged talent to support innovation and growth.A more detailed discussion of our strategy and business model can be found in our 2022 Annual Report  pages 6-7.In the first half of 2023  we made important progress on our strategic plans. Expert solutions  which include our software products and certain advanced information solutions  accounted for 58% of total revenues (HY 2022: 56%) and grew 7% organically (HY 2022: 9%). Software revenues accounted for 45% of total revenues (HY 2022: 44%) and grew 7% organically (HY 2022: 9%). Cloud software revenues accounted for 37% of total software revenues and grew 15% (HY 2022: 20%). Today  around 50% of our digital revenues are from products that leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to drive enhanced value for our customers. We are currently experimenting with the new generative AI models  testing dozens of use cases  collaborating with several large customers  and partnering with Microsoft and Google  while at the same time following our responsible AI principles.We also made progress on extending our reach into high growth adjacencies and geographies. The new Corporate Performance & ESG division  formed in March 2023  sets us on a path to extend our enterprise software solutions into corporate workflows for ESG data collection  analysis  reporting  and auditing. CCH Tagetik signed a channel partnership with LTIMindtree to support further geographic expansion. Health Learning Research & Practice launched vrClinicals for Nursing in partnership with Laerdal Medical and the National League for Nursing.Last but not least  we have taken several major steps to evolve our core capabilities this year. We made significant progress in centralizing our product development teams  more than doubling the number of FTEs in our global development organization  Digital eXperience Group (DXG). We have created a single unified branding  communications  and digital marketing function to support the business globally. And we continued to advance towards our specific ESG objectives by driving initiatives that enhance employee engagement and belonging and executing on programs that reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

Evolve Core Capabilities: we are enhancing our central functions to drive excellence and scale economies  mainly in sales and marketing (go-to-market) and in technology. We plan to advance our environmental  social  and governance (ESG) performance and capabilities and to continue investing in diverse and engaged talent to support innovation and growth.A more detailed discussion of our strategy and business model can be found in our 2022 Annual Report  pages 6-7.In the first half of 2023  we made important progress on our strategic plans. Expert solutions  which include our software products and certain advanced information solutions  accounted for 58% of total revenues (HY 2022: 56%) and grew 7% organically (HY 2022: 9%). Software revenues accounted for 45% of total revenues (HY 2022: 44%) and grew 7% organically (HY 2022: 9%). Cloud software revenues accounted for 37% of total software revenues and grew 15% (HY 2022: 20%). Today  around 50% of our digital revenues are from products that leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to drive enhanced value for our customers. We are currently experimenting with the new generative AI models  testing dozens of use cases  collaborating with several large customers  and partnering with Microsoft and Google  while at the same time following our responsible AI principles.We also made progress on extending our reach into high growth adjacencies and geographies. The new Corporate Performance & ESG division  formed in March 2023  sets us on a path to extend our enterprise software solutions into corporate workflows for ESG data collection  analysis  reporting  and auditing. CCH Tagetik signed a channel partnership with LTIMindtree to support further geographic expansion. Health Learning Research & Practice launched vrClinicals for Nursing in partnership with Laerdal Medical and the National League for Nursing.Last but not least  we have taken several major steps to evolve our core capabilities this year. We made significant progress in centralizing our product development teams  more than doubling the number of FTEs in our global development organization  Digital eXperience Group (DXG). We have created a single unified branding  communications  and digital marketing function to support the business globally. And we continued to advance towards our specific ESG objectives by driving initiatives that enhance employee engagement and belonging and executing on programs that reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

ACTIA's turnover rose by 12.2% to reach €150.5m in the second quarter  following a first quarter of €138.2m  up by 20.8%.

All segments showed progress  with the exception of the outsourced Manufacturing Design & Services (MDS) business that slowed down following several very robust quarters. The Group's business remains buoyant despite ongoing difficulties in sourcing certain components  meaning that not all orders placed by customers can be produced. Production delays still amounted to around ten million euros at 30 June 2023. Against this backdrop  consolidated revenue for the first half of 2023 nevertheless reached €288.7m  up by 16.2% compared to the same period 2022.For the second quarter  the sales of the foreign subsidiaries reached €76.3m  up by 28.4%. With a slight drop of 0.7% to €74.2m  sales of the French companies were stable  absorbing the decrease in the electronics outsourcing business  particularly in the field of home automation  following record growth in 2022. International customers accounted for 65.1% of second quarter sales  as opposed to 63.8% in the same quarter 2022. Indeed  the international business grew by 13.9%  proof of the dynamism in the Group's markets. Over the first half  international customers represented 64.4% of consolidated revenue  with progress in Germany and Brazil offsetting the decline in Egypt with the gradual winding up of deliveries to the SatCom customer.The Automotive Division generated 84.8% of the Group's quarterly revenue  a total of €127.6m. However  growth of 13.4% remained hampered by the supply difficulties for certain families of components  even if the situation is gradually improving. ACTIA continues to rely on its teams to manage the shortfalls and the production plans in order to limit the impact on its customers. In the second quarter of 2023  this helped to generate growth of 20.1% for the OEM* business  which accounts for 77.4% of the division's turnover  after an 18.5% improvement in the first quarter. These figures also take into account the end of the Volvo Car telematics contract in 2022  resulting in lost sales of €11.7m compared to the first half of 2022. In line with the disposal of the Technical Inspection and Garage Equipment business in April 2022  the Aftermarket** business experienced a decline of 3.0% in the second quarter  now accounting for no more than 5.2% of the division's revenue  resulting from the Diagnostics and Fleet Management businesses that were retained by the Group. The outsourced electronics or MDS business  at 12.9% of the division's revenue  was down by 16.0% in the second quarter  a reflection of the supply problems making it difficult to support the recovery in the aeronautics sector  and the flattening out of the Home Automation market after 3 years of very significant growth. The Group's historical OEM markets to a large extent offset this trend  particularly the circuit boards for diagnostic tools and onboard computers in the fields of agricultural machinery  trucks and rail. Lastly  ""Other""  with the ramping up of studies sold as part of the outsourced R&D business  up by 47.5%  reflects ACTIA's expertise and  in the second quarter produced 4.5% of the division's revenue.The Telecoms Division generated 15.2% of the Group's quarterly revenue. After a first quarter that saw very strong growth of 45.6%  further progress of 6.2% was made in the second quarter. This trend is evidence of the delays experienced for certain deliveries in 2022. Energy and Rail continued to pick up speed with growth of 26.9% and 66.0% respectively over the quarter  even if they remain sensitive to supplies of components. The end of significant shipments for the Egyptian SatCom contract  with the gradual switch to Maintenance in Operational Condition  has affected this segment  down by 24.9% compared to the second quarter 2022.2023 OUTLOOKWith a slight improvement forecast in the supply of components by the end of the year  which is expected to enable the factories to operate more smoothly  ACTIA maintains its objective of growth in excess of 15%. By addressing inventory levels and setting up factoring for its principal structures in order to better mobilise customer receivables  the Group is taking action to reduce the impact on its WCR during a period of sustained growth.Reassured by its solid order book and its portfolio of multi-year contracts that continues to grow  ACTIA Group targets revenue in excess of €800m by the end of 2025. This growth will be associated with a new segmentation of the Group's business into 4 Divisions (Mobility  Energy  Aerospace and Engineering) to provide greater clarity and visibility  and  by the same token  a reinforced growth dynamic. These changes will be made over the next 3 years.*OEM: Original Equipment Manufacturer** Aftermarket: including repairs and maintenance………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………ABOUT ACTIAACTIA Group is a mid-market company (ETI) founded in 1986.

(AEV)  entered into a Letter of Intent to jointly acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines  Inc. (CCBPI)  a successful business with attractive profitability and growth prospects  from The Coca-Cola Company (KO) The proposed acquisition would build on CCEP's successful expansion into Australia  Pacific & Indonesia (API) in 2021  positioning it as the world's largest Coca-Cola bottler by both revenue and volume  supporting its long-term growth strategy and focus on driving shareholder value;Coca-Cola bottler by both revenue and volume  supporting its long-term growth strategy and focus on driving shareholder value; CCEP has signed a non-binding Term Sheet and is in advanced discussions with AEV regarding a potential joint transaction  which may lead to the acquisition of CCBPI from KO  based on a 60:40 ownership structure between CCEP and AEV; andnon-binding Term Sheet and is in advanced discussions with AEV regarding a potential joint transaction  which may lead to the acquisition of CCBPI from KO  based on a 60:40 ownership structure between CCEP and AEV; and CCEP and AEV have entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent with KO  setting out the terms on which CCEP and AEV propose to acquire KO's 100% ownership in CCBPI  consistent with KO's stated intent to divest bottling operations CCEP's proposed acquisition of CCBPI  with AEV  one of the leading conglomerates in the local market  offers a great opportunity to co-acquire an established  well-run business with attractive profitability and growth prospects. The proposed transaction is a further step for CCEP to create a more diverse footprint within its existing API business segment and support Indonesia's transformation journey. It is aligned with CCEP's aim of driving sustainable and stronger growth through diversification and scale  and underpins the company's strategic mid-term objectives. CCEP and AEV's non-binding Letter of Intent with KO implies an enterprise value (EV) for CCBPI of US$1.8 billion (on a debt free cash free basis). The consideration would be paid in cash  which would have a modest impact on CCEP's leverage; CCEP's guidance to return to the top end of its Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA range of 2.5-3.0 times by the end of FY23 would instead be expected to be achieved during FY24. CCBPI delivered ~US$1.71 billion of revenue and ~US$901 million of PBT in FY22. As CCEP would be the majority owner (60%)  it is expected to consolidate CCBPI as of the acquisition date and establish a non-controlling interest representing AEV's minority interest (40%). The business would be governed by a Board of 5 members  three appointed by CCEP and two by AEV. CCEP would also appoint the CEO. The proposed acquisition is subject to a number of conditions  including satisfactory completion of due diligence (which is well underway)  the parties concluding definitive agreements and the receipt of regulatory approvals.There is  therefore  no certainty  at this stage  that the acquisition of CCBPI will be entered into or completed and  as such  further updates will be provided in due course. The potential transaction  if entered into  would be expected to close around the end of FY23.

Restated from these currency impacts  Q2’23 digital growth would have amounted to c. +20.5%.Strong increase in Adjusted EBITDA at €24.2 million or a margin of 5.8%  up +250bps YoY reflecting efficiency  control on investments and operating leverage.

Digital market share gains at the same level in Q1’23 and in Q2’23.Attractive commercial opportunities to sign and renew contracts at better conditions for the Group (margin  duration  …) with several Tier 1 labels and top artists.Confirmed leadership and recognized impact on local music industries  notably in Southeast Asia where the Group celebrated a successful first decade.Acquisition of the publishing platform Sentric in March’23  with plans to roll out first publishing solutions for selected songwriters and publishers before the end of the year.Embracing Artificial Intelligence across the entire business with a responsible approach to foster opportunities.2023 OutlookFor H2’23  Believe maintains the main assumptions underlying its growth scenario presented last March  e.g. continued increase in paid streaming  continued market share gains and challenging ad-funded streaming monetization. Given current currency translation impacts embedded in the revenues from digital partners (with c. -9% expected now for H2’23)  Believe is cautious regarding its organic growth. The Group will pursue its focus on improving efficiency  which will positively impact profitability for the full year. As a result  assumptions for FY’23 are now as follows: Organic growth of +14% (vs. +18% previously anticipated). Restated from currency impacts  organic growth would be c. +19.5%. Sustained progress in Adjusted EBITDA margin: c. 5.5% (vs. 5% previously anticipated)The Group’s reinforced appeal is generating a higher level of attractive commercial opportunities and therefore of advances. In H2’23  the Group will continue to privilege financing advances over acquisitions given their very attractive returns and support to future revenue growth. Consequently  Believe now anticipates a negative free cash flow for FY’23  with a positive free cash flow in H2’23.Denis Ladegaillerie  Founder and CEO said: “The start of the year has been marked by another strong performance of the roster thanks to our unique model and digital expertise despite currency headwinds and lower ad-supported monetization. This is a testament to the quality of service  which is at the core of our positioning in the industry. We recorded a significant level of signings as well as renewals by Labels and Artists on longer term and improved conditions. We have been focused on improving profitability and efficiency across the organization. We have also been in a great position to seize commercial opportunities and to invest in advances against better conditions to fuel long-term growth. We are heavily engaged in several innovative AI and Generative AI exploratory partnership discussions in H1 and strongly believe that AI and Generative AI will have a strong positive impact for the music industry and particularly for Believe  as a digital end-to-end large-scale music and technology driven business.”H1 2023 KEY FIGURESin €million H1 2022 H1 2023 ChangeYoY Organic change Group Revenues 352.2 415.4 +17.9% +17.5% Premium Solutions 329.2 388.5 +18.0% +18.1% Automated Solutions 23.0 26.9 +17.1% +9.2% Adjusted EBITDA pre-Central Platform 47.5 61.7 +30.0% in % of revenues 13.5% 14.9% 140bps Premium Solutions 43.2 57.2 +32.4% Automated Solutions 4.3 4.5 +5.0% Central Platform (35.7) (37.5) +4.9% Group's Adjusted EBITDA 11.7 24.2 +106.3% in % of revenues 3.3% 5.8% +250bps Operating income / loss (EBIT) (11.3) 1.0 Net cash from operating activities 21.4 (27.2) Free cash flow 10.8 (32.9) Net cash and cash equivalents 263.4 210.2H1 2023 HIGHLIGHTSStrong performance of the roster and very dynamic commercial activity despite Q2’23 headwindAfter a strong start to the year  Believe further grew its revenues in Q2’23 reflecting a solid performance of the existing roster of artists and labels. Over the course of H1’23  the Group remained at the forefront of audience development  fostering digital monetization in an ever-growing number of digital music genres. Believe gained significant market share throughout the semester  notably in Premium Solutions  and brought back solid value to artists and labels. Digital monetization was  however  affected by very moderate growth in ad-funded streaming monetization and a forex impact related to the euro exchange rate appreciation versus the dollar and several local currencies. The currency translation effect directly embedded in royalties paid out by DSPs2  which was positive until 2022-year end enhancing last year organic growth  became negative in Q1’23 and even more in Q2’23. The currency translation had a negative impact estimated at -6.5% on Q2’23 organic growth driven by the strengthening of the euro  which accelerated during the quarter.Commercial dynamism continued to be resilient throughout H1’23. Believe’s appeal to artists and labels further increased thanks to a strong track record and recognized quality of service  resulting in new signings of artists and labels. The Group also broadened its relationships with several artists and labels  under better margin conditions and with longer terms than previously expected. The level of advances was therefore elevated compared to the end of December’22 and even H1’21. As an example of the main advances paid in the period  Believe signed one of the largest independent label in China and one of the top 10 UK independent Electro & Dance label on a 10-year deal. Believe also renewed by anticipation the second largest label in Turkey until 2030  and one of the largest labels in India until 2033. The Group privileged providing financing through advances over acquisitions notably in Q2’23 as few external opportunities provide equivalent returns (the historical average return on investment of advances paid to labels served by Believe amounted to 31%3) and growth prospects. Believe will pursue this cash allocation policy in H2’23  leveraging data from streaming and social media along with superior service levels to foster development trajectory and potential return.Celebrating first decade in Southeast AsiaBelieve celebrated in June’23 10 years of empowering music in Southeast Asia  where the Group played a pivotal role in shaping the music landscape since 2013. Through royalty payments and advances  Believe returned a significant amount of revenues to Southeast Asian artists and labels  further fueling the growth of a sustainable local music ecosystem by fostering new artist development  funding the launch of new labels  exploring new genres of music and addressing new audiences. Overall  the Southeast Asian roster generated more than 634 billion of streams and views over the past ten years  making Believe the leading music company in the region.Southeast Asia is at the very beginning of its digital growth with a growing penetration of paid music subscriptions at only 1.8% of the population. Based on industry experts and company estimates  paid streaming users are expected to grow from 15 million today to 67 million in 2030. Believe holds leading positions in the largest music markets of the region such as Indonesia  the Philippines and Thailand  but also in booming markets like Malaysia  Vietnam  and Singapore. With its full services’ offer deployed in most of those territories  Believe’s expert teams leverage the Group’s strong network of digital music partners and innovative partnerships with DSPs to successfully accompany an ever-growing roster of local labels and artists in building their careers and expanding their audiences.Confirmed leadership and recognized quality of serviceIn France  Believe confirmed its leadership in new releases and its success in developing artists durably. Believe ranked #2 on local acts in H1’23  with a 27% market share for the top albums locally with 40 of the 149 local albums from the Top 200 (physical + digital according to SNEP data). This is a testament to the focused strategy on local acts and the digital expertise of the Group. Believe had 4 best-selling artists in the Top 10 in H1’23  proving its unique capacity to develop several artists in several genres at the very top of the market.Additionally  Believe won several awards during the semester. As an example  in India  where the Group has built a leading position  artists services won three awards at the 2023 radioandmusic.com CLEF Music Awards. In the UK  where the Group emerges as an attractive alternative to large incumbent music companies  Believe won Best Label/Artist Services at the Music Week Awards 2023  which is a true testament to the strength and its quality of service in digital. The Music Week Awards are the UK’s only music awards that recognize labels  publishing  live  retail  A&R  radio  marketing and PR – all segments of this industry.Embracing Artificial Intelligence with a responsible approach to foster opportunitiesGenerative AI and AI will impact in a positive manner Believe’s relationships with artists and labels  the way the Group partners with digital music services and how it manages its end-to-end digital operations. Generative AI will empower every artist to create greater high-quality music while AI-based marketing will give every artist a chance to better target audience; as a result  the Group expects continued fragmentation to play to Believe strengths. AI and Generative AI will allow for greater efficiency gains and opportunities to raise long term margins leveraging Believe’s Central Platform solutions through accelerated automation. During H1’23  the Group further developed its AI-enabled discovery solutions  explored partnerships conversations with several leading digital service providers around generative AI and explored investments on core internal AI and Generative AI use cases. Aligned with its driving forces of expertise  respect  fairness and transparency  which are the foundation of its long-term trusted relationships with artists and labels  the Group assesses each AI opportunity under the following Responsibility principles: consent  control  compensation and transparency. Key findings of the recent survey conducted by its subsidiary TuneCore of nearly 1 600 independent artists highlighted the need for a responsible approach to unlock AI and gen AI opportunities. Believe also launched in June a first public experiment through TuneCore with its partnership with Grimes and CreateSafe  which consists in using AI to facilitate collaborations with other artists and thus enlarge Grimes’ potential for collaboration.Another brick to build trusting relationships in the industry to further Shape Music for GoodBelieve and TuneCore joined as a founding member of the Music Fights Fraud alliance  a global task force aimed at eradicating streaming fraud. Supported by key industry associations including the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America)  the alliance represents for the first time all corners of the music industry aligned as a united front to combat fraud in music streaming. The founding members of Music Fights Fraud are all strong advocates for artists’ rights. Each participating company has instituted internal measures to contend with fraud and  by launching this task force  ultimately creating a healthier music industry where genuine content creators are able to thrive. This is fully aligned with Believe’s commitment to fostering a fairer  balanced  and more diverse artist and label market.H1 2023 FINANCIALSOrganic revenue growth of +17.5% in H1’23 reflecting a strong level of activity affected by currency headwinds in Q2’23H1'23 revenues grew by +17.9% to reach €415.4 million  reflecting an organic growth of +17.5%. The change in perimeter driven by the integration of Sentric amounted to €7.5 million of revenues (c. 2% to revenue growth in H1’23)  but this contribution was compensated by a negative forex impact related to the depreciation of the Turkish lira. Sentric revenues have been accounted for in non-digital sales  which were therefore up strongly in H1’23 (+32.9%)  including +11.0% of organic growth. The ongoing decrease in physical sales was fully offset by a strong increase at the start of the semester in merchandising  branding and other activities.Digital sales were up +18.0% organically in H1’23  reflecting a lower quarterly organic growth rate in Q2’23 (+14.0%) than in Q1’23 (+22.6% in Q1’23). Paid subscription monetization remained strong throughout the quarter  while ad-funded monetization slightly improved  but kept growing single digit at the main stores  including in June despite an easier comparison base (as a reminder the growth rate in ad-funded revenues started decelerating in June’22). This sustained level of activity was  however  affected by negative forex impacts due to the rapid strengthening of the euro during the period. The currency translation effect  directly embedded in the royalties that Believe received from its digital partners  went negative in Q1’23. The dragging effect was limited in Q1’23 (c. -1.0%) but represented a headwind to organic growth estimated at around -6.5% in Q2’23 (-3.6% for H1’23) significantly above Group’s anticipation and mainly impacting Premium Solutions’ organic growth. Restated from this currency impact  organic growth of digital sales would have been around +20.5% in Q2’23 and c. +21.6% in H1’23. The Group continued to increase its digital market share at the same pace throughout H1’23 with stable gains quarter-over-quarter  enabling Premium Solutions to further strengthen their positions notably in Asia and Europe.Premium Solutions driving organic growth  Automated Solutions revenue growth enhanced by SentricDigital Music Sales4 (DMS) amounted to €584.4 million in H1’23  reflecting double digit growth in Premium Solutions offset by lower DMS at TuneCore.In Premium Solutions  revenues amounted to €388.5 million  up c. +18% (at current and organic growth rate)  resulting from a strong organic growth in Q1’23 (+23.8%) and a solid Q2’23 (+13.2%). The positive perimeter effect related to Sentric integration was fully offset by a negative forex impact related to the Turkish lira  as mentioned above. Digital organic monetization was further affected by negative currency impacts as explained above  while presenting the same trends throughout the semester (resilient paid streaming  additional market share gains and lower growth in ad-funded monetization).Automated Solutions revenues amounted to €26.9 million up by +17.1% in H1’23  reflecting +11.2% in Q1’23 and +22.9% in Q2’23. Non-digital sales recorded a significant increase driven by the integration of Sentric self-served activities  which added +8.4% of revenue growth in H1’23 (+16.6% in Q2’23  first quarter of integration). Digital revenues grew single digit in Q2’23 after being slightly above +10% in Q1’23. Organic growth amounted to +8.6% in Q2’23  but revenue also embedded negative forex related to the weakening of the dollar versus the euro. This relative slowdown was expected as TuneCore increased its exposure to ad-funded monetization with the introduction of the Discovery Plan in November’21  which reported a strong traction in H1’22 and notably in Q2’22. The new Unlimited Pricing plan  introduced in June’22 continues to have a positive effect on new customers acquisition but with a lower ARPU (average revenue per user)  affecting the revenue growth rate.Strong growth in Asia-Pacific / Africa  Americas and Europein € million H1 2022 H1 2023 Change YoY Europe (excl.

The Group remained on a strong growth trajectory in Southern Europe and Eastern Europe. The UK was also very dynamic and positively impacted by the integration of Sentric in Q2’23  while the level of activity remained sustained in Italy. Revenue growth in Turkey was affected by the depreciation of the Turkish lira versus the euro  while other markets continued to progress.In H1’23  revenue growth reached +23.6% in Asia Pacific and Africa  which represented 27.0% of Group revenues. The market environment remained dynamic throughout the semester  but ad-funded streaming revenues remained depressed. Digital monetization was also affected by negative currency headwinds directly embedded in the royalties paid out by digital partners in Q2’23  affecting the overall performance. Consequently  India and Southeast Asia recorded lower growth in Q2 versus Q1  while the level of activity in Japan and Greater China remained very strong.Americas grew by +21.7% and represented 14.6% of Group revenues. The level of activity in Brazil and Mexico was strong throughout the semester. TuneCore remained on its positive trajectory  but the weakening of the dollar and less favorable comparison basis dragged on its overall performance.In France  revenues increased by +12.0% in H1’23 and represented 16.0% of Group revenues. The Group confirmed its position as a key player in France and its capacity to better and further develop artists and labels at any stage of their career. Digital revenues returned to double digit growth in Q2’23 after growing single digit in Q1’23 and Believe succeeded in growing its digital market share. Non-digital sales were however lower than in H1’22  which had been boosted by the massive concert in Marseille of top artist Jul in June’22.In Germany  revenues increased by +0.5% in H1’23 and represented 13.0% of Group revenues. Digital sales were less dynamic at the end of the quarter  but the Group had successes in developing artists in digital genres. The recent joint venture with Madizin started its commercial roll-out with promising signings. Revenues remained  however  affected by the exit from contracts that were too heavy in physical sales.Strong increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin illustrating control on investments and operating leverageBelieve adapted its investment pace to the growth level and focused on further improving efficiency in H1’23. The Group continued investing in local teams to fuel its future revenue growth  adding sourcing and servicing capabilities in its key markets  but at a slower pace to manage investments. The focus on efficiency had positive outcomes  notably at the Central Platform level.Adjusted EBITDA pre-Central Platform costs5 grew by +30.0% in H1’23 to reach €61.7 million (versus €47.5 million in H1’22). Believe pursued its investment strategy in H1’23 to support its profitable growth plan. The Group deployed additional sourcing and servicing capabilities in Premium Solutions  while introducing new features and functionalities on the TuneCore platform. Investments were  in parallel  closely monitored and adapted to the level of growth in each market. As a result  the Adjusted EBITDA margin pre-Central Platform reached 14.9%  an increase of 140bps compared with H1’22. This margin included growth investments in both segments  which represented 4.4% of total revenues in H1’23 (vs 5.4% in H1’22).Central Platform costs (€37.5 million in H1’23 versus €35.7 million in H1’22) increased by +4.9% year-over-year  but further decreased over revenue representing 9.0% in H1’23 compared with 10.1% in H1’22. Efficiency plans enabled the Group to optimize its investments in the Central Platform and some secondary investment projects were delayed. Believe continued deploying more spending in data analysis and digital marketing  and further developed AI-backed tools for discovery and audience development solutions. The planned decline in Central Platform costs over revenue provided solid operating leverage in H1’23.As for previous years  some Central Platform investments are capitalized under IFRS accounting principles. In H1’23  total investment (P&L and capitalized costs) in the Central Platform amounted to €45.3 million. Total investment went up +3.8% year-over-year and represented 10.9% of total Group revenues compared with 12.4% in H1’22.The Group’s Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled in H1’23 to reach €24.2 million compared with €11.7 million in H1’22. Adjusted EBITDA margin stood at 5.8% in H1’23 compared with 3.3% in H1’22 thanks to the Adjusted EBITDA margin increase at the segment level and better amortization of Central Platform and was consequently at the mid-term objective level (Group adjusted EBITDA margin of 5% to 7% by 2025).Positive operating income (EBIT)Depreciation & Amortization amounted to €21.2 million in H1’23  roughly stable compared with H1’22 (€20.2 million)  as the acquisition strategy was put on hold last year and resumed only in Q1’23. Acquisitions have been the main driver for the past D&A increases reported by the Group. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA combined with D&A stability resulted in a positive EBIT of €1.0 million.Free cash flow reflecting commercial dynamism and solid cash level at the end of June’23Working capital variation was negative by €42.9 million  reflecting higher artist and label advances that grew by €75.7 million compared with the end of December’22. The growing attractiveness of Believe toward Tier 1 labels and top artists and in a wider variety of music genres enabled the Group to sign longer-term contracts  to deepen its relationships with existing roster and to further add large-sized newcomers. Those signings support greater revenue generation  while economic terms of the advances improved  therefore increasing potential returns. Current activity extracted €32.8 million of cash from working capital in H1’23  partially compensating for the elevated level of advances.Free cash flow was negative by €32.9 million in H1’23  reflecting negative working capital variation. Capex amounted to €18.4 million and represented 4.4% of Group revenue  compared with €11.6 million or 3.3% of Group revenue in H1’22  with stable capitalized costs.Cash on the balance sheet amounted to €210.2 million at the end of June’23 compared with €263.4 million at the end of June’22 and €303.3 million at the end of December’22  mostly reflecting the acquisition of Sentric and higher artist and label advances.In the current environment  which remains fluid and challenging  the Group will continue to manage its cash and is likely to further allocate cash to advances over acquisitions in the next few months  opting for opportunities with greater return (historical average ROI of advances paid to labels: 31%) and revenue growth prospects.FY 2023 OUTLOOK AND MID-TERM OBJECTIVESIn H2’23  the Group will continue to drive a profitable growth trajectory towards its long-term profitability objective of 15% Adjusted EBITDA margin. The Group is organized to deliver such profitable growth in a degraded economic environment impacting ad-funded streaming activities and currency rates.With regards to H1’23 performance and current environment  the Group revised its initial growth scenario presented in March’23 at FY earnings presentation  which now includes a less favorable currency environment in H2’23 than initially anticipated  which will impact digital monetization (c. -9% currency impact embedded in the revenues from digital partners estimated for H2’23). The growth scenario also implies further increase and deployment of paid streaming  additional market share gains  and no recovery in ad-funded streaming monetization. Consequently  Believe revised its expectations of FY’23 organic growth and now anticipates around +14% for the Group (versus +18% initially expected). Restated from those currency impacts  organic growth would represent c. +19.5%. This would represent an organic CAGR of c. +22.6% for the period 2021-2023.Believe will keep investing in the Central Platform in H2’23 at the same controlled level as in H1’23  further driving improved amortization of associated costs. The Group adapted its investment pace to the growth level with success  while improving efficiency across the organization in H1’23 and intends to pursue those actions in H2’23. As a result  Believe revised its expectations of Adjusted EBITDA margin and now anticipates c. 5.5% in FY’23 (versus 5.0% initially anticipated).In H1’23  the Group’s track record and quality of service attracted an increased number of established and top artists and Tier 1 labels  leading the Group to allocate more cash to advances given their attractive returns and strong support to future long-term growth. This trend is likely to continue in H2’23  as the Group is in a good position to sign longer-term contracts offering attractive returns in a wider variety of music genres and in more geographies. Given the level of economic uncertainty  which remains high  the Group is actively managing its investments policy  between new hirings  new advances and M&A. After the acquisition of Sentric in March’23  which is expected to add around 3% of revenue growth on a full year basis with a neutral impact on Adjusted EBITDA margin after accounting for integration costs  the Group will continue identifying interesting acquisition targets but will remain highly selective in seizing opportunities.Believe now anticipates a higher level of advances during the year  while working capital extraction will be negatively impacted by the currency translation effects that are affecting digital monetization. In this context  the Group is now anticipating a negative free cash flow for FY’23 nevertheless showing improvement versus H1’23.Notwithstanding the current environment  the Group is on track to deliver on its medium-term trajectory communicated at the IPO  including a 2021-2025 CAGR of between +22% and +25% and a Group Adjusted EBITDA of 5%-7% by 2025  implying a segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%-16% (which is a ""high growth period"" margin  as the revenue growth is partially reinvested). Believe reiterates its confidence in its ability to achieve its long-term target of at least 15% Group Adjusted EBITDA margin.The interim earnings report is available on our investor website: Investors | BelieveWebcast:We will host a webcast https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/w2fuyhpt and conference call starting at 6:30 p.m. CET (5:30 p.m. GMT) today.

Restated from these currency impacts  Q2’23 digital growth would have amounted to c. +20.5%.Strong increase in Adjusted EBITDA at €24.2 million or a margin of 5.8%  up +250bps YoY reflecting efficiency  control on investments and operating leverage.

Given current currency translation impacts embedded in the revenues from digital partners (with c. -9% expected now for H2’23)  Believe is cautious regarding its organic growth. The Group will pursue its focus on improving efficiency  which will positively impact profitability for the full year. As a result  assumptions for FY’23 are now as follows: Organic growth of +14% (vs. +18% previously anticipated). Restated from currency impacts  organic growth would be c. +19.5%. Sustained progress in Adjusted EBITDA margin: c. 5.5% (vs. 5% previously anticipated)The Group’s reinforced appeal is generating a higher level of attractive commercial opportunities and therefore of advances. In H2’23  the Group will continue to privilege financing advances over acquisitions given their very attractive returns and support to future revenue growth. Consequently  Believe now anticipates a negative free cash flow for FY’23  with a positive free cash flow in H2’23.Denis Ladegaillerie  Founder and CEO said: “The start of the year has been marked by another strong performance of the roster thanks to our unique model and digital expertise despite currency headwinds and lower ad-supported monetization. This is a testament to the quality of service  which is at the core of our positioning in the industry. We recorded a significant level of signings as well as renewals by Labels and Artists on longer term and improved conditions. We have been focused on improving profitability and efficiency across the organization. We have also been in a great position to seize commercial opportunities and to invest in advances against better conditions to fuel long-term growth. We are heavily engaged in several innovative AI and Generative AI exploratory partnership discussions in H1 and strongly believe that AI and Generative AI will have a strong positive impact for the music industry and particularly for Believe  as a digital end-to-end large-scale music and technology driven business.”H1 2023 KEY FIGURESin €million H1 2022 H1 2023 ChangeYoY Organic change Group Revenues 352.2 415.4 +17.9% +17.5% Premium Solutions 329.2 388.5 +18.0% +18.1% Automated Solutions 23.0 26.9 +17.1% +9.2% Adjusted EBITDA pre-Central Platform 47.5 61.7 +30.0% in % of revenues 13.5% 14.9% 140bps Premium Solutions 43.2 57.2 +32.4% Automated Solutions 4.3 4.5 +5.0% Central Platform (35.7) (37.5) +4.9% Group's Adjusted EBITDA 11.7 24.2 +106.3% in % of revenues 3.3% 5.8% +250bps Operating income / loss (EBIT) (11.3) 1.0 Net cash from operating activities 21.4 (27.2) Free cash flow 10.8 (32.9) Net cash and cash equivalents 263.4 210.2H1 2023 HIGHLIGHTSStrong performance of the roster and very dynamic commercial activity despite Q2’23 headwindAfter a strong start to the year  Believe further grew its revenues in Q2’23 reflecting a solid performance of the existing roster of artists and labels.

Believe gained significant market share throughout the semester  notably in Premium Solutions  and brought back solid value to artists and labels. Digital monetization was  however  affected by very moderate growth in ad-funded streaming monetization and a forex impact related to the euro exchange rate appreciation versus the dollar and several local currencies. The currency translation effect directly embedded in royalties paid out by DSPs2  which was positive until 2022-year end enhancing last year organic growth  became negative in Q1’23 and even more in Q2’23. The currency translation had a negative impact estimated at -6.5% on Q2’23 organic growth driven by the strengthening of the euro  which accelerated during the quarter.Commercial dynamism continued to be resilient throughout H1’23. Believe’s appeal to artists and labels further increased thanks to a strong track record and recognized quality of service  resulting in new signings of artists and labels. The Group also broadened its relationships with several artists and labels  under better margin conditions and with longer terms than previously expected. The level of advances was therefore elevated compared to the end of December’22 and even H1’21. As an example of the main advances paid in the period  Believe signed one of the largest independent label in China and one of the top 10 UK independent Electro & Dance label on a 10-year deal. Believe also renewed by anticipation the second largest label in Turkey until 2030  and one of the largest labels in India until 2033. The Group privileged providing financing through advances over acquisitions notably in Q2’23 as few external opportunities provide equivalent returns (the historical average return on investment of advances paid to labels served by Believe amounted to 31%3) and growth prospects. Believe will pursue this cash allocation policy in H2’23  leveraging data from streaming and social media along with superior service levels to foster development trajectory and potential return.Celebrating first decade in Southeast AsiaBelieve celebrated in June’23 10 years of empowering music in Southeast Asia  where the Group played a pivotal role in shaping the music landscape since 2013. Through royalty payments and advances  Believe returned a significant amount of revenues to Southeast Asian artists and labels  further fueling the growth of a sustainable local music ecosystem by fostering new artist development  funding the launch of new labels  exploring new genres of music and addressing new audiences. Overall  the Southeast Asian roster generated more than 634 billion of streams and views over the past ten years  making Believe the leading music company in the region.Southeast Asia is at the very beginning of its digital growth with a growing penetration of paid music subscriptions at only 1.8% of the population. Based on industry experts and company estimates  paid streaming users are expected to grow from 15 million today to 67 million in 2030. Believe holds leading positions in the largest music markets of the region such as Indonesia  the Philippines and Thailand  but also in booming markets like Malaysia  Vietnam  and Singapore. With its full services’ offer deployed in most of those territories  Believe’s expert teams leverage the Group’s strong network of digital music partners and innovative partnerships with DSPs to successfully accompany an ever-growing roster of local labels and artists in building their careers and expanding their audiences.Confirmed leadership and recognized quality of serviceIn France  Believe confirmed its leadership in new releases and its success in developing artists durably. Believe ranked #2 on local acts in H1’23  with a 27% market share for the top albums locally with 40 of the 149 local albums from the Top 200 (physical + digital according to SNEP data). This is a testament to the focused strategy on local acts and the digital expertise of the Group. Believe had 4 best-selling artists in the Top 10 in H1’23  proving its unique capacity to develop several artists in several genres at the very top of the market.Additionally  Believe won several awards during the semester. As an example  in India  where the Group has built a leading position  artists services won three awards at the 2023 radioandmusic.com CLEF Music Awards. In the UK  where the Group emerges as an attractive alternative to large incumbent music companies  Believe won Best Label/Artist Services at the Music Week Awards 2023  which is a true testament to the strength and its quality of service in digital. The Music Week Awards are the UK’s only music awards that recognize labels  publishing  live  retail  A&R  radio  marketing and PR – all segments of this industry.Embracing Artificial Intelligence with a responsible approach to foster opportunitiesGenerative AI and AI will impact in a positive manner Believe’s relationships with artists and labels  the way the Group partners with digital music services and how it manages its end-to-end digital operations. Generative AI will empower every artist to create greater high-quality music while AI-based marketing will give every artist a chance to better target audience; as a result  the Group expects continued fragmentation to play to Believe strengths. AI and Generative AI will allow for greater efficiency gains and opportunities to raise long term margins leveraging Believe’s Central Platform solutions through accelerated automation. During H1’23  the Group further developed its AI-enabled discovery solutions  explored partnerships conversations with several leading digital service providers around generative AI and explored investments on core internal AI and Generative AI use cases. Aligned with its driving forces of expertise  respect  fairness and transparency  which are the foundation of its long-term trusted relationships with artists and labels  the Group assesses each AI opportunity under the following Responsibility principles: consent  control  compensation and transparency. Key findings of the recent survey conducted by its subsidiary TuneCore of nearly 1 600 independent artists highlighted the need for a responsible approach to unlock AI and gen AI opportunities. Believe also launched in June a first public experiment through TuneCore with its partnership with Grimes and CreateSafe  which consists in using AI to facilitate collaborations with other artists and thus enlarge Grimes’ potential for collaboration.Another brick to build trusting relationships in the industry to further Shape Music for GoodBelieve and TuneCore joined as a founding member of the Music Fights Fraud alliance  a global task force aimed at eradicating streaming fraud. Supported by key industry associations including the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America)  the alliance represents for the first time all corners of the music industry aligned as a united front to combat fraud in music streaming. The founding members of Music Fights Fraud are all strong advocates for artists’ rights. Each participating company has instituted internal measures to contend with fraud and  by launching this task force  ultimately creating a healthier music industry where genuine content creators are able to thrive. This is fully aligned with Believe’s commitment to fostering a fairer  balanced  and more diverse artist and label market.H1 2023 FINANCIALSOrganic revenue growth of +17.5% in H1’23 reflecting a strong level of activity affected by currency headwinds in Q2’23H1'23 revenues grew by +17.9% to reach €415.4 million  reflecting an organic growth of +17.5%. The change in perimeter driven by the integration of Sentric amounted to €7.5 million of revenues (c. 2% to revenue growth in H1’23)  but this contribution was compensated by a negative forex impact related to the depreciation of the Turkish lira. Sentric revenues have been accounted for in non-digital sales  which were therefore up strongly in H1’23 (+32.9%)  including +11.0% of organic growth. The ongoing decrease in physical sales was fully offset by a strong increase at the start of the semester in merchandising  branding and other activities.Digital sales were up +18.0% organically in H1’23  reflecting a lower quarterly organic growth rate in Q2’23 (+14.0%) than in Q1’23 (+22.6% in Q1’23). Paid subscription monetization remained strong throughout the quarter  while ad-funded monetization slightly improved  but kept growing single digit at the main stores  including in June despite an easier comparison base (as a reminder the growth rate in ad-funded revenues started decelerating in June’22). This sustained level of activity was  however  affected by negative forex impacts due to the rapid strengthening of the euro during the period. The currency translation effect  directly embedded in the royalties that Believe received from its digital partners  went negative in Q1’23. The dragging effect was limited in Q1’23 (c. -1.0%) but represented a headwind to organic growth estimated at around -6.5% in Q2’23 (-3.6% for H1’23) significantly above Group’s anticipation and mainly impacting Premium Solutions’ organic growth. Restated from this currency impact  organic growth of digital sales would have been around +20.5% in Q2’23 and c. +21.6% in H1’23. The Group continued to increase its digital market share at the same pace throughout H1’23 with stable gains quarter-over-quarter  enabling Premium Solutions to further strengthen their positions notably in Asia and Europe.Premium Solutions driving organic growth  Automated Solutions revenue growth enhanced by SentricDigital Music Sales4 (DMS) amounted to €584.4 million in H1’23  reflecting double digit growth in Premium Solutions offset by lower DMS at TuneCore.In Premium Solutions  revenues amounted to €388.5 million  up c. +18% (at current and organic growth rate)  resulting from a strong organic growth in Q1’23 (+23.8%) and a solid Q2’23 (+13.2%). The positive perimeter effect related to Sentric integration was fully offset by a negative forex impact related to the Turkish lira  as mentioned above. Digital organic monetization was further affected by negative currency impacts as explained above  while presenting the same trends throughout the semester (resilient paid streaming  additional market share gains and lower growth in ad-funded monetization).Automated Solutions revenues amounted to €26.9 million up by +17.1% in H1’23  reflecting +11.2% in Q1’23 and +22.9% in Q2’23. Non-digital sales recorded a significant increase driven by the integration of Sentric self-served activities  which added +8.4% of revenue growth in H1’23 (+16.6% in Q2’23  first quarter of integration). Digital revenues grew single digit in Q2’23 after being slightly above +10% in Q1’23. Organic growth amounted to +8.6% in Q2’23  but revenue also embedded negative forex related to the weakening of the dollar versus the euro. This relative slowdown was expected as TuneCore increased its exposure to ad-funded monetization with the introduction of the Discovery Plan in November’21  which reported a strong traction in H1’22 and notably in Q2’22. The new Unlimited Pricing plan  introduced in June’22 continues to have a positive effect on new customers acquisition but with a lower ARPU (average revenue per user)  affecting the revenue growth rate.Strong growth in Asia-Pacific / Africa  Americas and Europein € million H1 2022 H1 2023 Change YoY Europe (excl.

The Group remained on a strong growth trajectory in Southern Europe and Eastern Europe. The UK was also very dynamic and positively impacted by the integration of Sentric in Q2’23  while the level of activity remained sustained in Italy. Revenue growth in Turkey was affected by the depreciation of the Turkish lira versus the euro  while other markets continued to progress.In H1’23  revenue growth reached +23.6% in Asia Pacific and Africa  which represented 27.0% of Group revenues. The market environment remained dynamic throughout the semester  but ad-funded streaming revenues remained depressed. Digital monetization was also affected by negative currency headwinds directly embedded in the royalties paid out by digital partners in Q2’23  affecting the overall performance. Consequently  India and Southeast Asia recorded lower growth in Q2 versus Q1  while the level of activity in Japan and Greater China remained very strong.Americas grew by +21.7% and represented 14.6% of Group revenues. The level of activity in Brazil and Mexico was strong throughout the semester. TuneCore remained on its positive trajectory  but the weakening of the dollar and less favorable comparison basis dragged on its overall performance.In France  revenues increased by +12.0% in H1’23 and represented 16.0% of Group revenues. The Group confirmed its position as a key player in France and its capacity to better and further develop artists and labels at any stage of their career. Digital revenues returned to double digit growth in Q2’23 after growing single digit in Q1’23 and Believe succeeded in growing its digital market share. Non-digital sales were however lower than in H1’22  which had been boosted by the massive concert in Marseille of top artist Jul in June’22.In Germany  revenues increased by +0.5% in H1’23 and represented 13.0% of Group revenues. Digital sales were less dynamic at the end of the quarter  but the Group had successes in developing artists in digital genres. The recent joint venture with Madizin started its commercial roll-out with promising signings. Revenues remained  however  affected by the exit from contracts that were too heavy in physical sales.Strong increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin illustrating control on investments and operating leverageBelieve adapted its investment pace to the growth level and focused on further improving efficiency in H1’23. The Group continued investing in local teams to fuel its future revenue growth  adding sourcing and servicing capabilities in its key markets  but at a slower pace to manage investments. The focus on efficiency had positive outcomes  notably at the Central Platform level.Adjusted EBITDA pre-Central Platform costs5 grew by +30.0% in H1’23 to reach €61.7 million (versus €47.5 million in H1’22). Believe pursued its investment strategy in H1’23 to support its profitable growth plan. The Group deployed additional sourcing and servicing capabilities in Premium Solutions  while introducing new features and functionalities on the TuneCore platform. Investments were  in parallel  closely monitored and adapted to the level of growth in each market. As a result  the Adjusted EBITDA margin pre-Central Platform reached 14.9%  an increase of 140bps compared with H1’22. This margin included growth investments in both segments  which represented 4.4% of total revenues in H1’23 (vs 5.4% in H1’22).Central Platform costs (€37.5 million in H1’23 versus €35.7 million in H1’22) increased by +4.9% year-over-year  but further decreased over revenue representing 9.0% in H1’23 compared with 10.1% in H1’22. Efficiency plans enabled the Group to optimize its investments in the Central Platform and some secondary investment projects were delayed. Believe continued deploying more spending in data analysis and digital marketing  and further developed AI-backed tools for discovery and audience development solutions. The planned decline in Central Platform costs over revenue provided solid operating leverage in H1’23.As for previous years  some Central Platform investments are capitalized under IFRS accounting principles. In H1’23  total investment (P&L and capitalized costs) in the Central Platform amounted to €45.3 million. Total investment went up +3.8% year-over-year and represented 10.9% of total Group revenues compared with 12.4% in H1’22.The Group’s Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled in H1’23 to reach €24.2 million compared with €11.7 million in H1’22. Adjusted EBITDA margin stood at 5.8% in H1’23 compared with 3.3% in H1’22 thanks to the Adjusted EBITDA margin increase at the segment level and better amortization of Central Platform and was consequently at the mid-term objective level (Group adjusted EBITDA margin of 5% to 7% by 2025).Positive operating income (EBIT)Depreciation & Amortization amounted to €21.2 million in H1’23  roughly stable compared with H1’22 (€20.2 million)  as the acquisition strategy was put on hold last year and resumed only in Q1’23. Acquisitions have been the main driver for the past D&A increases reported by the Group. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA combined with D&A stability resulted in a positive EBIT of €1.0 million.Free cash flow reflecting commercial dynamism and solid cash level at the end of June’23Working capital variation was negative by €42.9 million  reflecting higher artist and label advances that grew by €75.7 million compared with the end of December’22. The growing attractiveness of Believe toward Tier 1 labels and top artists and in a wider variety of music genres enabled the Group to sign longer-term contracts  to deepen its relationships with existing roster and to further add large-sized newcomers. Those signings support greater revenue generation  while economic terms of the advances improved  therefore increasing potential returns. Current activity extracted €32.8 million of cash from working capital in H1’23  partially compensating for the elevated level of advances.Free cash flow was negative by €32.9 million in H1’23  reflecting negative working capital variation. Capex amounted to €18.4 million and represented 4.4% of Group revenue  compared with €11.6 million or 3.3% of Group revenue in H1’22  with stable capitalized costs.Cash on the balance sheet amounted to €210.2 million at the end of June’23 compared with €263.4 million at the end of June’22 and €303.3 million at the end of December’22  mostly reflecting the acquisition of Sentric and higher artist and label advances.In the current environment  which remains fluid and challenging  the Group will continue to manage its cash and is likely to further allocate cash to advances over acquisitions in the next few months  opting for opportunities with greater return (historical average ROI of advances paid to labels: 31%) and revenue growth prospects.FY 2023 OUTLOOK AND MID-TERM OBJECTIVESIn H2’23  the Group will continue to drive a profitable growth trajectory towards its long-term profitability objective of 15% Adjusted EBITDA margin. The Group is organized to deliver such profitable growth in a degraded economic environment impacting ad-funded streaming activities and currency rates.With regards to H1’23 performance and current environment  the Group revised its initial growth scenario presented in March’23 at FY earnings presentation  which now includes a less favorable currency environment in H2’23 than initially anticipated  which will impact digital monetization (c. -9% currency impact embedded in the revenues from digital partners estimated for H2’23). The growth scenario also implies further increase and deployment of paid streaming  additional market share gains  and no recovery in ad-funded streaming monetization. Consequently  Believe revised its expectations of FY’23 organic growth and now anticipates around +14% for the Group (versus +18% initially expected). Restated from those currency impacts  organic growth would represent c. +19.5%. This would represent an organic CAGR of c. +22.6% for the period 2021-2023.Believe will keep investing in the Central Platform in H2’23 at the same controlled level as in H1’23  further driving improved amortization of associated costs. The Group adapted its investment pace to the growth level with success  while improving efficiency across the organization in H1’23 and intends to pursue those actions in H2’23. As a result  Believe revised its expectations of Adjusted EBITDA margin and now anticipates c. 5.5% in FY’23 (versus 5.0% initially anticipated).In H1’23  the Group’s track record and quality of service attracted an increased number of established and top artists and Tier 1 labels  leading the Group to allocate more cash to advances given their attractive returns and strong support to future long-term growth. This trend is likely to continue in H2’23  as the Group is in a good position to sign longer-term contracts offering attractive returns in a wider variety of music genres and in more geographies. Given the level of economic uncertainty  which remains high  the Group is actively managing its investments policy  between new hirings  new advances and M&A. After the acquisition of Sentric in March’23  which is expected to add around 3% of revenue growth on a full year basis with a neutral impact on Adjusted EBITDA margin after accounting for integration costs  the Group will continue identifying interesting acquisition targets but will remain highly selective in seizing opportunities.Believe now anticipates a higher level of advances during the year  while working capital extraction will be negatively impacted by the currency translation effects that are affecting digital monetization. In this context  the Group is now anticipating a negative free cash flow for FY’23 nevertheless showing improvement versus H1’23.Notwithstanding the current environment  the Group is on track to deliver on its medium-term trajectory communicated at the IPO  including a 2021-2025 CAGR of between +22% and +25% and a Group Adjusted EBITDA of 5%-7% by 2025  implying a segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%-16% (which is a ""high growth period"" margin  as the revenue growth is partially reinvested). Believe reiterates its confidence in its ability to achieve its long-term target of at least 15% Group Adjusted EBITDA margin.The interim earnings report is available on our investor website: Investors | BelieveWebcast:We will host a webcast https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/w2fuyhpt and conference call starting at 6:30 p.m. CET (5:30 p.m. GMT) today.

These factors led to an increase in our outlook for the back half of the year ” said Joe Russell  President and Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to invest in the industry’s leading digital platform and our operating model  while enhancing and growing our portfolio. As evidenced by our recent $2.2 billion Simply Self Storage acquisition  we remain uniquely positioned to deliver growth and value to our stakeholders.”Highlights for the Three Months Ended June 30  2023Reported net income allocable to common shareholders of $3.00 per diluted share.Reported core FFO allocable to common shareholders (“Core FFO”) of $4.28 per diluted share  an increase of 7.3% relative to the same period in 2022. Core FFO per diluted share increased 11.5% compared to the same period in 2022  excluding the contribution from our equity investment in PS Business Parks  Inc.  which we sold in July 2022.Increased Same Store (as defined below) direct net operating income by 6.2%  resulting from a 6.3% increase in Same Store revenues.Achieved 80.3% Same Store direct net operating income margin.Acquired eleven self-storage facilities with 0.9 million net rentable square feet for $144.0 million. Subsequent to June 30  2023  we acquired or were under contract to acquire eleven self-storage facilities with 0.8 million net rentable square feet  for $118.2 million. In addition  on July 24  2023  we entered into a definitive agreement with Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust  Inc. (“BREIT”) to acquire BREIT Simply Storage LLC  a self-storage company that owns and operates 127 self-storage facilities (9.4 million square feet) and manages 25 self-storage facilities (1.8 million square feet) for third parties  for a cash acquisition price of $2.2 billion (the “Simply Acquisition”).Completed various expansion projects with 0.2 million net rentable square feet costing $19.1 million. At June 30  2023  we had various facilities in development and expansion with 4.8 million net rentable square feet estimated to cost $1.0 billion.On July 24  2023  in connection with the Simply Acquisition  issued $2.2 billion of unsecured senior notes in 2-  5.5-  10-  and 30-year tranches bearing annual rates of Compounded SOFR + 0.60%  5.125%  5.100%  and 5.350%  respectively.Operating Results for the Three Months Ended June 30  2023For the three months ended June 30  2023  net income allocable to our common shareholders was $528.3 million or $3.00 per diluted common share  compared to $603.4 million or $3.42 per diluted common share for the same period in 2022  representing a decrease of $75.1 million or $0.42 per diluted common share. The decrease is due primarily to (i) a $102.8 million decrease in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable and (ii) a $39.0 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities due to the sale of our equity investment in PSB in July 2022  partially offset by (iii) a $63.1 million increase in self-storage net operating income.The $63.1 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the three months ended June 30  2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 is a result of a $41.4 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $21.7 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 6.3% or $51.1 million in the three months ended June 30  2023 as compared to the same period in 2022  due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot  partially offset by a decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 5.2% or $9.7 million in the three months ended June 30  2023 as compared to the same period in 2022  due primarily to increased property tax expense and marketing expense. The increase in net operating income of $21.7 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and 2022 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Operating Results for the Six Months Ended June 30  2023For the six months ended June 30  2023  net income allocable to our common shareholders was $995.8 million or $5.65 per diluted common share  compared to $1 067.5 million or $6.05 per diluted common share for the same period in 2022  representing a decrease of $71.7 million or $0.40 per diluted common share. The decrease is due primarily to (i) a $165.1 million decrease in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable and (ii) a $76.4 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities due to our sale of PSB in July 2022  partially offset by (iii) a $155.2 million increase in self-storage net operating income and (iv) a $23.4 million increase in interest and other income.The $155.2 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the six months ended June 30  2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 is a result of a $105.7 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $49.5 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 8.0% or $126.5 million in the six months ended June 30  2023 as compared to the same period in 2022  due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot  partially offset by a decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 5.4% or $20.7 million in the six months ended June 30  2023 as compared to the same period in 2022  due primarily to increased property tax expense  repairs and maintenance expenses  marketing expense  and other direct property costs. The increase in net operating income of $49.5 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and 2022 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Funds from OperationsFunds from Operations (“FFO”) and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by Nareit. We believe that FFO and FFO per share are useful to REIT investors and analysts in measuring our performance because Nareit’s definition of FFO excludes items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating and financial performance. FFO represents net income before depreciation and amortization  which is excluded because it is based upon historical costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time  while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FFO also excludes gains or losses on sale of real estate assets and real estate impairment charges  which are also based upon historical costs and are impacted by historical depreciation. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends  because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition  other REITs may compute these measures differently  so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.For the three months ended June 30  2023  FFO was $4.29 per diluted common share as compared to $4.58 for the same period in 2022  representing a decrease of 6.3%.For the six months ended June 30  2023  FFO was $8.24 per diluted common share  as compared to $8.41 in the same period in 2022  representing a decrease of 2.0%.We also present “Core FFO” and “Core FFO per share ” non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing  with respect to the periods presented below  the impact of contingency resolution  due diligence costs incurred in pursuit of strategic transactions  unrealized gain on private equity investments  and our equity share of deferred tax benefits of a change in tax status and severance of a senior executive from our equity investees. We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance  and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However  Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO or Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such measures  Core FFO and Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.The following table reconciles net income to FFO and Core FFO and reconciles diluted earnings per share to FFO per share and Core FFO per share (unaudited):Three Months Ended June 30  Six Months Ended June 30  2023 2022 PercentageChange 2023 2022 PercentageChange (Amounts in thousands  except per share data) Reconciliation of Net Income to FFO and Core FFO: Net income allocable to common shareholders $ 528 259 $ 603 381 (12.5 )% $ 995 847 $ 1 067 505 (6.7 )% Eliminate items excluded from FFO: Depreciation and amortization 220 971 217 373 440 758 438 168 Depreciation from unconsolidated real estate investments 9 155 17 566 17 684 34 386 Depreciation allocated to noncontrolling interests and restricted share unitholders (1 732 ) (1 533 ) (3 205 ) (3 190 ) Gains on sale of real estate investments  including our equity share from investments (72 ) (29 306 ) (72 ) (53 184 ) FFO allocable to common shares $ 756 581 $ 807 481 (6.3 )% $ 1 451 012 $ 1 483 685 (2.2 )% Eliminate the impact of items excluded from Core FFO  including our equity share from investments: Foreign currency exchange loss (gain) 1 096 (101 723 ) 27 956 (137 100 ) Other items (4 093 ) (1 781 ) (6 226 ) 766 Core FFO allocable to common shares $ 753 584 $ 703 977 7.0 % $ 1 472 742 $ 1 347 351 9.3 % Reconciliation of Diluted Earnings per Share to FFO per Share and Core FFO per Share: Diluted earnings per share $ 3.00 $ 3.42 (12.3 )% $ 5.65 $ 6.05 (6.6 )% Eliminate amounts per share excluded from FFO: Depreciation and amortization 1.29 1.32 2.59 2.66 Gains on sale of real estate investments  including our equity share from investments — (0.16 ) — (0.30 ) FFO per share $ 4.29 $ 4.58 (6.3 )% $ 8.24 $ 8.41 (2.0 )% Eliminate the per share impact of items excluded from Core FFO  including our equity share from investments: Foreign currency exchange loss (gain) 0.01 (0.58 ) 0.16 (0.78 ) Other items (0.02 ) (0.01 ) (0.04 ) 0.01 Core FFO per share $ 4.28 $ 3.99 7.3 % $ 8.36 $ 7.64 9.4 % Exclude the contribution from our equity investment in PS Business Parks  Inc. to Core FFO per share — (0.15 ) — (0.30 ) Core FFO per share  excluding the impact of PS Business Parks  Inc. $ 4.28 $ 3.84 11.5 % $ 8.36 $ 7.34 13.9 % Diluted weighted average common shares 176 212 176 312 176 181 176 325Property Operations – Same Store FacilitiesThe Same Store Facilities consist of facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy  revenues  and cost of operations since January 1  2021. The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2021  2022  and 2023 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities  which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. However  because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such a measure  Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. The following table summarizes the historical operating results (for all periods presented) of these 2 344 facilities (155.2 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 75% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at June 30  2023 (unaudited):Three Months Ended June 30  Six Months Ended June 30  2023 2022 Change 2023 2022 Change (Dollar amounts in thousands  except for per square foot data) Revenues (a): Rental income $ 836 124 $ 788 684 6.0 % $ 1 655 058 $ 1 535 817 7.8 % Late charges and administrative fees 28 381 24 738 14.7 % 56 615 49 393 14.6 % Total revenues 864 505 813 422 6.3 % 1 711 673 1 585 210 8.0 % Direct cost of operations (a): Property taxes 77 211 74 504 3.6 % 153 895 147 562 4.3 % On-site property manager payroll 31 514 30 575 3.1 % 64 044 62 320 2.8 % Repairs and maintenance 14 665 13 679 7.2 % 32 676 29 588 10.4 % Utilities 10 067 10 611 (5.1 )% 22 633 22 561 0.3 % Marketing 14 469 9 086 59.2 % 30 022 20 805 44.3 % Other direct property costs 22 073 20 911 5.6 % 45 297 41 641 8.8 % Total direct cost of operations 169 999 159 366 6.7 % 348 567 324 477 7.4 % Direct net operating income (b) 694 506 654 056 6.2 % 1 363 106 1 260 733 8.1 % Indirect cost of operations (a): Supervisory payroll (8 502 ) (9 059 ) (6.1 )% (17 700 ) (18 979 ) (6.7 )% Centralized management costs (15 211 ) (14 440 ) 5.3 % (31 108 ) (31 203 ) (0.3 )% Share-based compensation (2 731 ) (3 880 ) (29.6 )% (5 870 ) (7 868 ) (25.4 )% Net operating income (c) $ 668 062 $ 626 677 6.6 % $ 1 308 428 $ 1 202 683 8.8 % Gross margin (before indirect costs  depreciation and amortization expense) 80.3 % 80.4 % (0.1 )% 79.6 % 79.5 % 0.1 % Gross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense) 77.3 % 77.0 % 0.4 % 76.4 % 75.9 % 0.7 % Weighted average for the period: Square foot occupancy 93.7 % 95.7 % (2.1 )% 93.5 % 95.6 % (2.2 )% Realized annual rental income per (d): Occupied square foot $ 22.99 $ 21.23 8.3 % $ 22.82 $ 20.69 10.3 % Available square foot $ 21.54 $ 20.32 6.0 % $ 21.33 $ 19.79 7.8 % At June 30: Square foot occupancy 93.2 % 94.8 % (1.7 )% Annual contract rent per occupied square foot (e) $ 23.34 $ 21.80 7.1 %(a) Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sales and expenses generated at the facilities. (b) Direct net operating income (“Direct NOI”)  a subtotal within NOI  is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll  centralized management costs  and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense. We utilize direct net operating income in evaluating property performance and in evaluating property operating trends as compared to our competitors. (c) See attached reconciliation of self-storage NOI to net income. (d) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency  and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition  the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts  which reduce rental income. (e) Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in  and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis  such as late charges and administrative fees  does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts  and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible.Property Operations – Non-Same Store FacilitiesIn addition to the 2 344 Same Store Facilities  we have 544 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies  revenues  or cost of operations since January 1  2021 or that we did not own as of January 1  2021  including 322 facilities that were acquired  49 newly developed facilities  87 facilities that have been expanded or are targeted for expansion  and 86 facilities that are unstabilized because they are undergoing fill-up or were damaged in casualty events (collectively  the “Non-Same Store Facilities”). Operating data  metrics  and further commentary with respect to these facilities  including detail by vintage  are included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under “Analysis of Net Income – Self-Storage Operations” in our June 30  2023 Form 10-Q.Investing and Capital ActivitiesDuring the three months ended June 30  2023  we closed the acquisition of eleven self-storage facilities (seven in South Carolina and one each in Florida  Massachusetts  North Carolina  and Virginia) with 0.9 million net rentable square feet for $144.0 million. During the six months ended June 30  2023  we closed the acquisition of 16 self-storage facilities (seven in South Carolina  two each in Florida and Virginia  and one each in Idaho  Kentucky  Massachusetts  Michigan  and North Carolina) with 1.2 million net rentable square feet for $190.8 million.On July 24  2023  we entered into a definitive agreement with BREIT to acquire BREIT Simply Storage LLC  a self-storage company that owns and operates 127 self-storage facilities (9.4 million square feet) and manages 25 self-storage facilities (1.8 million square feet) for third parties  for a cash acquisition price of $2.2 billion. The 127 wholly-owned facilities are geographically diversified across 18 states and located in markets with population growth that has been approximately double the national average since 2018. Approximately 65% of the facilities are located in high-growth Sunbelt markets. The acquisition  which is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  is currently expected to close in the third quarter of 2023.Subsequent to June 30  2023  we acquired or were under contract to acquire eleven self-storage facilities across six states with 0.8 million net rentable square feet  for $118.2 million.During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 48 properties (4.1 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of ezStorage for $1.8 billion. As of June 30  2023  we have completed the expansion projects on four facilities of this portfolio for $26.4 million  adding 169 000 net rentable square feet of storage space. These facilities generated revenues of $51.7 million  NOI of $40.4 million (including Direct NOI of $41.7 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 85.7% for the six months ended June 30  2023.During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 56 properties (7.5 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of All Storage for $1.5 billion. These facilities generated revenues of $43.1 million  NOI of $27.4 million (including Direct NOI of $28.9 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 78.6% for the six months ended June 30  2023.During the three months ended June 30  2023  we completed various expansion projects (0.2 million net rentable square feet in California) costing $19.1 million. During the six months ended June 30  2023  we opened three newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects (0.6 million net rentable square feet – 0.2 million in California and 0.1 million each in Florida  Maryland  New Jersey  and Pennsylvania) costing $84.4 million.

For context  always refer to the full article.MANILA  Philippines – Aboitiz Equity Ventures (AEV) and Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP) submitted a proposal to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines (CCBP) at an enterprise value of $1.8 billion (around P99 billion) on a debt-free  cash-free basis.In a statement on Wednesday  August 2  the two companies said the non-binding letter of intent was given to The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC). This arrangement means that the main terms and conditions have been presented  but parties can still walk away from the deal.The debt-free  cash-free basis of the transaction means that AEV and CCEP would not assume any of the debts on TCCC’s balance sheet  or get to keep any leftover cash.Should the deal push through  a 60-40 ownership structure between AEV and CCEP would be implemented. The buyout also means that TCCC would be fully divesting from its bottling operations in the Philippines.The potential transaction is expected to close around the end of 2023  subject to regulatory approvals  including clearance from the Philippine Competition Commission.“If completed  the proposed acquisition would build on AEV’s portfolio diversification strategy to enter the branded consumer goods space and on CCEP’s successful expansion into the Asia-Pacific region via its acquisition of Coca-Cola Amatil in 2021. AEV would be well-positioned to support CCBP’s growth ambition given the synergies that can be generated from AEV’s other businesses ” AEV said.Coca-Cola currently has 73 production lines and 19 plants across the Philippines  and services over 1 million outlets. It has over 9 000 employees.Aside from making soft drinks  Coca-Cola is also the company behind products like Lemon-Dou  Minute Maid  Nutri Boost  Powerade  and Wilkins.AEV is one of the leading conglomerates in the Philippines with interests in power  banking and financial services  food  infrastructure  land  and data science and artificial intelligence.CCEP is one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world  serving 600 million consumers and catering to 1.75 million businesses across 29 countries. It is listed on Euronext Amsterdam  the Nasdaq  Global Select Market  London Stock Exchange  and the Spanish Stock Exchanges.Shares of AEV fell sharply by 4.5% on Wednesday. – Rappler.com$1 = P55.14,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.02,mixed,0.31,0.25,0.45,True,English,"['Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines', 'foreign partner', 'Aboitiz', 'talks', 'leading consumer goods companies', 'consumer goods space', 'Aboitiz Equity Ventures', 'debt-free, cash-free basis', '60-40 ownership structure', 'Philippine Competition Commission', 'portfolio diversification strategy', 'Global Select Market', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Spanish Stock Exchanges', 'Coca-Cola Europacific Partners', 'The Coca-Cola Company', 'Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines', 'two companies', 'leading conglomerates', 'Coca-Cola Amatil', 'full article', 'enterprise value', 'non-binding letter', 'main terms', 'balance sheet', 'leftover cash', 'bottling operations', 'regulatory approvals', 'successful expansion', 'Asia-Pacific region', 'growth ambition', 'other businesses', '73 production lines', '1 million outlets', 'soft drinks', 'Minute Maid', 'Nutri Boost', 'data science', 'artificial intelligence', '600 million consumers', '1.75 million businesses', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'potential transaction', 'financial services', 'summarization', 'errors', 'context', 'MANILA', 'AEV', 'CCEP', 'proposal', 'CCBP', 'statement', 'Wednesday', 'intent', 'TCCC', 'arrangement', 'conditions', 'parties', 'deal', 'debts', 'buyout', 'end', 'clearance', 'acquisition', 'synergies', '19 plants', '9,000 employees', 'products', 'Lemon-Dou', 'Powerade', 'Wilkins', 'interests', 'banking', 'food', 'infrastructure', 'land', 'world', '29 countries', 'Nasdaq', 'Shares', 'Rappler']",2023-08-02,2023-08-03,rappler.com
