When viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition  we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below as adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative to  GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures  since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We strongly recommend that investors review the GAAP financial measures and additional non-GAAP information included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q  including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.Adjusted operating expenses  adjusted operating income  adjusted operating margin  adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders  adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below  which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance  and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions  except for per share amounts):Adjusted Operating Income  Operating Margin and Operating Expense Reconciliation (In millions) (Unaudited) ExchangesSegment Fixed Incomeand DataServicesSegment MortgageTechnologySegment Consolidated Six MonthsEndedJune 30  Six MonthsEndedJune 30  Six MonthsEndedJune 30  Six MonthsEndedJune 30  2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 Total revenues  less transaction-based expenses $2 190 $2 088 $1 109 $1 021 $485 $604 $3 784 $3 713 Operating expenses 631 603 699 692 530 557 1 860 1 852 Less: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 33 33 85 93 183 180 301 306 Less: Transaction and integration costs — — — — 46 60 46 60 Less: Other 17 — — — — — 17 — Adjusted operating expenses $581 $570 $614 $599 $301 $317 $1 496 $1 486 Operating income/(loss) $1 559 $1 485 $410 $329 $(45) $47 $1 924 $1 861 Adjusted operating income $1 609 $1 518 $495 $422 $184 $287 $2 288 $2 227 Operating margin 71% 71% 37% 32% (9)% 8% 51% 50% Adjusted operating margin 73% 73% 45% 41% 38% 47% 60% 60%Adjusted Operating Income  Operating Margin and Operating Expense Reconciliation (In millions) (Unaudited) ExchangesSegment Fixed Incomeand DataServicesSegment MortgageTechnologySegment Consolidated Three MonthsEndedJune 30  Three MonthsEndedJune 30  Three MonthsEndedJune 30  Three MonthsEndedJune 30  2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 Total revenues  less transaction-based expenses $1 093 $1 005 $546 $512 $249 $297 $1 888 $1 814 Operating expenses 311 304 356 338 266 303 933 945 Less: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 17 17 43 44 91 92 151 153 Less: Transaction and integration costs — — — — 25 52 25 52 Less: Other 1 — — — — — 1 — Adjusted operating expenses $293 $287 $313 $294 $150 $159 $756 $740 Operating income/(loss) $782 $701 $190 $174 $(17) $(6) $955 $869 Adjusted operating income $800 $718 $233 $218 $99 $138 $1 132 $1 074 Operating margin 72% 70% 35% 34% (7)% (2)% 51% 48% Adjusted operating margin 73% 71% 43% 43% 40% 46% 60% 59%Adjusted Net Income Attributable to ICE and Diluted EPS (In millions) (Unaudited) Six MonthsEnded June 30 2023 Six MonthsEnded June 30 2022 Net income attributable to ICE $ 1 454 $ 1 212 Add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 301 306 Add: Transaction and integration costs 46 60 Add/(Less): Net interest (income)/expense on pre-acquisition-related debt and debt extinguishment (12 ) 48 Less: Gain on sale of Euroclear equity investment and dividends received — (41 ) Add: Net losses from unconsolidated investees 65 57 Add: Other 17 9 Less: Income tax effect for the above items (112 ) (123 ) Add/(Less): Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles (85 ) 15 Less: Other tax adjustments (81 ) — Adjusted net income attributable to ICE $ 1 593 $ 1 543 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.59 $ 2.16 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 2.84 $ 2.75 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 561 562Adjusted Net Income Attributable to ICE and Diluted EPS (In millions) (Unaudited) Three MonthsEnded June 30 2023 Three MonthsEnded June 30 2022 Net income attributable to ICE $ 799 $ 555 Add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 151 153 Add: Transaction and integration costs 25 52 Add/(Less): Net interest (income)/expense on pre-acquisition-related debt and debt extinguishment (6 ) 48 Less: Gain on sale of Euroclear equity investment and dividends received — (41 ) Add: Net losses from unconsolidated investees 30 15 Add: Other 1 — Less: Income tax effect for the above items (55 ) (65 ) Add/(Less): Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles (86 ) 22 Less: Other tax adjustments (57 ) — Adjusted net income attributable to ICE $ 802 $ 739 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.42 $ 0.99 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 1.43 $ 1.32 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 561 560Adjusted Free Cash Flow Calculation (In millions) (Unaudited) Six Months EndedJune 30  2023 Six Months EndedJune 30  2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $1 805 $1 725 Less: Capital expenditures (61 ) (70 ) Less: Capitalized software development costs (142 ) (134 ) Free cash flow 1 602 1 521 Add/(Less): Section 31 fees  net 50 (115 ) Adjusted free cash flow $1 652 $1 406About Intercontinental ExchangeIntercontinental Exchange  Inc.

Group revenues contracted due to the decline in the net interest margin in France and in market activities’ revenues against a backdrop of gradual normalisation after some particularly favourable years. Operating expenses were contained despite persistent inflationary trends. The cost of risk was very low  reflecting the quality of our origination and our loan portfolio. The Group shows a solid balance sheet with a CET1 ratio at 13.1% and a robust liquidity profile. In addition  we pursued the execution of our ongoing strategic projects  notably the closing of the LeasePlan acquisition by ALD. The new management team has been fully operational since taking office on 24 May this year and is working to prepare the next chapter of the Group’s strategy. I will have the pleasure of presenting the new strategic and financial roadmap on 18 September at our Capital Markets Day to be held in London.”GROUP CONSOLIDATED RESULTSIn EURm Q2 23 Q2 22 Change H1 23 H1 22 Change Net bankingincome 6 287 6 901 -8.9% -10.3%* 12 958 13 944 -7.1% -6.8%* Underlying net bankingincome(1) 6 527 6 901 -5.4% -6.8%* 13 198 13 944 -5.3% -5.0%* Operating expenses (4 441) (4 325) +2.7% +1.1%* (9 498) (9 456) +0.4% +0.7%* Underlying operating expenses(1) (4 461) (4 450) +0.2% -1.3%* (8 662) (8 598) +0.7% +1.0%* Gross operating income 1 846 2 576 -28.3% -29.6%* 3 460 4 488 -22.9% -22.6%* Underlyinggross operating income(1) 2 066 2 451 -15.7% -16.8%* 4 536 5 346 -15.2% -14.7%* Net cost of risk (166) (217) -23.5% -23.2%* (348) (778) -55.3% -40.9%* Operating income 1 680 2 359 -28.8% -30.2%* 3 112 3 710 -16.1% -19.8%* Underlying operating income(1) 1 900 2 234 -14.9% -16.2%* 4 188 4 568 -8.3% -11.5%* Net profits or losses from other assets (81) (3 292) +97.5% +97.5%* (98) (3 290) +97.0% +97.0%* Underlying net profits or losses from other assets(1) (2) 11 n/s +0. n/s* (19) 13 n/s .n/s Income tax (425) (327) +29.9% +29.9%* (753) (660) +14.1% +7.8%* Net income 1 181 (1 256) n/s n/s 2 273 (236) n/s n/s O.w. non-controlling interests 281 255 +10.2% +1.9%* 505 454 +11.2% +6.9%* Reported Group net income 900 (1 511) n/s n/s 1 768 (690) n/s n/s Underlying Group net income(1) 1 159 1 481 -21.7% -22.1%* 2 667 3 019 -11.7% -14.5%* ROE 4.9% -12.1% 4.9% -3.5% +0.0% +0.0%* ROTE 5.6% -13.7% 5.6% -4.0% +0.0% +0.0%* Underlying ROTE(1) 7.6% 10.2% 9.1% 10.5% +0.0% +0.0%*Societe Generale’s Board of Directors  which met on 2 August 2023 under the chairmanship of Lorenzo Bini Smaghi  examined the Societe Generale Group’s results for Q2 23 and for the first half of 2023.The various restatements enabling the transition from underlying data to published data are presented in the Methodology notes in Section 9.5.Net banking incomeNet banking income decreased in Q2 23 by -8.9% (-10.3%*) vs. Q2 22  largely due to the decline in the net interest margin in French Retail Banking  a less conducive market environment in Global Banking and Investor Solutions activities and the booking of one-off items under Corporate Centre.French Retail Banking revenues fell by -13.6% vs. Q2 22 owing mainly to the decrease in the net interest margin  despite solid momentum in fees  a record performance from Private Banking and a strong increase in Boursorama’s revenues.Revenues in International Retail Banking & Financial Services grew by +6.3% (+0.9%*) vs. Q2 22  with a +3.3%* increase in revenues vs. Q2 22 in International Retail Banking  a strong performance by Financial Services that was driven by ALD revenues  up +18.7% vs. Q2 22 following the integration of LeasePlan  and by insurance revenues  which rose by +3.1%* vs. Q2 22.Global Banking & Investor Services registered revenues down -7.3% in Q2 23 relative to Q2 22 amid a less favourable market environment.

APPENDIX 2:METHODOLOGY1 - The financial information presented for the second quarter and first half 2023was examined by the Board of Directors on 2 August  2023 and has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union and applicable at that date. The limited review procedures on the condensed interim financial statements at 30 June 2023 carried by the Statutory Auditors are currently underway.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars’ net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document. The terms “Revenues” or “Net Banking Income” are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar’s net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses correspond to the “Operating Expenses” as presented in notes 5 and 8.2 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at December 31st  2022. The term “costs” is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document.4 - IFRIC 21 adjustmentThe IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e. a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed.The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (“SRF”) are part of IFRIC 21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU.5 – Exceptional items – Transition from accounting data to underlying dataIt may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment.Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar’s activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings.The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below:in EURm Q2 23 Q2 22 H1 23 H1 22 Exceptional Net banking income (+) 240 0 240 0 One-off items(1) 240 0 240 0 Exceptional operating expenses (-) (20) (125) 836 859 IFRIC linearisation (239) (284) 435 557 Transformation costs(1) 184 159 366 302 Of which related to French Retail Banking 122 97 262 201 Of which related to Global Banking & Investor Solutions 8 25 19 39 Of which related to Corporate Centre 54 37 85 62 One-off items 35 0 35 0 Exceptional Net profit or losses from other assets (+/-) 79 3 303 79 3 303 Net losses from the disposal of Russian activities(1) 0 3 303 0 3 303 Net losses from the disposal of ALD Russia(1) 79 0 79 0 Total exceptional items (pre-tax) 299 3 178 1 155 4 162 Total exceptional items (post-tax) 259 2 992 899 3 709 Reported Net income - Group Share 900 (1 511) 1 768 (690) Total exceptional items - Group share (post-tax) 259 2 992 899 3 709 Underlying Net income - Group Share 1 159 1 481 2 667 3 01976 - Cost of risk in basis points  coverage ratio for doubtful outstandingsThe cost of risk is defined on pages 42 and 691 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document.

This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (“doubtful”).7 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on page 43 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess Societe Generale’s return on equity and return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group’s businesses  according to the principles presented on page 43 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document.Group net income used for the ratio numerator is book Group net income adjusted for “interest net of tax payable on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  interest paid to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations” and “unrealised gains/losses booked under shareholders’ equity  excluding conversion reserves” (see methodology note No. 9). For ROTE  income is also restated for goodwill impairment.Details of the corrections made to book equity in order to calculate ROE and ROTE for the period are given in the table below:ROTE calculation: calculation methodologyEnd of period (in EURm) Q2 23 Q2 22 H1 23 H1 22 Shareholders' equity Group share 68 007 65 023 68 007 65 023 Deeply subordinated and undated subordinated notes (10 815) (8 683) (10 815) (8 683) Interest payable to holders of deeply & undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisation(1) (28) (8) (28) (8) OCI excluding conversion reserves 688 577 688 577 Distribution provision(2) (982) (1 193) (982) (1 193) Distribution N-1 to be paid (441) (914) (441) (914) ROE equity end-of-period 56 430 54 801 56 430 54 801 Average ROE equity 56 334 55 009 56 203 54 887 Average Goodwill (4 041) (3 646) (3 847) (3 636) Average Intangible Assets (3 117) (2 710) (2 997) (2 729) Average ROTE equity 49 176 48 653 49 359 48 522 Group net Income 900 (1 511) 1 768 (690) Interest paid and payable to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisation (216) (159) (379) (278) Cancellation of goodwill impairment - - - 2 Ajusted Group net Income 684 (1 670) 1 390 (966) Average ROTE equity 49 176 48 653 49 359 48 522 ROTE 5.6% -13.7% 5.6% -4.0% Underlying Group net income 1 159 1 481 2 667 3 019 Interest paid and payable to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisation (216) (159) (379) (278) Cancellation of goodwill impairment - - - 2 Ajusted Underlying Group net Income 943 1 322 2 288 2 743 Average ROTE equity (underlying) 49 435 51 645 50 257 52 231 Underlying ROTE 7.6% 10.2% 9.1% 10.5%RONE calculation: Average capital allocated to Core Businesses (in EURm)In EURm Q2 23 Q2 22 Change H1 23 H1 22 Change French Retail Banking 12 338 12 296 +0.3% 12 365 12 058 +2.5% International Retail Banking and Financial Services 10 310 10 565 -2.4% 11 510 10 795 +6.6% Global Banking and Investor Solutions 14 132 14 644 -3.5% 14 347 14 385 -0.3% Core Businesses 36 780 37 505 -1.9% 38 222 37 238 +2.6% Corporate Center 19 554 17 504 +11.7% 17 981 17 649 +1.9% Group 56 334 55 009 +2.4% 56 203 54 887 +2.4%88 - Net assets and tangible net assetsNet assets and tangible net assets are defined in the methodology  page 45 of the Group’s 2023 Universal Registration Document.

It is obtained in two steps:A first step aiming at reclassifying the items of the financial statements into aggregates allowing for a more economic reading of the balance sheet. Main reclassifications:Insurance: grouping of the accounting items related to insurance within a single aggregate in both assets and liabilities.Customer loans: include outstanding loans with customers (net of provisions and write-downs  including net lease financing outstanding and transactions at fair value through profit and loss); excludes financial assets reclassified under loans and receivables in accordance with the conditions stipulated by IFRS 9 (these positions have been reclassified in their original lines).Wholesale funding:Includes interbank liabilities and debt securities issued.Financing transactions have been allocated to medium/long-term resources and short-term resources based on the maturity of outstanding  more or less than one year.Reclassification under customer deposits of the share of issues placed by French Retail Banking networks (recorded in medium/long-term financing)  and certain transactions carried out with counterparties equivalent to customer deposits (previously included in short term financing).Deduction from customer deposits and reintegration into short-term financing of certain transactions equivalent to market resources.A second step aiming at excluding the contribution of insurance subsidiaries  and netting derivatives  repurchase agreements  securities borrowing/lending  accruals and “due to central banks”.The Group loan/deposit ratio is determined as the division of the customer loans by customer deposits as presented in the funded balance sheet.NB (1) The sum of values contained in the tables and analyses may differ slightly from the total reported due to rounding rules.(2) All the information on the results for the period (notably: press release  downloadable data  presentation slides and supplement) is available on Societe Generale’s website www.societegenerale.com in the “Investor” section.10.

Group revenues contracted due to the decline in the net interest margin in France and in market activities’ revenues against a backdrop of gradual normalisation after some particularly favourable years. Operating expenses were contained despite persistent inflationary trends. The cost of risk was very low  reflecting the quality of our origination and our loan portfolio. The Group shows a solid balance sheet with a CET 1 ratio at 13.1% and a robust liquidity profile. In addition  we pursued the execution of our ongoing strategic projects  notably the closing of the LeasePlan acquisition by ALD. The new management team has been fully operational since taking office on 24 May this year and is working to prepare the next chapter of the Group’s strategy. I will have the pleasure of presenting the new strategic and financial roadmap on 18 September at our Capital Markets Day to be held in London.”GROUP CONSOLIDATED RESULTSIn EURm Q2 23 Q2 22 Change H1 23 H1 22 Change Net banking income 6 287 6 901 -8.9% -10.3%* 12 958 13 944 -7.1% -6.8%* Underlying net banking income(1) 6 527 6 901 -5.4% -6.8%* 13 198 13 944 -5.3% -5.0%* Operating expenses (4 441) (4 325) +2.7% +1.1%* (9 498) (9 456) +0.4% +0.7%* Underlying operating expenses(1) (4 461) (4 450) +0.2% -1.3%* (8 662) (8 598) +0.7% +1.0%* Gross operating income 1 846 2 576 -28.3% -29.6%* 3 460 4 488 -22.9% -22.6%* Underlying gross operating income(1) 2 066 2 451 -15.7% -16.8%* 4 536 5 346 -15.2% -14.7%* Net cost of risk (166) (217) -23.5% -23.2%* (348) (778) -55.3% -40.9%* Operating income 1 680 2 359 -28.8% -30.2%* 3 112 3 710 -16.1% -19.8%* Underlying operating income(1) 1 900 2 234 -14.9% -16.2%* 4 188 4 568 -8.3% -11.5%* Net profits or losses from other assets (81) (3 292) +97.5% +97.5%* (98) (3 290) +97.0% +97.0%* Underlying net profits or losses from other assets(1) (2) 11 n/s +0. n/s* (19) 13 n/s . n/s Income tax (425) (327) +29.9% +29.9%* (753) (660) +14.1% +7.8%* Net income 1 181 (1 256) n/s n/s 2 273 (236) n/s n/s O.w. non-controlling interests 281 255 +10.2% +1.9%* 505 454 +11.2% +6.9%* Reported Group net income 900 (1 511) n/s n/s 1 768 (690) n/s n/s Underlying Group net income(1) 1 159 1 481 -21.7% -22.1%* 2 667 3 019 -11.7% -14.5%* ROE 4.9% -12.1% 4.9% -3.5% +0.0% +0.0%* ROTE 5.6% -13.7% 5.6% -4.0% +0.0% +0.0%* Underlying ROTE(1) 7.6% 10.2% 9.1% 10.5% +0.0% +0.0%*Societe Generale’s Board of Directors  which met on 2 August 2023 under the chairmanship of Lorenzo Bini Smaghi  examined the Societe Generale Group’s results for Q2 23 and for the first half of 2023.The various restatements enabling the transition from underlying data to published data are presented in the Methodology notes in Section 9.5.Net banking incomeNet banking income decreased in Q2 23 by -8.9% (-10.3%*) vs. Q2 22  largely due to the decline in the net interest margin in French Retail Banking  a less conducive market environment in Global Banking and Investor Solutions activities and the booking of one-off items under Corporate Centre.French Retail Banking revenues fell by -13.6% vs. Q2 22 owing mainly to the decrease in the net interest margin  despite solid momentum in fees  a record performance from Private Banking and a strong increase in Boursorama’s revenues.Revenues in International Retail Banking & Financial Services grew by +6.3% (+0.9%*) vs. Q2 22  with a +3.3%* increase in revenues vs. Q2 22 in International Retail Banking  a strong performance by Financial Services that was driven by ALD revenues  up +18.7% vs. Q2 22 following the integration of LeasePlan  and by insurance revenues  which rose by +3.1%* vs. Q2 22.Global Banking & Investor Services registered revenues down -7.3% in Q2 23 relative to Q2 22 amid a less favourable market environment. Global Markets & Investor Services recorded solid revenues but which were down in comparison to a very strong Q2 22 performance (-12.7%) owing to less conducive market conditions  notably in Fixed Income and Currencies (lower interest rate volatility and slower client activity)  while Financing and Advisory continued to post revenue growth  registering an increase of +4.0% vs. Q2 22  driven by a solid performance in the securitisation  investment banking and cash management activities.Over the first half of 2023  net banking income fell by -7.1% vs. H1 22 (-5.3% on an underlying basis).Operating expensesOn a reported basis  operating expenses came to EUR 4 441 million in Q2 23  up +2.7% vs. Q2 22.

APPENDIX 2: METHODOLOGY1 - The financial information presented for the second quarter and first half 2023 was examined by the Board of Directors on 2 August  2023 and has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union and applicable at that date. The limited review procedures on the condensed interim financial statements at 30 June 2023 carried by the Statutory Auditors are currently underway.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars’ net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document. The terms “Revenues” or “Net Banking Income” are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar’s net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses correspond to the “Operating Expenses” as presented in notes 5 and 8.2 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at December 31st  2022. The term “costs” is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document.4 - IFRIC 21 adjustmentThe IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e. a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed.The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (“SRF”) are part of IFRIC 21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU.5 – Exceptional items – Transition from accounting data to underlying dataIt may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment.Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar’s activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings.The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below:in EURm Q2 23 Q2 22 H1 23 H1 22 Exceptional Net banking income (+) 240 0 240 0 One-off items(1) 240 0 240 0 Exceptional operating expenses (-) (20) (125) 836 859 IFRIC linearisation (239) (284) 435 557 Transformation costs(1) 184 159 366 302 Of which related to French Retail Banking 122 97 262 201 Of which related to Global Banking & Investor Solutions 8 25 19 39 Of which related to Corporate Centre 54 37 85 62 One-off items 35 0 35 0 Exceptional Net profit or losses from other assets (+/-) 79 3 303 79 3 303 Net losses from the disposal of Russian activities(1) 0 3 303 0 3 303 Net losses from the disposal of ALD Russia(1) 79 0 79 0 Total exceptional items (pre-tax) 299 3 178 1 155 4 162 Total exceptional items (post-tax) 259 2 992 899 3 709 Reported Net income - Group Share 900 (1 511) 1 768 (690) Total exceptional items - Group share (post-tax) 259 2 992 899 3 709 Underlying Net income - Group Share 1 159 1 481 2 667 3 01976 - Cost of risk in basis points  coverage ratio for doubtful outstandingsThe cost of risk is defined on pages 42 and 691 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document. This indicator makes it possible to assess the level of risk of each of the pillars as a percentage of balance sheet loan commitments  including operating leases.In EURm Q2 23 Q2 22 H1 23 H1 22 French Retail BankingNet Cost Of Risk 109 21 198 68 Gross loan Outstandings 249 843 245 710 251 266 244 177 Cost of Risk in bp 18 3 16 6 International Retail Banking and Financial ServicesNet Cost Of Risk 83 97 174 422 Gross loan Outstandings 137 819 141 075 136 404 140 811 Cost of Risk in bp 24 28 26 60 Global Banking and Investor SolutionsNet Cost Of Risk (27) 69 (22) 263 Gross loan Outstandings 165 847 176 934 171 719 173 842 Cost of Risk in bp (7) 16 (3) 30 Corporate CentreNet Cost Of Risk 1 30 (2) 25 Gross loan Outstandings 18 873 14 943 17 705 14 678 Cost of Risk in bp 2 79 (2) 34 Societe Generale GroupNet Cost Of Risk 166 217 348 778 Gross loan Outstandings 572 382 578 662 577 093 573 508 Cost of Risk in bp 12 15 12 27The gross coverage ratio for doubtful outstandings is calculated as the ratio of provisions recognised in respect of the credit risk to gross outstandings identified as in default within the meaning of the regulations  without taking account of any guarantees provided. This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (“doubtful”).7 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on page 43 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess Societe Generale’s return on equity and return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group’s businesses  according to the principles presented on page 43 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document.Group net income used for the ratio numerator is book Group net income adjusted for “interest net of tax payable on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  interest paid to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations” and “unrealised gains/losses booked under shareholders’ equity  excluding conversion reserves” (see methodology note No. 9). For ROTE  income is also restated for goodwill impairment.Details of the corrections made to book equity in order to calculate ROE and ROTE for the period are given in the table below:ROTE calculation: calculation methodologyEnd of period (in EURm) Q2 23 Q2 22 H1 23 H1 22 Shareholders' equity Group share 68 007 65 023 68 007 65 023 Deeply subordinated and undated subordinated notes (10 815) (8 683) (10 815) (8 683) Interest payable to holders of deeply & undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisation(1) (28) (8) (28) (8) OCI excluding conversion reserves 688 577 688 577 Distribution provision(2) (982) (1 193) (982) (1 193) Distribution N-1 to be paid (441) (914) (441) (914) ROE equity end-of-period 56 430 54 801 56 430 54 801 Average ROE equity 56 334 55 009 56 203 54 887 Average Goodwill (4 041) (3 646) (3 847) (3 636) Average Intangible Assets (3 117) (2 710) (2 997) (2 729) Average ROTE equity 49 176 48 653 49 359 48 522 Group net Income 900 (1 511) 1 768 (690) Interest paid and payable to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisation (216) (159) (379) (278) Cancellation of goodwill impairment - - - 2 Ajusted Group net Income 684 (1 670) 1 390 (966) Average ROTE equity 49 176 48 653 49 359 48 522 ROTE 5.6% -13.7% 5.6% -4.0% Underlying Group net income 1 159 1 481 2 667 3 019 Interest paid and payable to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisation (216) (159) (379) (278) Cancellation of goodwill impairment - - - 2 Ajusted Underlying Group net Income 943 1 322 2 288 2 743 Average ROTE equity (underlying) 49 435 51 645 50 257 52 231 Underlying ROTE 7.6% 10.2% 9.1% 10.5%RONE calculation: Average capital allocated to Core Businesses (in EURm)In EURm Q2 23 Q2 22 Change H1 23 H1 22 Change French Retail Banking 12 338 12 296 +0.3% 12 365 12 058 +2.5% International Retail Banking and Financial Services 10 310 10 565 -2.4% 11 510 10 795 +6.6% Global Banking and Investor Solutions 14 132 14 644 -3.5% 14 347 14 385 -0.3% Core Businesses 36 780 37 505 -1.9% 38 222 37 238 +2.6% Corporate Center 19 554 17 504 +11.7% 17 981 17 649 +1.9% Group 56 334 55 009 +2.4% 56 203 54 887 +2.4%88 - Net assets and tangible net assetsNet assets and tangible net assets are defined in the methodology  page 45 of the Group’s 2023 Universal Registration Document.

The corrections made to Group net income in order to calculate EPS correspond to the restatements carried out for the calculation of ROE and ROTE.

The phased-in and fully loaded solvency ratios are presented pro forma for current earnings  net of dividends  for the current financial year  unless specified otherwise. The leverage ratio is also calculated according to applicable CRR2/CRD5 rules including the phased-in following the same rationale as solvency ratios.1011 – Funded balance sheet  loan to deposit ratioThe funded balance sheet is based on the Group financial statements. It is obtained in two steps:A first step aiming at reclassifying the items of the financial statements into aggregates allowing for a more economic reading of the balance sheet. Main reclassifications:Insurance: grouping of the accounting items related to insurance within a single aggregate in both assets and liabilities.Customer loans: include outstanding loans with customers (net of provisions and write-downs  including net lease financing outstanding and transactions at fair value through profit and loss); excludes financial assets reclassified under loans and receivables in accordance with the conditions stipulated by IFRS 9 (these positions have been reclassified in their original lines).Wholesale funding:Includes interbank liabilities and debt securities issued.Financing transactions have been allocated to medium/long-term resources and short-term resources based on the maturity of outstanding  more or less than one year.Reclassification under customer deposits of the share of issues placed by French Retail Banking networks (recorded in medium/long-term financing)  and certain transactions carried out with counterparties equivalent to customer deposits (previously included in short term financing).Deduction from customer deposits and reintegration into short-term financing of certain transactions equivalent to market resources.A second step aiming at excluding the contribution of insurance subsidiaries  and netting derivatives  repurchase agreements  securities borrowing/lending  accruals and “due to central banks”.The Group loan/deposit ratio is determined as the division of the customer loans by customer deposits as presented in the funded balance sheet.NB (1) The sum of values contained in the tables and analyses may differ slightly from the total reported due to rounding rules.(2) All the information on the results for the period (notably: press release  downloadable data  presentation slides and supplement) is available on Societe Generale’s website www.societegenerale.com in the “Investor” section.10. APPENDIX 3 : PUBLICATION OF NEW QUARTERLY SERIESSociete Generale is releasing restated quarterly statements reflecting the impacts from the merger of Societe Generale and Credit du Nord in France to create a unique brand name  SG.Following the completion of the merger of French networks in France  the Group proceeded to some non-material adjustments in its organization with the transfer of Societe des Banques de Monaco and the premium client base from Credit du Nord to private banking operations in France and the transfer of employee savings’ activities operated by Services Epargne Entreprises(11) (“S2E”) from French networks in France to insurance activities within International retail banking and financial services in order to reinforce already existing synergies with financial savings.The historical quarterly financial reporting has been restated in compliance with the following changes in governance.This organisational change comprises some immaterial adjustments to the cost sharing of some activities of Global Markets and Investor Services and Global Banking and Advisory.All of the above items have no impact on the performance of the Group nor on the Corporate Centre.The series of 2022 and Q1 23 quarterly results have been adjusted consequently and are available on the Societe Generale website.

Cash runway into Q3 2024Full financial statements for the second quarter of 2023 will be released in the coming daysConference call scheduled for 8AM ET/2PM CET on August 4  2023NEW YORK  Aug. 03  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cellectis (the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies  today provided business updates and preliminary financial results for the six-month period ending June 30  2023. Full report of the financial results for the second quarter of 2023 will be released in the coming days.“We are proud of our team and the strong execution this quarter. Our clinical data presented for UCART22 at the European Hematology Association (EHA) were positive for patients with r/r B-ALL who have failed multiple lines of treatment including multi-agent chemoimmunotherapy  CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy  and allogeneic stem cell transplant. We are looking forward to releasing new data later this year on our UCART22 product candidate manufactured in-house ” said André Choulika  Ph.D.  Chief Executive Officer at Cellectis.“In addition  we have made progress with our pipeline in 2023 and continue to focus on our core clinical trials BALLI-01 (evaluating UCART22)  NATHALI-01 (evaluating UCART20x22) and AMELI-01 (evaluating UCART123). This quarter  Cellectis presented an encore of the clinical data on the AMELI-01 clinical trial at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) 2023 annual meeting. These preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART123 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r AML.Cellectis’ innovation team also presented preclinical data on a gene editing process to develop a bona fide HBB gene correction of sickle cell mutation  and a comprehensive analysis to better design efficient TALE Base Editors (TALE-BE) at the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy (ISCT) 2023 annual meeting. These achievements showcase once more the power of our gene-editing platform and our TALEN®  the technology of choice for therapeutic gene editing  and that we are continuing to deliver constant breakthrough innovation to treat diseases with unmet medical needs.Despite an unprecedented challenging market environment for cell and gene therapy companies  Cellectis remains focused in its mission to develop innovative cancer therapy product candidates.”Pipeline HighlightsUCART Clinical Development ProgramsBALLI-01 (evaluating UCART22) in relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL)UCART22 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD22 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r B-ALL in the BALLI-01 Phase 1/2a clinical study.On June 9  Cellectis presented updated clinical and translational data at the European Hematology Association (EHA). These data support the preliminary safety and efficacy of UCART22 in a heavily pretreated r/r B-ALL population. UCART22 is currently the most advanced allogeneic CAR T-cell product in development for r/r B-ALL.In the poster presented at EHA  Cellectis included data from patients who received UCART22 after fludarabine  cyclophosphamide (FC) and FC with alemtuzumab (FCA) lymphodepletion (LD). Compared to the clinical update on BALLI-01 at ASH 2021  we have included data from six additional patients who received UCART22 at dose level 3 (DL3)  as of the December 31  2022 data cutoff.UCART22 administered after FC or FCA LD regimen was well tolerated. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) nor immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were observed.For FCA-dose level 3  50% of the six patients responded. Host lymphocytes remained suppressed through Day 28 for all patients who received FCA LD. Peak ferritin levels correlated with UCART22 cell expansion and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). UCART22 continues to be well tolerated  with no treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) or DLTs reported. UCART22 cell expansion was detected in 9 of 13 patients in the FCA LD arm and associated with clinical activity.The BALLI-01 study is currently enrolling patients after FCA LD with Cellectis’ in-house manufactured product. The next data set is expected to be released later this year.NATHALI-01 (evaluating UCART20x22) in relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r B-NHL)UCART20x22 is Cellectis’ first dual allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting both CD20 and CD22 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r B-NHL in the NATHALI-01 Phase 1/2a clinical study2.The NATHALI-01 clinical study is ongoing. Cellectis expects to provide first-in-human data later this year.AMELI-01 (evaluating UCART123) in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML)UCART123 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD123 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r AML in the AMELI-01 Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.On May 17  Cellectis presented an encore of the clinical data on the AMELI-01 clinical trial that were unveiled at the ASH 2022 annual meeting  at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) 2023 annual meeting. These preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART123 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r AML.The oral presentation reviewed preliminary data from patients who received UCART123 at one of the following dose levels: dose level 1 (DL1) 2.5x105 cells/kg; dose level 2 (DL2) 6.25x105 cells/kg; intermediate dose level 2 (DL2i) 1.5x106 cells/kg; or dose level 3 (DL3) 3.30x106 cells/kg after lymphodepletion with FC ([n=8]  DL1 – DL3) or FCA ([n=9]  DL2 & DL2i).The data presented showed that adding alemtuzumab to the FC LD regimen was associated with sustained host lymphodepletion and significantly higher UCART123 cell expansion  that correlated with improved anti-tumor activity.25% (n=2) of patients at DL2 in the FCA arm achieved meaningful response; one patient who failed five prior lines of therapy including allogeneic stem cell transplant experienced a durable minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete response that continued beyond 12 months  as of December 2022.The AMELI-01 study is currently enrolling patients after FCA lymphodepletion in a two-dose regimen arm.Research Data & Preclinical ProgramsUCART20x22On June 5  2023  Cellectis presented preclinical data on its product candidate UCART20x22  at the International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy (ISCT) 2023 annual event.Cellectis provided pre-clinical proof-of-concept data for UCART20x22 to overcome current mechanisms of resistance to CAR T-cell therapies in B-NHL  while providing a potential therapeutic alternative to CD19 targeting and allowing a reduction in the time from treatment decision to infusion.Cellectis demonstrated that UCART20x22 displays robust activity in vitro and in vivo  against targets expressing heterogeneous levels of CD22 and CD20. We have used in vitro cytotoxicity assays against different tumor cell lines  showing strong activity whether these cells express a single antigen (CD20 or CD22) or both antigens simultaneously  as well as IFNg release in response to antigen specific stimulation.Article published in Cancer Immunology ResearchOn May 31  2023  Cellectis published an article in Cancer Immunology Research demonstrating pre-clinical proof-of-concept data of UCART20x22 product candidate  to overcome current mechanisms of resistance to CAR T-cell therapies in B-NHL.In this study  we demonstrated that allogeneic CD20x22 CAR T-cells exhibit robust  sustained and dose-dependent activity in vitro and in vivo  while efficiently targeting primary Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma samples with heterogeneous levels of CD20 and CD22.HBB gene correction of sickle cell mutationEncouraging preclinical data on gene editing process using Cellectis TALEN® technology to develop highly efficient HBB gene correction of sickle cell mutation  were presented in a poster presentation at the ISCT 2023 annual event.These results showed that non-viral DNA delivery associated with TALEN® gene editing reduces the toxicity usually observed with viral DNA delivery and allows high levels of HBB gene correction in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells.Cellectis leveraged TALEN® technology to develop a gene editing process leading to highly efficient HBB gene correction via homology directed repair  while mitigating potential risks associated to HBB gene knock-out. Furthermore  we compared viral (TALEN-V) and non-viral (TALEN-NV) DNA template delivery strategies in mobilized healthy donor (HD) or non-mobilized homozygous sickle patient (HbSS) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).Both strategies led to high and comparable efficiencies of HBB gene correction in vitro in HD and HbSS  without affecting viability  purity or clonogenic potential of corrected HSPCs.The poster presentation highlighted the following data:TALEN®-mediated engineering efficiently corrects the mutated HBB gene in clinically relevant HSPCs and promote phenotype correction in fully mature RBCs.Cellectis optimized TALEN® gene editing process mitigates potential safety challenges by reducing the frequency of HBB gene inactivation (<10% β-thal cells).Non-viral DNA template-mediated HBB repair mitigates p53 DNA damage response activation  preserves edited LT-HSCs fitness and enables their efficient engraftment in vivo using an immunodeficient murine model.TALE Base Editors (TALE-BE)A comprehensive analysis to better design efficient TALE Base Editors (TALE-BE) using Cellectis’ TALEN® technology was presented in a poster at ISCT annual meeting.Cellectis developed a strategy that allowed to comprehensively characterize editing efficiencies in function of the TC position within the TALE-BE editing windows. This method is specifically taking advantage of the highly precise and efficient TALEN® mediated ssODN knock-in in primary T cells  allowing to focus on how target composition and spacer variations can affect TALE-BE activity/efficiency.The poster presentation highlighted the following data:Determined optimal spacer length (13/15 bp) for highly efficient TALE-BE for both C40/C40 and C11/C11 scaffolds.Determined optimal common sequence context for high editing rates.Determined that editing efficiency of the C11/C11 scaffold is highly dependent on Cytosine position requirements  resulting in more stringent activity in a context of 15 bp spacer size and decreasing the effects of bystander editing.We believe that the knowledge obtained will allow to better design efficient TALE-BE while improving the specificity profiles of this innovative editing platform.Novel treatment paradigm for successful CAR T immunotherapy against stroma-rich solid tumorsOn May 12  2023  Cellectis published an article in Frontiers Bioengineering demonstrating the efficacy of its TALEN® engineered FAP UCART-cells in cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) depletion  reduction of desmoplasia and tumor infiltration.Over 90% of epithelial cancers including breast  colorectal  pancreatic and lung adenocarcinomas express the CAF-specific surface marker  fibroblast activation protein α (FAP)  which makes it a promising CAR T-cell target. In this study  Cellectis proposed a novel and versatile approach of combination CAR T-cell therapy that can be extended to most stroma-rich cold tumors with relevant tumor-antigen targeting CAR T-cells which otherwise are recalcitrant to cell therapy.Preclinical data showed that:In a mouse xenograft model  successful implantation of injected CAFs in the tumors was confirmed by positive staining of spindle-like cells with human-specific FAP antibody  recapitulating a physiologically relevant TNBC tumor with tumor and stromal compartments.FAP UCART-cells alone significantly reduced tumor growth.In vitro and in vivo results show that FAP UCART-cells enable the reprogramming of the cold  stroma-rich triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) TME  making the tumor susceptible to subsequent Meso UCART infiltration and cytotoxicity and improving the overall antitumor activity of the treatment.In the context of combination therapy with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor  maximal anti-tumor activity and survival benefits were observed upon FAP UCART-cell treatment followed by Meso UCART-cell treatment.Licensed Allogeneic CAR T-cell Development ProgramsServier and Allogene: anti-CD19 programsAllogene announced that it is enrolling patients “in the industry’s first potentially pivotal Phase 2 allogeneic CAR T clinical trial with ALLO-501A across sites in the United States and Canada”. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently approved the ALPHA2 Clinical Trial Application (CTA).Allogene’s single-arm ALPHA2 trial in relapsed/refractory (R/R) large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) will enroll approximately 100 patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy and have not received prior anti-CD19 therapy. Allogene has announced that it expects to complete enrollment in 1H 2024 with the first data readout by the end of 2024.Long-term follow up data from the Phase 1 of Allogene’s ALPHA/ALPHA2 trials in LBCL was presented at both the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting with an encore presentation at the European Hematology Association Congress and International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma (ICML) Lugano in June 2023. The Phase 1 trials enrolled heavily pre-treated patients with a median of three prior lines of therapy. Data from 33 CAR T-naïve LBCL patients receiving Alloy™ cell product including 12 patients treated with the Phase 2 regimen  are the first to demonstrate the potential for an allogeneic CAR T product to induce complete responses at rates and durability similar to approved autologous therapies.Allogene: anti-BCMA and anti-CD70 programThe ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation of Allogene’s TRAVERSE study is enrolling patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have progressed on standard therapies including an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a VEGF-targeting therapy.Allogene’s TRAVERSE trial is now deploying an investigational in vitro companion diagnostic (IVD) assay designed to prospectively assess CD70 expression levels in patients. Allogene has announced that dose escalation in the TRAVERSE trial is expected to be completed in 2023.Corporate UpdatesOn June 28  2023  Cellectis reported results from the annual shareholders’ general meeting held on June 27  2023  at the Company’s Paris headquarters. At the meeting  during which more than 72% of shares were exercised  Resolutions 1 through 28 were adopted and resolution 29 was rejected  according to the management recommendations. The detailed results of the vote and the resolutions are available on the company’s website: https://www.cellectis.com/en/investors/general-meetings/At the end of the meeting  the terms of office of Ms. Annick Schwebig and Mr. Hervé Hoppenot ended and Ms. Annick Schwebig and Mr. Hervé Hoppenot departed the board of directors as of such date.During the annual shareholders meeting  Cécile Chartier  Ph.D.  was appointed as a director of the Cellectis’ Board of Directors  with immediate effect.Cécile Chartier currently serves as Chief Scientific Officer at NextVivo  Inc. Prior to her tenure at NextVivo  Dr. Chartier was Vice President of Research at Iovance Biotherapeutics  Inc. where she led the development of next generation tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) therapies through research to early-stage clinical trials. Cécile’s extensive experience in the development of next generation cell and gene therapies coupled with her deep knowledge of the U.S. biotechnology industry will be a huge asset to Cellectis.Financial ResultsThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis  have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”).We present certain financial metrics broken out between our two reportable segments – Therapeutics and Plants – in the appendices of this Q2 2023 financial results press release.On January 13  2023  Calyxt  Cibus Global LLC (Cibus) and certain other parties named therein  entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”)  pursuant to which  subject to the terms and conditions thereof  Calyxt and Cibus will merge in an all-stock transaction (the “Calyxt Merger”). As a consequence of the foregoing  Calyxt met the “held-for-sale” criteria specified in IFRS 5 and was classified as a discontinued operation until May 31  2023.On June 1  2023  Calyxt and Cibus closed the merger transaction and now operate under the name Cibus  Inc. Consequently  Calyxt was deconsolidated and Calyxt’s cash  cash equivalent and restricted cash are no longer included in the Group’s cash  cash equivalent and restricted cash since June 1  2023.Cash: As of June 30  2023  Cellectis  had $89 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash. This compares to $95 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31  2022. This $6 million difference mainly reflects $55 million of cash out  which include $15 million for R&D suppliers  $7 million for SG&A suppliers  $23 million for staff costs  $7 million for rents and taxes  $3 millions of reimbursement of the “PGE” loan  and a $1 million unfavorable impact on Forex partially offset by a $23 million net cash inflow from the capital raise closed in February  a $21 million net cash inflow from EIB loan  a $1 million cash inflow related to the grant and refundable advance from BPI  $2 millions of financial investments’ capital gain and interests  a $1 million reimbursement of social charges paid on stock options  and a $2 million net cash inflow from licenses and other cash receipts.Based on the current operating plan  Cellectis anticipates that the cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash as of June 30  2023 will fund Cellectis’ operations into the third quarter of 2024.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $5.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2023 compared to $6.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The decrease of $1.0 million reflects the recognition of two milestones related to Cellectis’ agreement with Cytovia for $1.5 million in 2022 and a milestone of $1.0 million with another partner while recognition of revenues in 2023 is not material  and partially offset by the increase of the research tax credit for $0.8 million and the partial recognition of a grant signed with “BPI” of $0.8 million.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $43.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $52.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $9.0 million decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a $3.4 million decrease in personal expenses due to departures not replaced (ii) a $4.7 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $28.0 million in 2022 to $23.2 million in 2023) mainly explained by internalization of our manufacturing and quality activities to support our R&D pipeline and (iii) a $0.8 million decrease of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses (from $3.1 million to $2.3 million).SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $8.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $10.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $2.0 million decrease primarily reflects (i) a $1.6 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $6.4 million in 2022 to $4.9 million in 2023) mainly explained by the implementation of our ERP in 2022 (ii) a $0.2 million decrease in personal expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.Net financial gain (loss): Consolidated net financial gain was $11.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $9.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $2.4 million increase primarily reflects (i) a $20.8 million increase of financial income  mainly attributable to the profit from Calyxt’s deconsolidation  partially offset by (ii) the loss in fair value on our retained investment in Calyxt since deconsolidation for $10.2 million  (iii) a $6.8 million decrease in the fair value of Cytovia’s note receivable.Net income (loss) from discontinued operations: Pursuant to Calyxt deconsolidation income from discontinued operation for the six-month period ended June 30  2023  2023 only include five months of activity. The $3.5 million increase of net loss from discontinued operations between the six-month period ended June 30  2022 and 2023 is primarily driven by (i) the increase of $9.2 million of net financial loss and (ii) the increase of $1.5 million of other operating expenses partially offset by (i) the decrease of $2.8 million of R&D expenses (from $6.3 million in 2022 to $3.5 in 2023) and (ii) the decrease of $4.5 million of SG&A expenses (from $6.8 million in 2022 to $2.3 million in 2023).Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $40.7 million (or $0.76 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2023  of which $35.7 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations  compared to $50.9 million (or $1.12 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2022  of which $47.3 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations. This $10.1 million decrease in net loss between the first six months of 2023 and 2022 was primarily driven by (i) a $9.0 million decrease of R&D expenses  (ii) a $2.0 million decrease of SG&A expenses and (iii) an increase of $2.4 million of the financial gain due to the deconsolidation of Calyxt compensated in part by the decrease of fair value of Cytovia’s note receivable. These downward impacts on the net loss were partially offset by (i) a decrease of $1.0 million of revenues and other income  (ii) an increase of $1.5 million of loss from discontinued operations attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $36.7 million (or $0.68 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to a net loss of $45.5 million (or $1.00 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2022.Please see “Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures” for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis for 2023 in the following areas:Supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART123  UCART22  UCART 20x22 and potential new product candidates;Operating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France)  and Raleigh (North Carolina  USA); andContinuing to strengthen our manufacturing and clinical departments.The selected  preliminary financial information set forth above are unaudited and should be considered preliminary and subject to change.

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME For the three-month period ended June 30  2023 (unaudited) - ($ in thousands except per share data) For the three-month period endedJune 30  2022 * 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (18 946 ) (10 648 ) Adjustment:Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 2 684 2 074 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (16 263 ) (8 574 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.36 ) (0.15 ) Basic adjusted earnings from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($ /share) 0.00 (0.05 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 45 497 127 55 583 768 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1) (0.36 ) (0.15 ) Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) from discontinued operations 0.02 (0.04 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 45 497 127 55 583 768*These amounts reflect adjustments made in connection with the presentation of the discontinued operationRECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME (unaudited) First six months ($ in thousands  except per share data) For the six-month period endedJune 30  2022 * 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (50 858 ) (40 715 ) Adjustment:Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 5 331 4 053 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (45 527 ) (36 662 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1.00 ) (0.68 ) Basic adjusted earnings from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($ /share) (0.95 ) (0.71 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 45 497 127 53 541 010 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1.00 ) (0.68 ) Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) from discontinued operations (0.95 ) (0.71 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 45 497 127 53 541 010*These amounts reflect adjustments made in connection with the presentation of the discontinued operationAbout CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

Fuji announced positive top-line results from the double-blind  placebo-controlled studies in February 2023  showing the first trial met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant difference for the change in the total dysmenorrhea score when compared to placebo. The second trial in patients with endometriosis also met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant difference for the change in the Visual Analog Scale for the most severe pelvic pain when compared to placebo.It is the second milestone payment received by Mithra under this agreement with Fuji  which was signed in 2016. The first milestone of EUR 1.25 million was received by Mithra upon completion of Phase 3 trials in Europe and the United States. Mithra remains eligible to receive a further EUR 12.5 million in total milestones prior to commercialization and to receive revenue from supply of the manufactured product post-commercialization.David Horn Solomon  Chief Executive Officer of Mithra  commented: “We are pleased with the strong progress made by our partner Fuji Pharma with Estelle®. This EUR 1.25 million milestone payment marks strong Phase 3 results  which indicate that this could be an excellent treatment for patients with dysmenorrhea and endometriosis  and will further boost Mithra’s balance sheet  as we pursue our aim of becoming a global leader in women's health. We are looking forward to continuing our close cooperation with Fuji as we work to bring Estelle® to patients in Japan and ASEAN territories.”Estelle®  Mithra’s first E4-based product composed of 15 mg Estetrol (E4) and 3 mg Drospirenone (DRSP)  is commercialized as a combined oral contraceptive in the US (NEXTSTELLIS®)  Canada (NEXTSTELLIS®)  and Europe (DROVELIS® and LYDISILKA®).Mithra’s core asset Estetrol (E4) is a native estrogen produced by the human fetus during pregnancy  passing into maternal blood at relatively high levels. Because of its unique mode of action and safety profile  Estetrol could represent a major breakthrough in various therapeutic fields of women’s health and beyond.For more information  please contact:Mithra Pharmaceuticals SADavid Horn SolomonChief Executive Officerinvestorrelations@mithra.com Investor & media relationsChris MaggosCohesion Bureauchris.maggos@cohesionbureau.com+41 79 367 6254About MithraMithra Pharmaceuticals SA (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming Women’s Health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

Fuji announced positive top-line results from the double-blind  placebo-controlled studies in February 2023  showing the first trial met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant difference for the change in the total dysmenorrhea score when compared to placebo. The second trial in patients with endometriosis also met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant difference for the change in the Visual Analog Scale for the most severe pelvic pain when compared to placebo.It is the second milestone payment received by Mithra under this agreement with Fuji  which was signed in 2016. The first milestone of EUR 1.25 million was received by Mithra upon completion of Phase 3 trials in Europe and the United States. Mithra remains eligible to receive a further EUR 12.5 million in total milestones prior to commercialization and to receive revenue from supply of the manufactured product post-commercialization.David Horn Solomon  Chief Executive Officer of Mithra  commented: “We are pleased with the strong progress made by our partner Fuji Pharma with Estelle®. This EUR 1.25 million milestone payment marks strong Phase 3 results  which indicate that this could be an excellent treatment for patients with dysmenorrhea and endometriosis  and will further boost Mithra’s balance sheet  as we pursue our aim of becoming a global leader in women's health. We are looking forward to continuing our close cooperation with Fuji as we work to bring Estelle® to patients in Japan and ASEAN territories.”Estelle®  Mithra’s first E4-based product composed of 15 mg Estetrol (E4) and 3 mg Drospirenone (DRSP)  is commercialized as a combined oral contraceptive in the US (NEXTSTELLIS®)  Canada (NEXTSTELLIS®)  and Europe (DROVELIS® and LYDISILKA®).Mithra’s core asset Estetrol (E4) is a native estrogen produced by the human fetus during pregnancy  passing into maternal blood at relatively high levels. Because of its unique mode of action and safety profile  Estetrol could represent a major breakthrough in various therapeutic fields of women’s health and beyond.For more information  please contact:Mithra PharmaceuticalsSADavid Horn SolomonChief Executive Officerinvestorrelations@mithra.com Investor & media relationsChris MaggosCohesion Bureauchris.maggos@cohesionbureau.com+41 79 367 6254About MithraMithra Pharmaceuticals SA (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming Women’s Health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

Such a distribution would result in a cash outflow in 2023 of €124.2 million.The second interim payment should therefore amount to €2.46 gross per share  i.e. €1.722 net per share (after deduction of the withholding tax of 30%).To our non-resident shareholders  Belgium has entered into international tax treaties with a certain number of foreign countries  which generally limit the burden of this withholding tax to 15% or even 10% ( https://www.solvac.be/actualites/communications-de-dividende/ ).

This was driven by a 23.6% YoY expansion of the 4G subscriber base and a robust increase in data revenues. EBITDA declined 37.9% YoY in local currency (-40.0% YoY in reported currency) impacted by extraordinary one-offs in 2Q22 and 2Q23.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the second quarter and first half ended June 30  2023. Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries  commented: ""The second quarter of 2023 was strong for Pharming. After the reimbursement disruptions experienced in the HAE market in the first quarter  RUCONEST® recovered significantly in the second quarter increasing 20% over the first quarter of 2023. Our RUCONEST® business performed well across a variety of leading revenue indicators  positioning us well for the second half of the year. RUCONEST® continues to provide a stable base for Pharming's future growth  and we continue to foresee low single digit growth in sales for the year. The Joenja® (leniolisib) U.S. launch got off to a strong start with the first reimbursed shipments to patients taking place in April; within two weeks of FDA approval. Our focus throughout the second quarter was enrolling identified U.S.-based APDS patients on Joenja® and working with payors on reimbursement. As of June 30  we have 60 patient enrollments and 43 patients on paid therapy  and US$3.8 million in associated revenues for the second quarter. 1We continue to make good progress in identifying additional patients with APDS in key global markets. We have now identified over 640 patients in markets including the U.S.  Europe  the U.K.  Japan  Canada  Australia and Israel. Through our regulatory  clinical  patient finding  and genetic testing efforts  we continue to make significant progress towards our goal of bringing this disease modifying treatment to adult and pediatric APDS patients worldwide. Pharming's progress continues to aid our patients and stakeholders as we focus on  and invest in  the long term growth of the company. I am immensely proud of our teams' many achievements in the first half of 2023."" Second quarter and first half highlights Commercialized assets RUCONEST® marketed for the treatment of acute HAE attacks Our RUCONEST® business had a strong second quarter  performing well across leading revenue indicators including active patients  vials shipped  and number of physicians prescribing. These positive indicators should position us well for the second half of the year. Moreover  the underlying in-market demand for RUCONEST® in the U.S. continues to be strong. We received over 70 new patient enrollments in each quarter of 2023 underpinning the importance of RUCONEST® to HAE patients  including those patients on prophylaxis who should have medication on hand to treat any breakthrough attacks. In the second quarter of 2023  RUCONEST® revenues were US$51.1 million  a 20% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023 and a 2% increase compared to the second quarter of 2022. For the first half of the year  RUCONEST® revenues were US$93.6 million  a 3% decrease compared to the first half of 2022. This was however a significant improvement when compared to the 9% revenue decrease experienced in the first quarter of 2023. The disruptions experienced in the first quarter  particularly in the month of February  impacted the entire U.S. HAE market across acute and prophylactic products and were temporary - as anticipated - and accounted for lower revenues in the first half of 2023 when compared to 2022. Joenja® (leniolisib) marketed in the U.S. - the first and only approved disease modifying treatment for APDS 2On March 24  the U.S. FDA approved Joenja® (leniolisib) for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja®  an oral  selective PI3Kδ inhibitor  is the first and only disease modifying treatment approved in the U.S. for APDS. The U.S. commercial launch of Joenja® is off to a strong start. First reimbursed shipments to patients took place in April; within two weeks of FDA approval. As of June 30  we received enrollments of 60 APDS patients of which 43 patients are already on paid therapy. Of the 43 patients on paid therapy  19 were previously on therapy under our Expanded Access Program (EAP) or Open Label Extension trial (OLE). The remaining 24 patients were previously untreated patients or naïve. We anticipate nearly all future patients to be naïve to Joenja®. Access and reimbursement discussions have been proceeding as expected. Given the rarity of APDS  the limited number of treatment options available  and that Joenja® is a disease modifying treatment and the only treatment indicated for APDS  we have seen high approval rates and fast timelines to covered therapy. Pharming's market access teams are continuing to work with government and private payors to both educate and provide the resources needed to formulate their policies to ensure access and reimbursement. Patient finding Based on available literature  Pharming estimates that over 1 500 patients are affected by APDS in our key global markets including the U.S.  Europe  U.K.  Japan  Canada  Australia and Israel. Our patient finding efforts continue to progress  and as of June 30  Pharming has identified over 640 patients - versus the over 500 patients reported as of December 2022. Of these 640 patients  approximately 200 are U.S.-based with approximately 75% over the age of 12 and are therefore currently eligible for treatment with Joenja®. During the second quarter  our primary focus during was enrolling patients previously identified with APDS in the U.S. and moving them onto paid therapy. As we enter the third quarter of 2023  we will intensify our focus towards conducting genetic testing  including testing family members of diagnosed patients  to identify additional individuals with APDS who may be eligible for treatment with Joenja®. Milestone and royalty payments As announced in April 2023  the first commercial sale of Joenja® triggered a US$10 million milestone payment by Pharming to Novartis. The regulatory approval for APDS also triggered a US$0.5 million milestone payment by Pharming to another party in the first quarter of 2023. With the approval of Joenja®  and pursuant to the terms of Pharming's 2019 exclusive license agreement with Novartis for leniolisib  Pharming is obligated to make certain one-off milestone payments to Novartis totaling up to US$200 million upon the first achievement of certain leniolisib sales levels in a calendar year and tiered royalty payments to Novartis calculated as low-teens mid-teens to high-teens percentages of leniolisib net sales. 3Sale of Priority Review Voucher In June 2023  Pharming announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) to Novartis for a pre-agreed one-time payment of US$21.1 million. Pharming was granted the PRV by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2023 in connection with the approval of Joenja®. The sale price was a pre-agreed  contractually defined percentage of the PRV value pursuant to the terms of the August 2019 exclusive license agreement between Pharming and Novartis for leniolisib. Additional information on the PRV  milestones  and royalties can be found in our Annual Report 2022 or in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on April 5  2023. Joenja® (leniolisib) strategic highlights - regulatory and clinical updates Leniolisib for APDS Pharming made significant progress over the first half of 2023 towards our objective of obtaining leniolisib regulatory approvals for APDS patients 12 years of age and older and for pediatric patients in key global markets. Furthermore  we continued to make progress in identifying additional indications for development of leniolisib beyond APDS. EEA and U.K. market In February  Pharming announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) decided to shift its assessment of the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib for patients 12 years of age and older to a standard review timetable. The list of questions received by Pharming included a request to submit updated data from the ongoing long-term extension study collected after the interim analysis included in the original MAA. In May  Pharming submitted its response to the CHMP Day 120 list of questions. Subsequently  as part of the MAA review procedure timetable  Pharming received the CHMP's Day 180 list of outstanding issues in July. Considering the rarity of the disease and the unmet need for the treatment of APDS patients  the CHMP will consult an Ad-hoc Expert Group (AEG) at a closed meeting also involving Pharming representatives including leniolisib investigators and APDS patients. Under EMA regulations  the CHMP may call an AEG meeting when a medicine is being assessed that requires input from specialized scientific advisors on matters that may fall outside the expertise of the EMA's established Scientific Advisory Groups  as is typically the case for rare diseases with few experts. 4",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.63,0.23,0.14,True,English,"['2Q/1H 2023 Financial Results', 'Pharming N', 'Press Release', 'low single digit annual revenue growth', 'low single digit growth', 'The U.S. commercial launch', 'entire U.S. HAE market', 'activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta', 'U.S.-based APDS patients', 'preliminary (unaudited) financial report', 'oral, selective PI3Kδ inhibitor', 'regulatory, clinical, patient finding', 'Pharming Group N.V.', 'U.S. Joenja® launch', 'U.S. launch', 'long term growth', 'US$3.8 million revenue', 'leading revenue indicators', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Sijmen de Vries', ""teams' many achievements"", 'U.S. FDA', 'genetic testing efforts', 'Commercialized assets RUCONEST®', '70 new patient enrollments', 'key global markets', 'acute HAE attacks', 'disease modifying treatment', 'pediatric APDS patients', 'strong second quarter', 'strong RUCONEST® revenues', 'future growth', 'U.K.', '2023 financial results', 'regulatory submissions', 'The Netherlands', 'market demand', 'PI3Kδ) syndrome', '9% revenue decrease', 'patient program', '60 patient enrollments', 'HAE patients', 'positive indicators', 'key markets', 'The Joenja®', 'breakthrough attacks', 'Strong start', 'FDA approval', 'associated revenues', 'lower revenues', 'Strong progress', 'second half', 'first half', 'Overall cash', 'cash equivalents', 'restricted cash', 'CHMP opinion', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'first quarter', 'stable base', 'two weeks', 'significant improvement', 'prophylactic products', 'RUCONEST® business', 'good progress', 'significant progress', 'additional patients', 'active patients', '60 APDS patients', '1H 2023 revenues', '2Q 2023 revenues', 'reimbursement disruptions', '43 patients', '640 patients', '3% decrease', 'therapy', '1Q', 'end', 'leniolisib', 'Canada', 'Australia', 'Israel', 'Leiden', 'Company', 'PHARM/Nasdaq', 'variety', 'year', 'sales', 'shipments', 'place', 'April', 'focus', 'payors', 'June', 'Europe', 'Japan', 'goal', 'adult', 'stakeholders', 'vials', 'number', 'physicians', 'underlying', 'importance', 'prophylaxis', 'medication', 'hand', '20% increase', '2% increase', 'month', 'February', 'March', 'age']",2023-08-03,2023-08-04,marketscreener.com

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted unanimously 10 to 0 to recommend routine use of Sanofi and AstraZeneca’s Beyfortus™ (nirsevimab-alip) for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease for newborns and infants below 8 months of age born during or entering their first RSV season.The Committee also voted unanimously 10 to 0 to recommend routine use of Beyfortus for children aged 8 to 19 months who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season.Additionally  the ACIP voted unanimously 11 to 0 to include Beyfortus in the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. Beyfortus will be available in the U.S. ahead of the upcoming 2023-2024 RSV season.Thomas TriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi“Today  we have turned the corner on the threat of RSV to our youngest  most vulnerable population. The ACIP’s unanimous recommendations for routine use of Beyfortus and inclusion in the Vaccines for Children program are critical steps toward providing millions of parents in the U.S. with the ability to protect their babies through their first RSV season  when they are most susceptible to severe RSV disease. We appreciate the FDA and CDC leadership  as well as the ACIP public health experts  for recognizing and quickly acting on the threat RSV poses to all infants.”Dr Regena Spratling  PhD  RN  APRN  CPNP-PC  FAANP  FAANPresident  National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners“As front-line providers managing the physical and emotional toll of RSV on our patients and their families  especially during the surges of the last two years  our community of pediatric-focused nurse practitioners welcomes the recent approval of nirsevimab. Today’s ACIP vote to include nirsevimab in routine immunization schedules  along with continued efforts to educate the public about the impact of RSV prevention  will help ensure equitable access to this immunization and help alleviate the strain RSV disease places on babies  families  and health care systems.”The provisional ACIP recommendations will be forwarded to the director of the CDC and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for review and approval. The official recommendations will be published in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Once approved  routine use of Beyfortus would be included in the CDC’s Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule.About the U.S. ACIP and CDC recommendationsThe ACIP is a body of independent health experts that advises the CDC and the nation on the types of populations and circumstances for which immunizations should be used. The CDC reviews advice from the ACIP and publishes final recommendations in the MMWR. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) generally requires coverage for all immunizations administered in accordance with final CDC recommendations. This requirement applies to all non-grandfathered commercial plans and Medicaid expansion beneficiaries. Individuals  or their healthcare providers  should contact their health insurance plan to determine coverage and reimbursement requirements as well as adoption timeframes. The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program helps provide immunizations to children whose parents or guardians may not be able to afford them. This helps ensure that all children have a better chance of getting their recommended immunizations on schedule.About RSVRSV is a very contagious virus that can lead to serious respiratory illness for infants  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). RSV symptoms can include runny nose  coughing  sneezing  fever  decrease in appetite  and wheezing.1 Two out of three infants are infected with RSV during their first year of life and almost all children are infected by their second birthday.1 2 In the U.S.  RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants under 12 months  averaging 16 times higher than the annual rate for influenza.3 4 Approximately 75% of infants hospitalized for RSV are born healthy and at term with no underlying conditions.5 Each year in the U.S.  an estimated 590 000 RSV disease cases in infants under one require medical care  including physician office  urgent care  emergency room visits and hospitalizations.6About BeyfortusIn the U.S.  Beyfortus is the first RSV prevention approved to protect all infants through their first RSV season  including for those born healthy at term or preterm  or with specific health conditions that make them vulnerable to RSV disease. Beyfortus is also approved for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.As a long-acting antibody provided directly to newborns and infants as a single dose  Beyfortus offers rapid protection to help prevent lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV without requiring activation of the immune system.7 Beyfortus administration can be timed to the start of the RSV season.Beyfortus was granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast-Track designations and was approved by the FDA on July 17  2023 following the positive recommendation of the FDA Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee. The approval was based on the extensive Beyfortus clinical development program spanning three pivotal late-stage clinical trials. Across all clinical endpoints  a single dose of Beyfortus delivered high  consistent and sustained efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract disease extending through five months  a typical RSV season.In March 2017  Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize Beyfortus. Under the terms of the agreement  AstraZeneca leads development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi leads commercialization activities and records revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120m  has paid development and regulatory milestones of €120m and will pay up to a further €375m upon achievement of certain regulatory and sales-related milestones. The two companies share costs and profits in all territories except in the U.S. where Sanofi consolidates 100% of the economic benefits in its Business Operating Income.Beyfortus has been granted special designations to facilitate expedited development by several regulatory agencies around the world. These include Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review designation by The China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) scheme and EMA accelerated assessment; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and has been named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development.Beyfortus has been granted marketing authorization in the European Union  Great Britain and Canada for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants from birth through their first RSV season and is currently undergoing regulatory review in China  Japan and several other countries. In Canada  nirsevimab is also approved for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season and such indication is under review at the EMA level.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Proportionate EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) for the same period was USD 247.6 million (second quarter 2022: USD 74.9 million).

The VLCC Nautica (2008 - 307 284 DWT) was sold and delivered debt-free to her new owner on 17 July 2023.The UN has begun the transfer operation of more than 1 million barrels of oil from the FSO Safer on 26 July 2023  which is likely to take around 20 days.Update - Newbuilding delivery scheduleThe outstanding capital expenditure for the five Suezmaxes currently under construction at the end of Q2 2023 was USD 209.6 million  of which USD 73.0 million is due 2023 and USD 136.6 million in 2024.On 30 May 2023  Euronav held a naming ceremony for two newbuildings  VLCC Clovis and Suezmax Brugge. VLCC Clovis (2023 - 299 158 dwt) was delivered on 30 May 2023 and Suezmax Brugge (2023 - 156 851 dwt) joined our fleet on 11 July 2023. This followed the delivery of the VLCC Camus (2023 - 299 158 dwt) and VLCC Cassius (2023 - 299 158 dwt) on 28 February and 11 January respectively.SUSTAINABLE FINANCINGEuronav has received a commitment of USD 190.5 million to finance 4 newbuildings entering service in 2023 (1 VLCC Clovis  and 3 Suezmaxes Brugge  Brest and Bristol). The new facility will carry an interest rate equal to SOFR plus margin 184 basis points (bps). Achievement of ESG KPI's  could lead to a blended rate of 177 bps. The term loan has a maturity of 12 years and was coordinated by DNB and ING  supported by K-Sure (premium included in the blended rate). This brings Euronav's sustainable financing level at 62%.SUSTAINABILITY UPDATEEuronav's industry-leading sustainability practices have been recognised at the first ever ESG Shipping Awards in Athens. The May 30 event  held under the auspices of the Greek Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy as well as the Hellenic Chamber  rewards exemplary Environmental  Social and Governance practices in the Greek Maritime industry.Euronav was the winner of the Silver Environment Award in recognition of the strength of its sustainable financing associated with environmental management and reporting  air emissions  energy efficiency  pollution prevention  biodiversity  climate strategy  waste  and water-related management.Webber Research 2023 ESG ScorecardEuronav has been placed in the top quartile of the only major report into Shipping Corporate Governance undertaken by Webber Research since 2016 (previously Wells Fargo). The Company was listed 16th out of 52 shipping companies of various sectors (containers  bulk  tankers) in the scorecard for 2023. Euronav will continue to observe and apply the highest standards of corporate governance. The ESG Scorecard ranks the public shipping universe on a number of corporate governance metrics with the goal of identifying both high quality shipping platforms and points of conflict based on underlying factors.TANKER MARKET & OUTLOOKSeasonal factors that are hard-wired into crude tanker markets typically tend to reduce cargo volumes during Q2 and Q3 (owing to refinery maintenance programmes  lower energy consumption during northern hemisphere spring  inventory planning  etc.). However  the impact in Q2 2023 and in Q3 so far is far smaller than historically observed  providing further evidence and confidence that the large crude tanker market is therefore well-positioned to continue the current upcycle based on strong fundamentals.Crude oil demand & supplyDemand for crude oil continues to see consistent upgrades for 2023 - the IEA has raised 2023 consumption forecasts nearly every month since November 2022. In total  the IEA is now forecasting 2.5m barrels per day (bpd) consumption growth for 2023 - up 0.9m bpd from Q4 2022 forecast. This sustained upward revision contradicts the performance and signals of a range bound oil price (Brent USD 71-85 year to date). Increased supply from non-OPEC sources and inventory drawdown (both strategic and commercial) provides some explanation for the oil price performance and buoyant tanker markets - as this supply needs to be shipped.The key development during the quarter was the surprise OPEC+ announcement of a commitment of further supply cuts of up to 1.6m bpd to end 2024 and Saudi Arabia's additional commitment to voluntarily reduce up to 1m bpd production on a month-bymonth basis. The cuts are focused specifically on Middle East exporting nations and will therefore provide a clear headwind for tanker operators primarily focused on the VLCC segment.However  there are a few caveats. Firstly  non-OPEC production continues to surprise on the upside with EIA forecasts for 1.9m bpd supply expansion. The key leading sources of this are the US  Norway  Canada  Brazil  and Guyana (source: EIA) which should also be supportive for ton miles as consumption growth continues to be focused on the Far East. Secondly  OPEC members (that are not part of OPEC+ cuts) (Venezuela  Iran  Nigeria) have seen stable production and exports. Thirdly  Russian barrels continue to defy most market forecasts with production and exports at similar level as late 2022.During the quarter two key patterns of trading have emerged. Firstly  smaller tankers (Suezmax  Aframax) have continued to exhibit more resilience than VLCC markets given the higher dislocation from Russian trading and consequent higher utilisation. Secondly  volatility within VLCC freight has been more elevated than usual. These two trends have however coalesced into another quarter of counter seasonal strength in freight rates. June saw a very large spike in VLCC freight rates reflecting a tight market between supply and demand. The average Q2 VLCC and Suezmax spot rates since 1990 have been USD 34k per day and USD 27k per day respectively  for Q2 2023 they amounted to USD 55k and USD 68k per day respectively  reflecting an exceptionally strong performance.Vessel SupplyAn arguably long overdue uptick in contracting occurred during Q2 with focus remaining on smaller tankers. Q2 2023 saw 15 Suezmax orders taking the orderbook-to-fleet ratio to 5% and the first four VLCC orders in almost a year (VLCC orderbook-to-fleet ratio at 1.6%). Unsurprisingly  there was no recycling of VLCC or Suezmax vessels for a second consecutive quarter given such buoyant freight markets.Contextual factors help to explain why new vessel contracting in Q2 could not remain at its previously very low levels. Contracting has come from highly reputable and disciplined owners with large established fleets as part of fleet renewal programmes. In addition  delivery dates are now on average 30 months after order placement - toward the higher end of the range since 1990. Finally  orderbook-to-fleet ratios remain extraordinarily low by historical standards (1.6% for VLCCs and 5.0% for Suezmaxes).Suezmax asset prices continued to rise during Q2 for Suezmax  with five and ten-year old vessels increasing in value by 8 to 10% over the quarter. Prices were flat for all age categories of VLCCs and recent inflation in older tonnage appears to have moderated across all tanker segments.Freight rates - consistent improvement and time charter emerging trendFreight rates retained their counter-seasonal trend during Q2 - a quarter when historically refinery maintenance and lower seasonal crude demand would see rates recalibrate lower from winter rates. Whilst rates are lower quarter-on-quarter  the reduction is modest with VLCC and suezmax rates remaining far above the average since 1990 for comparable Q2 periods (USD 33 708 per day for VLCC and USD 27 315 per day for Suezmax).The last period during which Q2 freight rates were sustainably above USD 40k per day for both VLCC and Suezmax sectors was in 2003-2008. Core industry fundamentals are similar today. In 2023  the global fleet average age is 11 years for VLCCs (vs. 8.2 years in 2003) and 11.1 years in 2023 for Suezmax (vs. 8.4 years in 2003). Then as now  owners faced incoming regulations requiring longer-term fleet adjustments  with the move from single-to double-hull vessels in 2003.So far in the third quarter of 2023  Euronav VLCCs in the Tankers International Pool have earned ~ USD 44 750 per day with 45% of the available days fixed. Euronav's Suezmax fleet trading on the spot market has earned ~ USD 49 500 per day on average with 50% of the available days fixed.DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERSQ2 2023 DividendThe Supervisory Board is proposing a dividend of USD 80 cents per share to reflect both the strong tanker market fundamentals and the robust operational leverage that the Euronav platform has to these market conditions.COUPON 35:• Ex-dividend date: 06/09/2023• Record date: 07/09/2023• Payment date: 19/09/2023Euronav shareholders will receive USD 2.63 dividend per share during calendar 2023 reflecting the Supervisory Board's confidence in the company and tanker sector's capability to maintain strong freight markets for the foreseeable future.MANAGEMENT BOARD UPDATEThe composition of the Company's Management Board underwent some key changes in the first half of 2023.

Cash runway into Q3 2024Full financial statements for the second quarter of 2023 will be released in the coming daysConference call scheduled for 8AM ET/2PM CET on August 4  2023NEW YORK  Aug. 03  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cellectis (the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies  today provided business updates and preliminary financial results for the six-month period ending June 30  2023. Full report of the financial results for the second quarter of 2023 will be released in the coming days.“We are proud of our team and the strong execution this quarter. Our clinical data presented for UCART22 at the European Hematology Association (EHA) were positive for patients with r/r B-ALL who have failed multiple lines of treatment including multi-agent chemoimmunotherapy  CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy  and allogeneic stem cell transplant. We are looking forward to releasing new data later this year on our UCART22 product candidate manufactured in-house ” said André Choulika  Ph.D.  Chief Executive Officer at Cellectis.“In addition  we have made progress with our pipeline in 2023 and continue to focus on our core clinical trials BALLI-01 (evaluating UCART22)  NATHALI-01 (evaluating UCART20x22) and AMELI-01 (evaluating UCART123). This quarter  Cellectis presented an encore of the clinical data on the AMELI-01 clinical trial at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) 2023 annual meeting. These preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART123 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r AML.Cellectis’ innovation team also presented preclinical data on a gene editing process to develop a bona fide HBB gene correction of sickle cell mutation  and a comprehensive analysis to better design efficient TALE Base Editors (TALE-BE) at the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy (ISCT) 2023 annual meeting. These achievements showcase once more the power of our gene-editing platform and our TALEN®  the technology of choice for therapeutic gene editing  and that we are continuing to deliver constant breakthrough innovation to treat diseases with unmet medical needs.Despite an unprecedented challenging market environment for cell and gene therapy companies  Cellectis remains focused in its mission to develop innovative cancer therapy product candidates.”Pipeline HighlightsUCART Clinical Development ProgramsBALLI-01 (evaluating UCART22) in relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL)UCART22 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD22 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r B-ALL in the BALLI-01 Phase 1/2a clinical study.On June 9  Cellectis presented updated clinical and translational data at the European Hematology Association (EHA) . These data support the preliminary safety and efficacy of UCART22 in a heavily pretreated r/r B-ALL population. UCART22 is currently the most advanced allogeneic CAR T-cell product in development for r/r B-ALL.In the poster presented at EHA  Cellectis included data from patients who received UCART22 after fludarabine  cyclophosphamide (FC) and FC with alemtuzumab (FCA) lymphodepletion (LD). Compared to the clinical update on BALLI-01 at ASH 2021  we have included data from six additional patients who received UCART22 at dose level 3 (DL3)  as of the December 31  2022 data cutoff.UCART22 administered after FC or FCA LD regimen was well tolerated. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) nor immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were observed.For FCA-dose level 3  50% of the six patients responded. Host lymphocytes remained suppressed through Day 28 for all patients who received FCA LD. Peak ferritin levels correlated with UCART22 cell expansion and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). UCART22 continues to be well tolerated  with no treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) or DLTs reported. UCART22 cell expansion was detected in 9 of 13 patients in the FCA LD arm and associated with clinical activity.The BALLI-01 study is currently enrolling patients after FCA LD with Cellectis’ in-house manufactured product. The next data set is expected to be released later this year.NATHALI-01 (evaluating UCART20x22) in relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r B-NHL)UCART20x22 is Cellectis’ first dual allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting both CD20 and CD22 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r B-NHL in the NATHALI-01 Phase 1/2a clinical study2.The NATHALI-01 clinical study is ongoing. Cellectis expects to provide first-in-human data later this year.AMELI-01 (evaluating UCART123) in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML)UCART123 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD123 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r AML in the AMELI-01 Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.On May 17  Cellectis presented an encore of the clinical data on the AMELI-01 clinical trial that were unveiled at the ASH 2022 annual meeting  at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) 2023 annual meeting. These preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART123 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r AML.The oral presentation reviewed preliminary data from patients who received UCART123 at one of the following dose levels: dose level 1 (DL1) 2.5x105 cells/kg; dose level 2 (DL2) 6.25x105 cells/kg; intermediate dose level 2 (DL2i) 1.5x106 cells/kg; or dose level 3 (DL3) 3.30x106 cells/kg after lymphodepletion with FC ([n=8]  DL1 – DL3) or FCA ([n=9]  DL2 & DL2i).The data presented showed that adding alemtuzumab to the FC LD regimen was associated with sustained host lymphodepletion and significantly higher UCART123 cell expansion  that correlated with improved anti-tumor activity.25% (n=2) of patients at DL2 in the FCA arm achieved meaningful response; one patient who failed five prior lines of therapy including allogeneic stem cell transplant experienced a durable minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete response that continued beyond 12 months  as of December 2022.The AMELI-01 study is currently enrolling patients after FCA lymphodepletion in a two-dose regimen arm.Research Data & Preclinical ProgramsUCART20x22On June 5  2023  Cellectis presented preclinical data on its product candidate UCART20x22  at the International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy (ISCT) 2023 annual event.Cellectis provided pre-clinical proof-of-concept data for UCART20x22 to overcome current mechanisms of resistance to CAR T-cell therapies in B-NHL  while providing a potential therapeutic alternative to CD19 targeting and allowing a reduction in the time from treatment decision to infusion.Cellectis demonstrated that UCART20x22 displays robust activity in vitro and in vivo  against targets expressing heterogeneous levels of CD22 and CD20. We have used in vitro cytotoxicity assays against different tumor cell lines  showing strong activity whether these cells express a single antigen (CD20 or CD22) or both antigens simultaneously  as well as IFNg release in response to antigen specific stimulation.Article published in Cancer Immunology ResearchOn May 31  2023  Cellectis published an article in Cancer Immunology Research demonstrating pre-clinical proof-of-concept data of UCART20x22 product candidate  to overcome current mechanisms of resistance to CAR T-cell therapies in B-NHL.In this study  we demonstrated that allogeneic CD20x22 CAR T-cells exhibit robust  sustained and dose-dependent activity in vitro and in vivo  while efficiently targeting primary Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma samples with heterogeneous levels of CD20 and CD22.HBB gene correction of sickle cell mutationEncouraging preclinical data on gene editing process using Cellectis TALEN® technology to develop highly efficient HBB gene correction of sickle cell mutation  were presented in a poster presentation at the ISCT 2023 annual event.These results showed that non-viral DNA delivery associated with TALEN® gene editing reduces the toxicity usually observed with viral DNA delivery and allows high levels of HBB gene correction in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells.Cellectis leveraged TALEN® technology to develop a gene editing process leading to highly efficient HBB gene correction via homology directed repair  while mitigating potential risks associated to HBB gene knock-out. Furthermore  we compared viral (TALEN-V) and non-viral (TALEN-NV) DNA template delivery strategies in mobilized healthy donor (HD) or non-mobilized homozygous sickle patient (HbSS) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).Both strategies led to high and comparable efficiencies of HBB gene correction in vitro in HD and HbSS  without affecting viability  purity or clonogenic potential of corrected HSPCs.The poster presentation highlighted the following data:TALEN®-mediated engineering efficiently corrects the mutated HBB gene in clinically relevant HSPCs and promote phenotype correction in fully mature RBCs.Cellectis optimized TALEN® gene editing process mitigates potential safety challenges by reducing the frequency of HBB gene inactivation (<10% β-thal cells).Non-viral DNA template-mediated HBB repair mitigates p53 DNA damage response activation  preserves edited LT-HSCs fitness and enables their efficient engraftment in vivo using an immunodeficient murine model.TALE Base Editors (TALE-BE)A comprehensive analysis to better design efficient TALE Base Editors (TALE-BE) using Cellectis’ TALEN® technology was presented in a poster at ISCT annual meeting.Cellectis developed a strategy that allowed to comprehensively characterize editing efficiencies in function of the TC position within the TALE-BE editing windows. This method is specifically taking advantage of the highly precise and efficient TALEN® mediated ssODN knock-in in primary T cells  allowing to focus on how target composition and spacer variations can affect TALE-BE activity/efficiency.The poster presentation highlighted the following data:Determined optimal spacer length (13/15 bp) for highly efficient TALE-BE for both C40/C40 and C11/C11 scaffolds.Determined optimal common sequence context for high editing rates.Determined that editing efficiency of the C11/C11 scaffold is highly dependent on Cytosine position requirements  resulting in more stringent activity in a context of 15 bp spacer size and decreasing the effects of bystander editing.We believe that the knowledge obtained will allow to better design efficient TALE-BE while improving the specificity profiles of this innovative editing platform.Novel treatment paradigm for successful CAR T immunotherapy against stroma-rich solid tumorsOn May 12  2023  Cellectis published an article in Frontiers Bioengineering demonstrating the efficacy of its TALEN® engineered FAP UCART-cells in cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) depletion  reduction of desmoplasia and tumor infiltration.Over 90% of epithelial cancers including breast  colorectal  pancreatic and lung adenocarcinomas express the CAF-specific surface marker  fibroblast activation protein α (FAP)  which makes it a promising CAR T-cell target. In this study  Cellectis proposed a novel and versatile approach of combination CAR T-cell therapy that can be extended to most stroma-rich cold tumors with relevant tumor-antigen targeting CAR T-cells which otherwise are recalcitrant to cell therapy.Preclinical data showed that:In a mouse xenograft model  successful implantation of injected CAFs in the tumors was confirmed by positive staining of spindle-like cells with human-specific FAP antibody  recapitulating a physiologically relevant TNBC tumor with tumor and stromal compartments.FAP UCART-cells alone significantly reduced tumor growth.In vitro and in vivo results show that FAP UCART-cells enable the reprogramming of the cold  stroma-rich triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) TME  making the tumor susceptible to subsequent Meso UCART infiltration and cytotoxicity and improving the overall antitumor activity of the treatment.In the context of combination therapy with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor  maximal anti-tumor activity and survival benefits were observed upon FAP UCART-cell treatment followed by Meso UCART-cell treatment.Licensed Allogeneic CAR T-cell Development ProgramsServier and Allogene: anti-CD19 programsAllogene announced that it is enrolling patients “in the industry’s first potentially pivotal Phase 2 allogeneic CAR T clinical trial with ALLO-501A across sites in the United States and Canada”. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently approved the ALPHA2 Clinical Trial Application (CTA).Allogene’s single-arm ALPHA2 trial in relapsed/refractory (R/R) large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) will enroll approximately 100 patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy and have not received prior anti-CD19 therapy. Allogene has announced that it expects to complete enrollment in 1H 2024 with the first data readout by the end of 2024.Long-term follow up data from the Phase 1 of Allogene’s ALPHA/ALPHA2 trials in LBCL was presented at both the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting with an encore presentation at the European Hematology Association Congress and International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma (ICML) Lugano in June 2023. The Phase 1 trials enrolled heavily pre-treated patients with a median of three prior lines of therapy. Data from 33 CAR T-naïve LBCL patients receiving Alloy™ cell product including 12 patients treated with the Phase 2 regimen  are the first to demonstrate the potential for an allogeneic CAR T product to induce complete responses at rates and durability similar to approved autologous therapies.Allogene: anti-BCMA and anti-CD70 programThe ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation of Allogene’s TRAVERSE study is enrolling patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have progressed on standard therapies including an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a VEGF-targeting therapy.Allogene’s TRAVERSE trial is now deploying an investigational in vitro companion diagnostic (IVD) assay designed to prospectively assess CD70 expression levels in patients. Allogene has announced that dose escalation in the TRAVERSE trial is expected to be completed in 2023.Corporate UpdatesOn June 28  2023  Cellectis reported results from the annual shareholders’ general meeting held on June 27  2023  at the Company’s Paris headquarters. At the meeting  during which more than 72% of shares were exercised  Resolutions 1 through 28 were adopted and resolution 29 was rejected  according to the management recommendations. The detailed results of the vote and the resolutions are available on the company’s website: https://www.cellectis.com/en/investors/general-meetings/At the end of the meeting  the terms of office of Ms. Annick Schwebig and Mr. Hervé Hoppenot ended and Ms. Annick Schwebig and Mr. Hervé Hoppenot departed the board of directors as of such date.During the annual shareholders meeting  Cécile Chartier  Ph.D.  was appointed as a director of the Cellectis’ Board of Directors  with immediate effect.Cécile Chartier currently serves as Chief Scientific Officer at NextVivo  Inc. Prior to her tenure at NextVivo  Dr. Chartier was Vice President of Research at Iovance Biotherapeutics  Inc. where she led the development of next generation tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) therapies through research to early-stage clinical trials. Cécile’s extensive experience in the development of next generation cell and gene therapies coupled with her deep knowledge of the U.S. biotechnology industry will be a huge asset to Cellectis.Financial ResultsThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis  have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”).We present certain financial metrics broken out between our two reportable segments – Therapeutics and Plants – in the appendices of this Q2 2023 financial results press release.On January 13  2023  Calyxt  Cibus Global LLC (Cibus) and certain other parties named therein  entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”)  pursuant to which  subject to the terms and conditions thereof  Calyxt and Cibus will merge in an all-stock transaction (the “Calyxt Merger”). As a consequence of the foregoing  Calyxt met the “held-for-sale” criteria specified in IFRS 5 and was classified as a discontinued operation until May 31  2023.On June 1  2023  Calyxt and Cibus closed the merger transaction and now operate under the name Cibus  Inc. Consequently  Calyxt was deconsolidated and Calyxt’s cash  cash equivalent and restricted cash are no longer included in the Group’s cash  cash equivalent and restricted cash since June 1  2023.Cash: As of June 30  2023  Cellectis  had $89 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash. This compares to $95 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31  2022. This $6 million difference mainly reflects $55 million of cash out  which include $15 million for R&D suppliers  $7 million for SG&A suppliers  $23 million for staff costs  $7 million for rents and taxes  $3 millions of reimbursement of the “PGE” loan  and a $1 million unfavorable impact on Forex partially offset by a $23 million net cash inflow from the capital raise closed in February  a $21 million net cash inflow from EIB loan  a $1 million cash inflow related to the grant and refundable advance from BPI  $2 millions of financial investments’ capital gain and interests  a $1 million reimbursement of social charges paid on stock options  and a $2 million net cash inflow from licenses and other cash receipts.Based on the current operating plan  Cellectis anticipates that the cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash as of June 30  2023 will fund Cellectis’ operations into the third quarter of 2024.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $5.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2023 compared to $6.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The decrease of $1.0 million reflects the recognition of two milestones related to Cellectis’ agreement with Cytovia for $1.5 million in 2022 and a milestone of $1.0 million with another partner while recognition of revenues in 2023 is not material  and partially offset by the increase of the research tax credit for $0.8 million and the partial recognition of a grant signed with “BPI” of $0.8 million.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $43.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $52.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $9.0 million decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a $3.4 million decrease in personal expenses due to departures not replaced (ii) a $4.7 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $28.0 million in 2022 to $23.2 million in 2023) mainly explained by internalization of our manufacturing and quality activities to support our R&D pipeline and (iii) a $0.8 million decrease of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses (from $3.1 million to $2.3 million).SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $8.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $10.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $2.0 million decrease primarily reflects (i) a $1.6 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $6.4 million in 2022 to $4.9 million in 2023) mainly explained by the implementation of our ERP in 2022 (ii) a $0.2 million decrease in personal expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.Net financial gain (loss): Consolidated net financial gain was $11.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $9.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $2.4 million increase primarily reflects (i) a $20.8 million increase of financial income  mainly attributable to the profit from Calyxt’s deconsolidation  partially offset by (ii) the loss in fair value on our retained investment in Calyxt since deconsolidation for $10.2 million  (iii) a $6.8 million decrease in the fair value of Cytovia’s note receivable.Net income (loss) from discontinued operations: Pursuant to Calyxt deconsolidation income from discontinued operation for the six-month period ended June 30  2023  2023 only include five months of activity. The $3.5 million increase of net loss from discontinued operations between the six-month period ended June 30  2022 and 2023 is primarily driven by (i) the increase of $9.2 million of net financial loss and (ii) the increase of $1.5 million of other operating expenses partially offset by (i) the decrease of $2.8 million of R&D expenses (from $6.3 million in 2022 to $3.5 in 2023) and (ii) the decrease of $4.5 million of SG&A expenses (from $6.8 million in 2022 to $2.3 million in 2023).Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $40.7 million (or $0.76 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2023  of which $35.7 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations  compared to $50.9 million (or $1.12 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2022  of which $47.3 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations. This $10.1 million decrease in net loss between the first six months of 2023 and 2022 was primarily driven by (i) a $9.0 million decrease of R&D expenses  (ii) a $2.0 million decrease of SG&A expenses and (iii) an increase of $2.4 million of the financial gain due to the deconsolidation of Calyxt compensated in part by the decrease of fair value of Cytovia’s note receivable. These downward impacts on the net loss were partially offset by (i) a decrease of $1.0 million of revenues and other income  (ii) an increase of $1.5 million of loss from discontinued operations attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $36.7 million (or $0.68 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to a net loss of $45.5 million (or $1.00 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2022.Please see “Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures” for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis for 2023 in the following areas:Supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART123  UCART22  UCART 20x22 and potential new product candidates;Operating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France)  and Raleigh (North Carolina  USA); andContinuing to strengthen our manufacturing and clinical departments.The selected  preliminary financial information set forth above are unaudited and should be considered preliminary and subject to change.

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME For the three-month period ended June 30  2023 (unaudited) - ($ in thousands except per share data) For the three-month period endedJune 30  2022 * 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (18 946 ) (10 648 ) Adjustment:Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 2 684 2 074 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (16 263 ) (8 574 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.36 ) (0.15 ) Basic adjusted earnings from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($ /share) 0.00 (0.05 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 45 497 127 55 583 768 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1) (0.36 ) (0.15 ) Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) from discontinued operations 0.02 (0.04 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 45 497 127 55 583 768*These amounts reflect adjustments made in connection with the presentation of the discontinued operationRECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME (unaudited) First six months ($ in thousands  except per share data) For the six-month period endedJune 30  2022 * 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (50 858 ) (40 715 ) Adjustment:Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 5 331 4 053 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (45 527 ) (36 662 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1.00 ) (0.68 ) Basic adjusted earnings from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($ /share) (0.95 ) (0.71 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 45 497 127 53 541 010 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1.00 ) (0.68 ) Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) from discontinued operations (0.95 ) (0.71 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 45 497 127 53 541 010*These amounts reflect adjustments made in connection with the presentation of the discontinued operationAbout CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

We have successfully implemented our R&D strategy focused on best-in-class medicines to accelerate innovation  aiming to generate short and long-term value for all our stakeholders. We are actively building a differentiated discovery pipeline of best-in-class small molecules  CAR-T cell therapies and biologicals in our core areas of immunology and oncology. In addition  our ongoing clinical programs across our therapeutic areas are progressing well  and we are optimistic about the global potential of our point-of-care CAR-T cell therapy portfolio in hematological malignancies. Furthermore  in immunology  we have continued to expand our clinical pipeline of small molecules  while leveraging our CAR-T capabilities to start clinical development in refractory systemic lupus erythematosus with a CD19 CAR-T candidate.”Half-Year 2023 operational performanceImmunology portfolioJyseleca® (filgotinib) (JAK1) Jyseleca® is reimbursed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in 19 and 18 countries respectively. Sobi 2   our distribution and commercialization partner in Eastern and Central Europe  Portugal  Greece  and the Baltic countries  launched Jyseleca® in Czech Republic and Poland in UC and in Croatia in RA. The commercial launch of Jyseleca® in Poland resulted in a €1 million milestone receivable for us in the first half of 2023. The European Commission endorsed the recommendation of the Pharmaceutical Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) to add measures to minimize risks of serious side effects with the JAK inhibitor class of medicines used for chronic inflammatory disorders. The product information for all JAK inhibitors has been updated accordingly to include these recommendations and warnings. We dosed the first patients in the pivotal Phase 3 OLINGUITO study in axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA). Based on the topline results from the Phase 3 DIVERSITY study in Crohn’s disease (CD)  we decided not to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe in this indication and not to proceed with the MAA for filgotinib in UC in Switzerland. We presented various data abstracts at the annual ECCO and EULAR congresses in Europe.Our pipeline assets First patients dosed in the Phase 2 GALARISSO study with oral  selective tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor  GLPG3667  in dermatomyositis (DM). Clinical trial application (CTA) filed to start clinical development of a CD19 CAR-T candidate in patients with refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (rSLE). Multiple small molecules programs initiated to further build our research pipeline.Oncology portfolioWe are encouraged by the initial safety  efficacy and point-of-care feasibility results we have observed in the Phase 1/2 studies with our CD19 CAR-T candidates  GLPG5101 and GLPG5201  which underscore the potential global transformational impact our differentiated approach to CAR-T cell therapy could have on patients.GLPG5101 in relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (rrNHL) We are in the final stages of the Phase 1 part of the ongoing Phase 1/2 ATALANTA-1 study  which enrolled patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma  mantle cell lymphoma and indolent lymphoma. To generate a robust data package that is informative for further development  we have decided to include more patients of certain subpopulations in the Phase 1 dose-escalation cohort of ATALANTA-1. The first patients with indolent lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma in the Phase 2 dose-expansion part of ATALANTA-1 have been dosed.GLPG5201 in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (rrCLL)  with or without Richter’s transformation (RT ) We presented promising interim safety  efficacy and point-of-care manufacturing data from 7 eligible patients 3 of the ongoing Phase 1/2 EUPLAGIA-1 study at two major scientific meetings in Europe: objective response rate of 100%; no cytokine release syndrome higher than grade 2  or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome observed. 4 We are recruiting the last patients in the Phase 1 dose-escalation part of EUPLAGIA-1 and preparations to start the Phase 2 dose-expansion cohort of the study are ongoing.We initiated multiple programs spanning various drug modalities  including biologicals  CAR-T cell therapies and small molecules  to further build our research pipeline.Corporate updateAt the Annual General Meeting held on 25 April 2023  all proposed resolutions were approved.The Board of Directors created 1 975 000 subscriptions rights under new subscription right plans.Thad Huston was appointed as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Operating Officer (COO)  succeeding Bart Filius  per 1 July 2023.The Board of Directors appointed Dr. Susanne Schaffert as non-executive independent Director by way of co-optation on 12 June 2023  replacing Dr. Rajesh Parekh who stepped down on 10 June 2023.We completed the integrated drug discovery collaboration transaction with NovAliX on 30 June 2023  effective as from 1 July 2023.

A number of key initiatives  led by the industry’s best talent  are well underway. Two months into the integration  we’ve already reached our first objectives. We will continue executing our integration plan at the same rapid pace and I am confident that we will start reaping some benefits very soon.The first results of ALD | LeasePlan as a combined entity are strong and promising  supported by a still highly favourable used car market and reflecting the unwavering commitment of our employees to achieving the best standards of service quality while transforming the company. They testify to the solidity and resilience of our business model in a rapidly changing macroeconomic environment. I have no doubt that the combined entity will be able to capitalize on this transformative deal to create value for all stakeholders.”Outlook for 2023In an economic environment marked by the continued rise in interest rates to tame inflation  economies slowed down during the first half of 2023. While supply and logistics chains continued to ease  allowing new car deliveries in Europe to recover from last year’s low levels  the production of new cars remained well below pre-Covid levels. Against this backdrop  ALD | LeasePlan continues to expect that the used car market will normalize gradually  with the exceptionally favourable supply/demand situation lasting until mid-2024 instead of end 2023  i.e. longer than previously anticipated.Leveraging on the acquisition of LeasePlan  ALD | LeasePlan expects for the full-year 2023:Funded fleet growth 8 between 2% and 4% vs. end December 2022  on the back of continued dynamic commercial activity and high order book;growth between 2% and 4% vs. end December 2022  on the back of continued dynamic commercial activity and high order book; Used Car Sales result per unit between EUR 1 200 and EUR 1 600 on average on ALD’s reported sales and c. 290 thousand vehicles sold. This guidance includes the negative impact of reduction in depreciation costs in previous quarters and reflects a progressive normalization in a still favourable market. No UCS result is assumed on LeasePlan’s Used car sales 9 ;between EUR 1 200 and EUR 1 600 on average on ALD’s reported sales and c. 290 thousand vehicles sold. This guidance includes the negative impact of reduction in depreciation costs in previous quarters and reflects a progressive normalization in a still favourable market. No UCS result is assumed on LeasePlan’s Used car sales ; Costs to achieve the integration and synergies10 between EUR 150 million and 180 million  unchanged vs. the previous estimate;Undisputed leadership in an industry where size mattersThe LeasePlan acquisition represents a step-up change  which propels the combined entity to the position of unrivalled leader in the operational leasing industry  where scale is crucial. ALD | LeasePlan ranks #1 multi-brand leasing player in 29 countries  including the top European markets  and operates a 3.4 million11 fleet  twice the size of its nearest competitor. With direct presence in 44 countries  ALD | LeasePlan’s geographical coverage is the largest in the industry. It enjoys a strong foothold in Western Europe and is well positioned in promising emerging markets all over the world.In line with its commitment to lead the transition to sustainable mobility  ALD | LeasePlan operates the #1 multi-brand EV12 fleet worldwide  with 428 thousand EVs as at 30 June 2023. Drawing on the broadest range of partnerships in the EV ecosystem and its unique capacity to address customers’ needs  ALD | LeasePlan will continue shaping the transformation of the industry.The combined entity firmly ranks #1 in the multinational segments  thanks to first-rate geographical coverage and long-standing commercial relationships. The client franchise in this category has risen from 320 clients for ALD alone to 550 clients for the combined entity  with associated fleet under management increasing from 378 thousand to 610 thousand vehicles as at 30 June 2023.The reinforced leadership positions  strong risk management  combined with the solid capital structure and potential for synergies from the acquisition have been recognized by credit rating agencies  which have awarded ALD | LeasePlan the best debt credit ratings among multi-brand leasing companies. Ratings were upgraded to the single A category just after the closing of the acquisition  allowing for more competitive funding costs and greater access to funding providers  both of which are essential in the sector. A new rating was assigned by Moody’s  namely A1  while S&P and Fitch have both upgraded their senior unsecured debt ratings to A-  corresponding to a 2-notch and 1-notch improvements respectively.First objectives achieved according to planThe integration of LeasePlan began immediately after closing  with teams of the combined entity joining forces to execute a thorough action plan. A number of objectives are already achieved only 60 days into the integration  in line with plans. Execution of the plan will continue at the same rapid pace  so that the first synergies can be delivered by the end of the year.As the LeasePlan acquisition was finalized a few months later than originally planned  ALD | LeasePlan now expects that annual run-rate synergies will be achieved by 2026 instead of 2025.CommerceALD | LeasePlan is committed to offering a seamless service and ensuring the highest level of customer satisfaction and therefore has arranged for a single team to face those clients which were previously served by both entities. Having received very positive feedback  it expects low attrition within this client segment.At the same time  sales teams have been trained on the full range of products (LCVs13  Flex  multimodality…) to capitalize on strengths and complementarities and take advantage of the multiple cross-selling opportunities offered by the combination.ProcurementProcurement is one of the main sources of synergies for the combined entity  prompting ALD | LeasePlan to start renegotiating the terms and conditions with its suppliers  leveraging on its scale. This proved successful so far  with bonus improvements already agreed by several OEMs. More recently  the first joint global tender was launched on tyres. With 4 million units purchased per annum  ALD | LeasePlan is in a strong position to improve its purchasing conditions.ALD | LeasePlan is on track to secure at least EUR 30 million of annual procurement savings by the end of 2023. This amount would progressively materialize through the income statement in 2024.OverheadsDigital & IT are key in the integration process. ALD | LeasePlan already started the convergence of IT tools and the streamlining of processes and will launch the local integration of IT by the end of the year. These initiatives will enable materializing cost synergies as from next year.Robust commercial performanceContinuing the positive trends of the previous quarters  total contracts for ALD | LeasePlan stood at 3 391 thousand as at end June 2023  up by 4.3%14 compared to end June 2022  reflecting the dynamic commercial activity. LeasePlan’s contribution amounted to 1 616 thousand contracts as at end June 2023.Full-service leasing contracts reached 2 667 thousand units as at end June 2023  up +3.0% vs. end June 2022 on a like-for-like basis  with the order book continuously at a high level.Fleet management contracts increased by +9.1% vs. June 2022  to reach 724 thousand vehicles. Year-on-year growth was primarily driven by a new banking partnership.ALD | LeasePlan continued to play a key role in clients’ transition towards sustainable mobility by leveraging their powerful EV offering (including charging). EV penetration of 32%15 of new passenger car registrations in H1 2023 progressed significantly compared to the same period last year (25% EV penetration). This outstanding performance compares very favourably to the European market at 21%16 in H1 2023. BEV17 and PHEV18 penetration stood at 19% and 13% respectively  well ahead of the market.This robust commercial performance was achieved across a more balanced geographical portfolio. ALD | LeasePlan’s diversification was enhanced by the acquisition of LeasePlan  with exposure to France  its largest market  reduced from 28% to 20% of total fleet. Similarly  the top 10 largest countries (including France) now account for 83% of total fleet  vs. 87% for ALD alone.Impacts of LeasePlan acquisition on financial statementsPerimeter effectLeasePlan is consolidated from its acquisition date  22 May 2023  i.e. for slightly more than a month in the H1 2023 income statement.The disposal of 6 entities representing c. 3% of the total combined fleet  was agreed with antitrust authorities during the LeasePlan negotiation process. Consequently  as at 30 June 2023  ALD’s entities in Portugal  Ireland and Norway (except NF Fleet Norway) and LeasePlan’s entities in Czech Republic  Finland and Luxembourg are classified as assets held-for-sale under IFRS 5. The ALD entities do not represent a major line of business or geographical area of operations and therefore are reported in the continuing activities of the Group’s income statement. LeasePlan entities do not contribute to the Group’s H1 2023 income statement  as their assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value in the Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) exercise. These 6 entities were sold to Crédit Agricole Consumer Finance and Stellantis on 1 August 2023 and hence were deconsolidated from that date.New regulatory statusUpon closing of the acquisition of LeasePlan  which holds a banking license allowing it to raise deposits  ALD SA became a Financial Holding Company supervised by the European Central Bank and subject to new regulatory requirements. Under its regulated status  ALD | LeasePlan is able to optimize its capital structure thanks to layers of hybrid capital. Additional Tier 1 is accounted for in “shareholders’ equity” while Tier 2  subscribed by the company’s parent Societe Generale  is accounted for in “borrowings from financial institutions” in the financial statements.Accounting considerationsThe Group applies the IFRS 3 “Business combinations” standard  whereby a Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) exercise is conducted. ALD | LeasePlan expects that the identification and recognition at fair value of acquired assets and liabilities will be finalized by end 2023. As a result  no profit on LeasePlan’s Used car sales was recognized since the acquisition in the H1 2023 income statement  as the fleet of LeasePlan will be assessed at fair value. Provisional goodwill as at 30 June 2023 is expected to be impacted in the full-year 2023 financial statements.Additionally  the harmonization of accounting policies and estimates across the Group is underway.Strong H1 2023 financial resultsALD | LeasePlan recorded strong H1 2023 financial results  supported by continued highly favourable used car prices and the consolidation of LeasePlan since 22 May 2023  despite the ramp-up of integration costs and the negative impact of the disposal of ALD Russia.Taken together  Leasing contract and Services margins (Total margins) reached EUR 1 255.4 million in H1 2023  an increase of 54.6%19 compared to H1 2022. Out of this amount  the contribution of LeasePlan since its acquisition on 22 May 2023 was EUR 170.1 million20. ALD total margins were stable vs. the same period last year  when adjusted for reduction in depreciation costs and non-operating items  and up by 4.5% on a like-for-like basis21 excluding the cost of Tier 2 debt22.Leasing contract margin was boosted by the reduction in depreciation costs (EUR +315.3 million vs. EUR +62.7 million in H1 2022). As a result of continued high estimated used car prices until mid-2024  depreciation has been adjusted or stopped for those vehicles whose sales proceeds are forecast to be in excess of their net book value. The depreciation curve was modified in H1 2023  taking into account the most recent fleet revaluation exercise  performed at mid-year.The reduction in depreciation costs equals the difference between the contractual amortization costs and the revised amortization cost. It anticipates in the Leasing contract margin part of Used car sales results which would otherwise be recorded later.No reduction in depreciation cost was assumed on LeasePlan’s portfolio due to the anticipation of fair value recognition in the context of the Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) exercise.Non-operating items23 impacting Leasing contract margin amounted to EUR +70.0 million (vs. EUR +47.9 million in H1 2022)  comprising:Fleet revaluation exercise 24 of EUR +17.1 million (vs. EUR +40.5 million in H1 2022);of EUR +17.1 million (vs. EUR +40.5 million in H1 2022); Hyperinflation in Turkey 25 EUR +19.8 million (vs. EUR +39.5 million in H1 2022);EUR +19.8 million (vs. EUR +39.5 million in H1 2022); Mark to market of derivatives 26 of EUR +33.1 million (vs. EUR -5.3m in H1 2022);of EUR +33.1 million (vs. EUR -5.3m in H1 2022); There was no adjustment to the provision in Ukraine accounted for in H1 2023 (vs. a EUR -26.8 million provision in H1 2022).At EUR +285.4 million in H1 2023  the contribution from Used car sales (UCS) result remained at a high level  albeit down from the historically high H1 2022 level (EUR +432.7m). The amount incorporates a negative impact of change in depreciation curve of EUR -132.0 million  as the positive impact of reduction in depreciation costs on Leasing contract margin in previous quarters anticipated some UCS profits. Due to continuing delays in car deliveries  some contracts were extended  which had a beneficial impact on UCS results.There has been no profit recorded on LeasePlan’s Used car sales since the acquisition in the H1 2023 income statement  due to the fair value recognition under the PPA. As a result  the current provisional goodwill was reduced accordingly.UCS result per unit27 on ALD’s sales came in at EUR 1 974 per unit in H1 2023 vs. EUR 3 212 per unit in H1 2022. Had ALD not recorded any reduction in depreciation costs to reflect exceptionally high used car prices in previous quarters  UCS result per unit would have stood at EUR 2 887. In Q2 2023  UCS result per unit amounted to EUR 1 346 per unit (EUR 2 614 without the impact of reduction in depreciation cost) vs. EUR 3 330 in Q2 2022.Leveraging on its efficient remarketing platform  ALD sold 145 thousand units28 in H1 2023 (not including 39 thousand vehicles sold by LeasePlan in May and June 2023) vs. 135 thousand in H1 2022. The volume increase  compared to the same period last year  is mainly driven by improved dynamics in new car deliveries.As a result of the exceptionally high used car prices  ALD | LeasePlan’s Gross Operating Income (GOI) reached EUR 1 540.8 million in H1 2023  up 23.8% vs. H1 2022. Excluding the net impact of the reduction in depreciation costs29  GOI would have increased by 14.8% vs. H1 2022.Operating expenses amounted to EUR 632.1 million in H1 2023  vs. EUR 403.7 million in the same period last year. The H1 2023 amount includes: i) a scope effect of EUR +115.5 million due to the consolidation of LeasePlan and Fleetpool  ii) LeasePlan integration costs for EUR 85.0 million and iii) transactions costs in relation to the LeasePlan acquisition and the disposal of the remedies entities for EUR 26.0 million. The company’s operating expenses include additional costs related to the new regulated status of ALD | LeasePlan.As a result  the Cost/Income ratio (excl. UCS result) stood at 50.3% in H1 2023  vs. 49.7% in H1 2022.Impairment charges on receivables came in at EUR 24.5 million in H1 2023  compared to EUR 18.9 million in H1 2022. The cost of risk30 remained low at 13 bps compared to 16 bps in H1 2022.Income tax expense increased to EUR 235.4 million  up from EUR 208.9 million in H1 2022. Effective tax rate came in at 26.3%  up from 25.4% in H1 2022.Result from discontinued operations amounted to EUR -91.3 million and was related to the disposal of ALD Russia on 20 April 2023. This amount covers: i) EUR -72 million reclassification of accumulated translation reserves into the income statement at the closing of the sale of ALD Russia (with no impact on shareholders’ equity); ii) EUR -29.2 million impairment of the net book value after tax and iii) EUR +9.9 million Q1 2023 net income reclassified from continued operations.ALD | LeasePlan’s net income (Group share)31 was strong at EUR 564.5 million in H1 2023  although down by 7.9% from the historical high of EUR 612.8 million in H1 2022.Diluted Earnings per share32 amounted to EUR 0.91 in H1 2023  vs. EUR 1.3833 in H1 2022. The change is distorted by the fact that the rights issue which financed the cash component of the LeasePlan acquisition price was settled in December 2022  while LeasePlan was consolidated only from 22 May 2023. Total balance sheet increased from EUR 31.3 billion as at 31 December 2022 to EUR 68.3 billion as at 30 June 2023  driven by the consolidation of LeasePlan. ALD | LeasePlan expects to finalize the PPA exercise  whereby acquired assets and liabilities are identified and recognized at fair value  by the end of 2023. Consequently  the related impact on provisional goodwill34 would be accounted for in the full-year 2023 financial statements.Earning Assets  at EUR 48.6 billion35  more than doubled vs. the end of 2022  underpinned by the consolidation of LeasePlan as well as higher-value vehicles and the rising share of Electric Vehicles in the funded fleet.ALD | LeasePlan’s risk-weighted assets (RWA) totalled EUR 54.3 billion36 as at 30 June 2023 under CRR2/CRD5 rules  with credit risk-weighted assets accounting for 85% of the total.ALD | LeasePlan has a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.5% and Total Capital ratio of 16.6% as at 30 June 2023. Total debt funding37 stood at EUR 47.1 billion at the end of June 2023  up from EUR 19.9 billion at the end of 2022  of which 33% consisted of loans from Societe Generale  while 24% came from deposits.As part of its active liquidity management strategy  ALD | LeasePlan continued to diversify its funding by issuing total of EUR 1 850 million bonds in H1 2023. The successful bond issues confirm the market’s solid appetite for ALD | LeasePlan debt instruments. Outstanding senior unsecured bonds now rank as Senior Preferred obligations. In the future  the combined entity intends to issue only Senior Preferred bonds on the market  through ALD S.A. as sole issuer.The combined entity has access to ample short-term liquidity  with cash holdings at Central bank reaching EUR 4.0 billion and an undrawn committed Revolving Credit Facility of EUR 1.375 billion in place.Conference call for investors and analystsDate: 3 August  at 10.00 am Paris time - 9.00 am London timeSpeakers: Tim Albertsen  CEO and Gilles Momper  CFOConnection details:Webcast: Click https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/efyyk7htConference call: FR: +33 1 70 91 87 04 UK: +44 121 281 8004 US: +1 718 705 8796 Access code: 457698Agenda18 September 2023: Capital Markets Day publicationCapital Markets Day publication 21 September 2023: Capital Markets Day presentationCapital Markets Day presentation 3 November 2023: Trading update and Q3 resultsTrading update and Q3 results 8 February 2024: Q4 and FY 2023 resultsPress contactALD Automotive | LeasePlanStephanie JonvilleALD Communication DepartmentTel.: +33 (0)6 46 14 81 90stephanie.jonville@aldautomotive.comAboutALD Automotive | LeasePlanALD Automotive | LeasePlan ALD Automotive | LeasePlan is a leading global sustainable mobility player providing full-service leasing  flexible subscription services  fleet management services and multi-mobility solutions to a client base of large corporates  SMEs  professionals and private individuals.

Group revenues contracted due to the decline in the net interest margin in France and in market activities’ revenues against a backdrop of gradual normalisation after some particularly favourable years. Operating expenses were contained despite persistent inflationary trends. The cost of risk was very low  reflecting the quality of our origination and our loan portfolio. The Group shows a solid balance sheet with a CET1 ratio at 13.1% and a robust liquidity profile. In addition  we pursued the execution of our ongoing strategic projects  notably the closing of the LeasePlan acquisition by ALD. The new management team has been fully operational since taking office on 24 May this year and is working to prepare the next chapter of the Group’s strategy. I will have the pleasure of presenting the new strategic and financial roadmap on 18 September at our Capital Markets Day to be held in London.”GROUP CONSOLIDATED RESULTSIn EURm Q2 23 Q2 22 Change H1 23 H1 22 Change Net bankingincome 6 287 6 901 -8.9% -10.3%* 12 958 13 944 -7.1% -6.8%* Underlying net bankingincome(1) 6 527 6 901 -5.4% -6.8%* 13 198 13 944 -5.3% -5.0%* Operating expenses (4 441) (4 325) +2.7% +1.1%* (9 498) (9 456) +0.4% +0.7%* Underlying operating expenses(1) (4 461) (4 450) +0.2% -1.3%* (8 662) (8 598) +0.7% +1.0%* Gross operating income 1 846 2 576 -28.3% -29.6%* 3 460 4 488 -22.9% -22.6%* Underlyinggross operating income(1) 2 066 2 451 -15.7% -16.8%* 4 536 5 346 -15.2% -14.7%* Net cost of risk (166) (217) -23.5% -23.2%* (348) (778) -55.3% -40.9%* Operating income 1 680 2 359 -28.8% -30.2%* 3 112 3 710 -16.1% -19.8%* Underlying operating income(1) 1 900 2 234 -14.9% -16.2%* 4 188 4 568 -8.3% -11.5%* Net profits or losses from other assets (81) (3 292) +97.5% +97.5%* (98) (3 290) +97.0% +97.0%* Underlying net profits or losses from other assets(1) (2) 11 n/s +0. n/s* (19) 13 n/s .n/s Income tax (425) (327) +29.9% +29.9%* (753) (660) +14.1% +7.8%* Net income 1 181 (1 256) n/s n/s 2 273 (236) n/s n/s O.w. non-controlling interests 281 255 +10.2% +1.9%* 505 454 +11.2% +6.9%* Reported Group net income 900 (1 511) n/s n/s 1 768 (690) n/s n/s Underlying Group net income(1) 1 159 1 481 -21.7% -22.1%* 2 667 3 019 -11.7% -14.5%* ROE 4.9% -12.1% 4.9% -3.5% +0.0% +0.0%* ROTE 5.6% -13.7% 5.6% -4.0% +0.0% +0.0%* Underlying ROTE(1) 7.6% 10.2% 9.1% 10.5% +0.0% +0.0%*Societe Generale’s Board of Directors  which met on 2 August 2023 under the chairmanship of Lorenzo Bini Smaghi  examined the Societe Generale Group’s results for Q2 23 and for the first half of 2023.The various restatements enabling the transition from underlying data to published data are presented in the Methodology notes in Section 9.5.Net banking incomeNet banking income decreased in Q2 23 by -8.9% (-10.3%*) vs. Q2 22  largely due to the decline in the net interest margin in French Retail Banking  a less conducive market environment in Global Banking and Investor Solutions activities and the booking of one-off items under Corporate Centre.French Retail Banking revenues fell by -13.6% vs. Q2 22 owing mainly to the decrease in the net interest margin  despite solid momentum in fees  a record performance from Private Banking and a strong increase in Boursorama’s revenues.Revenues in International Retail Banking & Financial Services grew by +6.3% (+0.9%*) vs. Q2 22  with a +3.3%* increase in revenues vs. Q2 22 in International Retail Banking  a strong performance by Financial Services that was driven by ALD revenues  up +18.7% vs. Q2 22 following the integration of LeasePlan  and by insurance revenues  which rose by +3.1%* vs. Q2 22.Global Banking & Investor Services registered revenues down -7.3% in Q2 23 relative to Q2 22 amid a less favourable market environment. Global Markets & Investor Services recorded solid revenues but which were down in comparison to a very strong Q2 22 performance (-12.7%) owing to less conducive market conditions  notably in Fixed Income and Currencies (lower interest rate volatility and slower client activity)  while Financing and Advisory continued to post revenue growth  registering an increase of +4.0% vs. Q2 22  driven by a solid performance in the securitisation  investment banking and cash management activities.Over the first half of 2023  net banking income fell by -7.1% vs. H1 22 (-5.3% on an underlying basis).Operating expensesOn a reported basis  operating expenses came to EUR 4 441 million in Q2 23  up +2.7% vs. Q2 22.

APPENDIX 2:METHODOLOGY1 - The financial information presented for the second quarter and first half 2023was examined by the Board of Directors on 2 August  2023 and has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union and applicable at that date. The limited review procedures on the condensed interim financial statements at 30 June 2023 carried by the Statutory Auditors are currently underway.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars’ net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document. The terms “Revenues” or “Net Banking Income” are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar’s net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses correspond to the “Operating Expenses” as presented in notes 5 and 8.2 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at December 31st  2022. The term “costs” is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document.4 - IFRIC 21 adjustmentThe IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e. a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed.The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (“SRF”) are part of IFRIC 21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU.5 – Exceptional items – Transition from accounting data to underlying dataIt may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment.Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar’s activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings.The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below:in EURm Q2 23 Q2 22 H1 23 H1 22 Exceptional Net banking income (+) 240 0 240 0 One-off items(1) 240 0 240 0 Exceptional operating expenses (-) (20) (125) 836 859 IFRIC linearisation (239) (284) 435 557 Transformation costs(1) 184 159 366 302 Of which related to French Retail Banking 122 97 262 201 Of which related to Global Banking & Investor Solutions 8 25 19 39 Of which related to Corporate Centre 54 37 85 62 One-off items 35 0 35 0 Exceptional Net profit or losses from other assets (+/-) 79 3 303 79 3 303 Net losses from the disposal of Russian activities(1) 0 3 303 0 3 303 Net losses from the disposal of ALD Russia(1) 79 0 79 0 Total exceptional items (pre-tax) 299 3 178 1 155 4 162 Total exceptional items (post-tax) 259 2 992 899 3 709 Reported Net income - Group Share 900 (1 511) 1 768 (690) Total exceptional items - Group share (post-tax) 259 2 992 899 3 709 Underlying Net income - Group Share 1 159 1 481 2 667 3 01976 - Cost of risk in basis points  coverage ratio for doubtful outstandingsThe cost of risk is defined on pages 42 and 691 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document. This indicator makes it possible to assess the level of risk of each of the pillars as a percentage of balance sheet loan commitments  including operating leases.In EURm Q2 23 Q2 22 H1 23 H1 22 French Retail BankingNet Cost Of Risk 109 21 198 68 Gross loan Outstandings 249 843 245 710 251 266 244 177 Cost of Risk in bp 18 3 16 6 International Retail Banking and Financial ServicesNet Cost Of Risk 83 97 174 422 Gross loan Outstandings 137 819 141 075 136 404 140 811 Cost of Risk in bp 24 28 26 60 Global Banking and Investor SolutionsNet Cost Of Risk (27) 69 (22) 263 Gross loan Outstandings 165 847 176 934 171 719 173 842 Cost of Risk in bp (7) 16 (3) 30 Corporate CentreNet Cost Of Risk 1 30 (2) 25 Gross loan Outstandings 18 873 14 943 17 705 14 678 Cost of Risk in bp 2 79 (2) 34 Societe Generale GroupNet Cost Of Risk 166 217 348 778 Gross loan Outstandings 572 382 578 662 577 093 573 508 Cost of Risk in bp 12 15 12 27The gross coverage ratio for doubtful outstandings is calculated as the ratio of provisions recognised in respect of the credit risk to gross outstandings identified as in default within the meaning of the regulations  without taking account of any guarantees provided. This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (“doubtful”).7 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on page 43 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess Societe Generale’s return on equity and return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group’s businesses  according to the principles presented on page 43 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document.Group net income used for the ratio numerator is book Group net income adjusted for “interest net of tax payable on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  interest paid to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations” and “unrealised gains/losses booked under shareholders’ equity  excluding conversion reserves” (see methodology note No. 9). For ROTE  income is also restated for goodwill impairment.Details of the corrections made to book equity in order to calculate ROE and ROTE for the period are given in the table below:ROTE calculation: calculation methodologyEnd of period (in EURm) Q2 23 Q2 22 H1 23 H1 22 Shareholders' equity Group share 68 007 65 023 68 007 65 023 Deeply subordinated and undated subordinated notes (10 815) (8 683) (10 815) (8 683) Interest payable to holders of deeply & undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisation(1) (28) (8) (28) (8) OCI excluding conversion reserves 688 577 688 577 Distribution provision(2) (982) (1 193) (982) (1 193) Distribution N-1 to be paid (441) (914) (441) (914) ROE equity end-of-period 56 430 54 801 56 430 54 801 Average ROE equity 56 334 55 009 56 203 54 887 Average Goodwill (4 041) (3 646) (3 847) (3 636) Average Intangible Assets (3 117) (2 710) (2 997) (2 729) Average ROTE equity 49 176 48 653 49 359 48 522 Group net Income 900 (1 511) 1 768 (690) Interest paid and payable to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisation (216) (159) (379) (278) Cancellation of goodwill impairment - - - 2 Ajusted Group net Income 684 (1 670) 1 390 (966) Average ROTE equity 49 176 48 653 49 359 48 522 ROTE 5.6% -13.7% 5.6% -4.0% Underlying Group net income 1 159 1 481 2 667 3 019 Interest paid and payable to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisation (216) (159) (379) (278) Cancellation of goodwill impairment - - - 2 Ajusted Underlying Group net Income 943 1 322 2 288 2 743 Average ROTE equity (underlying) 49 435 51 645 50 257 52 231 Underlying ROTE 7.6% 10.2% 9.1% 10.5%RONE calculation: Average capital allocated to Core Businesses (in EURm)In EURm Q2 23 Q2 22 Change H1 23 H1 22 Change French Retail Banking 12 338 12 296 +0.3% 12 365 12 058 +2.5% International Retail Banking and Financial Services 10 310 10 565 -2.4% 11 510 10 795 +6.6% Global Banking and Investor Solutions 14 132 14 644 -3.5% 14 347 14 385 -0.3% Core Businesses 36 780 37 505 -1.9% 38 222 37 238 +2.6% Corporate Center 19 554 17 504 +11.7% 17 981 17 649 +1.9% Group 56 334 55 009 +2.4% 56 203 54 887 +2.4%88 - Net assets and tangible net assetsNet assets and tangible net assets are defined in the methodology  page 45 of the Group’s 2023 Universal Registration Document.

The corrections made to Group net income in order to calculate EPS correspond to the restatements carried out for the calculation of ROE and ROTE.

The phased-in and fully loaded solvency ratios are presented pro forma for current earnings  net of dividends  for the current financial year  unless specified otherwise. The leverage ratio is also calculated according to applicable CRR2/CRD5 rules including the phased-in following the same rationale as solvency ratios.1011 – Funded balance sheet  loan to deposit ratioThe funded balance sheet is based on the Group financial statements. It is obtained in two steps:A first step aiming at reclassifying the items of the financial statements into aggregates allowing for a more economic reading of the balance sheet. Main reclassifications:Insurance: grouping of the accounting items related to insurance within a single aggregate in both assets and liabilities.Customer loans: include outstanding loans with customers (net of provisions and write-downs  including net lease financing outstanding and transactions at fair value through profit and loss); excludes financial assets reclassified under loans and receivables in accordance with the conditions stipulated by IFRS 9 (these positions have been reclassified in their original lines).Wholesale funding:Includes interbank liabilities and debt securities issued.Financing transactions have been allocated to medium/long-term resources and short-term resources based on the maturity of outstanding  more or less than one year.Reclassification under customer deposits of the share of issues placed by French Retail Banking networks (recorded in medium/long-term financing)  and certain transactions carried out with counterparties equivalent to customer deposits (previously included in short term financing).Deduction from customer deposits and reintegration into short-term financing of certain transactions equivalent to market resources.A second step aiming at excluding the contribution of insurance subsidiaries  and netting derivatives  repurchase agreements  securities borrowing/lending  accruals and “due to central banks”.The Group loan/deposit ratio is determined as the division of the customer loans by customer deposits as presented in the funded balance sheet.NB (1) The sum of values contained in the tables and analyses may differ slightly from the total reported due to rounding rules.(2) All the information on the results for the period (notably: press release  downloadable data  presentation slides and supplement) is available on Societe Generale’s website www.societegenerale.com in the “Investor” section.10. APPENDIX 3 : PUBLICATION OF NEW QUARTERLY SERIESSociete Generale is releasing restated quarterly statements reflecting the impacts from the merger of Societe Generale and Credit du Nord in France to create a unique brand name  SG.Following the completion of the merger of French networks in France  the Group proceeded to some non-material adjustments in its organization with the transfer of Societe des Banques de Monaco and the premium client base from Credit du Nord to private banking operations in France and the transfer of employee savings’ activities operated by Services Epargne Entreprises(11) (“S2E”) from French networks in France to insurance activities within International retail banking and financial services in order to reinforce already existing synergies with financial savings.The historical quarterly financial reporting has been restated in compliance with the following changes in governance.This organisational change comprises some immaterial adjustments to the cost sharing of some activities of Global Markets and Investor Services and Global Banking and Advisory.All of the above items have no impact on the performance of the Group nor on the Corporate Centre.The series of 2022 and Q1 23 quarterly results have been adjusted consequently and are available on the Societe Generale website.

Group revenues contracted due to the decline in the net interest margin in France and in market activities’ revenues against a backdrop of gradual normalisation after some particularly favourable years. Operating expenses were contained despite persistent inflationary trends. The cost of risk was very low  reflecting the quality of our origination and our loan portfolio. The Group shows a solid balance sheet with a CET 1 ratio at 13.1% and a robust liquidity profile. In addition  we pursued the execution of our ongoing strategic projects  notably the closing of the LeasePlan acquisition by ALD. The new management team has been fully operational since taking office on 24 May this year and is working to prepare the next chapter of the Group’s strategy. I will have the pleasure of presenting the new strategic and financial roadmap on 18 September at our Capital Markets Day to be held in London.”GROUP CONSOLIDATED RESULTSIn EURm Q2 23 Q2 22 Change H1 23 H1 22 Change Net banking income 6 287 6 901 -8.9% -10.3%* 12 958 13 944 -7.1% -6.8%* Underlying net banking income(1) 6 527 6 901 -5.4% -6.8%* 13 198 13 944 -5.3% -5.0%* Operating expenses (4 441) (4 325) +2.7% +1.1%* (9 498) (9 456) +0.4% +0.7%* Underlying operating expenses(1) (4 461) (4 450) +0.2% -1.3%* (8 662) (8 598) +0.7% +1.0%* Gross operating income 1 846 2 576 -28.3% -29.6%* 3 460 4 488 -22.9% -22.6%* Underlying gross operating income(1) 2 066 2 451 -15.7% -16.8%* 4 536 5 346 -15.2% -14.7%* Net cost of risk (166) (217) -23.5% -23.2%* (348) (778) -55.3% -40.9%* Operating income 1 680 2 359 -28.8% -30.2%* 3 112 3 710 -16.1% -19.8%* Underlying operating income(1) 1 900 2 234 -14.9% -16.2%* 4 188 4 568 -8.3% -11.5%* Net profits or losses from other assets (81) (3 292) +97.5% +97.5%* (98) (3 290) +97.0% +97.0%* Underlying net profits or losses from other assets(1) (2) 11 n/s +0. n/s* (19) 13 n/s . n/s Income tax (425) (327) +29.9% +29.9%* (753) (660) +14.1% +7.8%* Net income 1 181 (1 256) n/s n/s 2 273 (236) n/s n/s O.w. non-controlling interests 281 255 +10.2% +1.9%* 505 454 +11.2% +6.9%* Reported Group net income 900 (1 511) n/s n/s 1 768 (690) n/s n/s Underlying Group net income(1) 1 159 1 481 -21.7% -22.1%* 2 667 3 019 -11.7% -14.5%* ROE 4.9% -12.1% 4.9% -3.5% +0.0% +0.0%* ROTE 5.6% -13.7% 5.6% -4.0% +0.0% +0.0%* Underlying ROTE(1) 7.6% 10.2% 9.1% 10.5% +0.0% +0.0%*Societe Generale’s Board of Directors  which met on 2 August 2023 under the chairmanship of Lorenzo Bini Smaghi  examined the Societe Generale Group’s results for Q2 23 and for the first half of 2023.The various restatements enabling the transition from underlying data to published data are presented in the Methodology notes in Section 9.5.Net banking incomeNet banking income decreased in Q2 23 by -8.9% (-10.3%*) vs. Q2 22  largely due to the decline in the net interest margin in French Retail Banking  a less conducive market environment in Global Banking and Investor Solutions activities and the booking of one-off items under Corporate Centre.French Retail Banking revenues fell by -13.6% vs. Q2 22 owing mainly to the decrease in the net interest margin  despite solid momentum in fees  a record performance from Private Banking and a strong increase in Boursorama’s revenues.Revenues in International Retail Banking & Financial Services grew by +6.3% (+0.9%*) vs. Q2 22  with a +3.3%* increase in revenues vs. Q2 22 in International Retail Banking  a strong performance by Financial Services that was driven by ALD revenues  up +18.7% vs. Q2 22 following the integration of LeasePlan  and by insurance revenues  which rose by +3.1%* vs. Q2 22.Global Banking & Investor Services registered revenues down -7.3% in Q2 23 relative to Q2 22 amid a less favourable market environment.

APPENDIX 2: METHODOLOGY1 - The financial information presented for the second quarter and first half 2023 was examined by the Board of Directors on 2 August  2023 and has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union and applicable at that date. The limited review procedures on the condensed interim financial statements at 30 June 2023 carried by the Statutory Auditors are currently underway.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars’ net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document. The terms “Revenues” or “Net Banking Income” are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar’s net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses correspond to the “Operating Expenses” as presented in notes 5 and 8.2 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at December 31st  2022. The term “costs” is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document.4 - IFRIC 21 adjustmentThe IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e. a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed.The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (“SRF”) are part of IFRIC 21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU.5 – Exceptional items – Transition from accounting data to underlying dataIt may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment.Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar’s activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings.The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below:in EURm Q2 23 Q2 22 H1 23 H1 22 Exceptional Net banking income (+) 240 0 240 0 One-off items(1) 240 0 240 0 Exceptional operating expenses (-) (20) (125) 836 859 IFRIC linearisation (239) (284) 435 557 Transformation costs(1) 184 159 366 302 Of which related to French Retail Banking 122 97 262 201 Of which related to Global Banking & Investor Solutions 8 25 19 39 Of which related to Corporate Centre 54 37 85 62 One-off items 35 0 35 0 Exceptional Net profit or losses from other assets (+/-) 79 3 303 79 3 303 Net losses from the disposal of Russian activities(1) 0 3 303 0 3 303 Net losses from the disposal of ALD Russia(1) 79 0 79 0 Total exceptional items (pre-tax) 299 3 178 1 155 4 162 Total exceptional items (post-tax) 259 2 992 899 3 709 Reported Net income - Group Share 900 (1 511) 1 768 (690) Total exceptional items - Group share (post-tax) 259 2 992 899 3 709 Underlying Net income - Group Share 1 159 1 481 2 667 3 01976 - Cost of risk in basis points  coverage ratio for doubtful outstandingsThe cost of risk is defined on pages 42 and 691 of Societe Generale’s 2023 Universal Registration Document. This indicator makes it possible to assess the level of risk of each of the pillars as a percentage of balance sheet loan commitments  including operating leases.In EURm Q2 23 Q2 22 H1 23 H1 22 French Retail BankingNet Cost Of Risk 109 21 198 68 Gross loan Outstandings 249 843 245 710 251 266 244 177 Cost of Risk in bp 18 3 16 6 International Retail Banking and Financial ServicesNet Cost Of Risk 83 97 174 422 Gross loan Outstandings 137 819 141 075 136 404 140 811 Cost of Risk in bp 24 28 26 60 Global Banking and Investor SolutionsNet Cost Of Risk (27) 69 (22) 263 Gross loan Outstandings 165 847 176 934 171 719 173 842 Cost of Risk in bp (7) 16 (3) 30 Corporate CentreNet Cost Of Risk 1 30 (2) 25 Gross loan Outstandings 18 873 14 943 17 705 14 678 Cost of Risk in bp 2 79 (2) 34 Societe Generale GroupNet Cost Of Risk 166 217 348 778 Gross loan Outstandings 572 382 578 662 577 093 573 508 Cost of Risk in bp 12 15 12 27The gross coverage ratio for doubtful outstandings is calculated as the ratio of provisions recognised in respect of the credit risk to gross outstandings identified as in default within the meaning of the regulations  without taking account of any guarantees provided.

The leverage ratio is also calculated according to applicable CRR2/CRD5 rules including the phased-in following the same rationale as solvency ratios.1011 – Funded balance sheet  loan to deposit ratioThe funded balance sheet is based on the Group financial statements. It is obtained in two steps:A first step aiming at reclassifying the items of the financial statements into aggregates allowing for a more economic reading of the balance sheet. Main reclassifications:Insurance: grouping of the accounting items related to insurance within a single aggregate in both assets and liabilities.Customer loans: include outstanding loans with customers (net of provisions and write-downs  including net lease financing outstanding and transactions at fair value through profit and loss); excludes financial assets reclassified under loans and receivables in accordance with the conditions stipulated by IFRS 9 (these positions have been reclassified in their original lines).Wholesale funding:Includes interbank liabilities and debt securities issued.Financing transactions have been allocated to medium/long-term resources and short-term resources based on the maturity of outstanding  more or less than one year.Reclassification under customer deposits of the share of issues placed by French Retail Banking networks (recorded in medium/long-term financing)  and certain transactions carried out with counterparties equivalent to customer deposits (previously included in short term financing).Deduction from customer deposits and reintegration into short-term financing of certain transactions equivalent to market resources.A second step aiming at excluding the contribution of insurance subsidiaries  and netting derivatives  repurchase agreements  securities borrowing/lending  accruals and “due to central banks”.The Group loan/deposit ratio is determined as the division of the customer loans by customer deposits as presented in the funded balance sheet.NB (1) The sum of values contained in the tables and analyses may differ slightly from the total reported due to rounding rules.(2) All the information on the results for the period (notably: press release  downloadable data  presentation slides and supplement) is available on Societe Generale’s website www.societegenerale.com in the “Investor” section.10.

For important disclaimers and notes on the basis of preparation  please refer to page 15.Management commentsContinued global momentum  partially offset by US performance  delivered high-single digit revenue growthWe delivered a top-line increase of 7.2%  with revenue growth in more than 85% of our markets  driven by a revenue per hl increase of 9.0% as a result of pricing actions  ongoing premiumization and other revenue management initiatives. Volumes declined by 1.4%  as growth in the majority of our markets was offset by performance in the US. EBITDA increased by 5.0% with margin compression of 69bps  driven by anticipated commodity cost headwinds and increased sales and marketing investments. Underlying EPS was 0.72 USD.Progressing our strategic prioritiesWe continue to execute on and invest in three key strategic pillars to deliver consistent growth and long-term value creation.Lead and grow the category:This quarter we delivered volume growth in the majority of our markets and revenue growth in more than 85%.Digitize and monetize our ecosystem:BEES captured approximately 9.2 billion USD of gross merchandise value (GMV)  a 30% increase versus 2Q22 with 64% of our revenue through B2B digital channels. BEES Marketplace is live in 15 markets and generated an annualized GMV of approximately 1.3 billion USD with 63% of BEES customers now also Marketplace buyers.Optimize our business:In HY23  disciplined overhead management and efficient resource allocation enabled us to invest approximately 2.1 billion USD in capex and 3.5 billion USD in sales and marketing to drive the organic growth of our business. We continue to focus on deleveraging with net debt to EBITDA reaching 3.70x versus 3.86x as of 30 June 2022.Lead and grow the categoryIn HY23  we invested approximately 3.5 billion USD in sales and marketing  a 12.8% increase versus HY22  driving an increase of our portfolio brand power in approximately 60% of our key markets. We are executing on our five proven and scalable levers to drive category expansion:Inclusive Category: In 2Q23  the percentage of consumers purchasing our portfolio of brands increased across key markets in Latin America and Africa  according to our estimates. This increase in participation was led by female and lower income consumer groups  driven by continued brand and pack innovation.Core Superiority:In 2Q23  our mainstream portfolio delivered a mid-single digit revenue increase as double-digit growth in South Africa and Colombia was partially offset by the revenue decline of Bud Light in the US. Our mainstream brands gained or maintained share of segment in two thirds of our key markets  according to our estimates.Occasions Development: Our global no-alcohol beer portfolio delivered approximately 30% revenue growth this quarter  with our performance driven by Budweiser Zero in Brazil and growth of Corona Cero in Canada and Europe. Leveraging our digital direct-to-consumer products we are investing in and developing new consumption occasions. For example  in Brazil  Zé Delivery enabled the launch of Corona Sunset Hours  an everyday activation encouraging consumers to disconnect from work and reconnect with friends in the early evening.Premiumization:Our above core beer portfoliogrew revenue by more than 10% in 2Q23  led by our global brands and double-digit growth of Modelo in Mexico and Spaten in Brazil. Our global brands grew revenue by 18.4% outside of their home markets  led by Corona  which was recently recognized by Kantar BrandZ as the #1 fastest growing global beer brand by value  which grew by 23.7%. Budweiser delivered a revenue increase of 16.9%  with broad-based growth in 25 markets  and Stella Artois grew by 14.5%.Beyond Beer:Our global Beyond Beer business contributed over 385 million USD of revenue in the quarter and grew by mid-single digits as growth globally was partially offset by a soft malt-based seltzer industry in the US. Global growth was primarily driven by the expansion of Brutal Fruit in Africa and the Vicky portfolio in Mexico.Digitize and monetize our ecosystemDigitizing our relationships with more than 6 million customers globally: As of 30 June 2023  BEES is live in 23 markets with approximately 64% of our 2Q23 revenues captured through B2B digital platforms. In 2Q23 BEES had 3.3 million monthly active users and captured approximately 9.2 billion USD in gross merchandise value (GMV)  growth of 15% and 30% versus 2Q22 respectively. BEES Marketplace is live in 15 markets with 63% of BEES customers also marketplace buyers. Marketplace captured approximately 340 million USD in GMV from sales of third-party products this quarter  growth of 41% versus 2Q22.Leading the way in DTC solutions: Our omnichannel direct-to-consumer (DTC) ecosystem of digital and physical products generated revenue of more than 385 million USD in 2Q23. Our digital DTC products  Zé Delivery  TaDa and PerfectDraft are available in 20 markets  generated 16.5 million ecommerce orders and delivered over 115 million USD in revenue this quarter  representing 18% growth versus 2Q22.Optimize our businessIn HY23  disciplined overhead management and efficient allocation of resources across our operations enabled us to invest approximately 2.1 billion USD in capex and 3.5 billion USD in sales and marketing to drive the organic growth of our business  while managing the continued elevated cost environment. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio reached 3.70x versus 3.86x as of 30 June 2022  an increase versus 3.51x as of 31 December 2022 due to the seasonality of our cashflow generation. Underlying EPS was 0.72 USD  a decrease of 0.01 USD per share versus 2Q22  cycling a 0.04 USD per share net benefit from tax credits in Brazil year-over-year.Advancing our sustainability prioritiesWe continued to innovate and make progress towards our 2025 Sustainability Goals through key local initiatives with the potential to scale globally. For Climate Action  we invested in a biomass processor in our Jupille brewery in Belgium to produce thermal energy from malt husks  which is expected to reduce our gas consumption by more than 15% and lower our carbon emissions. In Sustainable Agriculture  to strengthen local supply chains we provided technical and financial training to over 900 smallholder barley farmers in Uganda. In Water Stewardship  we installed new vacuum pump technology in breweries across several markets to reduce water usage in bottle fillers by approximately 50%. For Circular Packaging  our business in Brazil launched a nationwide returnable bottle campaign to help increase the use of returnable packaging by promoting affordability and sustainability.Creating a future with more cheersIn HY23  we delivered 10.0% revenue growth and 9.1% EBITDA growth while continuing to invest for the long-term in our brands  facilities and digital transformation. We remain focused on brewing high quality beer  providing best-in-class service to our customers  generating value for our stakeholders and delivering on our purpose to create a future with more cheers.2023 Outlook(i) Overall Performance: We expect our EBITDA to grow in line with our medium-term outlook of between 4-8% and our revenue to grow ahead of EBITDA from a healthy combination of volume and price. The outlook for FY23 reflects our current assessment of inflation and other macroeconomic conditions. (ii) Net Finance Costs: Net pension interest expenses and accretion expenses are expected to be in the range of 200 to 230 million USD per quarter  depending on currency and interest rate fluctuations. We expect the average gross debt coupon in FY23 to be approximately 4%. (iii) Effective Tax Rates (ETR): We expect the normalized ETR in FY23 to be in the range of 27% to 29%.

Inflation in Argentina has accelerated over the past 12 months  resulting in a more significant impact on the organic revenue growth of AB InBev than historically. For illustrative purposes  fully excluding the Argentinean operation  2Q23 organic revenue increased for AB InBev would be 4.6% versus the 7.2% reported. For HY23 revenue growth for AB InBev would be 6.7% versus the 10.0% reported.Consolidated other operating income/(expenses) in 2Q23 increased by 26.2% primarily driven by higher government grants and the impact of disposal of non-core assets year-over-year. In HY22  Ambev recognized 201 million USD income in other operating income related to tax credits.

Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents -5 128 -3 287HY23 recorded a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 3 287 million USD compared to a decrease of 5 128 million USD in HY22  with the following movements:Our cash flow from operating activities reached 1 597 million USD in HY23 compared to 2 182 million USD in HY22. The decrease was driven by changes in working capital for HY23 compared to HY22. Changes in working capital in the first half of 2023 and 2022 reflect higher working capital levels at the end of June than at year-end as a result of seasonality.Our cash outflow from investing activities was 2 061 million USD in HY23 compared to a cash outflow of 1 917 million USD in HY22. The increase in the cash outflow from investing activities was mainly due to higher net capital expenditures in HY23 compared to HY22. Out of the total HY23 capital expenditures  approximately 33% was used to improve the company’s production facilities while 49% was used for logistics and commercial investments and 18% was used for improving administrative capabilities and for the purchase of hardware and software.Our cash outflow from financing activities amounted to 2 823 million USD in HY23  as compared to a cash outflow of 5 392 million USD in HY22. The decrease is primarily driven by lower debt redemption in HY23 compared to HY22.Our net debt increased to 73.8 billion USD as of 30 June 2023 from 69.7 billion USD as of 31 December 2022.Our net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio was 3.70x as of 30 June 2023. Our optimal capital structure is a net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio of around 2x.We continue to proactively manage our debt portfolio. 96% of our bond portfolio holds a fixed-interest rate  42% is denominated in currencies other than USD and maturities are well-distributed across the next several years.As of 30 June 2023  we had total liquidity of 16.9 billion USD  which consisted of 10.1 billion USD available under committed long-term credit facilities and 6.8 billion USD of cash  cash equivalents and short-term investments in debt securities less bank overdrafts.NotesTo facilitate the understanding of AB InBev’s underlying performance  the analyses of growth  including all comments in this press release  unless otherwise indicated  are based on organic growth and normalized numbers. In other words  financials are analyzed eliminating the impact of changes in currencies on translation of foreign operations  and scope changes. Scope changes represent the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  the start or termination of activities or the transfer of activities between segments  curtailment gains and losses and year over year changes in accounting estimates and other assumptions that management does not consider as part of the underlying performance of the business. The organic growth of our global brands  Budweiser  Stella Artois and Corona  excludes exports to Australia for which a perpetual license was granted to a third party upon disposal of the Australia operations in 2020. All references per hectoliter (per hl) exclude US non-beer activities. Whenever presented in this document  all performance measures (EBITDA  EBIT  profit  tax rate  EPS) are presented on a “normalized” basis  which means they are presented before non-underlying items. Non-underlying items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the Company. They are presented separately because they are important for the understanding of the underlying sustainable performance of the Company due to their size or nature. Normalized measures are additional measures used by management and should not replace the measures determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company’s performance. As from 1 January 2023  mark-to-market gains/(losses) on derivatives related to the hedging of our share-based payment programs are reported in the non-underlying net finance income/(cost). The 2022 presentation was amended to conform to the 2023 presentation. We are reporting the results from Argentina applying hyperinflation accounting since 3Q18. The IFRS rules (IAS 29) require us to restate the year-to-date results for the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency  using official indices before converting the local amounts at the closing rate of the period. These impacts are excluded from organic calculations. In HY23  we reported a negative impact on the profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev of 35 million USD. The impact in HY23 underlying EPS was -0.02 USD. Values in the figures and annexes may not add up  due to rounding. 2Q23 and HY23 EPS is based upon a weighted average of 2 016 million shares compared to a weighted average of 2 012 million shares for 2Q22 and HY22.Legal disclaimerThis release contains “forward-looking statements”.

Target Returns The Company has a target annual net total return on the Company's NAV of between 6% and 9% per annum  which  until 21 September 2022  included quarterly dividends with a target yield each financial year of 6% (the equivalent of 6 pence per Ordinary Share) or higher  of the Issue Price*. On 21 September 2022  the annual target dividend was changed to 7% (the equivalent of 7 pence per Ordinary Share) or higher  of the Issue Price. The change became effective from the dividend declared in respect of the 3-month period ended 30 September 2022. On 24 February 2023  a further increase in the annual target dividend to 8% was agreed  (the equivalent of 8 pence per Ordinary Share) or higher  of the Issue Price. The change became effective from the dividend declared in respect of the 3-month period ended 31 March 2023. The increases in the annual target yield are intended to increase the rate of return to investors during the financial year  following recent increases in global interest base-rates. Ongoing Charges Ongoing charges for the year ended 31 March 2023 have been calculated in accordance with the Association of Investment Companies (the ""AIC"") recommended methodology. The ongoing charges for the year ended 31 March 2023 were 0.97% (31 March 2022: 0.97%). * The Issue Price being £1.00. This is a target only and not a profit forecast. There can be no assurance that this target will be met or that the Company shall pay any dividends at all. This target return should not be taken as an indication of the Company's expected or actual current or future results. The Company's actual return will depend upon a number of factors  including the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding and the Company's total expense ratio  as defined by the AIC's ongoing charges methodology. Potential investors should decide for themselves whether or not the return is reasonable and achievable in deciding whether to invest in or retain or increase their investment in the Company.

CHAIR'S STATEMENT for the year ended 31 March 2023 Bronwyn Curtis OBE In my capacity as Chair of the Board of Directors of TwentyFour Income Fund Limited  I am pleased to present my report on the Company's progress for the year ended 31 March 2023. Investment Performance The dividends declared by TFIF during the year ended 31 March 2023 were 9.46 pence per ordinary share  with 7.27p per ordinary share paid during the year  which is an excellent result for a period when equities  bonds and property have all been weak. The strategy of investing in higher yielding floating rate asset backed securities in a rising interest rate environment has enabled the Company to deliver these attractive dividends  as all excess investment income is paid out each year. We have also been able to increase the target base  annual income distribution for TFIF   initially to 7p in September 2022  and then to 8p per ordinary share in February 2023 (from 6p at the start of the year)  paid on a quarterly basis. Any additional income generated over and above the 8p will continue to be paid out in the final dividend. The market volatility seen in all fixed income products did impact the Company's NAV and share price. TFIF delivered a share price total return of positive 0.87% and the total return of the net asset value was negative 3.61%. Despite this difficult environment  TFIF shares mostly traded at a premium and 79.1m TFIF shares were issued during the financial year. The portfolio did not see any material interest deferrals or defaults during this financial year. The Company raised a net £34m at the triennial share realisation opportunity in October 2022 as demand for tendered shares in the subsequent placing programme exceeded supply. It was one of the few successful fund raisings that month in the London market  as it took place around the time of the UK mini budget when market turmoil was at its height. Market Overview The Russian invasion of Ukraine just prior to the start of the Company's financial year caused credit spreads to widen as risk sentiment in all markets deteriorated quickly. The Company did not have any direct or indirect exposure to Russia or Ukraine and  to date  has not had any direct impact from the various sanctions imposed on Russia. The resulting increase in energy prices caused inflation to surge to the highest level for 40 years and central banks responded by rapidly increasing key interest rates. As the Company invests in floating rate bonds  this has had a significant positive impact on income; all investments are either made in GBP or hedged back to GBP  so the income of the Company effectively tracks the Bank Rate set by the Bank of England. High interest rates and inflation  however  have put pressures on the cost of living  but as UK and European labour markets are still very tight and wage growth has been substantial  UK and European mortgage arrears remain at historically low levels. Non-prime consumer and auto loan arrears have started to increase and the Portfolio Manager has therefore increased the allocation towards other secured assets. The market turmoil following the UK mini budget resulted in the highest selling pressure in the European and UK Asset Backed Securities market since the Global Financial Crisis. With UK pension funds in need of liquidity  the Portfolio Manager saw this as an excellent opportunity to invest at yields not seen since the Company's launch in 2013  and the Board was supportive of the Portfolio Manager's decision to temporarily increase gearing to buy higher rated bonds that were accretive to the income. This was a liquidity event and the temporary sell off was not due to concerns about credit quality. In March 2023 bank debt spreads widened significantly after the collapse of various US regional banks and the unprecedented write-off of Credit Suisse contingent convertible bonds  which were ranked junior to shareholders in a surprise move by the Swiss regulator. Whilst RMBS are issued by banks (and other non-bank lenders) to fund mortgages  these loans have no exposure to the balance sheet of the originating banks  and the Board recognised the strong performance of the asset class during this period of broader market volatility. Dividend The Company distributes all its investment income to ordinary shareholders. In the current market the Company is targeting quarterly payments equivalent to at least 8p per year. The fourth interim dividend is used to distribute any residual income generated in the year. As mentioned above  dividends paid by the Company in the year ended 31 March 2023 totalled 7.27p per ordinary share. The increase in dividends this year was driven by two main factors; the increase in the UK Bank Rate (which rose by 3.5% from 0.75% to 4.25% in the year to 31 March 2023)  and the effect of bond amortisations and share issuance which enabled the Portfolio Manager to invest at the prevailing higher bond yields that were more accretive to the income of the Company. Premium/Discount and Share Capital Management The share price started the year at an 4.85% discount to NAV mainly due to market sentiment following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However  from summer 2022 the shares have traded consistently at a 1-2% premium  except for a very short period after the UK mini budget  and a brief fall over the year end date to -0.47%. Discounts in the UK Investment Company sector have widened significantly at the time of writing and the board has been having regular discussions with the Company's broker to determine if any additional discount control measures will be required to help mitigate volatility in the Company's share price. Shares were issued to shareholders to an amount of 79 094 006 in the 12 months to 31 March 2023  of which £34m was in relation to the excess demand for shares at the realisation event  and £4m was raised through numerous ongoing tap issues throughout the year. The Board is grateful for the continued support from our investors  and has approved a continued share issuance program to reflect the continued investment opportunities in this sector. Annual General Meeting The Company's 2023 Annual General Meeting (""AGM"") will be held at the offices of Northern Trust International Fund Administration Services (Guernsey) Limited  Trafalgar Court  Les Banques  St Peter Port  Guernsey  Channel Islands on 14 September 2023 at 12:30 pm. Board Composition I assumed the Chair position on 14 October 2022  having joined the Board as Chair-elect on 12 July 2022. The former Chair  Trevor Ash stepped down as Chair- at the AGM  along with Ian Burns  who retired from his position as Senior Independent Director and Audit Chair  both having served on the Board since January 2013. John Le Poidevin has taken over as Audit Chair  and Joanne Fintzen became the Senior Independent Director during the year. John de Garis assumed the role of Chair of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee during the year. In line with the succession planning for Richard Burwood  Paul Le Page joined the Board on 16 March 2023. Richard will step down at the Company's forthcoming AGM. I would like to thank Trevor  Ian  and Richard for their hard work and valued contribution to the Company during their tenures on the Board. I have every confidence that the Shareholders are in very good hands with an experienced Board of diverse skills. The changes to the Board composition over the period have ensured that the Company is represented by an appropriate breadth of skills  diversity and knowledge. Realisation Opportunity As reported in the Company's Interim Financial Statements  the triennial share realisation opportunity took place in October 2022. It is very pleasing to note that the net fund raising that resulted was one of the very few successful fund raisings in October 2022 in the London market. The Board sees this result  against a very difficult back-drop  as a vote of confidence by our investors in the Company's investment strategy. Only 1.5% of shares were redeemed  whilst a net additional £34 million of share capital was raised as a result of the process. Corporate Events The Company was promoted to the London Stock Exchange's FTSE 250 index following the quarterly reshuffle  effective 16 September 2022. The Board welcomed the promotion as a positive development  increasing the Company's stock market profile and helping to diversify the investor base. Outlook Inflation and recessionary fears  in addition to the ongoing problems in commercial real estate and banks  are likely to persist into the 2023/24 financial year  and market volatility is likely to remain elevated. Current valuations reflect modest recessionary yields  so the Company is  in our view  in a good position to benefit from potential market dislocations. While a deterioration of fundamental performance of the investment asset class of the Company is expected (mostly co-related to unemployment  house prices  corporate earnings and defaults) the Board remains confident in the Portfolio Manager's underwriting and stress testing which the Board believes to be instrumental to avoiding bond defaults and significant price drops  especially as an economic recession is becoming more likely. The Company's income is expected to continue to benefit whilst interest rates in the UK and Europe remain elevated. Bronwyn Curtis OBEChair17 July 2023 PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S REPORTfor the year ended 31 March 2023 TwentyFour Asset Management LLP In our capacity as Portfolio Manager to the TwentyFour Income Fund Limited  we are pleased to present our report on the Company's progress for the year ended 31 March 2023. Investment Background For the first half of the reporting period (into autumn of 2022) market sentiment as a whole remained very weak across all fixed income markets during what has been a period of elevated volatility  characterised by risk-off direction  challenging liquidity  the ongoing conundrum of interest rates policy  inflation and recessionary fears  the escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict and its associated energy supply/cost concerns. This was punctuated by the disastrous UK mini budget causing extreme moves in UK Gilt yields and the ensuing liability-driven investment (""LDI"") liquidity-driven bond sell off. Amidst this we did see short periods of stability  which in turn gave rise to windows of opportunity in both primary and secondary markets. Conditions recovered towards the calendar year-end as market activity shifted in line with economic data and more benign central bank rhetoric. The start of 2023 saw markets get off to the strongest start to a year since 2019  as a number of the issues that had driven risk appetite in 2022 started to ease  although after a strong rally in most parts of financial markets in January  February and March marked a return to more negative broader market investor sentiment. Renewed inflation fears and strong labour markets in the US  UK and Europe lowered the likelihood of a dovish pivot by the central banks in the near term. For primary ABS markets  issuance was a little bifurcated; the start of the Russia/Ukraine conflict and developing challenges in tech and crypto markets saw a hiatus in issuance in March 2022 but sentiment recovered quite quickly and April provided an attractive opportunity for investors looking to add floating rate exposure following the Bank of England moving ahead with rate hikes. The month was very busy across all asset classes  even as spreads widened across the capital stack  but was followed by a virtual slowdown in May  and then a small rebound in June. Despite the ongoing market volatility and weaker views  several issuers placed deals in July ahead of the summer. While August proved to have a relatively more constructive tone but was typically quiet with virtually no primary issuance. September saw a modicum of normality returning to the primary pipeline  allowing issuers to price deals into a receptive investor base early in the month. However  market conditions deteriorated sharply later in the month  triggered by the UK mini budget  and issuance ceased abruptly forcing one UK prime RMBS issuer to retain a deal it had planned to sell. Secondary markets also sold off heavily  more than wiping out the gains from the rally earlier in the month. The subsequent stress in Gilts and wider rates markets was compounded by the now well-documented bond sales by pension funds running LDI strategies. The ABS market saw extremely high levels of secondary sales in the run-up to month-end; over €4bn of sales went through the typical BWIC (""bids wanted in competition""  meaning a request for bids submitted by an investor to a number of dealers) in the last week of the month  more than in the previous three months combined. In the main  most of the selling activity was concentrated in senior AAA and AA RMBS/ABS/CLOs and Australian RMBS. Execution was good on the whole in terms of volumes traded as investors with cash to spend were able to add bonds at yields not seen for many years (excluding the small window at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic)  and dealers were seen to be providing liquidity in selective and preferred asset classes. Pricing clarity was challenging but spreads could broadly be characterised as having widened by 50-75bp in seniors and 3-7 price points lower in mezzanine bonds. The volume of RMBS/ABS and CLOs sold on publicly offered BWICs was unprecedented over a three week period  comfortably in the region of around €6bn  and not including similar-sized volumes which were reported to have traded bilaterally. Selling began to subside towards the latter part of October 2022 as markets became more orderly  although some selling moved on to mezzanine lists. Interestingly  not a large amount of sub-investment grade was offered for sale  endorsing the fact that the sell-off was purely a drive for liquidity from a relatively small group of investors and nothing at all to do with any credit performance concerns. Encouragingly  whilst spreads were understandably wider (although no wider than any comparable markets such as covered bonds or financials)  all the selling volume was absorbed and any liquidity fears that may have lingered about European ABS and CLOs has been well and truly erased. In fact  anecdotal accounts of sellers being unable to source liquidity in corporate bonds and turning to ABS to achieve it were heard repeatedly. The typically higher cash price of ABS (due to their floating rate nature  and therefore immunisation from interest rate duration) meant they were an attractive  if not the ""go to"" asset to sell in these markets as the sales had a lower P&L impact - arguably making ABS an unintended victim of its own success. Secondary markets dominated ABS and CLO trading flows during October and November in the absence of much primary issuance. Rishi Sunak's appointment in late October 2022 reassured markets  and the CLO market saw the first rumblings of primary issuance after a very quiet period. A handful of deals priced in October 2022 with several more being announced into a marketing phase. Challenges remained around the arbitrage; the rising weighted average cost of capital (to as high as 350bps) being considerably higher than the average 160-180 average range in 2021. This is due to the cost of the liabilities  mainly the AAA tranches still clearing around +220 discount margin (""dm"")  however there were windows where the underlying loan prices sold off enabling managers to add collateral. Primary ABS issuance remained fairly muted again into year-end 2022 as issuers had previously pushed back plans and although there were some notably large  and upsized liquid deals from UK and European Prime issuers during the period all of which were very well received. In contrast  the CLO market saw eight new deals price in November 2022  on the heels of a fairly buoyant October 2022  for a notional value of around €3bn which proved to be the busiest month since March. Secondary markets saw a much better tone into the year end after the havoc inflicted by the LDI sell off in the previous 6 or 7 weeks. Spreads  by and large  retraced across all sectors with most of the tightening seen in the investment grade space  whilst sub-investment grade lagged a little into the month end. This brought the overall volume of placed issuance for the calendar year to around €80bn including €26bn in CLOs. RMBS accounted for €32bn of issuance with the rest split between Autos and Consumer at €18bn. The year also saw a drop in CMBS primary to just €0.9bn. While this overall number was the second lowest annual total in the post-2008 period  it could be suggested that given the macro backdrop over the course of 2022  it was actually a reasonable outcome  as evidenced by the strong levels of investor interest in deals that came to market during the windows of opportunity. Spread performance in general over the month was positive with a noticeable investor bias to add risk in both CLOs and ABS. BWIC volumes returned to a degree of normality and execution prices remained strong throughout the month. Following on from similar generic moves seen in November  this put the market on a reasonably positive footing going into 2023. Underlying performance of assets for 2022 remained strong although expectations remained that there would be some consumer deterioration given the economic backdrop. The primary market saw a solid start to 2023 with a small handful of deals; the main themes during the first two months were a very strong spread performance across all asset classes  with the understandable exception of CMBS  and a lot of demand for bonds across nearly all rating bands. Notably two UK Prime deals saw very high levels of demand from investors with over-subscription levels of approximately three times. The pricing represented a tightening of 11 bps versus a benchmark deal that printed at the end of 2022 which in the AAA Prime sector is a strong rally in spreads terms. Mezzanine tranches too provided useful pricing points for market participants where bonds were available. Secondary ABS market spreads began the year on a stable footing and initially lagged slightly  but as the wider credit market compression theme filtered through  the direction quickly changed driving a strong risk rally across securitised products. This was also helped by the supply-demand technical  driven by low-ish and orderly primary issuance together with an atypical month of supply in BWIC volume of around €1bn all seeing healthy demand. Secondary CLO spreads saw strong performance with steady tightening throughout February. Also during February 2023 the ABS market saw Blackstone default on a single loan within a CMBS transaction (the loan being for Finnish offices) after it failed to get bondholder approval for a maturity extension. Whilst the Company doesn't have exposure to this transaction  and we are aware the income from tenants is enough to service the debt and the LTV on the mortgage is low  we will be following the process closely. The Portfolio Managers have been cautious on CMBS for some time and after a full sector review  sold various deals in the second half of last year. An active March 2023 in primary markets quickly unravelled as the US and European banking ""hiccup"" struck financial markets mid-month  which put paid to any further issuance until the last week of the month as spreads widened in quick order and borrowers waited to observe market developments. The ABS market bounced back reasonably quickly to the extent that BMW was able to place a £400m deal into the UK together with another Prime Auto deal in Germany  and a Green RMBS deal in Spain both placed by month end as ABS spreads  in general  retraced nearly all of their intra-month widening. On the CLO side  issuance remained fairly muted for another month with the sector now having seen just below €7bn of issuance year to date. Overall issuance volume for the first quarter of 2023 was a reasonable €20bn including CLOs. Performance Review The Company started the reporting period just after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia  meaning the risk sentiment in the credit and equity markets changed significantly as investors sought liquidity. Additionally  general risk sentiment had evolved due to expectations of high inflation  increasing interest rates and the general higher risk of a slowdown of the UK and European economies. Following a brief relief during the summer  floating rate fixed income markets were again faced with a large liquidity event  which was the result of the UK mini-budget as GILT yields increased significantly and UK pension funds had to sell assets to settle margin calls on their books. During this period there were no defaults in the portfolio  however  spreads had widened for most of the first six months of the financial year. As risk appetite returned in October  spreads retraced roughly half of this spread widening in the second half of the Company's financial year. For the Company  this resulted in increased NAV volatility  particularly due to the negative performance of CLOs through the Period as they correlated with High Yield corporate bonds  demonstrating significant volatility showing negative performance. In October 2022 CLO spreads briefly reached 1100 and 1650bps for BB and B rated bonds  but spreads rapidly contracted in the first quarter of 2023. CMBS showed similar negative performance over this 12 month period  but credit spreads in the sector didn't significantly tighten as concerns over (global) commercial real estate valuations increased and this was reflected in bond valuations. The Portfolio Manager viewed the illiquidity following the UK mini-budget  and the following spread widening  as an opportunity to buy assets (predominantly BBB to B rated UK and Dutch RMBS and BB rated CLOs) and increased fund leverage in the fourth quarter of 2022 to fund these purchases. This leverage was reduced in the first quarter of 2023 when credit spreads tightened and the Portfolio Manager sought to lock in this performance. As the Portfolio Manager views a future recession in the UK and Europe as very likely  overall positioning has changed to a focus on secured collateral (RMBS and CLOs) over unsecured consumer loans and SMEs  from Western European countries and they have further improved the average rating of the underlying portfolio. As SONIA has continued to increase through the year  the NAV has benefited from increasingly higher coupon payments. The total NAV performance for the year was -3.61%. The Company's NAV per Share ended at 100.89 from 112.45 at the start of the period  with dividends totalling 7.27p paid during the period. Portfolio Allocation Secondary spreads which had been relatively stable and constructive earlier in April widened  driven by an elevated amount of ABS selling from macro and institutional investors in order to fund fixed income outflows amid broader volatility. Combined with the substantial primary supply  this took spreads to levels not seen since the COVID sell-off. Bank trading desks had little appetite to add risk in any fixed income product and investors were able to pick and choose selectively where to add risk at higher yields. This allowed the investment team of the Portfolio Manager to gradually increase the purchase yield of the portfolio  over and above the natural yield increase generated by the rises in interest rates. Outlook Floating rate ABS began 2023 well placed with a strong income component through high spreads and increased base rates with more rises expected. Performance caught up in the first two months of the year  spreads remain wider. Highlights for the sector are expected to include robust deal performance across mortgages although some weakness is expected in consumer pools. CMBS is expected to be the weakest performer  with Credit Real Estate (""CRE"") valuations decreasing  and we anticipate selective loans with short maturities will face refinancing challenges. Other sectors are expected to perform well. Liquidity conditions have been restored after Q3 volatility and 2023 so far has seen strong and active investor participation  which we expect to continue. Default rates and ratings are expected to outperform in ABS relative to credit markets. We anticipate volatility to remain a theme through this late cycle phase and assets with stronger liquidity characteristics are preferred. EU ABS issuance has surprised to the upside so far in 2023  despite demand driven reductions in lending in Europe  as early year tightening of spreads has accelerated issuer plans. Bank issuance has begun to represent a larger share. This is expected to continue but predicated by the potential for disruption by wider market events.

Business Model and Strategy The Company is a closed-ended investment company  incorporated with limited liability in Guernsey. The Company has been granted exemption from income tax within Guernsey and the Directors intend to continue to operate the Company so that this tax-exempt status is maintained. Investment Objectives and Policy The Company's investment objective and policy is set out in the Summary Information. The strategy for the Company is to target less liquid  higher yielding asset backed securities. These securities  whilst fundamentally robust  do not offer enough liquidity for use in the typical daily mark-to-market UCITs funds  but are well suited to a traded closed-ended vehicle  where investors can obtain liquidity by trading shares on the London Stock Exchange. The view of the Board is that this part of the fixed income market has been largely overlooked and therefore represents attractive relative value. High Income The Company's income consists wholly or mainly of investment income and the Ordinary Shares are designed to offer a high dividend yield. The Board intends to distribute substantially all of the Company's income after expenses and tax to the holders of the Ordinary Shares  paying quarterly interim dividends with equal amounts paid in June  September and December each year  with a final dividend paying any remaining income being paid in March. The full year dividend per share for 2023 totalled 9.46p (2022: 6.77p) representing 99.89% of the total comprehensive income for the year. This is in accordance with the dividend policy approved by shareholders at an extraordinary shareholders meeting in May 2019. Long Term Growth in Capital Value The asset value of the Company's portfolio is heavily influenced by external macro-economic factors. The Directors meet with the Portfolio Manager regularly to discuss the portfolio. Additional details are covered in the Chair's Statement and Portfolio Manager's Report. Future Prospects The Board's main focus is to generate attractive risk adjusted returns principally through income distributions. The future of the Company is dependent upon the success of the investment strategy. The investment outlook and future developments are discussed in both the Chair's Statement and the Portfolio Manager's Report. The Board meets at least annually  to consider the long-term strategy of the business  incorporating presentations and discussion on longer-term opportunities and threats to the business. Focus is placed on principal and emerging risks which have the potential to disrupt the business model. Business Environment Principal Risks  Emerging Risks and Uncertainties The Board is responsible for the Company's system of internal financial and reporting controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board is satisfied that by using the Company's risk matrix as its core element in establishing the Company's system  internal financial and reporting controls while monitoring the investment limits and restrictions set out in the Company's investment objective and policy  that the Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company. The Board also regularly meets to discuss any emerging risks affecting the Company and to establish effective controls to manage them. The below risks are all considered principal risks affecting the Company. Market Risk and Investment Valuations Market risk is the risk associated with changes in market factors including spreads  interest rates  economic uncertainty  changes in laws and political circumstances. Due to inflation concerns and existing geo-political tensions  both the UK and Europe could go into a prolonged recessionary period  therefore  risk premiums demanded by the market could continue to rise as risk sentiment deteriorates and wider spreads could result in lower cash prices. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the portfolios may not be able to sell securities at a given price and/or over the desired timeframe. Investments made by the Company may be relatively illiquid. Some investments held by the Company may take longer to realise than others and this may limit the ability of the Company to realise its investments and meet its target dividend payments in the scenario where the Company has insufficient income arising from its underlying investments. Credit Risk and Investment Performance (Issuer) Credit risk arises when the issuer of a settled security held by the Company experiences financing difficulties or defaults on its payment obligations resulting in an impact to the security market price. The Company holds Asset Backed Securities which comprises debt securities issued by companies  trusts or other investment vehicles which  compared to bonds issued or guaranteed by governments  are generally exposed to greater risk of default in the repayment of the capital provided to the issuer or interest payments due to the Company. The amount of credit risk is indicated by the issuer's credit rating which is assigned by one or more internationally recognised rating agencies. This does not amount to a guarantee of the issuer's creditworthiness but generally provides a strong indicator of the likelihood of default. Securities which have a lower credit rating are generally considered to have a higher credit risk and a greater possibility of default than more highly rated securities. There is a risk that an internationally recognised rating agency may assign incorrect or inappropriate credit ratings to issuers. Issuers often issue securities which are ranked in order of seniority which  in the event of default  would be reflected in the priority in which investors might be paid back. Whilst they have been historically low since the inception of the Company  the level of defaults in the portfolio and the losses suffered on such defaults may increase in the event of adverse financial or credit market conditions. In the event of a default under an Asset Backed Security  the Company's right to financial recovery will depend on its ability to exercise any rights that it has against the borrower under the insolvency legislation of the jurisdiction in which the borrower is incorporated. As a creditor  the Company's level of protection and rights of enforcement may therefore vary significantly from one country to another  may change over time and may be subject to rights and protections which the relevant borrower or its other creditors might be entitled to exercise. Information regarding investment restrictions that are currently in place in order to manage credit risk can be found in note 17. Foreign Currency Risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk through its investments in predominantly Euro-denominated assets. The Company's share capital is denominated in Sterling and its expenses are incurred in Sterling. The Company's financial statements are presented in Sterling. Amongst other factors affecting the foreign exchange markets  events in the Eurozone may impact upon the value of the Euro which in turn will impact the value of the Company's Euro-denominated investments. The Company manages its exposure to currency movements by using spot and forward foreign exchange contracts  which are rolled forward periodically. Counterparty Credit Risk Where a market counterparty to an Over the Counter (OTC) derivative transaction fails  any unrealised positive mark to market profit may be lost. The Company mitigates this risk by only trading derivatives against approved counterparties which meet minimum creditworthiness criteria and by employing central clearing and margining where applicable. Settlement Risk Settlement Risk is the risk of loss associated with any security price movements between trade date and eventual settlement date should a trade fail to settle on time (or at all). The Company mitigates the risk of total loss by trading on a delivery versus payment (DVP) basis for all non-derivative transactions and central clearing helps to ensure that trades settle on a timely basis. Reinvestment Risk The Portfolio Manager is conscious of the challenge to reinvest any monies that result from principal and income payments and to minimise reinvestment risk. Cash flow analysis is conducted on an ongoing basis and is an important part of the Portfolio Management process  ensuring such proceeds can be invested efficiently and in the best interests of the Company. The Portfolio Manager expects £123.9m of assets to have a Weighted Average Life of under 1 year. While market conditions are always subject to change  the Portfolio Manager does not currently foresee reinvestment risk significantly impacting the yield nor affecting each quarter's minimum dividend and recognises the need to be opportunistic as and when market conditions are particularly favourable in order to reinvest any proceeds or in order to take advantage of rapidly evolving pricing during periods of market volatility. Operational Risks The Company is exposed to the risk arising from any failures of systems and controls in the operations of the Portfolio Manager  Administrator  AIFM  Independent Valuer  Custodian and the Depositary amongst others. The Board and its Audit Committee regularly review reports from key service providers on their internal controls  in particular  focussing on changes in working practices. The Administrator  Custodian and Depositary report to the Portfolio Manager any operational issues for final approval of the Board as required. Accounting  Legal and Regulatory Risks The Company is exposed to the risk that it may fail to maintain accurate accounting records or fail to comply with requirements of its Admission document and fail to meet listing obligations. The accounting records prepared by the Administrator are reviewed by the Portfolio Manager. The Portfolio Manager  Administrator  AIFM  Custodian  Depositary and Corporate Broker provide regular updates to the Board on compliance with the Admission document and changes in regulation. Changes in the legal or the regulatory environment can have a major impact on some classes of debt. The Portfolio Manager monitors this and takes appropriate action. Income Recognition Risk The Board considers income recognition to be a principal risk and uncertainty. The Portfolio Manager estimates the remaining expected life of the security and its likely terminal value  which has an impact on the effective interest rate of the Asset Backed Securities which in turn impacts the calculation of interest income. This risk is considered on behalf of the Board by the Audit Committee as discussed below and is therefore satisfied that income is appropriately stated in all material aspects in the Financial Statements. Cyber Security Risks The Company is exposed to risk arising from a successful cyber-attack through its service providers. The Company requests of its service providers that they have appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate the risk of cyber-attacks (including minimising the adverse consequences arising from any such attack)  that they provide regular updates to the Board on cyber security  and conduct ongoing monitoring of industry developments in this area. The Board is satisfied that the Company's service providers have the relevant controls in place to mitigate this risk. Geopolitical Risk and Economic Disruption The Company is exposed to the risk of geopolitical and economic events impacting on the Company  Portfolio Manager and Shareholders  including disruption arising from the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic  elevated levels of global inflation  recessionary risks and the current war in Ukraine. The Company does not hold any assets in Ukraine  Belarus or Russia  however  the situation in the region and wider geo-political consequences remain volatile and the Board and Portfolio Manager continue to monitor the situation carefully and will take whatever steps are necessary and in the best interests of the Company's Shareholders. This includes but is not limited to ensuring that the requirements of all international sanctions are adhered to and ensuring that the Portfolio Manager  Administrator and other key suppliers continue to operate all protections  protocols and monitoring of heightened cyber threats. The Company's key suppliers do not have operations in Ukraine  Russia and Belarus and there is not expected to be any adverse impact from military operations on the activity  process or procedures of the Company. Climate Change Risk Climate change risk is the risk of the Company not responding sufficiently to pressure from stakeholders to assess and disclose the impact of climate change on investment portfolios and address concerns on what impact the Company and its portfolio has on the environment. Regular contact is maintained by the Portfolio Manager and Broker with major stakeholders and the Board receives regular updates from the Portfolio Manager on emerging policy and best practice within this area and can take action accordingly. Environmental  Social  and Governance (""ESG"") factors are assessed by the Portfolio Manager for every transaction as part of the investment process. Specifically for ABS  for every transaction an ESG assessment is produced by the Portfolio Manager and an ESG score is assigned. External ESG factors are factors related to the debt issuers of ABS transactions and they are assessed through a combination of internal and third-party data. Climate risks are incorporated in the ESG analysis under environmental factors and taken into consideration in the final investment decision. CO2 emissions are tracked at issuer and deal level where information is available. Given the bankruptcy-remoteness feature of securitisation transactions the climate risks which the manager considers more relevant and that are able to potentially impact the value of the investment are the ones related to the underlying collateral which include physical and transitional risks. Those risks are also assessed and considered as environmental factors in the ESG analysis. Board Diversity When appointing new Directors and reviewing its composition  the Board considers  amongst other factors  diversity  balance of skills  knowledge  gender  social and ethnic background and experience. As at 31 March 2023  the Board is comprised of two female and four male Directors  which is expected to be a temporary situation whilst the Board is going through a transitionary period of Director rotation and retirements. The Board notes the New Listing rules published in April 2022 andbelieves that the Company meets the diversity targets required. The Company has no employees. The Board believes it is fully compliant with Listing Rules LR 9.8.6R(9) and LR 14.3.33R(1) in relation to board diversity which are: At least 40% of the Board are women (currently 2 out of 6 Directors are female  but one male Director is due to retire at the next AGM);At least one senior position held by a woman ( Bronwyn Curtis is currently Chair and Joanne Fintzen is the current Senior Independent Director); andAt least one individual on the board to be from a minority ethnic background (please see table below). Additional detail is set out in the table below: Name Gender Ethnicity Bronwyn Curtis Female White European Richard Burwood Male White British John de Garis Male White British Joanne Fintzen Female British/European Indian Paul Le Page Male White British John Le Poidevin Male White British Environmental  Social and Governance The Board recognises the importance of Environmental  Social and Governance (""ESG"") factors in the investment management industry and the wider economy as a whole. The Company is a closed-ended investment company with a limited purpose and without employees. As such  it is the view of the Board that the direct environmental and social impact of the Company is limited and that ESG considerations are most applicable in respect of the asset allocation decisions made for its portfolio. The Company has appointed the Portfolio Manager to advise it in relation to all aspects relevant to the Investment Portfolio. In keeping with the Board's expectation that ESG factors be taken into account  the Portfolio Manager has a formal ESG framework which incorporates ESG factors into its investment process. The Portfolio Manager has an ESG Committee representing all areas of its business  reports into the Portfolio Manager's Executive Committee. While there are no official ESG guidelines  the Portfolio Manager considerers ESG factors for every asset which it purchases on behalf of the Company and attributes internal scores to the assets in the Portfolio. The Company does not have executive directors or employees. It has entered into contractual arrangements with a number of third party service providers  all of which have confirmed to the Company that they have appropriate ESG policies in place. Service Providers Further details of the ESG policies and practices of the Portfolio Manager can be found at: www.twentyfouram.com/responsible-investment-policy www.twentyfouram.com/corporate-social-responsibility www.twentyfouram.com/esg-at-twentyfour-integration-and-engagement The Board undertakes annual due diligence on  and ongoing monitoring of  all such Service Providers including obtaining a confirmation that each such Service Provider complies with relevant laws  regulations and good practice The Administrator is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Northern Trust Corporation  which has adopted the UN Global Compact principles  specifically: implementing a precautionary approach to addressing environmental issues through effective programs  undertaking initiatives that demonstrate the acknowledgement of environmental responsibility  promoting and using environmentally sustainable technologies  and UN Sustainable Development Goals  specifically: using only energy efficient appliances and light bulbs  avoiding unnecessary use and waste of water  implementing responsible consumption and production  and taking action to reduce climate change. Engagement and Voting Wherever possible  on behalf of its investors  the Company is committed to actively engaging at a corporate  industry and regulatory level. The Company has contracted the Portfolio Manager to perform this function. It is noted that the Investment Portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed income assets. The voting rights attributable to these types of securities are usually limited in scope  and the opportunity to engage at a corporate level shall therefore  in most cases  be via interaction with senior management of companies during the due diligence process. A copy of the Portfolio Manager's Engagement Policy can be found at https://www.twentyfouram.com/engagement-at-twentyfour. The Company engages on behalf of its investors at industry and regulatory level primarily through its Service Providers  including the Portfolio Manager  the Administrator  and through the Company's membership of the Association of Investment Companies. Under the AIC Code  in the event that 20% or more of the Shareholder votes are cast against a Board recommendation for a resolution  the Company should explain  when announcing the voting results  what actions it intends to take to consult Shareholders in order to understand the reasons behind the result and following such consultation  should provide a final summary to Shareholders and in the next annual report. There is nothing to report in respect of the Shareholder votes held in the year. Position and Performance PRIIPs KIDs The Company has published a Key Information Document (""KID"") in compliance with the Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (""PRIIPs"") Regulation. The KID can be found on the Company website at the web address below: www.twentyfouram.com/funds/twentyfour-income-fund/fund-literature/ The process for calculating the risks  cost and potential returns are prescribed by regulation. The figures in the KID may not reflect the expected returns for the Company and anticipated returns cannot be guaranteed. Key Performance Indicators (""KPIs"") At each Board meeting  the Directors consider a number of performance measures to assess the Company's success in achieving its objectives. Below are the main KPIs which have been identified by the Board for determining the progress of the Company: Net Asset ValueEarnings/(Loss) Per ShareShare PriceDiscount/Premium to Net Asset ValueOngoing ChargesDividends Declared Net Asset Value The Net Asset Value (""NAV"") per Ordinary Share  including retained earnings  at 31 March 2023 was 100.97p  based on net assets as at this date of £724 982 762 divided by number of Ordinary Shares in issue of 718 036 661 (31 March 2022: 112.45p based on net assets of £718 477 218 divided by number of Ordinary Shares in issue of 638 942 655). The financial year of the Company started just after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia  meaning the risk sentiment in the credit and equity markets changed significantly as investors sought liquidity. Additionally  general risk sentiment has evolved due to expectations of high inflation  increasing interest rates and the general higher risk of a slowdown of the UK and European economies. Following a brief relief during the summer  floating rate fixed income markets were again faced with a large liquidity event  which was the result of the UK mini-budget as Gilt yields increased significantly and UK pension funds had to sell assets to settle margin calls on their books. During this period there were no impairments to the portfolio  however  spreads widened for most of the first half year. But as risk sentiment returned in October  spreads retraced roughly half of the spread widening in the second half of the year. As SONIA has continued to increase through the year  the NAV has benefited from increasingly higher coupon payments. The total NAV performance for the year was -3.61%. Additionally  the Company has paid out all of its income as dividend (9.46p) and this has had an impact on the NAV. Share Price The Share Price is the price per share per Ordinary Share trading on the London Stock Exchange. On 31 March 2023  the share price was 100.50p (31 March 2022: 107.00p). (Loss)/Earnings per Ordinary Share - Basic and Diluted (Loss)/Earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the net loss for the year of £22 595 345 (31 March 2022: net gain of £36 303 495) by the weighted average number of shares for the year of 664 696 773 (31 March 2022: 512 445 511). The net loss for the year has been primarily driven by a decrease in unrealised gains on investments. Market sentiment is discussed in further detail within the Chair's statement. Discount/Premium to NAV The discount/premium to NAV is a percentage difference in the share price per share to the net asset value per share. It is calculated by subtracting the share price from the NAV per share and dividing it by the NAV per share. If the share price is lower than the NAV per share  the shares are trading at a discount. If the share price is higher than the NAV per Share  the shares are trading at a premium. On 31March 2023  the discount to NAV was 0.47% (31 March 2022: discount of 4.85%). Ongoing Charges Ongoing charges for the year ended 31 March 2023 have been calculated in accordance with the Association of Investment Companies (the ""AIC"") recommended methodology. The ongoing charges represent the Company's management fee and all other operating expenses  excluding finance costs  share issue or buyback costs and non-recurring legal and professional fees  expressed as a percentage of the average of the weekly net assets during the year. The ongoing charges for the year ended 31 March 2023 were 0.78% (31 March 2022: 0.97%). The ongoing charges were calculated as follows: 31.03.2023 31.03.2022 £ £ Ongoing Charges Average NAV for the year (a) 670 955 356 576 399 204 Total expenses 6 828 728 5 571 225 Less: Expenses not recognised as part of the AIC Ongoing Charges Methodology (287 931) (130) Total recognised expenses (b) 6 540 797 5 571 095 Ongoing Charges (b/a) 0.97% 0.97% Dividends Until 21 September 2022  the Company maintained a dividend target of 6 pence  per Ordinary Share  per year in accordance with the Company's prospectus. On 21 September 2022  the dividend target increased to 7 pence  per Ordinary Share per year and on 24 February 2022  it increased further to 8 pence per Ordinary Share per year. If the minimum target of 6p for the year is not met  a Continuation Vote is required. The dividend yield for the year ended 31 March 2023 was 9.41% (31 March 2022: 6.77%) meaning that the Company met its dividend target for the current year. During the year  the following dividends were declared: Period to Dividend rate per Share (£) Net dividend payable (£) Ex-dividend date Record date Pay date 30 June 2022 0.0150 9 584 140 21 July 2022 22 July 2022 5 August 2022 30 September 2022 0.0175 11 198 996 20 October 2022 21 October 2022 4 November 2022 31 December 2022 0.0175 12 268 142 19 January 2023 20 January 2023 3 February 2023 31 March 2023 0.0446 32 483 815 20 April 2023 21 April 2023 3 May 2023 The Directors will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the dividend policy. Viability Statement Under the UK Corporate Governance Code  the Board is required to make a ""Viability Statement"" which considers the Company's current position  principal risks  emerging risks and uncertainties combined with an assessment of the prospects of the Company in order to be able to state that they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and that the business model is viable over the period of their assessment. The Board considers that three years is an appropriate period to assess the viability of the Company given the uncertainty of the investment world and the strategy period. In selecting this period  the Board considered the environment within which the Company operates and the risks associated with the Company. The Company's prospects are driven by its business model and strategy. The Company's aim is to provide investors with an attractive level of income with a high degree of certainty around that income and a focus on capital preservation in uncertain times  by investing in less liquid  high yielding asset backed securities. The Board's assessment of the Company over the three year period has been made with reference to the Company's current position and prospects  the Company's strategy  and the Board's risk appetite having considered each of the Company's principal risks  emerging risks and uncertainties summarised above. The Board has also considered the Company's expected cash flows  income flows  its likely ability to pay dividends and analysis of the portfolio with reference to: liquidity analysis  including but not limited to  the changes in liquidity of the Company over time based on the liquidity of the underlying assets;foreign exchange analysis  including but not limited to  monitoring the effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange hedging strategy;credit analysis  including but not limited to  analysing the current credit ratings and credit rating outlooks of the underlying securities by the main rating agencies  as well as sufficient diversification across sectors;valuation analysis  including but not limited to  assessing the pricing accuracy of the underlying securities; andsignificant accounting judgements  estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  the fair value of securities not quoted in an active market  estimated life of asset backed securities and determination of observable inputs. In this context  the Board's central case is that the prospects for economic activity will remain such that the investment objective  policy and strategy of the Company will be viable for the foreseeable future through a period of at least three years from the year ended 31 March 2023. In making this judgement  the Board has assessed that the main risks to the viability of the Company are key global and market uncertainties driven by factors external to the Company which in turn can impact on the liquidity and NAV of the investment portfolio.A simulation has been designed to estimate the impact of these uncertainties on the NAV of the Company at times of stress  based on historical performance data  using techniques which analyse how changes in the Company's ability to generate income (by assessing different levels of reinvestment rates available as well as changes in FX and interest income generation  over a 3-year period) would impact the annual dividend the Company is able to generate. All of the foregoing has been considered against the background of the Company's dividend target. Key assumptions covered by the Board in relation to the viability of the Company include: Dividend Target The ongoing viability of the Company and the validity of the going concern basis depend on the Company meeting its dividend target annually during the three-year period. In the event that the Company does not meet the dividend target annually  as disclosed in note 20  during the three-year period an Ordinary Resolution will be put to the Shareholders  at the AGM following any reporting period in which the minimum dividend target of 6p per year is not met  with the continuation vote requirements set out in note 17. During the year  the annual dividend target was increased  as outlined on Summary Information. The Company's ability to continue to meet its dividend target is further disclosed in the Chair's Statement. Realisation Opportunity The next Realisation Opportunity is due to occur just after the AGM in Autumn 2025. The Board's view is that should the share price remains at the current levels  relative to the NAV  they would not expect to see a major incentive to redeem. Whilst there is no degree of certainty  rather like the Realisation Opportunity that occurred during 2022  there may be some redemption requests. In the past  these have been matched by secondary selling of the redeemed shares to new purchasers. It is believed the Realisation Opportunity is currently a low risk to the viability prospects of the Company. Market Uncertainty In the prior year  most sectors saw negative return on the NAV per Ordinary Share  as a result of spread widening  the negative contribution was largest for RMBS at -2.09% followed by CLOs at -1.37%. Volatility during the 1 year period (monthly returns) was relatively high for the NAV per Ordinary Share compared to historical periods  at 3.00%. Risk of Credit Losses The risk of credit impairment and losses increased due to the risk of default  caused by higher levels of inflation and increasing global interest rates. The Portfolio Manager continues to stress test the holdings of the Company  under scenarios that specifically address the impact of these significant economic events on individual loan pools  and analyse the performance of the underlying investments. The Portfolio Manager remains of the view that there is no material risk of credit issues on any holdings in the portfolio  and the rapid price recovery seen since October 2022 support their view at the time that  relying on their stress modelling  the material price moves seen were largely attributable to market liquidity rather than concerns around credit performance. Between 31 March 2023 and the date of signing  the Company's portfolio witnessed no defaults and no deferrals of interest payments. Section 172 Statement Although the Company is domiciled in Guernsey  the Board has considered the guidance set out in the AIC Code in relation to Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 in the UK. Section 172 of the Companies Act requires that the Directors of the Company act in the way they consider  in good faith  is most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of all stakeholders  including suppliers  customers and shareholders.

Business Review The Company TwentyFour Income Fund Limited (the ""Company"") was incorporated with limited liability in Guernsey  as a closed-ended investment company on 11 January 2013. The Ordinary Shares of the Company were listed with a Premium Listing on the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange on 6 March 2013. Investment Objective and Policy The Company's investment objective and policy is set out in the Summary Information. Acquisition of UK Mortgages Limited Assets during the prior year On 8 February 2022  the Company announced that it had agreed terms of a proposed acquisition of the assets of UK Mortgages Limited  (the ""Scheme""). The Scheme was to be effected through the reconstruction of UKML  consisting of the winding up of UKML  the transfer of the assets of UKML to the Company and the issue of new Ordinary Shares by the Company to the shareholders of UKML. Under the terms of the Scheme  the assets of UKML were placed into a ""Rollover Pool"" for transfer to the Company  with cash and other net current assets placed into a ""Liquidation Pool"" in order to meet any outstanding UKML current and future liabilities. The Company and UKML agreed to bear their own costs in relation to the Scheme. The proposed acquisition value was 84p per UKML share  less the costs of UKML in relation to the Scheme and the retention to meet both unknown and ascertained liabilities  divided by the total number of UKML shares in issue (excluding any UKML shares held in treasury by UKML) as at 18 March 2022 (the ""Calculation Date"")  subject to certain adjustments in accordance with the Scheme. On 3 March 2022  the Company published a prospectus on the proposed Scheme  along with a timetable. On 18 March 2022  it was announced that the Shareholders of both UKML had approved the Scheme by a special resolution. Trading in UKML shares was suspended on the same day. On 23 March 2022  the Boards of both UKML and the Company announced the final Scheme entitlements as at the Calculation Date. The Company issue price at that date  per new Ordinary Share of the Company  to be issued to shareholders of UKML  was £1.1421. The acquisition value per UKML share was £0.8331. 130 427 846 new Ordinary Shares of the Company were issued under the Scheme to former shareholders of UKML. The new Ordinary Shares issued by the Company were admitted to the London Stock Exchange the following day  with share certificates dispatched the week commencing 28 March 2022. The total value of assets transferred were: 4 Profit Participating Notes (""PPNs"") valued at £87.1 million (consisting of RMBS assets); Listed notes of £19.0 million and cash of £38.5 million. Discount/Premium to NAV The Board monitors and manages the level of the share price discount/premium to NAV. In managing this  the Company operates a share buyback facility whereby it may purchase  subject to various terms as set out in its Articles and in accordance with The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  up to 14.99% of the Company's Ordinary Shares in issue immediately following Admission for trading on the London Stock Exchange. On 22 August 2022  a Realisation Opportunity was made under which investors were offered an opportunity to realise all or part of their Shareholding in the Company  with Shareholders opting to redeem 9 582 068 Ordinary Shares for a consideration of £8 814 544. Subsequently  a Realisation Opportunity  where Shareholders of the Company (the ""Shareholders"") may apply to redeem shares up to 56 days before the relevant annual general meeting date of the Company (the ""Reorganisation Date"")  will be offered at the annual general meeting of the Company every three years subject to the aggregate NAV of the continuing Ordinary Shares on the last Business Day before Reorganisation being not less than £100 million. The next Realisation Opportunity is due to take place in Autumn 2025. Shareholder Information Shareholder information is set out in the Summary Information. Going Concern The Directors believe that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements in view of the Company's holdings in cash and cash equivalents and the liquidity of investments and the income deriving from those investments  meaning the Company has adequate financial resources and suitable management arrangements in place to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements. The Company also achieved its dividend target of 6 pence per Ordinary Share per year  for the year ended 31 March 2023  meaning that as per the Company's Articles  a Continuation Vote is not required. The Company's continuing ability to meet its dividend target  along with the Company's ability to continue as a going concern  in light of the external geo-political and macro factors  the increased risk of default due to rising inflation  increasing global interest rates and the next Realisation Opportunity has been considered as part of the Viability Statement. No material doubts to going concern have been identified. On 31 March 2023  the Company's cash balance was 3.76% of total net assets (2022: 8.31%). Post-year end  the Company has maintained a positive cash balance and continues to meet liabilities when they fall due. The Portfolio Manager considers that cash management plays a key part in the management of the Company and continuingly monitors liabilities  including the Company's quarterly dividends. Results The results for the year are set out in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Directors proposed dividends of £65 494 843 in respect of income available for distribution earned during the year ended 31 March 2023  a breakdown of which can be found in note 20. Dividends paid during the year amounted to £47 555 276 as recognised in the Statement of Changes in Equity. Income available for distribution in any quarter comprises (a) the accrued income of the portfolio for the period  and (b) an additional amount to reflect any income purchased in the course of any Ordinary Share subscriptions that took place during the period (so as to ensure that the income yield of the shares is not diluted as a consequence of the issue of new shares during an income period) and (c) any income on the foreign exchange contracts created by the risk-free rate differentials between each foreign currency pair  less (d) total expenditure for the period. Portfolio Manager The Company entered into a Portfolio Management Agreement with TwentyFour Asset Management LLP  the Portfolio Manager  on 29 May 2014. Pursuant to this agreement  the Portfolio Manager is entitled to a portfolio management fee paid monthly in arrears  at a rate of 0.75% per annum of the lower of NAV  which is calculated as of the last business day of each month  or market capitalisation of each class of shares.

On 25 October 2022 the Board purchased the following Ordinary Shares in the Company as part of the Redemption Placing shares  made available on the market as part of the Realisation Opportunity: Price per Total Name Allocation (Ordinary Shares) share (pence) Consideration £ Bronwyn Curtis 105 313 94.95 100 000 Richard Burwood 21 062 94.95 20 000 Joanne Fintzen 21 062 94.95 20 000 John de Garis 21 062 94.95 20 000 John Le Poidevin 236 956 94.95 225 000 Corporate Governance The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance and has implemented a framework for corporate governance which it considers to be appropriate for an investment company in order to comply with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ""UK Code""). The Company is also required to comply with the Code of Corporate Governance (the ""GFSC Code"") issued by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission. The UK Listing Authority requires all UK premium listed companies to disclose how they have complied with the provisions of the UK Code. This Corporate Governance Statement  together with the Going Concern Statement  Viability Statement and the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities indicate how the Company has complied with the principles of good governance of the UK Code and its requirements on Internal Control. The Company is a member of the AIC and by complying with the 2019 AIC Code of Corporate Governance (""the AIC Code"") is deemed to comply with both the UK Code and the GFSC Code. The Board has considered the principles and recommendations of the AIC Code and considers that reporting against these will provide appropriate information to Shareholders. To ensure ongoing compliance with these principles the Board reviews a report from the Corporate Secretary at each quarterly meeting  identifying how the Company is in compliance and identifying any changes that might be necessary. The AIC Code and the AIC Guide are available on the AIC's website  www.theaic.co.uk. The UK Code is available in the Financial Reporting Council's website  www.frc.org.uk. Throughout the year ended 31 March 2023  the Company has complied with the recommendations of the 2019 AIC Code and thus the relevant provisions of the UK Code  except as set out below. The UK Code includes provisions relating to: The role of the Chief Executive;Executive Directors' remuneration;Annually assessing the need for an internal audit function; andThe means for the workforce to raise concerns. For the reasons set out in the AIC Guide  the Board considers the first three provisions are not relevant to the position of the Company as it is an externally managed investment company. The Company has therefore not reported further in respect of these provisions. The fourth point is not applicable to the Company  as it has no employees. The Board established a Nomination and Remuneration Committee  which held its first meeting on 14 March 2023. Prior to that date  the Board  as a whole  fulfilled the function of a Nomination and Remuneration Committee. Details of compliance with the AIC Code are noted below. There have been no other instances of non-compliance  other than those noted above. The Company's risk exposure and the effectiveness of its risk management and internal control systems are reviewed by the Audit Committee at its meetings and at least annually by the Board. The Board believes that the Company has adequate and effective systems in place to identify  mitigate and manage the risks to which it is exposed. Role  Composition and Independence of the Board The Board is the Company's governing body and has overall responsibility for maximising the Company's success by directing and supervising the affairs of the business and meeting the appropriate interests of Shareholders and relevant stakeholders  while enhancing the value of the Company and also ensuring protection of investors. A summary of the Board's responsibilities is as follows: statutory obligations and public disclosure;strategic matters and financial reporting;risk assessment and management including reporting compliance  governance  monitoring and control; and other matters having a material effect on the Company. The Board's responsibilities for the Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements are set out in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities. The Board currently consists of six non-executive Directors  all of whom are considered to be independent of the Portfolio Manager and as prescribed by the Listing Rules. The Board considers it has the appropriate balance of diverse skills and experience  independence and knowledge of the Company and the wider sector  to enable it to discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively and that no individual or group of individuals dominates decision making. The Chair is responsible for leadership of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness. Joanne Fintzen has served as Senior Independent Director  following the retirement of Ian Burns. Chair The Chair is Bronwyn Curtis  who took over the role on 14 October 2022  following the retirement of Trevor Ash. The Chair of the Board must be independent for the purposes of Chapter 15 of the Listing Rules. Bronwyn Curtis is considered independent because she: has no current or historical employment with the Portfolio Manager; andhas no current directorships in any other investment funds managed by the Portfolio Manager; Biographies of all the Directors can be found in Board Members. Board Role and Composition The Board is required to ensure that the Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements  taken as a whole  are fair  balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for Shareholders to assess the Company's position and performance  business model and strategy. In seeking to achieve this  the Directors have set out the Company's investment objective and policy and have explained how the Board and its delegated Committees operate  and how the Directors review the risk environment within which the Company operates and set appropriate risk controls. Furthermore  throughout the Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements the Board has sought to provide further information to enable Shareholders to have a fair  balanced and understandable view. The Board has contractually delegated responsibility for the management of its investment portfolio  the arrangement of custodial and depositary services and the provision of accounting and company secretarial services. The Board is responsible for the appointment and monitoring of all service providers to the Company. The Directors are kept fully informed of investment and financial controls and other matters by all services providers that are relevant to the business of the Company and should be brought to the attention of the Directors. The Board has adopted a policy on the tenure of its independent Directors that aligns with the AIC Code of Corporate Governance (""the Code"") that none of the Directors  including the Chair of the Board should serve for more than 9 years  even though the Board considers that boards of investment companies are more likely to benefit from a director's long association with a company in that they will experience a number of investment cycles. During the year  two Directors who had been appointed on the incorporation of the Company retired: Trevor Ash; and Ian Burns. One of the current Directors  Richard Burwood  was appointed on the incorporation of the Company and he will retire as a Director  at the 2023 AGM. The Board has also given careful consideration to the recommendations of the Davies Review and their implementation. The Board has reviewed its composition and believes that the current Board mix  allied to its recruitment plans  provide an appropriate range of skills  experience and diversity. The Board is committed to continuing its implementation of the recommendations of the Davies Review as part of its succession planning over future years and by complying with the disclosure requirement of DTR 7.2.8 in terms of the Company's diversity policy. The Board holds quarterly Board meetings  to discuss general management  structure  finance  corporate governance  marketing  risk management  compliance  asset allocation and gearing  contracts and performance. The quarterly Board meetings are the principal source of regular information for the Board enabling it to determine policy and to monitor performance  compliance and controls but these meetings are also supplemented by communication and discussions throughout the year. A representative of the Portfolio Manager  AIFM  Administrator  Custodian and Depositary and Corporate Broker attend each Board meeting either in person or by telephone  thus enabling the Board to fully discuss and review the Company's operation and performance. Each Director has direct access to the Portfolio Manager and Company Secretary and may  at the expense of the Company  seek independent professional advice on any matter. The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year  the Management Engagement Committee meets at least once a year and a dividend meeting is held quarterly. In addition  ad hoc meetings of the Board to review specific items between the regular scheduled quarterly meetings can be arranged. Between formal meetings  there is regular contact with the Portfolio Manager  AIFM  Administrator  Custodian and Depositary and the Corporate Broker. Attendance at the Board and Committee meetings during the year was as follows: Quarterly Board Meetings Audit Committee Meetings Management Engagement Committee Meetings Remuneration and Nomination Committee Ad hoc Committee Meetings Held Attended Held Attended Held Attended Held Attended Held Attended Bronwyn Curtis 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 8 5 John Le Poidevin 4 4 3 3 1 1 1 1 11 11 Trevor Ash 2 1 1 - 1 1 - - 6 2 Ian Burns 2 2 1 1 1 1 - - 6 5 Richard Burwood 4 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 11 11 John de Garis 4 4 3 3 1 1 1 1 11 11 Joanne Fintzen 4 4 3 3 1 1 1 1 11 9 Paul Le Page 1 1 1 1 - - 1 1 - - The number of meetings held indicates the meetings held during each Director's membership of the relevant Board or Committee during the year ended 31 March 2023. In addition to the scheduled Board and Committee meetings  11 ad hoc Committee of the Board meetings were held during the year which were attended by those Directors available at the time. Board Performance and Training During the year  the Board commissioned a review of its performance by external evaluation practitioner Trust Associates Limited. The review determined the Board's approach to corporate governance and its supervision of its regulatory compliance to be good. The review also determined the Board to be effective with independent thought and action with the right balance of skills and experience necessary for its proper functioning and the safeguarding of Shareholders' interests. Re-Election of Directors Under the terms of their appointment  each Director is required to seek re-election on an annual basis. At the 14 October 2022 Annual General Meeting  Bronwyn Curtis was elected to the Board and all other continuing Directors were re-elected. Trevor Ash and Ian Burns  did not seek re-election. At the Company's next AGM  Paul Le Page will seek election and Richard Burwood will not seek re-election. The Company may terminate the appointment of a Director without compensation immediately on serving written notice. UK Criminal Finances Act 2017 In respect of the UK Criminal Finances Act 2017 which introduced a new Corporate Criminal Offence of `failing to take reasonable steps to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion'  the Board confirms that it is committed to zero tolerance towards the criminal facilitation of tax evasion. The Board also keeps under review developments involving other social and environmental issues  such as the General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"")  which came into effect on 25 May 2018  and Modern Slavery  and reports on those to the extent they are considered relevant to the Company's operations. There are no findings to report at year end. Board Committees and their Activities Terms of Reference All Terms of Reference of the Board's Committees are available from the Administrator upon request. Management Engagement Committee The Board has established a Management Engagement Committee which meets at least once a year and comprises the entire Board  with Richard Burwood serving as Chair. Its formal duties and responsibilities include the regular review of the performance of and contractual arrangements with the Portfolio Manager and other service providers and the preparation of the Committee's annual opinion as to the Portfolio Manager's services. The Management Engagement Committee carried out a review of the performance and capabilities of the Portfolio Manager and other service providers at its 20 September 2022 meeting and recommended the continued appointment of TwentyFour Asset Management LLP as Portfolio Manager is in the interest of Shareholders. The Management Engagement Committee also recommended that the appointment of all the Company's current service providers should continue. Audit Committee The Audit Committee comprises the entire Board  with the exception of the Chair of the Board  with John Le Poidevin acting as Chair since the retirement of Ian Burns on 14 October 2022. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee provide that the Committee shall be responsible  amongst other things  for reviewing the Interim and Annual Financial Statements  considering the appointment and independence of the external auditor  discussing with the external auditor the scope and results from the audit and reviewing the Company's compliance with the AIC Code. Further details on the Audit Committee can be found in the Audit Committee Report. Remuneration and Nomination Committee The Remuneration and Nomination Committee has been established consisting of all Directors. John de Garis has served as chair since its establishment. The Committee met for the first time on 15 March 2023  where the Committee approved its Terms of Reference and a succession plan to replace Richard Burwood  following his imminent retirement at the next AGM. International Tax Reporting For purposes of the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act  the Company registered with the US Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") as a Guernsey reporting Foreign Financial Institution (""FFI"")  received a Global Intermediary Identification Number (8V9U53.99999.SL.831)  and can be found on the IRS FFI list. The Common Reporting Standard (""CRS"") is a global standard developed for the automatic exchange of financial account information developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (""OECD"")  which has been adopted in Guernsey and which came into effect on 1 January 2016. The Board ensures that the Company is compliant with Guernsey regulations and guidance in this regard. Internal Controls In accordance with the AIC Code  the Board is ultimately responsible for establishing and maintaining the Company's system of internal financial and operating control and for maintaining and reviewing its effectiveness throughout the year. The Company's risk matrix remains the core element of the Company's risk management process in establishing the Company's system of internal financial and reporting control. The risk matrix is prepared by the Board  identifying the risks facing the Company and then collectively assessing the likelihood and impact of each risk and the strength of the controls operating over each risk. The system of internal financial and operating control is designed to manage rather than to eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives  safeguard Company assets and maintain reliable financial information and by its nature can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against misstatement and loss. The AIC Code requires Directors to conduct at least annually a review of the Company's system of internal financial and operating control  covering all controls  including financial  operational  compliance and risk management. The Board has evaluated the systems of internal controls of the Company. In particular  it has prepared a process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the Company and the policies by which these risks are managed. The Board also considers whether the appointment of an internal auditor is required and has determined that there is no requirement for a direct internal audit function at this time. The Board has delegated the day to day responsibilities for the management of the Company's investment portfolio  the provision of depositary services and administration  registrar and corporate secretarial functions including the independent calculation of the Company's NAV and the production of the Annual Report and Financial Statements which are independently audited. Formal contractual agreements have been put in place between the Company and service providers. Even though the Board has delegated responsibility for these functions  it retains accountability for these functions and is responsible for the systems of internal control. At each quarterly Board meeting  compliance reports are provided by the Administrator  Company Secretary  Portfolio Manager  AIFM and Depositary. The Board also receives confirmation from the Administrator of its accreditation under its Service Organisation Controls 1 report. The Company's risk exposure and the effectiveness of its risk management and internal control systems are reviewed by the Audit Committee at its meetings and at least annually by the Board.

Source: Morningstar. Chairman’s Statement Introduction I am pleased to present the Annual Report for MIGO Opportunities Trust plc (“MIGO” or the “Company”) covering the year ended 30 April 2023. Financial markets around the world were dominated throughout the period by the continuing fight against inflation. Rising interest rates and changes in expectations of when the interest rates would peak have been daily talking points throughout the year  with ongoing impacts in stock  bond and property markets. This market volatility  coupled with share prices falling to levels significantly below their net asset values  favour our Investment Manager’s style of searching for future themes at current discounts in the investment trust universe. Investment Manager Aside from market events  MIGO’s year was dominated by the news in early 2023  that our portfolio manager  Nick Greenwood  had decided to leave Premier Miton Investors (“PMI”). In spite of the uncertainty that this introduced  it has been encouraging to see shareholders have been happy to stick with MIGO and await further developments and accordingly  supported in part by the Board’s proactive approach to buybacks  our share price and discount have held at reasonably steady levels. I thank everyone for their patience. As announced on 27 July 2023  the Board has appointed Asset Value Investors Limited (“AVI”) to become the Company’s AIFM and investment manager to implement MIGO’s existing investment objective and policy. The decision follows detailed shareholder engagement and a rigorous selection process  as part of the Board’s investment manager review announced in March  after serving protective notice to PMI. Established in 1985  AVI is an experienced manager of investment trusts  and the Board expects MIGO to benefit from AVI’s deep sector expertise and supportive analyst resource as well as its distribution and marketing channels. Over the past five years  AVI has added significant resource to its investment research team; this depth of knowledge will be available to support MIGO’s portfolio managers. Further information on AVI can be found in the Business Review as well as on their website  www.assetvalueinvestors.com AVI’s appointment remains subject to regulatory approval and is expected to commence in Q4 2023. The Board and I would like to thank PMI for its cooperation in this transition and for their hard work and support over the years. The Board is particularly pleased that  alongside MIGO’s appointment of AVI  AVI has committed to hiring additional  specialist investment management resource with experience of managing a portfolio such as MIGO’s. This recruitment has started with Charlotte Cuthbertson  a former co-portfolio manager of MIGO  who joined AVI earlier in July. AVI has also informed the Board that it expects to be able to announce a further senior level appointment with relevant experience  to work alongside Charlotte  in the coming months. The Board has been mindful of shareholders’ views expressed during the consultation exercise and looks forward to sharing full details of the AVI appointment once regulatory approvals have been received. As previously announced  PMI will continue to manage the MIGO portfolio until MIGO transitions to AVI. There will be no change to MIGO’s robust discount management policy or fee structure. Performance During the year under review  your Company’s net asset value (“NAV”) per share fell to 328.6p (2022: 362.6p)  a total return of -9.3% (2022: +4.8%). The Company’s share price ended the year at 318.5p (2022: 355.5p)  giving a total share price return of -10.3% (2022: +2.7%). The total return performance chart gives a longer-term picture  showing the NAV return per share over 5 years as +19.7% and the share price return over the same period as +16.8%. At the end of the year under review  the Company traded at a discount of 3.1% to NAV per share (2022: 2.0%). We believe the strategy of the Company is best measured against a “cash plus” benchmark  and accordingly the Company does not have a formal equity benchmark against which the Board reviews long-term performance and our Investment Manager does not invest by reference to an index. Over the year  the Company’s formal cash benchmark  SONIA plus 2%  rose by 4.6% (2022: +2.2%) and over five years by 14.9%. While any loss is disappointing  we have confidence in the long-term outlook for MIGO and its strategy. A comprehensive appraisal of the performance of  and developments within  your portfolio during the year under review and since 30 April 2023 is provided in the Investment Manager’s Report. During the year  the principal drivers of positive performance were holdings in Georgia Capital  Amedeo Air Four Plus  Macao Property Opportunities and Japanese activist trusts. The main detractors were Mining trusts and Vietnam. Dividend The results attributable to shareholders for the year ended 30 April 2023 are shown in the Financial Statements. In the year  the Company made a revenue account profit and  as a result  under investment trust rules regarding distributable income  a final dividend must be paid to comply with those rules. Subject to shareholders’ approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)  a final dividend of 3.00p per share will be paid on 5 October 2023 to shareholders on the register as of 8 September 2023. The associated ex-dividend date will be 7 September 2023. This is the second dividend to be paid in the history of the Company  but MIGO’s principal objective remains to provide shareholder returns through capital growth in its investments and outperforming SONIA plus 2% over the longer term. Therefore  the Board is maintaining its current policy to pay only those dividends necessary to maintain UK investment trust status. Subject to the investment trust rules  any dividends and distributions will continue to be at the discretion of the Board from time to time. Board Changes The MIGO Board had been made up of three Directors since the resignation of Michael Philips in March 2022. To return to the more normal complement of four Directors  a search process was undertaken in Autumn 2022. Following a skills analysis of the Board  a review of possible candidates by an independent consultancy and interviews conducted by the Board  it was decided that both Lucy Costa Duarte and Ian Henderson were exceptional candidates and had a lot to offer to MIGO and that the appointment of both as independent non-executive Directors of the Company would be in shareholders’ interests. Further biographical details can be found below. Both Lucy and Ian have already shown their dedication to MIGO during the search for a new AIFM and Investment Manager in the course of numerous meetings and assessments of possible candidates. Their input was invaluable and showed both the willingness and ability to get up to speed with MIGO and its requirements in order to provide the best solutions for shareholders. Both Lucy and Ian will stand for election by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. In line with best Corporate Governance practice  an annual review of the effectiveness of the whole Board and its Committees was again performed  also taking into account the performance of the new Directors. The Board is satisfied that each Director is fully engaged with the Company’s business and that all Directors are working together as an effective team. In accordance with our policy of all Directors standing for re-election annually  you will find the appropriate resolutions in the Notice of the AGM. The appointment of AVI as our new AIFM and Investment Manager means that Katya Thomson will no longer be considered independent under the AIC’s Code of Corporate Governance  as she also sits on the board of another AVI investment trust. She has therefore taken the decision to step down from her role as non-executive director and Chairman of the Audit Committee once a replacement can be found. We will miss Katya’s insights but will keep shareholders informed of developments as we find a new Chair of Audit. Articles of Association The Board of Directors is proposing to make an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Association (the “Articles”) to increase the aggregate amount paid to Directors by way of fees for their services as Directors under Article 97 from £150 000 to £250 000 in any financial year. This proposed limit increase is not due to any unusual rises in Directors’ fees. Our ceiling had been in place for many years and is lower than many other equivalent Investment Trust Boards. As our Board expanded from three to five during the year under review  aggregate fees rose close to the £150 000 per annum level. It is the Board’s intention to return to four Directors as a result of natural evolution in the future and  in the long term  four Directors should be seen as the “norm” for MIGO. So  while to some degree  being close to the limit should be temporary  we feel it is prudent to raise the ceiling amount. Further details can be found in the Report of the Directors and in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. Share Issues and Share Buybacks At the year-end  the Company’s shares traded at a discount of 3.1% to net asset value per share  having traded at a discount of 2.0% at the 2022 year-end. In comparison  the unweighted average discount across the whole investment companies universe* has expanded from 9.2% to 12.5% over the same period. (source: Numis Securities Limited). (* The full investment companies universe as defined by Numis Securities Research including both equities and alternative asset investment companies. ) During the year ended 30 April 2023  410 000 new shares were issued when the Company was trading at a premium to NAV per share  between mid-September and mid-November 2022. A total of 2 222 459 shares was repurchased in order to restrict any undue widening in the Company’s share price discount to NAV per share. This number includes 1 022 459 shares bought back in the month following announcement that Nick Greenwood would leave Premier Miton. While the Company does not target any particular share price or discount level for buybacks  the buybacks conducted during the year were at discounts ranging from 1.0% to 3.8%. As at the date of this report  the discount stands at 4.9% and 550 000 further shares have been repurchased since the year-end. The Board is unanimous in its support of the buyback policy to keep any discount volatility to a minimum and is firmly of the view that buying in at a double discount (MIGO shares’ discount to NAV and the unweighted average discount to NAV of the underlying holdings  29.2% as at 28 July 2023  being the latest practical date prior to the publication of this report) is accretive to shareholders. Annual General Meeting The AGM of the Company this year will be held on Wednesday  20 September 2023 at 12 noon at 25 Southampton Buildings  London WC2A 1AL. The notice convening the AGM can be found at the back of this document  together with an explanation of all resolutions. The Directors look forward to meeting shareholders. Outlook With a new AIFM and Investment Manager having been appointed  MIGO and its shareholders have a lot to look forward to. Our investment universe continues to offer a broad range of appealing investment opportunities  and discounts across the sector have widened materially to levels close to the widest they have ever been  thus offering attractive valuations. Finally  rising interest rates have seen several sectors  which had previously traded at a premium  de-rate and thereby increase our opportunity set. The Company is in a good position and your Board remains optimistic and thanks shareholders for their continued support throughout the last 12 months and going forward. Richard Davidson Chairman 3 August 2023 Investment Manager’s Report Performance The period under review proved particularly challenging for the investment trust sector as well as our NAV which fell by 9.4%. The key driver was the dramatic widening of investment trust discounts. By comparison  the Numis All-Share Including Investment Companies Index rose by 4.7%  and the MSCI World Index rose 3.78%  both on a total return basis. Post our year end  conditions have remained extremely tough for the investment trust industry. The continued collapse in demand for income generating funds led to discounts becoming extreme at the beginning of April when the sector’s average discount reached 17.5%. This compares with a figure of around 1% at the beginning of last year. The “alternatives” sub sector  which includes asset classes such as song rights  property  shipping and renewable energy  saw its average discount widen to 25%. The largest twelve positions in MIGO Opportunities Trust averaged over 31% discount at the end of March. These figures are the widest for many years and represent a significant general underperformance of trust share prices relative to their underlying portfolios. A dominant factor behind this derating has been the persistent rise in interest rates. A useful income can now be generated from conventional sources such as gilts. Therefore  some investors may choose to switch out of  say  an infrastructure trust yielding 5% into gilts in order to reduce risk without having to give up income. It has become clear that many of these trusts had originally been bought purely in response to negligible deposit rates rather than for their fundamentals. The evaporation of this yield premium triggered a universal sell off. A further challenge facing the closed end world is the ongoing consolidation of the wealth management industry  a major investor in the trust sector. The latest merger will see the amalgamation of Investec and Rathbones which will create a giant with £100 billion of assets under management. The fear is that in the medium term this vast pot of money will become just too large to use investment trusts efficiently. The number of shares available to buy in even sizeable trusts would be insufficient for such a large investor to take a meaningful position. It is pleasing that we have avoided many of the year’s problem areas. This is partly because these had traded on premiums in the recent past and were neither overlooked or unloved at that point. We held large cash balances in order to protect the portfolio. Nevertheless  it has inevitably suffered as discounts have widened in many of the trusts that we own. Inevitably  it has been a difficult period in performance terms. Portfolio Strategy Despite the headwinds  there were plenty of individual holdings which generated positive returns. These were drawn from a wide variety of asset classes including Georgia  aircraft leasing  private equity  activism in Japan and smaller companies in the UK. This variety highlights how diversified our investments are. This diversification is a key tool in limiting the impact on the portfolio for a downturn in any specific area. Counterintuitively  Georgia’s economy has been boosted as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A significant number of professionals  notably within the information technology industry  have moved over the border. Georgia Capital shares rose by nearly a third during theyear. Nevertheless  the shares usually trade at an eye-wateringly wide discount often in excess of 60%. The management team owns a significant stake. It seems inconceivable that when the time eventually comes for them to extract their investment  they would aim to achieve this by selling in the market at around 40p in the pound. It would be more likely that the trust would move into orderly wind down returning funds to shareholders at net asset value. Despite being a relatively small position  our exposure to aircraft leasing via Amedeo Air Four Plus made a useful contribution. Until recently  many of this trust’s aircraft remained in storage in the Middle East. The rapid recovery in air traffic has led to the majority of them being called back into service. Furthermore  serious delays in the production of the next generation of wide-bodied passenger jets means that Amedeo’s A380s will be generating cash far longer than originally intended given most of the current leases have been extended to 2035 or 2036. In late February the trust announced a compulsory redemption of 1 share for every 8 held at 64.5p and an increase in the quarterly dividend from 1.5p to 1.75p. Given some of our initial purchases last summer were at 30p  our rewards have proven swifter and larger than anticipated. Our expectation had been that the bulk of our returns would be generated through the generous dividend flow over a number of years. Macau Property Opportunities owns up-marketapartments in the former Portuguese colony. Whilst this trust has passed the end of its fixed life  attempts to dispose of the assets were hampered by the pandemic. The natural buyers of these apartments are based in Hong Kong and until recently were unable to inspect the properties and unsurprisingly few have been sold. The shares have risen modestly since the reopening of China but still trade at around a 50% discount. Even if the assets are sold well below book value  this would lead to a return of capital well above the level where the shares currently trade. It was pleasing to see trusts focusing on activism in Japan performing well. After decades of being repeatedly told that Japanese corporate governance was improving  only to be disappointed  we were cynical when these funds were originally launched. In the event they have performed much better than mainstream Japanese funds. We opportunistically acquired a holding in Nippon Active Value on a wide discount when the shares were harshly treated during last summer’s sell off when a committed seller appeared. Smaller companies in Japan are often very lowly rated compared with other markets. Over half of stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange trade below book and almost 700 companies’ market price is actually below half of book. Furthermore  Japanese companies typically have 40% of their balance sheet in cash. The Tokyo Stock Exchange recently introduced a number of reforms notably requiring managements to explain their strategy should their shares trade below book. Naming and shaming works in Japan. There has been a dramatic increase in activism  which represents a catalyst for change. The number of unsolicited takeover bids has doubled during the last three years and share buybacks have risen to record levels. Whilst asset strippers will still be rebuffed  activists with a pragmatic approach will get a hearing. This is because there is generational change in Japan. Younger locals are often not interested in taking over the reins  creating situations where a solution needs to be found. The central bank has persisted with yield curve control  leaving it the last bank offering “free money” and as a result the yen has languished. Sterling-based investors will benefit from its eventual recovery. Inflation is beginning to take hold for the first time in decades which should stoke demand for equities. Private equity trusts have been friendless for some time as investors had feared significant mark downs in the valuations of these vehicles’ underlying portfolios. Therefore  it was pleasing to see Oakley Capital and Dunedin Enterprise share prices make progress duringthe year. Oakley sold a couple of businesses at attractive prices. We have owned Dunedin Enterprise for many years. This trust has been in orderly wind down  steadily handing cash back to shareholders  as assets have been liquidated. A significant proportion of Dunedin’s portfolio was realised this year  notably Incremental  an IT services platform  and RED  a supplier of SAP staff. UK microcap specialist Rockwood Strategic share price surged almost 40% highlighting how it is possible to profit from individual stocks despite the current dire sentiment towards smaller companies which led to the AIM Index declining by nearly 20% during the year ended 30 April 2023. This sector is certainly unloved and overlooked  and as a result we started positions in Rights & Issues and  since our year end  Schroder British Opportunities. They have been added to our smallercompanies basket  the rationale being that the UK stock market trades at a discount to the rest of the world. Smaller companies trade at a discount to their larger peers and on many occasions  it has been possible to acquire investment trusts with smaller company mandates at a wide discount. A true Russian doll of discounts. We have owned Rights & Issues in the past; however  following the retirement of the long-term manager and a change of management to Jupiter  the shares have derated. This is not a situation that the fiercely independent board will allow to perpetuate. Schroder British Opportunities failed to stimulate much interest when it was launched in 2020 and now usually trades at discounts in excess of 30%. Nevertheless  the team managing the trust is well regarded. Conversely  our exposure to mining proved to be a laggard. Baker Steel Resources Trust is a developer of mines and creates value from acquiring promising deposits and gaining the required permissions. The trust then typically sells to a multinational which will build the mine and take the project into production. Baker Steel often retains a royalty. Capital available to the mining industry is currently scarce so a number of the trust’s developments are on hold. Nevertheless  given these projects are vast compared to Baker Steel’s modest size  it only needs one or two to get over the line for the trust to have a good year. The challenges appear to be priced in as the shares languish on a wide discount. Weakness in Geiger Counter is slightly surprising given the steady rise in the Uranium spot price. A general lack of appetite for the sector and a rapid rise in mine build out costs are likely to be factors. Phoenix Spree Deutschland was another drag on ourattribution. The trust owns a portfolio of rental apartment blocks in Berlin. Whilst tenant demand remains strong given a shortage of housing in the German capital  the private market has frozen. Proceeds from selling rental properties into the open market had been used by the trust to fund dividends. Lack of sales led to Phoenix Spree failing to pay its dividend which surprised the market and as a result the shares fell sharply. Vietnam proved to be one of the worst performing markets during the period. This was triggered by a scandal where inappropriate corporate bonds were sold to inexperienced investors. The local stock market is dominated by retail investors often trading on margin. This leads to volatility and sometimes a complete detachment from fundamentals. Vietnamese equities trade on one of lowest ratings in Asia despite the country enjoying one of the fastest economic growth rates within the region. Multinationals are seeking to diversify their manufacturing and supply lines away from China given the trade war with the Unites States and the return to totalitarianism. Vietnam and India will be the principal beneficiaries from this trend. EPE Special Opportunities was another detractor. Itsdominant portfolio position Luceco saw its shares slump. The manufacturer and distributor of LED lighting suffered as DIY retailers found themselves overstocked once the Covid-19 home improvement boom petered out. This imbalance has since largely been resolved. We have reacted to recent market developments by seeking opportunities where a trust’s share price has been harshly treated. In many cases these levels are unsustainable as perfectly good assets are owned by trusts which have failed to develop a following. Should there be no recovery  then these assets may be seized via takeovers or mergers. The first example within our portfolio came in early April when Industrials REIT  which owns a portfolio of mixed light industrial parks across Britain  was bid for by Blackstone. The offer was at a substantial premium to the latest closing price. There is an opportunity to arbitrage the fact that in many cases it is a lack of demand for the high yield structure that has led to the discount even when the assets a trust owns are keenly sought after. An example is renewable power where trusts have derated. We have built a position in Aquila European Renewables at discounted prices  the widest of which represented a discount to NAV of 22%  at which point the shares yielded 6% with dividend cover of 1.8x. Aquila and its peer group's share registers are dominated by institutions and wealth managers who are suffering outflows forcing them to sell into an unwilling market. There is a wide range of methodologies employed by the various renewable trusts. Some are cheaper than they look. Aquila European Renewables operates solar plants in Iberia and Greece as well as wind farms in Scandinavia. Its shares stood out as its asset life assumptions were much shorter than rivals. Just moving into line with the rest of the sector would increase the net asset value  taking its discount sharply wider. The methodology used is made up of a number of factors such as cost of capital  asset lives and inflation assumptions. Inevitably such an approach will usually lead to a very different value than could be achieved by simply selling the assets. At present wind farms and solar plants are in demand and open market prices are believed to be significantly higher than stated net asset values. This leaves the sector vulnerable to opportunistic takeover bids. Some trusts  typically managed by overseas managers  have failed to develop a following and are likely to be the losers as investors migrate toward the biggest  most liquid trusts. Aquila is managed from Hamburg and a move that might be considered could be a listing on Euronext. Continental investors would better understand the attractions of Aquila’s assets. Given that until recently renewable trusts traded at premiums putting them outside our area of focus  we are less familiar with the sector. Therefore  we are assessing a number of opportunities across the alternative asset range where mispricings are likely to have developed. Small toeholds have been taken in VPCSpecialty Lending and EJF Investments. Another new entrant is JP Morgan India. In the aftermath of a change in the management team of an investment trust  often its discount continues to reflect the track record of the vehicle rather than that of the new managers. This is true of JP Morgan India which continues to languish on a wide discount despite the recently appointed team significantly outperforming local large cap indices. The trust has a structure which dictates that a quarter of the shares are tendered at a price close to net asset value in the event of underperformance. Unless the portfolio does well in the next couple of years  shareholders will enjoy a useful uplift. International Biotechnology Trust was added as apartial switch from Biotech Growth Trust. This was part of a move to generally reduce our exposure to China. Our concern is that investments made under a totalitarian regime are a speculation rather than an investment. There is no certainty that the rules will not change. There were a couple of departures. We sold StrategicEquity Capital as part of a shift in our focus towards thesmallest of UK companies. Alpha Real had been in our portfolio for many years. We had the opportunity to tender our entire holding at a significant premium to the market price. Our investment in Alpha Real proved to be an extremely profitable one. Outlook Looking forward we remain cautious. Investors had enjoyed “free” money since the global financial crisis. Abundant liquidity supported a widespread rise in asset prices during that period. This largesse has now come to an end and the process will move into reverse suggesting mainstream indices will drift. The tide will be against us although the authorities will be limited in respect of how fast liquidity can be drained from the financial system given the fragility of markets. Should the global economy prove resilient  this will only increase the risk of further interest rate increases. Rate rises recently put in place will take time to take effect. Notwithstanding these challenges  there will be many opportunities for us to exploit in overlooked corners of the closed end world. On past occasions when discounts within our portfolio became as wide as they are presently  it proved to be the precursor of the next explosive run up in the value of our portfolio  although there is no guarantee that this pattern could be repeated. The challenges facing investment trusts generated by oversupply and consolidation of wealth managers won’t be resolved quickly but there are self-help measures that can be taken. Buybacks reduce the oversupply. Investment trusts that still have ambitions to appeal to the wealth management industry can merge with likeminded vehicles to become large enough for the major chains to support. Such initiatives should help narrow discounts allowing share prices to outperform underlying portfolios. There are new audiences such as self-directed individuals and smaller wealth managers which are still investment-led. These remain attracted to investment trusts. Over decades we have repeatedly been warned that the investment trust industry has been under threat. Nevertheless  the sector has thrived. The law of natural selection is alive and well within the trust world. We will lose funds that no longer attract an audience  but the investment trust sector has constantly evolved over the years and will continue to do so.

Its purpose is to inform the shareholders of the Company and help them to assess how the Directors have performed their duty to promote the success of the Company. In particular  the Chairman’s Statement and the Investment Manager’s Report concentrate on the outlook for the current year and the factors likely to affect the position of the business. The Strategic Report contains certain forward-looking statements. These statements are made by the Directors in good faith based on the information available to them up to the time of their approval of this report and such statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties  including both economic and business risk factors  underlying any such forward-looking information. Further information on how the Directors have discharged their duty under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 can be found below. Business Model The Company is an externally managed investment trust and its shares are premium listed on the Official List of the FCA and traded on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. The Company has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs as an authorised investment trust under sections 1158 and 1159 of the Corporation Taxes Act 2020  subject to there being no subsequent serious breaches of regulations. In the opinion of the Directors  the Company is directing its affairs so as to enable it to continue to qualify for such approval. The purpose of the Company is to provide a vehicle for investors to gain exposure to a portfolio of companies which have been undervalued by the markets in which they are traded  through a single investment. The Company’s strategy is to create value for shareholders by addressing its investment objective  which is set out below. As an externally managed investment trust  all of the Company’s day-to-day management and administrative functions are outsourced to service providers. As a result  the Company has no executive directors  employees or internal operations. The Company is an Alternative Investment Fund (“AIF”) under the UK Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“UK AIFMD”) and has currently appointed Premier Portfolio Managers Limited as its Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”). The Board has retained responsibility for risk management and has appointed Premier Portfolio Managers Limited to manage its investment portfolio. Company management  company secretarial and administrative services are outsourced to Frostrow Capital LLP. The Board remains responsible for all aspects of the Company’s affairs  including setting the parameters for monitoring the investment strategy and the review of investment performance and policy. It also has responsibility for all strategic policy issues  including share issuance and buybacks  share price and discount/premium monitoring  corporate governance matters  dividends and gearing. Further information on the Board’s role and the topics it discusses with the Investment Managers is provided in the Corporate Governance Report. As announced on 7 March 2023  the Board has served protective notice on Premier Portfolio Managers Limited and was conducting a review to identify a new AIFM and Investment Manager. As detailed in the Chairman’s Statement  and announced on 27 July 2023  Asset Value Investors Limited (“AVI”) has been appointed as the new AIFM and Investment Manager of MIGO subject to regulatory approval. Investment Objective The objective of the Company is to outperform SONIA plus 2% (the “Benchmark”) over the longer term  principally through exploiting inefficiencies in the pricing of closed-end funds (SONIA being the Sterling Overnight Index Average  the Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rate preferred by the Bank of England for use in Sterling derivatives and relevant financial contracts). This is intended to reflect the aim of providing a better return to shareholders over the longer term than they would get by placing money on deposit. The Benchmark is a target only and should not be treated as a guarantee of the performance of the Company or its portfolio. Investment Policy The Company invests in closed-end investment funds traded on the London Stock Exchange’s main market  but has the flexibility to invest in investment funds listed or dealt on other recognised stock exchanges  in unlisted closed-end funds (including  but not limited to  funds traded on AIM) and in open-ended investment funds. The funds in which the Company invests may include all types of investment trusts  companies and funds established onshore or offshore. The Company has the flexibility to invest in any class of security issued by investment funds including  without limitation  equity  debt  warrants or other convertible securities. In addition  the Company may invest in other securities  such as non-investment fund debt  if deemed to be appropriate to produce the desired returns to shareholders. The Company is unrestricted in the number of funds it holds. The Company invests in listed closed-end investment funds that themselves have stated investment policies to invest no more than 15% of their gross assets in other listed closed-end investment funds. However  the Company may invest up to 10%  in aggregate  of the value of its gross assets at the time of acquisition in closed-end investment funds that do not have such a stated investment policy. In addition  the Company will not invest more than 25%  in aggregate  of the value of its gross assets at the time of acquisition in open-ended funds. There are no prescriptive limits on allocation of assets in terms of asset class or geography. There are no limits imposed on the size of hedging contracts  save that their aggregated value will not exceed 20% of the portfolio’s gross assets at the time they are entered into. The Board permits borrowings of up to 20% of the Company’s net asset value (measured at the time new borrowings are incurred). The Company’s investment objective may lead  on occasions  to a significant amount of cash or near cash being held. Dividend Policy It is the Company’s policy to pursue capital growth for shareholders with income being a secondary consideration. This means that the Company’s Investment Manager is frequently drawn to companies whose future growth profile is more important than the generation of dividend income for shareholders. The Company complies with the United Kingdom’s investment trust rules regarding distributable income which require investment trusts to retain no more than 15% of their income from shares and securities each year. The Company’s dividend policy is that the Company will pay the minimum dividend required to maintain investment trust status. Results and Dividend The results attributable to shareholders for the year ended 30 April 2023 are shown in the Statement of Financial Position. In the year  the Company made a revenue profit. Under investment trust rules regarding distributable income  a final dividend must be paid to allow the Company to comply with those rules. Subject to shareholders’ approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting  a final dividend of 3.00p per share will be paid on 5 October 2023 to shareholders on the register as of 8 September 2023. The associated ex-dividend date will be 7 September 2023. The Board During the year  Lucy Costa Duarte and Ian Henderson were appointed as Directors of the Company with effect from 1 November 2022. The Board is very pleased to have appointed directors with extensive industry and investor relations experience. At the date of this report  the Board of the Company comprises Richard Davidson (Chairman)  Lucy Costa Duarte  Ian Henderson  Ekaterina (Katya) Thomson and Hugh van Cutsem. All of these Directors are independent non-executive Directors. Richard Davidson  Katya Thomson and Hugh van Cutsem served throughout the year  and Lucy Costa Duarte and Ian Henderson since their appointment date  and up to the signing of this report. All Directors will stand for election or re-election respectively at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Further information on the Directors can be found below. Board Diversity The Board is fully supportive of all aspects of diversity and the importance of having a range of skilled  experienced individuals with relevant knowledge in order to allow it to fulfil its obligations. Further information on Board diversity as well as the Board’s diversity policy can be found in the Corporate Governance Report. Board Focus and Responsibilities With the day-to-day management of the Company outsourced to service providers  the Board’s primary focus at each Board meeting is reviewing the investment performance and associated matters such as  amongst other things  future outlook and strategy  gearing  asset allocation  investor relations  marketing  and industry issues. In line with its primary focus  the Board retains responsibility for all the key elements of the Company’s strategy and business model  including: · investment objective and policy  incorporating the investment guidelines and limits  and changes to these; · whether the manager should be authorised to gear the portfolio up to a pre-determined limit; · review of performance against the Company’s Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”); · consideration of share issuance and buybacks and premium/discount management; · review of the performance and continuing appointment of service providers; and · maintenance of an effective system of oversight  risk management and corporate governance. Details of the principal KPIs  along with details of the principal risks  and how they are managed  follow within this business review. Key Performance Indicators The Company’s Board of Directors meets at least four times a year. At each quarterly meeting it reviews performance against a number of key performance measures  as below: NAV and the movement of the NAV compared with the notional returns available for cash – defined as SONIA plus 2%  the Company’s Benchmark The Directors regard the Company’s net asset value (“NAV”) per share as being the overall measure of value delivered to shareholders over the long term  as opposed to returns available for cash holdings. A full description of performance during the year under review and the investment portfolio are contained in the Investment Manager’s Review. The NAV total return per share for the year to 30 April 2023 was -9.3% (2022: +4.8%)  compared with the Benchmark return of 4.6% (2022:2.2%). NAV volatility^ The Company aims to deliver its performance with a lower level of volatility in the NAV than equity markets. For the year to 30 April 2023  the Company’s NAV had a volatility of 8.2% (2022: 8.2%)*  compared with the volatility of the Numis All Share inc Investment Companies Total Returns Index of 14.2% (2022: 14.2%). The movement in the Company’s share price One of the most immediate measures of the value of the Company’s Ordinary shares is their price. The Board regularly considers the Company’s investment performance and other ways in which share price performance may be enhanced  including the effectiveness of marketing. The Ordinary share price decreased by 10.4% (2022: increased by 2.7%) over the year. Further details are given in the Chairman’s Statement and the Investment Manager’s Review. Share price in relation to the NAV per share The Board believes that an important driver of an investment trust’s discount or premium over the long term is investment performance together with a proactive marketing strategy. However  there can be volatility in the discount or premium during the year. Therefore  the Board requests authority each year to buy back and issue shares with a view to limiting the volatility of the share price discount or premium. During the year under review  410 000 new shares were issued by the Company (2022: 685 000). New shares will only be issued at a premium to the Company’s cum-income net asset value at the time of issue. 2 222 459 shares were bought back during the year (2022: 1 504 729 including 149 729 shares bought back following the Realisation Opportunity in September 2021)  and 550 000 shares were bought back after the year-end (2022: 1 200 000). The Company’s Ordinary share price in relation to the NAV per share during the year has ranged from a premium of 4.8% (2022: 4.7%) to a discount of 5.7% (2022: 5.7%). At the year end  the shares traded at a discount of 3.0% to the NAV per share (2022: 2.0% discount). In comparison  the unweighted average discount across the whole investment companies universe was 12.1% (2022: 8.2%)#. * Source: Frostrow Capital LLP. ^ See Glossary for definition and calculation methodology. # Source: Numis Securities Limited. Principal Risks  Emerging Risks and Risk Management The Board considers that the risks detailed within this report are the principal risks currently facing the Company to deliver its strategy. The Board is responsible for the ongoing identification  evaluation and management of the principal risks faced by the Company. The Audit Committee  on behalf of the Board  has established a process for the regular review of these risks and their mitigation. This process is in line with the UK Governance Code and the FRC’s Guidance on Risk Management  Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting. During the year ended 30 April 2023  the Audit Committee has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Company  including those that would threaten its business model  future performance  solvency and liquidity. The Committee also considered the controls in place to mitigate the inherent risks and whether additional controls or actions were required to bring the residual risk down to an acceptable level. The Committee was satisfied with the controls that are in place  although it is important to note that the systems in place cannot eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Company’s investment objective. Further details as well as a summary of the Company’s approach to risk and how principal risks and uncertainties were dealt with during the year under review  are set out below. In addition  information about the Company’s risk assessment and internal control procedures is provided in the Audit Committee Report. The principal risks are categorised under the following broad headings: · investment risks; · strategic risks; · operational risks; and · macro risks. Principal Risk Mitigation Investment risks Market and discount risk The Company aims to capitalise on the opportunities that exist due to inefficiencies in the pricing of closed-end funds and is exposed to fluctuations in the market prices of those funds and their underlying assets. Additionally  the Company is exposed to the risk that the market price of its investments differs from that of their NAV per share – purchasing funds whose market price is at a discount to NAV per share can result in significant gains on the upside  but can also lead to exposure to poorly performing companies. The Company may use borrowing  the effect of which would be to amplify the gains or losses the Company experiences. Investors should be aware that by investing in the Company they are exposing themselves to the market risks associated with owning publicly traded shares  and the additional discount risks specific to investing in closed-end funds. To manage this risk the Board and the AIFM have appointed the Investment Manager to manage the portfolio within the remit of the investment objective and policy and borrowing limits. Compliance with the investment policy and borrowing limits is monitored on a daily basis by the AIFM and reported to the Board monthly. At the year-end the Company had no borrowings (2022: £nil). The Investment Manager monitors the volatility  discount  quality of underlying assets  and level of gearing within the portfolio holdings and potential investments. The results of this feed into the stock selection process and consideration of the portfolio constituents. In addition  the Investment Manager reports at each Board meeting on the performance of the portfolio  encompassing  inter alia  the rationale for stock selection decisions  the make-up of the portfolio  and portfolio company updates. Liquidity  cash and foreign exchange risk The market in closed-end funds can often be illiquid. As such the Company is exposed to the risk that it will not be able to sell an investment at the current market value  or on a timely basis  when the Investment Manager chooses  or it is required to do so to meet financial liabilities. A proportion of the Company’s investments might also be denominated in foreign currencies which might be subject to fluctuations in valuation and  at times  a proportion of the portfolio may be held in cash  preventing the Company from benefiting from positive movements in the market. The Investment Manager monitors volume and price-based trade measures and looks to ensure that a proportion of the portfolio is invested in readily realisable funds. The Board also receives an update on the liquidity of the portfolio and the current level of liquidity of the Company on a regular basis as well as the Company’s cash position and any foreign exchange valuations. Further details on market  liquidity and other financial risks can be found in note 15 to the Financial Statements. Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through existing reserves and a revolving credit facility and may be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. The Board monitors the effect of interest rate movements on the Company’s finances and reviews the Company’s ongoing compliance with the loan covenants on a monthly basis. Strategic risks Shareholder relations and share price performance The Company and its shareholders are exposed to the risk  particularly if the investment strategy and approach are unsuccessful  that the Company may be viewed unfavourably resulting in a widening of the share price discount to NAV per share. In managing this risk the Board reviews the Company’s investment objective in relation to market and economic conditions and the performance of its peers and discusses at each Board meeting the Company’s future development and strategy. The Board does not seek to manage the discount on a day-to-day basis but does monitor the trend over longer periods and considers how share price performance may be enhanced  including the effectiveness of marketing and the possibility of share buybacks. Given the size of the Company the Board is conscious of the impact of share buybacks on liquidity and the ongoing charges of the Company. During the year under review  the Company issued 410 000 new shares (2022: 685 000). During the year  the Company also bought back a total of 2 222 459 ordinary shares (2022: 1 504 729) and since the year-end a further 550 000 shares (2022: 1 200 000) up to the time of writing  in order to keep the discount under control and prevent it from widening. As at the year end and since  the shares have been trading at a discount to NAV. Going forward  share issuances or buybacks will continue to be undertaken when required to reduce price volatility and to ensure that the shares are trading close to par with their net asset value. Key person risk The loss of a key employee of the Investment Manager could result in the deterioration of the performance of the Company. The Board considers the make-up of the team supporting the lead investment manager as part of its annual review. During the year under review  Nick Greenwood decided to leave Premier Fund Managers Limited  leading the Board to serve protective notice on Premier Fund Managers as Investment Manager of MIGO. Following a rigorous selection process  AVI has been appointed by the Board to take over from Premier Fund Managers with the effective date still to be announced. More information on this can be found in the Chairman’s Statement. Company duration risk Every three years  the Company’s shareholders may be offered a realisation opportunity at the discretion of the Board. Depending on the structure of the realisation opportunity and the level of take-up  amounts available to shareholders will depend on the valuation of the portfolio and its liquidity and may be lower than expected  especially in adverse market conditions. The Board has implemented  with shareholder approval  a realisation opportunity which may be offered to shareholders every three years at the Board’s discretion. Further details are set out in the Report of the Directors. The Board formulates the appropriate realisation opportunity based on feedback from the relevant service providers. In particular  the investor sentiment prior to the realisation opportunity in 2021 was monitored by the Investment Manager and the Company’s Brokers and only 0.55% of MIGO’s issued share capital was realised and bought back by the Company. The next realisation opportunity may be offered to shareholders in 2024  and more details will follow nearer the time. Operational risks Service provider risk The Board is reliant on the systems of the Company’s service providers and as such a disruption to  or a failure of  those systems could lead to a failure to comply with law and regulations leading to reputational damage to the Company – either directly or by association with the service provider in question – and/or financial loss. This encompasses disruption or failure caused by cyber crime or hybrid working practices and covers dealing  trade processing  administrative services  financial and other operational functions. To manage these risks the Board: receives reports from the AIFM and Frostrow Capital LLP on compliance with applicable laws and regulations; reviews internal control reports and key policies of the AIFM  Investment Manager  Custodian and Frostrow; reviews reports from the Depositary; maintains a risk matrix which details the risks to which the Company is exposed and the controls relied upon to manage those risks; and receives updates on pending changes to the legal and regulatory environment and progress towards the Company’s compliance with any relevant future changes. The service providers of the Company have again confirmed that they have all necessary business continuity procedures in place including enabling to work from home  increased IT and cyber security awareness as well as team and client meetings via video conference calls as and when required. The Board continues to monitor the performance of all service providers given the ability of many employees to work remotely even post-lockdowns. Macro risks Global Risk Significant political and economic change in the UK and abroad might lead to volatile markets impacting the Company’s performance and reduced investor appetite for the Company’s shares. Global events  such as another pandemic  acts of war or terrorist attacks  might affect the performance of portfolio companies or result in the Company’s service providers being unable to meet their contractual duties. During the year under review  the ongoing war in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia have led to supply emergencies  market volatility and increased inflation. Political and economic developments both in the UK and world-wide are being monitored and discussed  where relevant  between the Board and the Investment Manager as part of the portfolio review at every Board meeting. The Investment Manager maintains a dialogue with the investee companies and monitors the impact of any material events on their business  and updates the Board accordingly. ESG and Climate Change Risk Risks related to the environment  social issues and governance (ESG) such as the impact of climate change or bad governance of portfolio companies  MIGO itself or its service providers could have an adverse impact on operational performance. At every Board meeting  the Board receives updates including information on governance-related issues  from the Portfolio Manager and the Company Secretary. Due to the nature of the Company and its investment policy  any investment decisions can only  at best  have a limited impact on climate change and ESG issues. Details of the current Investment Manager’s ESG approach can be found in the “Responsible Investing” section on Premier Miton’s website www.premiermiton.com/responsibility. The governance of MIGO and its service providers is reviewed regularly by the Company Secretary on behalf of the Board and is reported on in more detail in the Corporate Governance Report. UK Regulatory Risk The regulatory environment in which the Company operates might change materially  affecting the Company’s modus operandi. The Board monitors regulatory change with the assistance of Frostrow and external professional advisers to ensure that the Board is aware of any likely changes in the regulatory environment and will be able to adapt as required. UK Legal Risk The Company and/or the Directors might fail to comply with legal requirements in relation to FCA dealing rules and procedures  the UK AIFMD  the Listing Rules  the Companies Act 2006  relevant accounting standards  the Bribery Act 2010  the Criminal Finances Act 2017  the Association of Investment Companies (“AIC”) Statement of Recommended Practice (“SORP”)  GDPR  tax regulations or any other applicable regulations. The Board monitors regulatory change with the assistance of its external professional advisers to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations including the Companies Act 2006  the AIFMD  the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (“Section 1158”)  the Market Abuse Regulation (“MAR”)  the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (“DTRs”) and the FCA’s Listing Rules. The Board reviews compliance reports and internal control reports provided by its service providers  as well as the Company’s financial statements and revenue forecasts. The Depositary reports twice yearly to the Audit Committee  confirming that the Company has been managed in accordance with the AIFMD  MIGO’s Articles of Association and with investment restrictions and leverage limits. The Directors attend seminars and conferences to keep up to date on regulatory changes and receive industry updates from the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary also presents a quarterly report on changes in the regulatory environment  including AIC updates  and how changes have been addressed. Governance Risk Poor adherence to corporate governance best practice or errors or irregularities in published information could lead to censure and/or result in reputational damage to the Company. The Board reviews all information supplied to shareholders and Frostrow’s marketing activity at each meeting. Details of the Company’s compliance with corporate governance best practice  including information on relationships with shareholders  are set out in the Corporate Governance Report. Emerging Risks The Company has carried out a detailed assessment of its emerging and principal risks. The International Risk Governance Council’s definition of an “emerging” risk is one that is new or is a familiar risk in a new or unfamiliar context or under new context conditions (re-emerging). Failure to identify emerging risks may cause reactive actions rather than being proactive and  in a worst-case scenario  could cause the Company to become unviable or otherwise fail or force the Company to change its structure  objective or strategy. The Audit Committee reviews a risk register at its half-yearly meetings. Emerging risks are discussed in detail as part of this process to try to ensure that both emerging and well-known risks are identified and mitigated as far as possible. Any emerging risks and mitigations are added to the risk register. During the year under review  the Board identified as an emerging risk the deteriorating economic environment  which may impact portfolio investments and  potentially  the Company’s service providers. This risk includes the cost of living crisis  increased energy costs and food supply difficulties from a country macro level down to every household and business. Whilst it is not possible to mitigate the above emerging risks directly  the Board regularly reviews the premium and discount levels and considers ways in which share price performance may be enhanced to prevent MIGO becoming unattractive to shareholders. The Investment Manager  Frostrow and Numis are in regular contact with larger investors to ensure that MIGO’s objective is still in line with shareholders’ objectives. There are also regular updates for all shareholders by way of factsheets  annual and half-yearly reports and other documentation on the Company’s website. The experience and knowledge of the Directors is useful in these discussions  as are update papers and advice received from the Board’s key service providers such as the AIFM and Investment Manager and the Company’s brokers. In addition  the Company is a member of the AIC  which provides regular technical updates  draws members’ attention to forthcoming industry and regulatory issues and advises on compliance obligations. Going Concern The content of the Company’s portfolio  trading activity  the Company’s cash balances and revenue forecasts  and the trends and factors likely to affect the Company’s performance are reviewed and discussed at each Board meeting. The Board has considered a detailed assessment of the Company’s ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due  including tests which modelled the effects of substantial falls in markets and significant reductions in market liquidity  on the Company’s NAV  its cash flows and its expenses. Further information is provided in the Audit Committee Report. Based on the information available to the Directors at the date of this report  including the results of these stress tests  the conclusions drawn in the Long-Term Viability Statement  the Company’s cash balances  and the liquidity of the Company’s listed investments  the Directors are satisfied that the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in operation for at least the next 12 months and that  accordingly  it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. In reaching these conclusions and those in the Long-Term Viability Statement below  the stress testing conducted also featured consideration of the long-term effects of the continuing uncertainty created by the increase in global inflation and rising interest rates  together with the consequences of the war in Ukraine and the subsequent long-term effects on economies and international relations. Long-Term Viability Statement In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code  the Directors have carefully assessed the Company’s current position and prospects as described in the Chairman’s Statement and the Investment Manager’s Report  as well as the Principal Risks outlined above and have formed a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three financial years. The Board has chosen a three-year horizon in view of the long-term nature and outlook adopted by the Investment Manager when making decisions while recognising the limitations and uncertainties inherent in predicting market conditions in making this assessment. To make the assessment and in reaching the conclusion of long-term viability  the Audit Committee has considered the Company’s financial position and its ability to liquidate its portfolio and meet its liabilities as they fall due: · the portfolio is principally comprised of investments traded on major international stock exchanges. Based on historic analysis  77.3% of the current portfolio could be liquidated within 30 trading days with 37.7% in seven days under normal market conditions and there is no expectation that the nature of the investments held within the portfolio will be materially different in future; · the expenses of the Company are predictable and modest in comparison with the assets and there are no capital commitments foreseen which would alter that position; and · the Company has no employees  only its non-executive Directors. Consequently  it does not have redundancy or other employment-related liabilities or responsibilities. The Directors have also considered the fact that following the realisation opportunity in September 2021  the majority of shareholders have decided to hold on to their shares and that the net asset value of the Ordinary shares continued to be more than £30 million  allowing the Company to continue in operation and allowing a positive outlook towards the next Realisation Opportunity in 2024. For more details about the Company’s capital structure and the Realisation Opportunity  please refer to the Report of the Directors below. Finally  the Board has appointed AVI to become the Company’s AIFM and investment manager to implement MIGO’s existing investment objective and policy. The decision follows detailed shareholder engagement and a rigorous selection process  as part of the Board’s manager review announced in March. Established in 1985  AVI is an experienced manager of investment trusts  and the Board expects MIGO to benefit from AVI’s deep sector expertise and supportive analyst resource as well as its distribution and marketing channels. Further information can be found in the Chairman’s Statement. The appointment of AVI is expected to commence in Q4 2023  with the exact date still to be announced. The Audit Committee considers the potential impact of the Company’s principal risks and various severe  but plausible  downside scenarios  as well as the following assumptions in considering the Company’s longer-term viability: · there will continue to be demand for investment trusts; · investors will wish to continue to have exposure to the type of companies that the Company invests in  namely closed-end investment funds; · the Board and both the current and new Investment Manager will continue to adopt a long-term view when making investments; · the threats to the Company’s solvency or liquidity incorporated in the Principal Risks will be managed or mitigated as outlined above; · regulation will not increase to a level that makes running the Company uneconomical; and · the performance of the Company will continue to be satisfactory. The continuing uncertainty in the global economy  the ongoing war in Ukraine as well as more Covid-19 related lockdowns in some countries  have created significant supply chain disruption and inflationary pressures world-wide. These were factored into the key assumptions made by assessing their impact on the Company’s key risks and whether the key risks had increased in their potential to affect the normal  favourable and stressed market conditions. As part of this review  the Board considered the impact of a significant and prolonged decline in the Company’s performance and prospects. This included a range of plausible downside scenarios such as reviewing the effects of substantial falls in investment values and the impact of the Company’s ongoing charges ratio  which were the subject of stress testing. Furthermore  the Audit Committee considered the operational resilience of the Company’s service providers  and thereby the operational viability of the Company. During the year under review all key service providers have again been contacted with regard to their business continuity systems as well as their IT and cyber security systems to prevent fraudulent activity of any kind. No issues were raised and the Audit Committee was reassured that all key service providers were operating well and to their normal high service standards while enabling their employees to work remotely  if necessary. Based on the results of this review  the Directors have formed a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three financial years. Management Arrangements AIFM and Investment Manager Premier Portfolio Managers Limited is currently the Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”) for the Company pursuant to an Investment Management Agreement dated 22 July 2014 (the “IMA”)  as amended on 9 September 2015  10 September 2018  24 April 2020 and 1 April 2022. Under the terms of the IMA  the AIFM provides  inter alia  the following services: · risk management services; · monitoring the Investment Manager’s compliance with the Company’s investment objective and investment policy and reporting any non-compliance in a timely manner to the Investment Manager and the Board; · determining the net asset value per share on a daily basis; · maintaining professional indemnity insurance at the level required under the AIFM Rules; · preparing the monthly factsheets for the Company; and · upholding compliance with applicable tax  legal and regulatory requirements. The current AIFM has appointed Premier Fund Managers Limited as the Investment Manager under a Delegation Agreement. Under the terms of the Delegation Agreement  the Investment Manager provides  inter alia  the following services: · seeking out and evaluating investment opportunities; · deciding the manner by which monies should be invested  divested  retained or realised; · deciding how rights conferred by the investments should be exercised; · analysing the performance of investments made; and · advising the Company in relation to trends  market movements and other matters which may affect the investment objective and policy of the Company.

If the Company as a whole moves to a realisation basis then the AIFM will be paid 0.5% of the adjusted market capitalisation of the Company as a whole. Following the realisation opportunity in 2021  there are no Realisation Shares in issue. The management fee accrues daily and is payable in arrears monthly. Details of the fees paid to the AIFM for their services during the year are set out in note 3 to the Financial Statements. The IMA and Delegation Agreement may be terminated by six months’ written notice subject to the provisions for earlier termination as set out therein. There are no specific provisions contained within the IMA relating to compensation payable in the event of termination of the agreement other than the entitlement to fees which would be payable within any notice period. Appointment of a new AIFM and Investment Manager During the year under review and to the date of this report  Premier Portfolio Managers Limited was appointed as MIGO’s AIFM and Premier Fund Managers Limited as MIGO’s Investment Manager (together: “Premier Miton” or “PMI”). The Board thanks the team at Premier Miton for their hard work and support over the years. However  following Nick Greenwood’s decision to depart from Premier Miton  the Board of MIGO served protective notice on Premier Miton and announced the news on 7 March 2023. Detailed shareholder engagement and a rigorous selection process  as part of the Board’s investment manager review  resulted in the appointment of AVI to become the Company’s AIFM and Investment Manager to implement MIGO’s existing investment objective and policy. The appointment of AVI is expected to commence in Q4 2023  with the exact date still to be announced. AVI was established in 1985 to take over the management of one of the oldest listed investment companies in London. AVI believes a concentrated  contrarian  high-conviction portfolio of companies provides the opportunity for long-term returns in excess of broader equity markets. It offers investors a specialist research-driven approach which has proven to still be relevant 37 years later. Learn more about AVI at www.assetvalueinvestors.com The Board expects MIGO to benefit from AVI’s deep sector expertise and supportive analyst resource as well as its distribution and marketing channels. AVI has also committed to hiring additional  specialist investment management resource with experience of managing a portfolio such as MIGO’s. This recruitment has started with Charlotte Cuthbertson  a former co-portfolio manager of MIGO  who joined AVI earlier in July. AVI has also informed the Board that it expects to be able to announce a further senior level appointment with relevant experience  to work alongside Charlotte  in due course. The new Investment Management Agreement with AVI will mirror the agreement that MIGO currently has with Premier Miton in all material aspects. Further information can be found in the Chairman’s Statement. Company Secretary  Marketing and Administration Company secretarial  marketing  and administrative services are provided by Frostrow Capital LLP (“Frostrow”) under an agreement dated 1 February 2016 and novated on 24 April 2020 and 27 July 2023.

Frostrow’s fees will reduce from 25 basis points to 20 basis points on market capitalisation of the Company in excess of £100 million. The agreement may be terminated by either party on six months’ written notice. Frostrow provides the following services  inter alia  under its agreement with the Company: · marketing and shareholder services; · administrative and company secretarial services; · advice and guidance in respect of corporate governance requirements; · maintenance of the Company’s accounting records together with Link Group  to which a number of accounting functions have been delegated; · preparation of the annual and half yearly reports; and · ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. In light of the high level of service provided by Frostrow in these areas  it is the opinion of the Directors that the continuing appointment of Frostrow is in the best interest of shareholders. Details of the fees paid to Frostrow for their services during the year are set out in note 4 to the Financial Statements. Company Promotion The Company has appointed Frostrow to promote the Company’s shares to professional investors in the UK. As Investment Company Specialists  the Frostrow team provides a continuous  pro-active marketing  distribution and investor relations service that aims to promote the Company by encouraging demand for the shares. Frostrow actively engages with professional investors  typically discretionary wealth managers  some institutions and a range of execution-only platforms. Regular engagement helps to attract new investors and retain existing shareholders  and over time results in a stable share register made up of diverse  long-term holders. Frostrow arranges and manages a continuous programme of one-to-one meetings with professional investors around the UK. These include regular meetings with “gate keepers”  the senior points of contact responsible for their respective organisations’ research output and recommended lists. The programme of regular meetings also includes autonomous decision makers within large multi-office groups  as well as small independent organisations. Some of these meetings involve the Investment Manager  but most of the meetings do not  which means the Company is being actively promoted while the Investment Manager concentrates on managing the portfolio. The Company also benefits from involvement in the regular professional investor seminars run by Frostrow in major centres  notably London and Edinburgh  or webinars which are focused on buyers of investment companies. Frostrow produces many key corporate documents  including annual and half-yearly reports. All Company information and invitations to investor events  including updates from the Investment Manager on portfolio and market developments  are regularly emailed to a growing database  overseen by Frostrow  consisting of professional investors across the UK. Frostrow maintains close contact with all the relevant investment trust broker analysts  particularly those from Numis Securities Limited  the Company’s corporate broker  but also others who publish and distribute research on the Company to their respective professional investor clients. For the duration of the search for a new Investment Manager  a specialist PR agency  Kaso Legg Communications Ltd  was also appointed to support the Board’s engagement with stakeholders. The Company continues to benefit from regular press coverage  with articles appearing in respected publications that are widely read by both professional and self-directed private investors. The latter typically buy their shares via retail platforms  which account for a significant proportion of the Company’s share register. Depositary and Custodian The Bank of New York Mellon (International) Limited (“BNYMIL”) was appointed by the Board as Depositary and Custodian to the Company with effect from 2 July 2018  taking over from BNY Mellon Trust & Depositary (UK) Limited following an internal reorganisation within the Bank of New York Mellon Group.

The Company and the Depositary may terminate the Depositary Agreement with three months’ written notice. The Depositary provides the following services  interalia  under the Depositary Agreement: · safekeeping and custody of the Company’s custodial investments and cash; · processing of transactions; and · foreign exchange services. As part of the transition of AIFM and Investment Manager to AVI  work has commenced to transition the role of depositary and custodian as well. Further information will follow in due course.

The schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board  as well as the Terms of Reference of its committees  are reviewed on an annual basis and further describe Directors’ responsibilities and obligations and include any statutory and regulatory duties. The Audit Committee has the responsibility for the ongoing review of the Company’s risk management systems and internal controls and  to the extent that they are applicable  risks related to the matters set out in Section 172 are included in the Company’s risk register and are subject to periodic and regular reviews and monitoring. Stakeholders A company’s stakeholders are normally considered to comprise its shareholders  its employees  its customers  its suppliers as well as the wider community in which the company operates and impacts. The Company is different in that as an externally managed investment trust it has no employees and  significantly  its customers are synonymous with its shareholders. In terms of suppliers  the Company receives professional services from a number of different service providers  principal among them being the Portfolio Manager. The Directors believe that fostering constructive and collaborative relationships with the Company’s service providers will assist in their promotion of the success of the Company for the benefit of all shareholders. The Board engages with representatives from its service providers throughout the year. Representatives from the Investment Manager and Frostrow are in attendance at each Board meeting. The services provided by the Investment Manager and the Company Secretary and Administrator respectively  are fundamental to the long-term success of the Company. Furthermore  the Board believes that the wider community in which the Company operates encompasses its portfolio of investee companies and the communities in which they operate. Details of how the Board considers the needs and priorities of the Company’s stakeholders and how these are taken into account during all its discussions and as part of its decision-making are detailed below. All discussions involve careful considerations of the longer- term consequences of any decisions and their implications for stakeholders. Further details are set out below: Who? Why? How? Stakeholder group The benefits of engaging with the company’s stakeholders How the board  the portfolio manager and administrator have engaged with the company’s stakeholders Investors Continued shareholder support and engagement are critical to the continued existence of the Company and the delivery of its long-term strategy. Clear communication of the Company’s strategy and the performance against the Company’s objective can help the share price trade at a narrower discount or a wider premium to its net asset value per share which benefits shareholders. New shares can be issued to meet demand without diluting net asset value per share for existing shareholders. Increasing the size of the Company can benefit liquidity as well as spread costs. In an effort to control the discount at which shares trade to their net asset value per share  the Company can buy back shares if the Board considers this to be in the best interest of the Company and shareholders as a whole. Shares can either be held in “treasury” or cancelled. Any shares held in treasury can later be sold back to the market if conditions permit. The Company does not currently hold any shares in treasury. The Investment Manager  Frostrow and the Company’s broker  on behalf of the Board  complete a programme of investor relations throughout the year. An analysis of the Company’s shareholder register is provided to the Directors at each Board meeting along with marketing reports from Frostrow. The Board reviews and considers the marketing plans on a regular basis. Reports from the Company’s broker on investor sentiment and industry issues are submitted to the Board. Key mechanisms of engagement include: · the Annual and Interim Reports of the Company; · the Annual General Meeting; · the Company’s website which hosts reports  video interviews with the portfolio manager and monthly factsheets; · Stock Exchange announcements; · one-on-one investor meetings and online webinars; · should any significant votes* be cast against a resolution  proposed at the Annual General Meeting  the Board will engage with Shareholders in order to understand the reasons behind the votes against; and. · following the consultation  an update will be published no later than six months after the AGM and the Annual Report will detail the impact the Shareholder feedback has had on any decisions the Board has taken and any actions or resolutions proposed. * Significant votes against a resolution would be at least 20% of votes cast (sources: The Investment Association and the UK Corporate Governance Code) Investment Manager The relationship with the Investment Manager is fundamental to ensuring the Company meets its investment objective. Engagement with the Company’s Investment Manager is necessary to evaluate their performance against the Company’s stated strategy and to understand any risks or opportunities this may present. Engagement also helps ensure that Investment Management costs are closely monitored and remain competitive. The Board meets regularly with the Company’s Investment Manager throughout the year both formally at the scheduled Board meetings and informally as needed. The Board also receives monthly performance and compliance reporting.This is expected to continue once AVI has taken over as AIFM and Investment Manager from Premier Miton. The Investment Manager’s attendance at each Board meeting provides the opportunity for the Investment Manager and Board to further reinforce their mutual understanding of what is expected from both parties. Service Providers The Company contracts with third parties for other services including: depositary  investment accounting & administration as well as company secretarial and registrars. The Company ensures that the third parties to whom the services have been outsourced complete their roles in line with their service level agreements  thereby supporting the Company in its success and ensuring compliance with its obligations. The Board and Frostrow engage regularly with other service providers both in one-to-one meetings and via regular written reporting. Representatives from service providers are asked to attend Board and Audit Committee meetings when deemed appropriate. This regular interaction provides an environment where topics  issues and business development needs can be dealt with efficiently and collegiately. Portfolio Companies Gaining a deeper understanding of the portfolio companies and their strategies assists in understanding and mitigating risks of an investment as well as identifying future potential opportunities. Day-to-day engagement with portfolio companies is undertaken by the Investment Manager. Details of how the Investment Manager carries out portfolio management as well as information on its investment approach can be found in the Investment Manager’s Report. The Board receives updates at each scheduled Board meeting from the Investment Managers on specific investments including regular valuation reports and detailed portfolio and returns analyses. The Investment Manager’s engagement with portfolio companies includes active voting at their annual general meetings  discussions with their stakeholders and on-site visits where appropriate. All engagements with portfolio companies are expected to continue under the new AIFM and Investment Manager  AVI. What? Outcomes and actions What were the key topics of engagement? What actions were taken  including principal decisions? Key topics of engagement with investors Ongoing dialogue with shareholders concerning the strategy of the Company  performance and the portfolio. The Investment Manager  Frostrow and the broker meet regularly with shareholders and potential investors to discuss the Company’s strategy  performance  the portfolio and any other issues which might be raised.Shareholders are provided with performance updates via the Company’s website as well as the usual financial reports  monthly factsheets and podcasts. Key topics of engagement with the Investment Manager on an ongoing basis Portfolio composition  performance  outlook and business updates as well as any particular issues of engagement with portfolio companies.Team compositionThe impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on their business and the portfolio. Updates are received by the Directors at every Board meeting and throughout the year in respect of economic and other factors which might impact on investment decision making.The ongoing war in Ukraine and its impact on markets and the Company’s portfolio in particular  is also being kept under observation by the Board and the Investment Managers.During the year under review  the Board of MIGO was informed that Nick Greenwood  the lead investment manager had decided to leave PMI. After serving protective notice on PMI on 6 March 2023  and following detailed shareholder engagement and a rigorous selection process  as part of the Board’s manager review  the Board appointed AVI to become the Company’s AIFM and Investment Manager to implement MIGO’s existing investment objective and policy. Further information can be found in the Chairman’s Statement. Other Service Providers The Directors have frequent engagement with the Company’s other service providers through the annual cycle of reporting and due diligence meetings or discussions held by Frostrow on behalf of the Board. This engagement is completed with the aim of maintaining an effective working relationship and oversight of the services provided. No specific action is currently required as the reviews of the Company’s other service providers have been positive and the Directors believe their continued appointment is in the best interests of the Company. Portfolio Companies The Investment Manager  on behalf of the Board  has engaged with a number of portfolio companies: in order to create value for shareholders  mainly to tighten discounts or to provide liquidity.in order to address ESG matters including climate change. Many trusts have to deal with increasing environmental legislation and are already working hard to improve their credentials.in order to achieve good governance overall  as good governance means that board and management of portfolio companies are aware and proactive in their approach to all environmental and social issues. In order to achieve better liquidity  the Investment Manager has lobbied a number of portfolio companies for increasing buybacks and changes in capital structure.The Investment Manager is aware that trusts perceived to be falling behind in ESG and climate change concerns will be downrated by investors. This issue therefore makes up an important part of the risk assessment when looking at possible investments.For the current Investment Manager good governance is the best way to ensure best value for shareholders. To this end  environmental and social factors as well as governance are discussed in meetings with managements. It is expected that this will continue under the new Investment Manager. Culture and Business Ethics The Directors agree that establishing and maintaining a healthy corporate culture among the Board and in its interaction with the Investment Manager  other service providers and shareholders supports the delivery of the Company’s goals. The Board seeks to promote a culture of openness  debate and integrity through ongoing dialogue and engagement with all stakeholders. The Company is committed to carrying out business in an honest and fair manner with a zero-tolerance approach to bribery  tax evasion and corruption. As such  policies and procedures are in place to prevent these. As detailed in the Governance section  the Company has a number of policies and procedures in place to assist with maintaining a culture of good governance including those relating to diversity and Directors’ conflicts of interest. The Board assesses and monitors compliance with these policies as well as the general culture of the Board through Board meetings and  in particular  the annual evaluation process which is undertaken by each Director (for more information please see the performance evaluation section in the Corporate Governance Report). The Board strives to ensure that its culture is in line with the Company’s purpose  values and strategy. It also seeks to appoint the best possible service providers  including the Investment Manager  and evaluates their remit  performance and cost effectiveness on a regular basis. The Board considers the culture of the Investment Manager and other service providers  including their policies  practices and behaviour  through regular reporting from these stakeholders and  in particular  during the annual review of the performance and continuing appointment of all service providers through its Management Engagement Committee. Environmental  Human Rights and Social Issues The Company has no employees and the Board consists entirely of non-executive Directors. Day-to-day management of the Company’s business is delegated to the Investment Manager. As an investment trust that invests in other funds  the Company has very limited direct impact on the community or the environment and therefore the Company itself has no environmental  human rights  social or community policies. However  the Company acknowledges that it can have an indirect impact on the community or the environment  based on the portfolio companies that the Investment Manager invests in. Therefore  ESG matters including climate change are frequently discussed in meetings with portfolio companies  and are also part of the risk assessment when deciding on whether an investment should be made. For further details please see the Investment Manager’s Report and the Business Review. As an investment company  the Company does not provide goods or services in the normal course of business and does not have customers. All its operational functions are outsourced to third-party service providers. Accordingly  the Company falls outside the scope of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The Company’s suppliers are typically professional advisers and the Company’s supply chains are considered low risk in this regard. In carrying out its activities and in relationships with suppliers  the Company aims to conduct itself responsibly  ethically and fairly. The Board expects its principal service providers also to have appropriate governance policies in place. Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) The Company notes the TCFD recommendations on climate-related financial disclosures. The Company is an investment trust with no employees  internal operations or property and  as such  it is exempt from the Listing Rules requirement to report against the TCFD framework. The current Investment Manager reports on progress against its own climate change objectives on its website at www.premiermiton.com/responsibility/ . There  the principles of responsible investing  UN sustainable development goals and the aims of the Carbon Disclosure Programme (“CDP”) are set out. Premier Miton is also a signatory to Climate Action 100+  an investor-led initiative to ensure the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters take necessary action on climate change.

Mr Opitz thus slightly increases his shareholding and holds around 8% in Pyrum including attributable shares. Pascal Klein continues to hold around 10% of the company. The transaction was executed as an OTC transaction at a purchase price of EUR 50.00 per share and thus around 3.7% above the average value of the last five trading days prior to the closing on Xetra (EUR 48.23). The relevant notifications of Pyrum Innovations AG on directors' dealings pursuant to Art. 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation are available on the company's website at https://www.pyrum.net/investoren/finanzmitteilungen/.Pascal Klein: ""I still remain the largest individual shareholder of Pyrum. However  a larger tax payment due to the IPO has led me to sell a small part of my shareholding in the company. My shares are in very good hands with Jürgen Opitz. Through the OTC transaction  we wanted to prevent a possible influence on the share price due to the tightness of the market for Pyrum shares.""Pyrum Innovations AG  a pioneer in the sustainable recycling of end-of-life tyres (ELTs) based on its patented pyrolysis technology  has been listed on the Euronext Growth market segment of the Oslo Stock Exchange since 30 September 2021 and on the Scale market segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since 30 March 2022. In addition to the founding partners Pascal Klein and Michael Kapf  the chemical group and cooperation partner BASF is also among the major shareholders with a current share of 7.9%. The tyre manufacturer Continental  among others  also participated in the IPO.About Pyrum Innovations AGPyrum Innovations AG is active in the attractive recycling market for end-of-life tyres with its patented pyrolysis technology. Pyrum's pyrolysis process is energy self-sufficient and  according to the Fraunhofer Institute  saves significantly more CO 2 emissions than today's standard recycling processes for end-of-life tyres - especially compared to incineration in cement plants - and produces new raw materials such as pyrolysis oil  gas and recovered carbon black from the waste used as input materials. In this way  Pyrum closes the recyclable material loop and pursues a completely sustainable business model. As a pioneer  Pyrum Innovations AG was the first company in the end-of-life tyre recycling sector to receive REACH registration from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the pyrolysis oil it produces. This means that the oil is recognised as an official raw material that can be used in production processes. In addition  Pyrum has received ISCC PLUS certification for the pyrolysis oil and the recovered carbon black. Both products are thus considered sustainable and renewable raw materials. In addition  Pyrum has received ISO 14001 certification for its environmental management system and ISO 9001 certification for its quality management system. These achievements have also been recognised by international experts in the tyre industry. For example  Pyrum won the Best Tyre Recycling Innovation category at the inaugural Recircle Awards and has been nominated for the Grand Prix Mittelstand (Großer Preis des Mittelstandes) from the German state of Saarland.www.pyrum.netContactIR.on AGFrederic HilkePhone: +49 221 9140 970Email: pyrum@ir-on.comPyrum Innovations AGDieselstr. 866763 Dillingen / SaarEmail: presse@pyrum.net",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,positive,0.77,0.21,0.02,True,English,"['Pyrum Innovations AG', 'Supervisory Board member', 'Executive Board OTC', 'EQS-News', 'shares', 'Supervisory Board member Jürgen Opitz', 'Best Tyre Recycling Innovation category', 'life tyre recycling sector', 'Euronext Growth market segment', 'Pyrum Innovations AG Dieselstr.', 'Scale market segment', 'attractive recycling market', 'Executive Board OTC', 'IR.on AG', 'largest individual shareholder', 'last five trading', 'larger tax payment', 'Oslo Stock Exchange', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'recyclable material loop', 'European Chemicals Agency', 'environmental management system', 'quality management system', 'inaugural Recircle Awards', 'Grand Prix Mittelstand', 'Großer Preis', 'standard recycling processes', 'Market Abuse Regulation', 'official raw material', 'sustainable business model', 'ISCC PLUS certification', 'new raw materials', 'sustainable recycling', 'Mr Opitz', 'life tyres', 'production processes', 'input materials', 'ISO 14001 certification', 'ISO 9001 certification', 'OTC transaction', 'Key word', 'Pascal Klein', 'purchase price', 'average value', 'relevant notifications', 'pyrum.net', 'small part', 'good hands', 'possible influence', 'pyrolysis technology', 'founding partners', 'Michael Kapf', 'chemical group', 'cooperation partner', 'major shareholders', 'pyrolysis process', 'Fraunhofer Institute', 'CO 2 emissions', 'cement plants', 'carbon black', 'REACH registration', 'international experts', 'German state', 'Frederic Hilke', 'pyrolysis oil', 'share price', 'current share', '4,000 Pyrum shares', 'attributable shares', 'first company', 'EQS-News', 'Miscellaneous', 'CEST', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'Dillingen', 'Saar', 'CEO', 'ISIN', 'total', 'holding', 'counter', '31 July', 'closing', 'Xetra', 'directors', 'dealings', 'Art.', 'website', 'investoren', 'finanzmitteilungen', 'IPO', 'tightness', 'pioneer', 'end', 'ELTs', '30 September', '30 March', 'addition', 'BASF', 'manufacturer', 'Continental', 'others', 'incineration', 'gas', 'waste', 'way', 'ECHA', 'products', 'achievements', 'industry', 'example', 'Mittelstandes', 'Contact', 'Phone', 'Email', 'presse']",2023-08-04,2023-08-04,markets.businessinsider.com

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillDepartment of Finance officials have raised questions over the future of Ireland’s stock market  warning the Dublin exchange may face “long-term decline” as two of its biggest companies take out listings in the United States.Officials fear the departure of cement giant CRH from the Irish market and US moves by gambling group Flutter “could harm Ireland’s attractiveness” for international investors in shares  leading to a loss of trading revenues and commissions.In a private briefing note for Minister for Finance Michael McGrath  they also said nutrition company Glanbia  insulation maker Kingspan and food group Kerry might yet be tempted to follow CRH and Flutter with US listings.The note  released under the Freedom of Information Act  was submitted to Mr McGrath as he prepared for an April meeting with Euronext  owner of the Irish Stock Exchange since 2018.READ MOREEuronext Dublin  whose headquarters is in Amsterdam  had previously written to the Minister asking him to intervene with CRH and Flutter to persuade them to maintain Irish listings.Asked whether the Minister had intervened  the department said officials had engaged with Euronext Dublin and “relevant market participants” to better understand the issues impacting on Irish equity markets.CRH will leave the Irish market in September as it prepares to join the New York Stock Exchange and seek inclusion on US indices that track market performance  moves designed to boost American investment in the company.Flutter  owner of the Paddy Power business  has received shareholder approval to take out a stock market listing in the US but has not said whether it will leave the Irish market.Such developments are significant for the Dublin exchange because the two companies make up about 38 per cent of the annual turnover of shares.[ Irish stock market facing strong headwinds as companies shift primary listings ]CRH is moving for strategic reasons  seeking a US listing to gain from increased public infrastructure funding there and higher share valuations. The US market accounts for three-quarters of its profit.For its part  Flutter wants to take advantage of new American opportunities as US states relax gambling laws after the supreme court struck down a federal ban on commercial sports betting.Finance officials have asked whether CRH was the “canary in the coal mine”  noting a shortage of new companies going to Dublin market with initial public offerings (IPOs) of their shares.“The lack of an IPO pipeline and the few new listings to the Irish exchange in recent years  in comparison to London or European market peers  suggests the Irish exchange could be entering a phase of long-term decline ” the paper said.“With CRH and Flutter representing almost c. 40 per cent of the total value of the Irish equities market  it would not be unwise to consider whether similar growth prospects  liquidity and valuation siren calls could trigger another Irish-listed company to announce a USA listing.”The paper said Glanbia could be one “potential candidate”  saying the company’s financial reporting currency has shifted to US dollars in line with most of its revenues.“The impact on the exchange would not be as large as with CRH  but it may open the doors for other companies to consider the strategy  like Kerry Group but particularly Kingspan.”Asked for comment  Glanbia and Kingspan each said they had no plans to change their Dublin listing. Kerry Group did not comment.Euronext said the challenges facing Irish equity capital markets were “not unique to Ireland” and were also confronting UK and certain European Union markets. “The larger part of Euronext Dublin’s business is debt and funds listings and it is the number 1 exchange globally for listing debt and funds.”Department of Finance officials said they had not found any official statements on potential listing changes from Ryanair  Smurfit Kappa  Kerry Group or Kingspan. “However  it is certain that other larger companies are watching the CRH proposals with interest.”,negative,0.02,0.33,0.64,negative,0.02,0.29,0.69,True,English,"['two big firms', 'stock exchange', 'US listings', 'Officials', 'future', 'Ireland', 'Dara Mac Dónaill', 'Irish equity capital markets', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Irish equity markets', 'European Union markets', 'public infrastructure funding', 'higher share valuations', 'commercial sports betting', 'initial public offerings', 'similar growth prospects', 'one “potential candidate', 'financial reporting currency', 'relevant market participants', 'European market peers', 'potential listing changes', 'new American opportunities', 'private briefing note', 'Paddy Power business', 'c. 40 per cent', 'Irish stock market', 'Irish equities market', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'stock market listing', 'Finance Michael McGrath', 'cement giant CRH', 'other larger companies', 'nutrition company Glanbia', '38 per cent', 'Irish market', 'Irish exchange', 'new companies', 'new listings', 'Mr McGrath', 'American investment', 'other companies', 'market performance', 'Dublin market', 'USA listing', 'Dublin listing', 'Irish listings', 'Dublin exchange', 'number 1 exchange', 'US market', 'US listing', 'long-term decline', 'biggest companies', 'United States', 'international investors', 'insulation maker', 'Information Act', 'April meeting', 'shareholder approval', 'Such developments', 'two companies', 'annual turnover', 'strong headwinds', 'strategic reasons', 'gambling laws', 'supreme court', 'federal ban', 'coal mine', 'IPO pipeline', 'recent years', 'total value', 'siren calls', 'larger part', 'official statements', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'US indices', 'US states', 'US dollars', 'primary listings', 'Finance officials', 'food group', 'Irish-listed company', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Kerry Group', 'trading revenues', 'US moves', 'funds listings', 'CRH proposals', 'owner', 'Minister', 'Flutter', 'Photograph', 'Department', 'questions', 'future', 'Ireland', 'departure', 'attractiveness', 'shares', 'loss', 'commissions', 'Kingspan', 'Freedom', 'READ', 'headquarters', 'Amsterdam', 'issues', 'September', 'inclusion', 'three-quarters', 'profit', 'advantage', 'canary', 'shortage', 'IPOs', 'lack', 'comparison', 'London', 'phase', 'paper', 'liquidity', 'impact', 'doors', 'strategy', 'comment', 'plans', 'challenges', 'UK', 'debt', 'Ryanair', 'interest']",2023-08-04,2023-08-04,irishtimes.com
28765,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/norway-bulletin-april-2023-5162955/,Norway Bulletin - April 2023,"M&A activity is predicted to be strong in 2023 as companies experience tighter access to credit and the anticipated takeovers of some Euronext Growth Oslo-listed companies will start to materialise. The Bermuda Connection for Norway IPOs - ""Appointed Stock ...","​We are pleased to bring you the Conyers Norway Bulletin for 2023  in which we highlight developments affecting Bermuda-based companies in the Norwegian market over the past year.Compared with global markets  the Oslo exchanges remained resilient in 2022. Oslo Børs  for example  experienced only a one per cent fall in value during the year  largely due to strong performance in both shipping and oil and gas  which remain core sectors in Norway. The average fall in value of companies in other sectors was generally in line with global patterns.As in many jurisdictions  fewer acquisitions happened in 2022 than had been expected in Norwegian sectors. M&A activity is predicted to be strong in 2023 as companies experience tighter access to credit and the anticipated takeovers of some Euronext Growth Oslo-listed companies will start to materialise.The Bermuda Connection for Norway IPOs - ""Appointed Stock Exchange"" StatusSince Norway adopted the European Union's Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR)  Bermuda has become an even more attractive domicile for companies seeking to list on a Norwegian exchange: Bermuda is one of the few jurisdictions that both is CSDR compliant and has given all three Norwegian exchanges ""appointed stock exchange"" status. The Euronext Growth Oslo exchange  in particular  is popular for new listings because it allows typically small and medium-sized companies an ability to raise capital through a quick admissions process  along with the potential to ""uplist"" to a larger exchange  such as Oslo Børs. One recent example that Conyers advised on was the Euronext Growth Oslo IPO by Shelf Drilling (North Sea)  Ltd. in November 2022. The company is a shallow-water offshore drilling contractor  operating primarily in the North Sea  that had been domiciled previously in the Cayman Islands  which has not recognised the Euronext Growth Oslo as an approved exchange. As part of the preparation for and execution of the IPO  Conyers provided Bermuda law advice and assistance to the company on its continuance to Bermuda  the completion of its private placement of new shares in connection with its acquisition of five jack-up rigs and its admission to and listing on Euronext Growth Oslo (ticker: SDNS). Another recent Norwegian IPO was completed by Seacrest Petroleo Bermuda Limited  an upstream oil and gas company that specialises in operating mid-life oil and gas fields in Brazil. Seacrest Petroleo  which began trading on the Euronext Expand Oslo in February 2023  was the only company to complete a Norwegian IPO in the first quarter of 2023.Two other Oslo-listed Bermuda companies commenced dual listings on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in March this year: Himalaya Shipping Ltd.  primarily listed on Euronext Expand Oslo  completed a US$45 million New York IPO; and Cool Company Ltd moved its primary listing to the NYSE after its IPO there  making Euronext Growth Oslo a secondary listing.Oslo Exchange Up-listingNorwegian markets also saw a significant increase in up-listings from Euronext Growth Oslo to Oslo Børs. One such up-listing was by Seadrill Limited  which relisted on Oslo Børs and the NYSE following its successful restructuring in Bermuda.During 2021  Conyers' Bermuda  London and Cayman Islands offices advised Seadrill Limited and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries (Seadrill Group) in connection with its Chapter 11 filing with the US Bankruptcy Court and subsequent restructuring. Following that restructuring  Seadrill received approval to uplist from Euronext Expand Oslo back to Oslo Børs in November 2022. (It had previously relisted its common shares on the NYSE in October 2022.)Seadrill's successful restructuring and relisting on major exchanges quickly put it in a position to pursue and finalise new M&A deals in 2022:In September  Seadrill sold the legal entities that own and operate seven jack-up drilling rigs in Saudi Arabian waters for approximately US$628 million. The proceeds from this sale enabled Seadrill to significantly de-leverage its balance sheet and to eliminate outstanding capital expenditures.In October  Seadrill entered into a binding agreement to sell its entire 35% stake in Paratus Energy Services Limited (formerly Seadrill New Finance Limited) and certain other interests to an undisclosed buyer.In December  Seadrill and Aquadrill LLC entered into a definitive merger agreement  under which Seadrill acquired Aquadrill in an all-stock transaction at an implied equity value of approximately US$958 million. That acquisition completed on 3 April 2023.The quick return by Seadrill to participation in major industry deals demonstrates the success of its restructuring efforts. Bermuda played an integral role alongside the US bankruptcy courts in the impressive collaboration required on this complex matter.Sponsored Norwegian Depository ReceiptsOne of the new developments for Norwegian markets is that non-Norwegian companies can now list Sponsored Norwegian Depository Receipts (SNDRs). This change came about when Norway adopted the European Union's Central Securities Depository Regulation. Unlike other methods for making foreign shares available in Norway  SNDRs do not require local law to recognise the Norwegian Central Securities Depository as a foreign shareholder register  nor do companies have to set up complicated intermediary links.SNDRs are typically used for unlisted Bermuda companies  such as Avenir LNG and GoodBulk  where investors can participate in the company with such interests being tradeable on the Norwegian over-the-counter market (Euronext NOTC).The underlying shares are deposited and held with a Norwegian financial institution  with that institution issuing the SNDRs held by the investors. Shares previously registered in Norway through the now-defunct single security link method can be converted to SNDRs through a relatively simple process.Marine Money 2023: Equity Follow-on Deal of the YearConyers was recognised by Marine Money magazine for our involvement in a transaction that won Equity Follow-on Deal of the Year 2022. Conyers advised Hafnia Limited in connection with a US$100 million private placement of new shares in May 2022. Hafnia put some of those proceeds towards working capital for its new fleet of 32 IMO II tankers  which it gained through its acquisition of Chemical Tankers Inc. in January 2022. (Conyers was also recognised for our involvement in that acquisition  which won M&A Deal of the Year 2021.)23 Bermuda Companies Listed in Oslo with Combined Market Capitalisation of US$26 billion*18 Bermuda companies listed on Oslo Børs2 Bermuda companies listed on Growth Oslo3 Bermuda companies listed on Expand Oslo*As of 30 April 20232 New Listings of Bermuda Companies in the Past Year: Seacrest Petroleo Bermuda Limited (Expand Oslo) and Shelf Drilling (North Sea) Ltd. (Growth Oslo)World Federation of Exchanges to Convene Global Meeting in Bermuda in 2023This year  the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX) will host the general assembly and annual meeting of the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) on 19-21 September 2023. The BSX  which became a WFE member in 1999  has been a WFE board member since 2016.The Oslo Børs exchange is also a WFE member  and the assembly will be an opportunity to strengthen ties between the two jurisdictions. The BSX is particularly popular for debt listings  and we note  for example  that Norwegian Cruise Lines has previously listed nearly US$2 billion of its senior notes on the BSX.Conyers recently expanded its services to include BSX listing sponsorship following the approval of Conyers Securities (Bermuda) Limited as a full trading member of the BSX. The BSX requires a listing sponsor for all new listings to better ensure the legitimacy of the entity and its regulatory compliance. Conyers has helped clients list new entities on the BSX for many years  and this new service capability means Conyers can also look after the final step of listing sponsorship. As a full trading member  Conyers can sponsor any type of listing on the BSX  including primary equity listings  which is particularly useful for dual listings involving the BSX.Other Market ActivityIn February 2023  Golden Ocean Group Limited  the world's leading owner of Capesize dry bulk vessels  entered into an agreement to acquire six modern 208 000 deadweightton vessels equipped with exhaust gas cleaning systems (scrubbers) for a total consideration of US$291 million. The newly-acquired vessels will be chartered back to their former owner  an unrelated third party  for approximately 36 months at an average daily time charter equivalent rate of approximately US$21 000 net.The acquisition will be financed by a new US$233 million credit facility  which will be secured by the newly acquired vessels and two unencumbered vessels  and cash on hand (largely from the proceeds of the sale of 11 older vessels over the previous 24 months). Golden Ocean expects to have sufficient remaining cash to fund the majority of the expected equity required for 10 Kamsarmax currently under construction.Flex LNG Ltd finalised its Balance Sheet Optimization Programme in March 2023 with the signing of a US$290 million loan agreement for the refinancing of Flex Freedom and Flex Vigilant. Previously  Flex LNG had completed the refinancing of Flex Aurora  Flex Artemis and Flex Amber in February and closed the lease for Flex Rainbow earlier in March. These financings provided Flex LNG with US$204 million in net cash proceeds for the first quarter of 2023. Effective 30 December 2022  Frontline plc (formerly Frontline Ltd.) redomiciled to Cyprus from Bermuda. Frontline's management described the move as one of the conditional steps toward a previously announced proposal to combine operations with Belgium-based tanker firm Euronav. That planned merger fell through in January 2023.Recent Transactions by Bermuda-based CompaniesArcher Limited (OB:ARCH) made a successful private placement of 1.04 billion new common shares (equivalent to approximately US$100 million in gross proceeds) followed by a public placement of 17 773 685 new common shares (April 2023).Himalaya Shipping Ltd.

(OB:FLNG; NYSE:FLNG) registered US$100 million of ordinary shares  which may be issued to eligible participants under the company's dividend reinvestment plan and direct stock purchase plan  and entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc. as sales agents  under which they may offer and sell its ordinary shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million (November 2022).Cool Company Ltd (OB:CLCO; NYSE CLCO) was subject to two share offerings of approximately US$270 million  with Golar LNG Ltd as the selling shareholder for the offerings (November 2022).Northern Ocean Ltd.
