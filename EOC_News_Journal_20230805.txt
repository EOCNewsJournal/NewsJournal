WeissEvents of the last five years  such as the U.S.-China trade war  the COVID-19 pandemic  and—most recently—Russia's invasion of Ukraine  have raised concerns in the popular press and among policymakers that the international economic and financial system is at risk of becoming significantly fragmented (Aiyar et al.  2023; Ip  2023; Shin  2023). Most recently  attention has shifted to the possibility of fragmentation along geopolitical lines  where countries primarily trade with and invest in other countries with which they share close diplomatic and political ties (International Monetary Fund  2023a b). For the U.S.  these fragmentation fears often focus on concerns about the willingness of investors in emerging market economies (EMEs) to hold U.S. assets (and U.S. dollar-denominated assets more broadly).In this note  I discuss purchases of U.S. securities by foreign official and private investors in 2022 as reported by the Treasury International Capital (TIC) system—the primary data source on foreign demand for U.S. securities—and find little evidence of financial fragmentation through this channel.2 I focus on investors in countries (in particular China  India  and many countries in the Middle East) that have received attention for having heightened geopolitical tensions with the U.S. following Russia's invasion of Ukraine  or increased economic ties with Russia  or greater willingness to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar.3 Investors in these countries were among the largest purchasers of U.S. securities in 2022.4 Moreover  purchases by these countries were not just large compared to flows from other countries  but also large relative to their own purchases of U.S. securities in recent years. The behavior of financial flows to the U.S. in 2022 suggests that financial fragmentation has been quite limited to date  at least for foreign holdings of U.S. securities.5Foreign purchases of U.S. securities were significant in 2022 and sometimes came from ""unexpected"" locationsIn 2022  foreign investors purchased nearly $670 billion of long-term U.S. securities and short-term Treasury bills. As shown in Figure 1  investors in countries that experienced heightened geopolitical tensions with the U.S. in 2022  or countries that—at a minimum—expressed further desire to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar  were among the largest purchasers of U.S. securities last year  specifically China  India  and the Middle East oil exporters.6 7 For China and India  these purchases came despite deepening economic ties to Russia—which was subjected to numerous additional U.S. sanctions in 2022—through greater imports of Russian fuel  and  in the case of China  strengthened political ties following the declaration of a ""no-limits"" partnership with Russia.8 Moreover  geopolitical relations between China and the U.S. appeared to deteriorate further in 2022  especially after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan (Kuo et al.  2022). Some Middle East oil exporters reportedly experienced strained relations with the U.S. in 2022  and the United Arab Emirates became an important intermediary for Russian oil exports.9 If widespread financial fragmentation was occurring  one would not expect these countries to make large purchases of U.S. securities. Finally  while central banks in many of these countries also reportedly made net purchases of gold in 2022  these gold purchases were significantly smaller in dollar terms relative to the purchases of U.S. securities reported here (World Gold Council  2023).10Figure 1. Largest Net Purchasers of U.S. Assets in 2022Moreover  the reported purchases by potential geoeconomic diversifiers may understate these countries' true purchases of U.S. securities in 2022. Some of the large purchases of U.S. securities in 2022 attributed to Belgian residents  as shown in Figure 1  likely reflect purchases by ultimate investors in other countries. Euroclear  a major global securities custodian  is based in Belgium  so holdings of U.S. securities attributed to Belgium often belong to residents of other foreign countries who custody these securities with Euroclear (Bertaut and Judson  2014). For example  Setser (2016) notes that the TIC data may understate China and Saudi Arabia's true holdings of U.S. dollar assets  but that combining Belgium's holdings of U.S. Treasury securities with China's holdings helps match both the size of China's estimated U.S. dollar FX reserves and the timing of changes in these FX reserves. Thus  it is plausible that some of the Belgian purchases estimated in 2022 actually came from Chinese investors and perhaps investors in some of the other countries discussed above.Purchases of U.S. securities by China  India  and Middle East oil exporters in 2022 also large compared to their prior purchases.Not only were the purchases by China  India  and the Middle East oil exporters in 2022 large compared to those by other countries  they were also sizable when measured against these countries' average purchases over the previous nine years. As shown in Figure 2  net purchases in 2022 were well above average annual net purchases from 2013-2021 in every case. Additionally  for India and the Middle East oil exporters  purchases of U.S. securities in 2022 were not just above average but the highest ever. Moreover  these record purchases of U.S. securities by investors in India and the Middle East came despite limited overall FX reserve accumulation or even FX reserve sales by these countries in 2022. Thus  the lack of foreign exchange reserve accumulation in 2022 by some of these countries does not necessarily reflect a diminished interest in U.S. securities.11 As before  under increased financial fragmentation  one would not expect these countries to be making larger purchases of U.S. assets compared to purchases in previous years.Figure 2. Purchases of U.S. Securities in 2022 by Selected EMEsOne qualification is that  for China and the Middle East oil exporters  current account surpluses were significantly larger in 2022 than in previous years. Since current account surpluses are equivalent to net capital outflows  this would suggest that the larger purchases of U.S. securities by China and the Middle East oil exporters in 2022 were simply the mirror of their larger current account surpluses. That is  geopolitical tensions could still have weighed on financial flows to the U.S. from these countries. The data do not necessarily support this argument  however. As shown in Figure 3  purchases of U.S. securities by Middle East oil exporters in 2022 were still quite large when compared to purchases in other years since 2005 when these countries had similarly large current account surpluses. Current account balances likely play some role in determining which countries purchase U.S. securities  but the large purchases by the Middle East oil exporters in 2022 still stand out even after accounting for their large current account surpluses.Figure 3. Middle East Petrodollar Recycling  2005−2022A large current account surplus in China also does not necessarily guarantee large purchases of U.S. securities by Chinese investors. Chinese annual current account surpluses returned to more elevated levels three years ago  beginning in 2020 (far surpassing the 2010-2019 annual average)  and approaching record levels in 2022. Yet  over the past three years  Chinese investors purchased U.S. securities only in 2022  despite the heightened geopolitical tensions.Although India consistently runs current account deficits (accruing an especially large deficit in 2022)  one still needs to consider whether its net purchases of U.S. securities in 2022 might have reflected broader developments in Indian investors' purchases of foreign securities. To do so  I compare purchases of U.S. securities by Indian investors (as reported in the TIC data) to combined gross portfolio outflows and official reserve asset accumulation for each of the past ten years in Figure 4. By this benchmark  Indian purchases of U.S. securities in 2022 are exceptionally notable  as Indian investors actually sold foreign securities on net in 2022. Thus  the large purchases of U.S. securities by Indian investors in 2022 were not part of a broader set of purchases of foreign securities.Figure 4. Purchases of Foreign Assets by India  2013−2022Purchases of U.S. securities by other EMEs also relatively large in 2022The phenomenon of relatively large purchases of U.S. securities (when compared to those of recent years) in 2022 was not limited to China  India  and the Middle East oil exporters. Figure 2 additionally shows that Colombia and South Africa also had purchases of U.S. securities in 2022 above their recent historical averages  with purchases by Colombia at historical highs.12 These purchases are notable as both countries possibly showed signs of drifting away from the U.S. geopolitically in 2022.13 Under the administration led by Iván Duque  Colombia had pledged to help train Ukrainian troops for landmine removal in May 2022 (Orru  2022). Following Gustavo Petro's ascension to the presidency  Colombia's rhetoric on Ukraine shifted to a more neutral stance  and Petro refused to send Russian-made weapons to Ukraine in early 2023 (Quesada  2022; Stott et al.  2023). South Africa participated in joint military exercises with Russia and China during the one-year anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine (du Plessis  2023). If geopolitics were a major factor driving financial flows to the U.S.  these net purchases would likely not have occurred.Differences in data coverage lead to slightly different conclusions about fragmentation in other recent workOther recent work finds greater geopolitical distance between countries is associated with a reduction in cross-border portfolio investment (International Monetary Fund  2023a). Such a finding seems at odds with the facts reported in this note  so it is important to discuss what may be behind this discrepancy. First  I report net purchases by all investors—both private and official sector purchases  while International Monetary Fund (2023a) studies private sector allocations  sometimes focusing only on investment fund allocations and at other times reporting results for all private portfolio investments. For the U.S. and other advanced economies that receive substantial cross-border inflows from foreign official (government) investors  it is important to consider both private and official investors  as official investors are responsible for nearly a quarter of all cross-border portfolio holdings of U.S. securities.14Second  there are also differences in the data on private sector investors between this note and International Monetary Fund (2023a) that could result in different conclusions about geoeconomic fragmentation. International Monetary Fund (2023a) primarily analyzes investment fund allocations  but these funds are a subset of the overall investor base  and their importance for total portfolio investment varies across countries. This can limit our ability to draw broader conclusions about geopolitics and financial fragmentation from analysis of this sector. While the use of the IMF's coordinated portfolio investment survey (CPIS) data ameliorates this concern  the CPIS can also be limited by countries' voluntary participation in this survey. For example  many of the Middle East oil exporters discussed in this note do not report their cross-border holdings in CPIS. In contrast  reporting on all cross-border securities holdings in the TIC system is mandatory for all U.S.-resident custodians.15 Thus  while this note only discusses foreign portfolio investments in the U.S.  it analyzes the most comprehensive data available on these investments and finds little evidence of fragmentation along geopolitical lines.ReferencesAiyar  Shekhar  Ilyina  Anna  and others (2023).

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillDepartment of Finance officials have raised questions over the future of Ireland’s stock market  warning the Dublin exchange may face “long-term decline” as two of its biggest companies take out listings in the United States.Officials fear the departure of cement giant CRH from the Irish market and US moves by gambling group Flutter “could harm Ireland’s attractiveness” for international investors in shares  leading to a loss of trading revenues and commissions.In a private briefing note for Minister for Finance Michael McGrath  they also said nutrition company Glanbia  insulation maker Kingspan and food group Kerry might yet be tempted to follow CRH and Flutter with US listings.The note  released under the Freedom of Information Act  was submitted to Mr McGrath as he prepared for an April meeting with Euronext  owner of the Irish Stock Exchange since 2018.READ MOREEuronext Dublin  whose headquarters is in Amsterdam  had previously written to the Minister asking him to intervene with CRH and Flutter to persuade them to maintain Irish listings.Asked whether the Minister had intervened  the department said officials had engaged with Euronext Dublin and “relevant market participants” to better understand the issues impacting on Irish equity markets.CRH will leave the Irish market in September as it prepares to join the New York Stock Exchange and seek inclusion on US indices that track market performance  moves designed to boost American investment in the company.Flutter  owner of the Paddy Power business  has received shareholder approval to take out a stock market listing in the US but has not said whether it will leave the Irish market.Such developments are significant for the Dublin exchange because the two companies make up about 38 per cent of the annual turnover of shares.[ Irish stock market facing strong headwinds as companies shift primary listings ]CRH is moving for strategic reasons  seeking a US listing to gain from increased public infrastructure funding there and higher share valuations. The US market accounts for three-quarters of its profit.For its part  Flutter wants to take advantage of new American opportunities as US states relax gambling laws after the supreme court struck down a federal ban on commercial sports betting.Finance officials have asked whether CRH was the “canary in the coal mine”  noting a shortage of new companies going to Dublin market with initial public offerings (IPOs) of their shares.“The lack of an IPO pipeline and the few new listings to the Irish exchange in recent years  in comparison to London or European market peers  suggests the Irish exchange could be entering a phase of long-term decline ” the paper said.“With CRH and Flutter representing almost c. 40 per cent of the total value of the Irish equities market  it would not be unwise to consider whether similar growth prospects  liquidity and valuation siren calls could trigger another Irish-listed company to announce a USA listing.”The paper said Glanbia could be one “potential candidate”  saying the company’s financial reporting currency has shifted to US dollars in line with most of its revenues.“The impact on the exchange would not be as large as with CRH  but it may open the doors for other companies to consider the strategy  like Kerry Group but particularly Kingspan.”Asked for comment  Glanbia and Kingspan each said they had no plans to change their Dublin listing. Kerry Group did not comment.Euronext said the challenges facing Irish equity capital markets were “not unique to Ireland” and were also confronting UK and certain European Union markets. “The larger part of Euronext Dublin’s business is debt and funds listings and it is the number 1 exchange globally for listing debt and funds.”Department of Finance officials said they had not found any official statements on potential listing changes from Ryanair  Smurfit Kappa  Kerry Group or Kingspan. “However  it is certain that other larger companies are watching the CRH proposals with interest.”,negative,0.02,0.33,0.64,negative,0.02,0.29,0.69,True,English,"['two big firms', 'stock exchange', 'US listings', 'Officials', 'future', 'Ireland', 'Dara Mac Dónaill', 'Irish equity capital markets', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Irish equity markets', 'European Union markets', 'public infrastructure funding', 'higher share valuations', 'commercial sports betting', 'initial public offerings', 'similar growth prospects', 'one “potential candidate', 'financial reporting currency', 'relevant market participants', 'European market peers', 'potential listing changes', 'new American opportunities', 'private briefing note', 'Paddy Power business', 'c. 40 per cent', 'Irish stock market', 'Irish equities market', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'stock market listing', 'Finance Michael McGrath', 'cement giant CRH', 'other larger companies', 'nutrition company Glanbia', '38 per cent', 'Irish market', 'Irish exchange', 'new companies', 'new listings', 'Mr McGrath', 'American investment', 'other companies', 'market performance', 'Dublin market', 'USA listing', 'Dublin listing', 'Irish listings', 'Dublin exchange', 'number 1 exchange', 'US market', 'US listing', 'long-term decline', 'biggest companies', 'United States', 'international investors', 'insulation maker', 'Information Act', 'April meeting', 'shareholder approval', 'Such developments', 'two companies', 'annual turnover', 'strong headwinds', 'strategic reasons', 'gambling laws', 'supreme court', 'federal ban', 'coal mine', 'IPO pipeline', 'recent years', 'total value', 'siren calls', 'larger part', 'official statements', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'US indices', 'US states', 'US dollars', 'primary listings', 'Finance officials', 'food group', 'Irish-listed company', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Kerry Group', 'trading revenues', 'US moves', 'funds listings', 'CRH proposals', 'owner', 'Minister', 'Flutter', 'Photograph', 'Department', 'questions', 'future', 'Ireland', 'departure', 'attractiveness', 'shares', 'loss', 'commissions', 'Kingspan', 'Freedom', 'READ', 'headquarters', 'Amsterdam', 'issues', 'September', 'inclusion', 'three-quarters', 'profit', 'advantage', 'canary', 'shortage', 'IPOs', 'lack', 'comparison', 'London', 'phase', 'paper', 'liquidity', 'impact', 'doors', 'strategy', 'comment', 'plans', 'challenges', 'UK', 'debt', 'Ryanair', 'interest']",2023-08-04,2023-08-05,irishtimes.com

Six years on  the focus has shifted to the departure from the Dublin market of cement giant CRH and anxiety that it will soon be followed by gambling group Flutter.CRH set out plans in March to shift its primary listing to the New York stock exchange  setting off handwringing in London because the move will mean it leaves the blue-chip FTSE100 index. Although the company will maintain a secondary London listing  that is not a good look for a market that presents itself as a global leader.But the implications for the Irish market from CRH’s move could be even greater. The company will delist entirely from Dublin next month  ending a decades-long association with an exchange whose roots go back to the 1790s. With Paddy Power-owner Flutter also seeking a US listing  there are concerns that it too will go the way of CRH. The two companies comprise some 38 per cent of the annual turnover of shares in Dublin.Accenture job cuts: Staff ‘distraught and devastated’ after announcement Listen | 44:44It would be bad enough to lose only one  worse still to lose two — and there are concerns that yet more will take their lead. Although Ireland’s success at winning huge volumes of foreign direct investment has made it one of the fastest-growing European economies  the challenges facing the equity side of the Dublin stock market seem like something from a different world.READ MOREEuronext Dublin chief Daryl Byrne wrote in March to Minister for Finance Michael McGrath  saying other Irish-listed companies with significant US operations may follow in the footsteps of CRH and Flutter.Warning of a potential loss to the exchequer of up to €300 million in tax revenue  Byrne says the delisting of the two companies or a shift towards US trading activity “is likely to have serious stamp duty implications in terms of the collectability and the amount of revenue generated for the State”.Now  additional information has come to light about the response within the Department of Finance  where officials note potentially existential questions being raised down the line.Given CRH and Flutter’s share of the trading volume on the exchange  the delisting of these companies will create difficulties for the public equities ecosystem in Ireland  resulting in a loss of revenues and commission — Department of Finance officials“An assessment of the impact on the exchequer and the economy from the loss of a functioning stock exchange for Irish listed companies [the exchange is still home to large trading volumes for funds and debt securities]  both in the near and longer-term (five to 10 years) could be considered ” states a briefing note for the Minister from finance officials.While that is cast as a question for later discussions  officials accept the potential departure of two significant companies “could harm Ireland’s attractiveness” for international equity investors. “Given CRH and Flutter’s share of the trading volume on the exchange  the delisting of these companies will create difficulties for the public equities ecosystem in Ireland  resulting in a loss of revenues and commission ” the note says.Euronext Dublin chief executive Daryl Byrne has written to Minister for Finance Michael McGrath noting the potential for further stock market defections. Photograph: Dara MacDónaill/The Irish Times“The industry that supports capital markets activity in Ireland has already contracted materially  as evidenced by the reduction in the number of stockbrokers to essentially two over the last decade.”Although Euronext has always said the larger part of its Dublin business is in the lucrative listing of debt and funds  the finance note sets out a stark assessment of the challenges facing the equity side of the business after the CRH defection.For one thing  finance officials say nutrition company Glanbia  insulation maker Kingspan and food group Kerry could be prompted to follow CRH with a US listing. Kerry Group had no comment on a possible US listing. Glanbia and Kingspan said they had no such plans.The companies in question say they have no such plans. Still  officials point to the allure of US growth prospects and “siren calls” about liquidity and valuations. “[It] is certain that other larger companies are watching the CRH proposals with interest.”In Ireland  the pipeline of IPOs and the current attrition of listings  point towards a long but steady decline of preference for the Irish exchange as a listing destination of choice — Department of Finance officialsThe lack of new companies joining the market only compounds the strain. With few flotations in prospect  as companies pursue alternatives to initial public offerings (IPOs)  the picture cast by finance officials is one of stagnation and structural challenge.“In Ireland  the pipeline of IPOs and the current attrition of listings  point towards a long but steady decline of preference for the Irish exchange as a listing destination of choice ” they say.The paper points to three “interconnected but detrimental developments” in the past 15–20 years that combine to make Irish IPOs less appealing.First was a reduced exposure by Irish pension funds to equities and diversification by such pension funds from Irish equities.Second was a reduced number of local stockbrokers competing for IPO candidates and less “sell-side” research coverage.Third was a “buy-side” shift from active stock picking to passive investment through exchange-traded funds.“Despite an anecdotal increase in the IPO pipeline in late 2022 only three companies — Uniphar  Corre Energy and HealthBeacon — have floated in Dublin in the past four years ” the paper says.For its part  Euronext Dublin accepts the Irish market has seen more departures than joiners over the past five yearsWorse still  the official notes that HealthBeacon is the only one of 44 companies to have gone public since 2015 through the exchange’s “IPO Ready” programme. The officials suggest a review of that programme “could yield information” on the low conversation rate.For its part  Euronext Dublin accepts the Irish market has seen more departures than joiners over the past five years.“Along with equity capital market participants  we are working on a number of initiatives to reverse this situation and incentivise more IPOs on our markets  some of which will require Government support.”Such challenges are not unique to Ireland.

Mr Opitz thus slightly increases his shareholding and holds around 8% in Pyrum including attributable shares. Pascal Klein continues to hold around 10% of the company. The transaction was executed as an OTC transaction at a purchase price of EUR 50.00 per share and thus around 3.7% above the average value of the last five trading days prior to the closing on Xetra (EUR 48.23). The relevant notifications of Pyrum Innovations AG on directors' dealings pursuant to Art. 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation are available on the company's website at https://www.pyrum.net/investoren/finanzmitteilungen/.Pascal Klein: ""I still remain the largest individual shareholder of Pyrum. However  a larger tax payment due to the IPO has led me to sell a small part of my shareholding in the company. My shares are in very good hands with Jürgen Opitz. Through the OTC transaction  we wanted to prevent a possible influence on the share price due to the tightness of the market for Pyrum shares.""Pyrum Innovations AG  a pioneer in the sustainable recycling of end-of-life tyres (ELTs) based on its patented pyrolysis technology  has been listed on the Euronext Growth market segment of the Oslo Stock Exchange since 30 September 2021 and on the Scale market segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since 30 March 2022. In addition to the founding partners Pascal Klein and Michael Kapf  the chemical group and cooperation partner BASF is also among the major shareholders with a current share of 7.9%. The tyre manufacturer Continental  among others  also participated in the IPO.About Pyrum Innovations AGPyrum Innovations AG is active in the attractive recycling market for end-of-life tyres with its patented pyrolysis technology. Pyrum's pyrolysis process is energy self-sufficient and  according to the Fraunhofer Institute  saves significantly more CO 2 emissions than today's standard recycling processes for end-of-life tyres - especially compared to incineration in cement plants - and produces new raw materials such as pyrolysis oil  gas and recovered carbon black from the waste used as input materials. In this way  Pyrum closes the recyclable material loop and pursues a completely sustainable business model. As a pioneer  Pyrum Innovations AG was the first company in the end-of-life tyre recycling sector to receive REACH registration from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the pyrolysis oil it produces. This means that the oil is recognised as an official raw material that can be used in production processes. In addition  Pyrum has received ISCC PLUS certification for the pyrolysis oil and the recovered carbon black. Both products are thus considered sustainable and renewable raw materials. In addition  Pyrum has received ISO 14001 certification for its environmental management system and ISO 9001 certification for its quality management system. These achievements have also been recognised by international experts in the tyre industry. For example  Pyrum won the Best Tyre Recycling Innovation category at the inaugural Recircle Awards and has been nominated for the “Grand Prix Mittelstand” (“Großer Preis des Mittelstandes”) from the German state of Saarland.www.pyrum.netContactIR.on AGFrederic HilkePhone: +49 221 9140 970Email: pyrum@ir-on.comPyrum Innovations AGDieselstr. 866763 Dillingen / SaarEmail: presse@pyrum.net",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,positive,0.77,0.21,0.02,True,English,"['Pyrum Innovations AG', 'Supervisory Board member', 'Executive Board OTC', 'shares', 'Supervisory Board member Jürgen Opitz', 'Best Tyre Recycling Innovation category', 'life tyre recycling sector', 'Euronext Growth market segment', 'Pyrum Innovations AG Dieselstr.', 'Scale market segment', 'attractive recycling market', 'Executive Board OTC', 'IR.on AG', 'largest individual shareholder', 'last five trading', 'larger tax payment', 'Oslo Stock Exchange', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'recyclable material loop', 'European Chemicals Agency', 'environmental management system', 'quality management system', 'inaugural Recircle Awards', 'Grand Prix Mittelstand', 'Großer Preis', 'standard recycling processes', 'Market Abuse Regulation', 'official raw material', 'sustainable business model', 'ISCC PLUS certification', 'new raw materials', 'sustainable recycling', 'Mr Opitz', 'life tyres', 'production processes', 'input materials', 'ISO 14001 certification', 'ISO 9001 certification', 'OTC transaction', 'Key word', 'Pascal Klein', 'purchase price', 'average value', 'relevant notifications', 'pyrum.net', 'small part', 'good hands', 'possible influence', 'pyrolysis technology', 'founding partners', 'Michael Kapf', 'chemical group', 'cooperation partner', 'major shareholders', 'pyrolysis process', 'Fraunhofer Institute', 'CO 2 emissions', 'cement plants', 'carbon black', 'REACH registration', 'international experts', 'German state', 'Frederic Hilke', 'pyrolysis oil', 'share price', 'current share', '4,000 Pyrum shares', 'attributable shares', 'first company', 'EQS-News', 'Miscellaneous', 'CEST', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'Dillingen', 'Saar', 'CEO', 'ISIN', 'total', 'holding', 'counter', '31 July', 'closing', 'Xetra', 'directors', 'dealings', 'Art.', 'website', 'investoren', 'finanzmitteilungen', 'IPO', 'tightness', 'pioneer', 'end', 'ELTs', '30 September', '30 March', 'addition', 'BASF', 'manufacturer', 'Continental', 'others', 'incineration', 'gas', 'waste', 'way', 'ECHA', 'products', 'achievements', 'industry', 'example', 'Mittelstandes', 'Contact', 'Phone', 'Email', 'presse']",2023-08-04,2023-08-05,marketscreener.com

ON THE CROSS-BORDERCONVERSION OF BREMBO S.P.A. FROM ITALY TO THE NETHERLANDS INFORMATION REGARDING THE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL This is to announce that on 4 August 2023 (""Date of Registration"") the minutes of the extraordinary shareholders' meeting of Brembo S.p.A. (""Brembo"" or the ""Company"")  held on 27 July 2023 in a single call (the ""Shareholders' Meeting"")  were filed with the Company Register of Bergamo. In its extraordinary session  the Shareholders' Meeting approved  the cross-border conversion of Brembo S.p.A. from Italy to the Netherlands  and the related relevant and ensuing resolutions (the ""Cross-BorderConversion""). SHAREHOLDERS ENTITLED TO EXERCISE THE RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL The shareholders of Brembo who did not contribute to passing the resolution concerning the Cross-Border Conversion  i.e.  shareholders who were absent  abstained or voted against  are entitled to exercise the right of withdrawal pursuant to Article 2437  paragraph 1  of the Italian Civil Code (the ""Right of Withdrawal""). The Right of Withdrawal applies to all  or part of  Brembo shares (the ""Shares"") owned by the Company's shareholders entitled to exercise the Right of Withdrawal. LIQUIDATION VALUE The liquidation value of the Shares for which the Right of Withdrawal may be exercised amounts to € 13.096 per Share (the ""Liquidation Value""). Pursuant to Article 2437-ter  paragraph 3  of the Italian Civil Code  the Liquidation Value was calculated by the Board of Directors in reference to the arithmetic average of the closing prices of the Shares on the regulated market Euronext Milan  organised and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A.  in the six months prior to the date of publication of the Notice of Calling of the General Shareholders' Meeting  i.e. prior to 20 June 2023. PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL In compliance with the provisions of Article 127-bis  paragraph 2  of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 58 of 24 February 1998 (""ICLF"")  all shareholders on whose behalf Shares were registered after the date indicated in Article 83-sexies  paragraph 2  of ICLF to grant entitlement to attend the Shareholders' Meeting (i.e.  after the record date on 18 July 2023)  but prior to opening of the said Shareholders' Meeting  shall be considered as falling within the shareholders who did not contribute to passing the resolution concerning the Cross-Border Conversion and  therefore  shall be entitled to exercise the Right of Withdrawal.Entitled shareholders shall exercise the Right of Withdrawal within 15 days of the Date of Registration  i.e.  within 19 August 2023 (included)  by sending to Brembo a declaration for exercising the Right of Withdrawal (the ""Declaration"") by means of (i) registered letter with return receipt to Brembo S.p.A. c/o Computershare S.p.A. - Via Lorenzo Mascheroni 19  20145 Milan  Italy  or (ii) certifiede-mail(PEC) from the entitled shareholders' certified e-mail account to the certified e-mail address operations@pecserviziotitoli.it. The Declaration may be prepared using the form available on the Company's website at www.brembo.com  Investors - For shareholders - Registered Office Relocation. The Declaration shall include the information pursuant to Article 2437-bis  paragraph 1  of the Italian Civil Code  namely: (i) personal details  tax code  domicile and telephone contact number of the withdrawing shareholder for communications concerning the Right of Withdrawal; (ii) the number of Shares for which the Right of Withdrawal is being exercised; (iii) details of the depositary intermediary with whom the shares for which the shareholder exercises the Right of Withdrawal are registered (the ""Intermediary""). Shareholders who intend to exercise the Right of Withdrawal are also required to request the Intermediary  upon sending their Declaration to Brembo  that it issues a communication pursuant to Article 43  paragraph 1  of the post-trading consolidated decree of CONSOB and Banca d'Italia of 13 August 2018  as subsequently amended (the ""Consolidated Decree"") attesting to: (i) the uninterrupted ownership  by the withdrawing shareholder  of the Shares for which the Right of Withdrawal is being exercised before the opening of the Shareholders' Meeting and until the date of issuing of the Intermediary's Communication; and (ii) the absence of any pledges or any other restrictions in favour to the third parties over the Shares for which the Right of Withdrawal is being exercised (the ""Intermediary's Communication""). In the event that there should be a pledge or other restrictions over the Shares for which the Right of Withdrawal is being exercised  the withdrawing shareholder will also need to send  together with the Declaration  an attestation made by the pledgee (or the subject in whose favour any other such restriction exists over the Shares)  whereby said subject irrevocably and unconditionally consents to revoke the pledge/restriction regarding the Shares and consents to their liquidation  in compliance with the instructions given by the shareholder who exercises the Right of Withdrawal. It is the responsibility of shareholders who exercise the Right of Withdrawal to: (i) ensure that the information contained in the Declaration is complete and accurate; and (ii) send the Declaration to Brembo within and no later than the aforementioned term of 15 days  i.e.  19 August 2023 (included)  in which regard Brembo disclaims all liability. Declarations that are sent after the aforementioned term  or that do not comply with the above-mentioned methods  or that do not include the necessary information or are not timely supplemented by the related Intermediary's Communication will be disregarded and  therefore  the Right of Withdrawal will not be deemed to have been validly exercised.It bears recalling that  pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article 2437-bis  paragraph 2  of the Italian Civil Code and Article 43  paragraph 2  of Consolidated Decree  the Shares for which the Right of Withdrawal has been exercised shall be made unavailable by the Intermediary issuing the Intermediary's Communication until the completion of the liquidation procedure. Finally  it should also be noted that the legal effects of the exercise of the Right of Withdrawal by the eligible shareholders who have validly exercised it will be subject to the completion of the Cross-Border Conversion  which  in turn  is subject to the fulfilment (or waiver  as the case may be) of certain conditions precedent set forth in the resolution adopted by the Shareholders' Meeting (including  inter alia  that the amount of any disbursement to be paid by the Company: (a) to the shareholders who have exercised the Right of Withdrawal; and/or (b) to Brembo's creditors prior to the registration of the resolution of the Shareholders' Meeting  who have objected  does not exceed in the aggregate the amount of € 200 000 000 (two hundred million)) (the ""Conditions""). LIQUIDATION OF THE SHARES FOR WHICH THE RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL HAS BEEN EXERCISED In the event that one or more shareholders of Brembo exercise the Right of Withdrawal  the liquidation procedure shall be performed in compliance with the provisions of Article 2437-quater of the Italian Civil Code. In detail  and without prejudice to the fact that further information will be made available in the terms and manners provided for by applicable laws and regulations in force from time to time: firstly  the Shares for which the Right of Withdrawal has been exercised will be offered up in option to the other shareholders of Brembo proportionally to the Shares owned by each of them (the "" Option Right Offer "").

In the event that there should be a pledge or other restrictions over the Shares for which the Right of Withdrawal is being exercised  the withdrawing shareholder will also need to send  together with the Declaration  an attestation made by the pledgee (or the subject in whose favour any other such restriction exists over the Shares)  whereby said subject irrevocably and unconditionally consents to revoke the pledge/restriction regarding the Shares and consents to their liquidation  in compliance with the instructions given by the shareholder who exercises the Right of Withdrawal.

Declarations that are sent after the aforementioned term  or that do not comply with the above-mentioned methods  or that do not include the necessary information or are not timely supplemented by the related Intermediary's Communication will be disregarded and  therefore  the Right of Withdrawal will not be deemed to have been validly exercised.It bears recalling that  pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article 2437-bis  paragraph 2  of the Italian Civil Code and Article 43  paragraph 2  of Consolidated Decree  the Shares for which the Right of Withdrawal has been exercised shall be made unavailable by the Intermediary issuing the Intermediary's Communication until the completion of the liquidation procedure. Finally  it should also be noted that the legal effects of the exercise of the Right of Withdrawal by the eligible shareholders who have validly exercised it will be subject to the completion of the Cross-Border Conversion  which  in turn  is subject to the fulfilment (or waiver  as the case may be) of certain conditions precedent set forth in the resolution adopted by the Shareholders' Meeting (including  inter alia  that the amount of any disbursement to be paid by the Company: (a) to the shareholders who have exercised the Right of Withdrawal; and/or (b) to Brembo's creditors prior to the registration of the resolution of the Shareholders' Meeting  who have objected  does not exceed in the aggregate the amount of € 200 000 000 (two hundred million)) (the ""Conditions"").

The expanding toolkit of tradeable products at Cboe allows customers to choose the right product  size and time to effectively navigate market environments.

Our adjusted operating expense guidance2 range for 2023 moves lower to $766 to $774 million from $769 to $779 million.

(2)Specific quantifications of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the company's organic growth guidance  adjusted operating expenses guidance and the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings guidance are not available. The company believes that there is uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to certain of its GAAP measures  primarily related to acquisition-related revenues and expenses that would be required to reconcile to GAAP revenues less cost of revenues  GAAP operating expenses and GAAP effective tax rate  which preclude the company from providing accurate guidance on certain forward-looking GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.

Capital expenditures for 2023 are now expected to be in the range of $48 to $54 million   down from the previous guidance of $60 to $66 million .(1)Specific quantifications of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the company's organic and inorganic growth guidance  adjusted operating expenses guidance and the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings guidance are not available. Acquisitions are considered organic after 12 months of closing. The company believes that there is uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to certain of its GAAP measures  primarily related to acquisition-related revenues and expenses that would be required to reconcile to GAAP revenues less cost of revenues  GAAP operating expenses and GAAP effective tax rate  which preclude the company from providing accurate guidance on certain forward-looking GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. The company believes that providing estimates of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the range of the company's organic growth  adjusted operating expenses and the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors for the reasons identified above.Capital ManagementAt June 30  2023  the company had adjusted cash2 of $403.0 million.

These measures are not in accordance with  or a substitute for  GAAP  and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP measures provided in this press release include net transaction and clearing fees  adjusted operating expenses  adjusted operating income  organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  net revenues on a constant currency basis  and adjusted operating margin  adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share  effective tax rate on adjusted earnings  net revenues on a constant currency basis  adjusted cash  EBITDA  EBITDA margin  adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.Organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  organic non-transaction revenue and organic net revenue guidance: These are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for the impact of our acquisitions for the period or guidance  as applicable. Management believes the organic net revenue growth and guidance measures provide users with supplemental information regarding the company's ongoing and future potential revenue performances and trends by presenting revenue growth and guidance excluding the impact of the acquisitions. Revenues from acquisitions that have been owned for at least one year are considered organic and are no longer excluded from organic net revenue from either period for comparative purposes.Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. As such  if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures  it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses  the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of the company. Therefore  we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide investors with an additional basis for comparison across accounting periods.Acquisition-related expenses: From time to time  we have pursued acquisitions  which have resulted in expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred in the normal course of the company's business operations. These expenses include integration costs  as well as legal  due diligence  impairment charges  and other third-party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size  timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly  we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide an additional analysis of Cboe's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Cboe's performance between periods.The tables below show the reconciliation of each financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of those items detailed below and are referred to as adjusted financial measures.Organic Net Revenue ReconciliationTable 3Three Months EndedSix Months Ended(in millions)June 30 June 30 Reconciliation of Revenues Less Cost of Revenues to Organic Net Revenue2023202220232022Revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue)$ 467.1$ 424.1$ 938.5$ 842.2Less acquisitions:Acquisition revenues less cost of revenues (inorganic net revenue)$ (3.2)$ —$ (7.6)$ —Organic net revenue$ 463.9$ 424.1$ 930.9$ 842.2Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP InformationThree Months EndedSix Months EndedTable 4June 30 June 30 (in millions  except per share amounts)2023202220232022Reconciliation of Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to Non-GAAP (As shown on Table 1)Net income (loss) allocated to common stockholders$ 167.0$ (184.5)$ 339.6$ (74.9)Non-GAAP adjustmentsAcquisition-related expenses (1)0.714.37.116.3Investment establishment costs (2)———3.0Gain on investment (3)—(7.5)—(7.5)Loan forgiveness (4)—(1.3)—(1.3)Amortization of acquired intangible assets (5)29.330.160.260.7Goodwill impairment (6)—460.1—460.1Impairment of investment (7)—10.6—10.6Income from investment (8)(2.1)—(2.1)—Total Non-GAAP adjustments27.9506.365.2541.9Income tax expense related to the items above(6.8)(143.2)(16.3)(151.9)Tax reserves (9)0.7—2.248.5Net income allocated to participating securities - effect on reconciling items(0.1)(1.3)(0.3)(1.6)Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders$ 188.7$ 177.3$ 390.4$ 362.0Reconciliation of Diluted EPS to Non-GAAPDiluted earnings (loss) per common share$ 1.57$ (1.74)$ 3.20$ (0.70)Per share impact of non-GAAP adjustments noted above0.213.410.484.10Adjusted diluted earnings per common share$ 1.78$ 1.67$ 3.68$ 3.40Reconciliation of Operating Margin to Non-GAAPRevenue less cost of revenue$ 467.1$ 424.1$ 938.5$ 842.2Non-GAAP adjustments noted above————Adjusted revenue less cost of revenue$ 467.1$ 424.1$ 938.5$ 842.2Operating expenses (10)$ 222.3$ 661.5$ 445.8$ 839.9Non-GAAP adjustments noted above30.0504.567.3537.1Adjusted operating expenses$ 192.3$ 157.0$ 378.5$ 302.8Operating income (loss)$ 244.8$ (237.4)$ 492.7$ 2.3Non-GAAP adjustments noted above30.0504.567.3537.1Adjusted operating income$ 274.8$ 267.1$ 560.0$ 539.4Adjusted operating margin (11)58.8 %63.0 %59.7 %64.0 %Reconciliation of Income Tax Rate to Non-GAAPIncome (loss) before income taxes241.8(256.8)490.0(31.9)Non-GAAP adjustments noted above27.9506.365.2541.9Adjusted income before income taxes$ 269.7$ 249.5$ 555.2$ 510.0Income tax provision (benefit)74.0(72.3)148.843.0Non-GAAP adjustments noted above6.1143.214.1103.4Adjusted income tax expense$ 80.1$ 70.9$ 162.9$ 146.4Adjusted income tax rate29.7 %28.4 %29.3 %28.7 %(1) This amount includes ongoing acquisition related costs primarily from the Company's Cboe Digital and Cboe Canada acquisitions.

The deferred compensation plans' expenses are not excluded from ""adjusted operating expenses"" and do not have an impact on ""Income before income taxes."" (11) Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating income divided by adjusted revenue less cost of revenue.EBITDA ReconciliationsEBITDA (earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used non-GAAP financial measures of operating performance. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue). It is presented as supplemental information that the company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the company's core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to EBITDA acquisition-related expenses  gain on investment  loan forgiveness  investment establishment costs  goodwill impairment  impairment of investment  and income from investment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes either for net income  as an indicator of the company's operating performance  or for cash flow  as a measure of the company's liquidity. In addition  because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies  the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.Table 5Three Months EndedSix Months Ended(in millions  except percentages)June 30 June 30 Reconciliation of Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to EBITDA and AdjustedEBITDA (Per Table 1)2023202220232022Net income (loss) allocated to common stockholders$ 167.0$ (184.5)$ 339.6$ (74.9)Interest expense  net13.914.629.025.4Income tax provision (benefit)74.0(72.3)148.843.0Depreciation and amortization39.840.281.281.1EBITDA$ 294.7$ (202.0)$ 598.6$ 74.6EBITDA Margin63.1 %(47.6) %63.8 %8.9 %Non-GAAP adjustments not included in above line itemsAcquisition-related expenses0.714.37.116.3Gain on investment—(7.5)—(7.5)Loan forgiveness—(1.3)—(1.3)Investment establishment costs———3.0Goodwill impairment—460.1—460.1Impairment of investment—10.6—10.6Income from investment(2.1)—(2.1)—Adjusted EBITDA$ 293.3$ 274.2$ 603.6$ 555.8Adjusted EBITDA Margin62.8 %64.7 %64.3 %66.0 %Table 6(in millions)June 30 December 31 Reconciliation of Cash and Cash Equivalents to Adjusted Cash20232022Cash and cash equivalents$ 413.6$ 432.7Financial investments103.791.7Less deferred compensation plan assets(32.7)(27.5)Less cash collected for Section 31 Fees(81.6)(93.7)Adjusted Cash$ 403.0$ 403.2Table 7(in millions)Reconciliation of Net Transaction and Clearing Fees by Business Segment –Three Months Ended June 30  2023 and 2022ConsolidatedOptionsN.A.

Click here for a full analysis.,fcafotodigital/E+ via Getty ImagesIntroductionBack in April  I wrote a follow-up article on Acomo (OTCPK:ACNFF)  a Netherlands-based company focusing on the sourcing  trading  processing  and distribution of food products. Pretty much a 'modern' version of the East India Company. I argued the cash flows were strong but it was taking the company more time to digest a large acquisition. But as shareholders were treated to a generous dividend  I thought it was a fair compensation to wait. Acomo has now released its H1 2023 results and I was hoping to see an acceleration of the free cash flow result despite the increasing interest rates on the financial markets.Yahoo FinanceAcomo's main listing is on Euronext Amsterdam  where it is trading with ACOMO as its ticker symbol. The average daily volume in Amsterdam is approximately 12 000 shares per day for a monetary value of about 250 000 EUR per day  and that makes the Dutch listing clearly superior in terms of volume. The company ended 2022 with 29.6M shares outstanding. This results in a market capitalization of almost 610M EUR based on the current share price of approximately 20.5 EUR per share (which is about 7% lower than when my previous article was published.This article is meant as an update on two previously published articles  which you can read here and here. Those articles also provide background information on the company and its recent large acquisition  which caused the net debt to increase.Cash flow remains importantIt wasn't an easy semester for Acomo and the company highlighted the 'varying market conditions' it experienced. The company put in a strong performance in the spices and nuts  seeds and food solution divisions but was hurting in the organic ingredients segment. Acomo pointed to a global destocking phase to justify the weak performance of the organic division. Additionally  the company was hurt by the cocoa market 'due to a mismatch between physical sales and the futures position' and has now taken the appropriate steps to tighten up the correlation between contracts and sales.Acomo Investor RelationsAs you can see above  Acomo reported a 20% reduction in the EBITDA but fortunately the adjusted EBITDA was higher  resulting a 10% hit to the adjusted EBITDA which came in just below 50M EUR. This obviously didn't mean the first semester was a total disaster. As you can see below  the company's operating income of 36.4M EUR was still hit by the higher interest expenses  but all things considered  the net income of 22.2M EUR (representing an EPS of 0.75 EUR) was very reasonable. Especially taking into account some of the non-recurring elements which had a negative impact of approximately 10-15% on the EPS which would otherwise have come in closer to 0.85 EUR per share.Acomo Investor RelationsSure  that net income is lower than in the first half of 2022  and I do blame the higher interest expenses for that. Acomo's large acquisition was likely a good move  but it remains important to reduce the gross debt as fast as possible as the average cost of debt in the first semester came in at close to 6%.That's also why I'm keeping close tabs on Acomo's working capital generation. The company reported a total operating cash flow of 54.2M EUR but this includes a 22.5M EUR contribution from the working capital releases. We should however still deduct the 2.3M EUR in lease payments.Acomo Investor RelationsThis means the adjusted operating cash flow was approximately 29.4M EUR and after deducting the 3.5M EUR in capex  the underlying free cash flow result was almost 26M EUR or about 87 cents per share. That's important because 1) it confirms the sustaining capex is lower than the depreciation and amortization expenses and 2) it definitely improves Acomo's balance sheet.As of the end of June  Acomo had about 2M EUR in cash and about 260M EUR in gross debt for a net debt level of 258M EUR. Based on the H1 adjusted EBITDA and excluding the lease payments (and lease liabilities)  this represents a multiple of approximately 2.75 times the adjusted EBITDA.The balance sheet does not worry me. Acomo traditionally has a high inventory level (which currently stands at 328M EUR) and the total net working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) is 275M EUR.Acomo Investor Relations Acomo Investor RelationsIn fact  as you can see above  the total amount of current assets exceeds the total amount of liabilities (including financial debt and lease liabilities)  so I'm not worried at all.An interim dividend was declaredAcomo has declared an interim dividend of 0.40 EUR per share  this will cost the company just under 12M EUR and after making a 23M EUR dividend payment in the first half of the year  it is clear the dividend remains very well covered.While that's great news  I would like to see a better focus on debt reduction though as that will provide an additional boost to the free cash flow result. For every 10M EUR in debt it repays  the free cash flow result will increase by almost 2 cents per share per year. So it's definitely worth pursuing.In any case  I think Acomo will be able to keep the dividend stable at 1.20 EUR per share which would result in a dividend yield of almost 6%. That being said  and as mentioned above  I wouldn't mind a lower dividend on the condition the retained cash will be used to reduce the total debt.Investment thesisI still have no position in Acomo  but I am getting increasingly interested in the stock as Acomo is currently trading at a 8-9% free cash flow yield despite the sharp increase in the interest expenses. Additionally  I think the full-year dividend will continue to exceed 1 EUR per share and if Acomo would keep it unchanged compared to last year  the 1.20 EUR annual dividend would represent a dividend yield of almost 6% (subject to the 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax).And while the high gross debt and net debt level appears frightening  let's not forget Acomo has in excess of 300M EUR in inventory and its current assets are higher than the total (current + non-current) liabilities combined. This makes Acomo very attractive in my books.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
