(the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS- NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies ,"Cellectis Inc.NEW YORK  Aug. 07  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cellectis S.A. (the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS- NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies  announced today the release of the full report of the financial results for the second quarter 2023 (ended June 30  2023) and filing of the corresponding 6-K with the SEC.Financial ResultsThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis  have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”).We present certain financial metrics broken out between our two reportable segments – Therapeutics and Plants – in the appendices of this Q2 2023 financial results press release.On January 13  2023  Calyxt  Cibus Global LLC (Cibus) and certain other parties named therein  entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”)  pursuant to which  subject to the terms and conditions thereof  Calyxt and Cibus will merge in an all-stock transaction (the “Calyxt Merger”). As a consequence of the foregoing  Calyxt met the “held-for-sale” criteria specified in IFRS 5 and was classified as a discontinued operation until May 31  2023.On June 1  2023  Calyxt and Cibus closed the merger transaction and now operate under the name Cibus  Inc. Consequently  Calyxt was deconsolidated and Calyxt's cash  cash equivalent and restricted cash are no longer included in the Group's cash  cash equivalent and restricted cash since June 1  2023.Cash: As of June 30  2023  Cellectis  had $89 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash. This compares to $95 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31  2022. This $6 million difference mainly reflects $55 million of cash out  which include $15 million for R&D suppliers  $7 million for SG&A suppliers  $23 million for staff costs  $7 million for rents and taxes  $3 millions of reimbursement of the “PGE” loan  and a $1 million unfavorable impact on Forex partially offset by a $23 million net cash inflow from the capital raise closed in February  a $21 million net cash inflow from EIB loan  a $1 million cash inflow related to the grant and refundable advance from BPI  $2 millions of financial investments’ capital gain and interests  a $1 million reimbursement of social charges paid on stock options  and a $2 million net cash inflow from licenses and other cash receipts.Story continuesBased on the current operating plan  Cellectis anticipates that the cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash as of June 30  2023 will fund Cellectis’ operations into the third quarter of 2024.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $5.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2023 compared to $6.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The decrease of $1.0 million reflects the recognition of two milestones related to Cellectis’ agreement with Cytovia for $1.5 million in 2022 and a milestone of $1.0 million with another partner while recognition of revenues in 2023 is not material  and partially offset by the increase of the research tax credit for $0.8 million and the partial recognition of a grant signed with “BPI” of $0.8 million.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $43.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $52.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $9.0 million decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a $3.4 million decrease in personal expenses due to departures not replaced (ii) a $4.7 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $28.0 million in 2022 to $23.2 million in 2023) mainly explained by internalization of our manufacturing and quality activities to support our R&D pipeline and (iii) a $0.8 million decrease of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses (from $3.1 million to $2.3 million).SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $8.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $10.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $2.0 million decrease primarily reflects (i) a $1.6 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $6.4 million in 2022 to $4.9 million in 2023) mainly explained by the implementation of our ERP in 2022 (ii) a $0.2 million decrease in personal expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.Net financial gain (loss): Consolidated net financial gain was $11.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $9.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $2.4 million increase primarily reflects (i) a $20.8 million increase of financial income  mainly attributable to the profit from Calyxt’s deconsolidation  partially offset by (ii) the loss in fair value on our retained investment in Calyxt since deconsolidation for $10.2 million  (iii) a $6.8 million decrease in the fair value of Cytovia’s note receivable.Net income (loss) from discontinued operations: Pursuant to Calyxt deconsolidation income from discontinued operation for the six-month period ended June 30  2023  2023 only include five months of activity. The $3.5 million increase of net loss from discontinued operations between the six-month period ended June 30  2022 and 2023 is primarily driven by (i) the increase of $9.2 million of net financial loss and (ii) the increase of $1.5 million of other operating expenses partially offset by (i) the decrease of $2.8 million of R&D expenses (from $6.3 million in 2022 to $3.5 in 2023) and (ii) the decrease of $4.5 million of SG&A expenses (from $6.8 million in 2022 to $2.3 million in 2023).Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $40.7 million (or $0.76 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2023  of which $35.7 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations  compared to $50.9 million (or $1.12 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2022  of which $47.3 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations. This $10.1 million decrease in net loss between the first six months of 2023 and 2022 was primarily driven by (i) a $9.0 million decrease of R&D expenses  (ii) a $2.0 million decrease of SG&A expenses and (iii) an increase of $2.4 million of the financial gain due to the deconsolidation of Calyxt compensated in part by the decrease of fair value of Cytovia’s note receivable. These downward impacts on the net loss were partially offset by (i) a decrease of $1.0 million of revenues and other income  (ii) an increase of $1.5 million of loss from discontinued operations attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $36.7 million (or $0.68 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to a net loss of $45.5 million (or $1.00 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2022.Please see ""Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis for 2023 in the following areas:Supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART123  UCART22  UCART 20x22 and potential new product candidates;Operating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France)  and Raleigh (North Carolina  USA); andContinuing to strengthen our manufacturing and clinical departments.CELLECTIS S.A.STATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION (unaudited)($ in thousands) As of December 31  2022 June 30  2023 ASSETS Non-current assets Intangible assets 718 695 Property  plant  and equipment 63 621 59 231 Right-of-use assets 44 275 41 457 Non-current financial assets 8 791 13 006 Total non-current assets 117 406 114 389 Current assets Trade receivables 772 422 Subsidies receivables 14 496 19 488 Other current assets 9 078 7 869 Cash and cash equivalent and Current financial assets 97 697 85 505 Total current assets 122 043 113 285 Total assets held for sale 21 768 0 TOTAL ASSETS 261 216 227 674 LIABILITIES Shareholders’ equity Share capital 2 955 3 491 Premiums related to the share capital 583 122 476 224 Currency translation adjustment (28 605 ) (37 050 ) Retained earnings (333 365 ) (305 392 ) Net income (loss) (106 139 ) (40 715 ) Total shareholders’ equity -

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock-based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOMEFor the three-month period ended June 30  2023(unaudited) - ($ in thousands except per share data) For the three-month period ended June 30  2022 * 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (18 946 ) (10 648 ) Adjustment: Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 2 684 2 074 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (16 263 ) (8 574 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.36 ) (0.15 ) Basic adjusted earnings from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($ /share) 0.00 (0.05 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 45 497 127 55 583 768 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1) (0.36 ) (0.15 ) Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) from discontinued operations 0.02 (0.04 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 45 497 127 55 583 768*These amounts reflect adjustments made in connection with the presentation of the discontinued operationRECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME (unaudited)First six months($ in thousands  except per share data) For the six-month period ended June 30  2022 * 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (50 858 ) (40 715 ) Adjustment: Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 5 331 4 053 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (45 527 ) (36 662 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1.00 ) (0.68 ) Basic adjusted earnings from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($ /share) (0.95 ) (0.71 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 45 497 127 53 541 010 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1.00 ) (0.68 ) Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) from discontinued operations (0.95 ) (0.71 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 45 497 127 53 541 010*These amounts reflect adjustments made in connection with the presentation of the discontinued operationAbout CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

In this article  I explore two global financial services organisations owned by the Polen Capital Small and Mid Cap Fund – Euronext and TMX Group.,Euronext and TMX Group: Two exchanges enjoying monopolistic connotationsOur global investment partner  Polen Capital  seeks to invest in high-quality companies that have strong growth potential and competitive advantages. In this article  I explore two global financial services organisations owned by the Polen Capital Small and Mid Cap Fund – Euronext and TMX Group.EuronextEuronext was originally formed in 2000 from the merger of the Amsterdam  Brussels and Paris stock exchanges. It has expanded to include Portugal  Ireland  Italy and Norway  covering 7 European capital markets  offering a diverse portfolio of stocks  exchange traded funds  bonds  commodities  foreign exchange and derivatives  as well as clearing  custody  data  index  and other investor services.The revenue of most exchanges comes from three major sources – the annual cost of listings  live data feed  and stock exchange announcements. There are 2 000 listed companies with a combined €6.8 trillion market capitalisation as well as 900 indices of all sizes and profiles  and 15 000 ETFs  funds  warrants  certificates  futures and options. Over the eight years to December 2022  Revenue has tripled from €458.5 million to €1 418.8 million (a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15 per cent)  whilst earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortisation (EBITDA) has grown 3.8 times from €224.4 million to €861.6 million (a CAGR of 18 per cent) as volumes have grown and through accretive acquisitions.However  in the March 2023 Quarter both went backwards; revenue was down by 6 per cent to €372 million and EBITDA declined by 13 per cent to €218 million. EBITDA margins came down 5.0 per cent from 63.7 per cent in the March 2022 Quarter to 58.7 per cent in the March 2023 Quarter. This weakness  which continued into the June 2023 Quarter  reflects the shorter-term cyclicality of the Euronext business with pressure on average daily turnover  clearing  and settlement. Longer-term  it is a high-quality volumes-based business than should thrive and survive in nearly any market environment.TMX GroupTMX Group operates cash and derivative markets for multiple asset classes  including equities  fixed income and energy. TMX operates the Toronto Stock Exchange  the third largest exchange by market capitalisation in North America  behind the NYSE and the NASDAQ  and the Montreal Exchange  giving them a near monopoly on capital market access in Canada. They also provided clearing facilities and data products. Through LOGICLY  the company provides advanced insights and analytic tools for wealth management professionals.With a market capitalisation of C$8.3 billion (U.S.$6.3 billion)  calendar 2022 revenue was up 14 per cent to U.S.$1.17 billion  and this was split 32 per cent: Global Solutions  Insights & Analytics; 24 per cent: Capital Formation; 23 per cent: Derivative Trading & Clearing; and 21 per cent: Equities and Fixed Income Trading & Clearing. From a regional perspective  Canada accounts for 60 per cent of revenue  the USA 22 per cent  the UK and Germany 9 per cent; and Other 9 per cent.In the June 2023 half-year  revenue grew a further 6 per cent to C$605 million  whilst cash flows from operating activities were up 17 per cent to C$269 million. However  growth in expenses at 9 per cent (to C$319 million) crimped adjusted net income growth to C$211 million  up one per cent. Over time  revenues should continue to grow at a steady pace but at higher incremental profit margins due to shrinking fixed costs.The Polen Capital Global Small and Mid Cap Fund own shares in Euronext and TMX Group.

But a viable plan to boost the equity side of the business remains elusive. That must be a concern. The domestic stock market is but one capital source for business  but it is a critical one nonetheless.,The Irish Stock Exchange  Dublin- faces questions about its future as some major companies move their market listings to the US (Photographer: Dara Mac Dónaill / Irish Times )A stark report on the Irish stock exchange by Department of Finance officials lays bare the daunting challenges facing the historic market for Irish equities.Building materials giant CRH delists next month  cutting some €39 billion from the Irish share index. The company is pursuing a New York listing to access US infrastructure funding and higher share valuations. The possibility of gambling group Flutter following suit casts doubt over a further €30.8 billion. The owner of the Paddy Power brand sees copious opportunities in a largely untapped US market as federal states relax gambling laws.The drive for growth marks but the latest phase in the transformation of these Irish groups into corporations of scale with global reach. Yet it has left the Irish Stock Exchange with a conundrum. The potential loss of €70 billion in the capitalisation of the market will dim Dublin’s allure for international investors – and the glaring shortage of market entrants means there is no prospect of replacing the lost value any time soon.Euronext Dublin  the Dutch-controlled group that bought the exchange in 2018  asked Minister for Finance Michael McGrath to intervene as it sought to persuade CRH and Flutter to keep their Irish listings. McGrath’s department had contacts with “relevant market participants” but there is nothing to suggest minds will change.READ MORENow finance officials warn of “long-term decline” in the Irish market  saying nutrition company Glanbia  insulation maker Kingspan and Kerry  the food group might yet consider taking out US listings. In a briefing note released under the Freedom of Information Act  they say a study might yet be needed on the “loss of a functioning stock exchange for Irish-listed companies”. This is dire talk  reflecting a mood of drift and stagnation at odds with the high-growth open economy on the doorstep of the Anglesea Street exchange.The lack of new listings is not unique to Ireland. Recent industry research shows European flotations have slumped this year to the lowest level since the global crash more than a decade ago. That flows from rising interest rates  record inflation  deeper pools of stock market and private equity capital in the US and better liquidity in its markets. On a longer horizon  the strain in Dublin is greater because of lower equity exposure by domestic pension funds and their diversification from Irish equities.
