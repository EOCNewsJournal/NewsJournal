This is my first year as Chairman of Berkeley  having initially been appointed as an independent Non-executive Director and Chairman Designate on 8 June 2022. On conclusion of the Company's Annual General Meeting on 6 September 2022  I succeeded Glyn Barker as Chairman of the Board and the Nomination Committee and as a member of the Remuneration Committee. I would like to thank Glyn for his stewardship in having led the Board through a period of significant transition following his appointment as Chairman on 23 July 2020  and for his service to Berkeley over the previous nine years. In the period from 1 May 2022 to the date of this Notice of Meeting  there have been a number of Committee changes  as outlined in the Corporate Governance section of the Company's Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2023. On 6 September 2022  Natasha Adams was appointed as a member of the Remuneration Committee. Thereafter  on 16 November 2022  Sir John Armitt stepped down  and Rachel Downey was appointed  as a member of the Nomination Committee. Additionally  on 16 November 2022  Sarah Sands was appointed as a member of the Audit Committee. As announced on 21 June 2023  Sir John Armitt  Diana Brightmore-Armour  Andy Myers  Justin Tibaldi  Paul Vallone and Karl Whiteman will step down from the Board at the conclusion of the Company's Annual General Meeting on 8 September 2023. I would like to thank Sir John  Diana and Andy for their outstanding service to the Berkeley Board and its Committees over their tenure as Non-executive Directors. I would like to also thank Justin  Paul and Karl and pay tribute to them for their significant contributions to the Board. They will remain in their current operational roles as key members of the Group's senior leadership team and as members of the Board of the Company's immediate subsidiary  The Berkeley Group plc and their importance to Berkeley  internally and externally  will not change. Subject to their re-election as Directors  and as further announced on 21 June 2023  the following additional changes to Board and Committee composition will take place with effect from the conclusion of the 2023 Annual General Meeting: Rachel Downey will be appointed as Senior Independent Director; Andy Kemp will be appointed as Chairman of the Audit Committee and step down as Chairman  but remain a member  of the Remuneration Committee; Natasha Adams will replace Andy Kemp as Chair of the Remuneration Committee; William Jackson will join the Remuneration Committee; and Natasha Adams and Andy Kemp will join the Nomination Committee. The Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2023 (the 'Annual Report') is available on the Company's website. Printed copies of the Annual Report have been sent to those shareholders that requested them. If you requested a printed copy of the Annual Report and have not received it  please contact the Company Secretary. Summary of Resolutions The full form of the resolutions is set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting accompanying this letter. However  by way of summary  we will be proposing the following: (a) that the accounts for the year ended 30 April 2023 be received; (b) that the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year ended 30 April 2023 be approved; (c) that those Directors standing for re-election be re-elected; that KPMG LLP be re-appointed as auditor; (e) that the Audit Committee be authorised to determine the auditor's remuneration; that the Directors be authorised to allot a percentage of the share capital of the Company and that authority be granted for the allotment for cash of certain of those shares without reference to shareholders' pre-emption rights; (g) that the authority be renewed allowing the Company to purchase its own shares in the market; (h) that the authority be renewed allowing the Company to make donations to certain political organisations and to incur certain political expenditure; and (i) that general meetings may be held on 14 days' notice. 3LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BERKELEY GROUP HOLDINGS PLC Presentation of Report and Accounts (Resolution 1) In accordance with Section 437 of the Companies Act 2006 (the 'Act')  Directors must present the Report of the Directors and the accounts of the Company for the year ended 30 April 2023 to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. The Report of the Directors  the accounts and the Report of the Company's Auditor on the accounts and on those parts of the Remuneration Report that are required to be audited are contained within the Annual Report. Remuneration Report (Resolution 2) In accordance with Section 439 of the Act  shareholders are required to approve the Annual Report on Remuneration which forms part of the Remuneration Report as presented on pages 132 to 156 of the Annual Report. In accordance with the Act  Resolution 2 in respect of the Annual Report on Remuneration is advisory only in order to provide shareholder feedback to the Board and does not affect the future remuneration paid to any Director. The Company's Directors' Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2022 Annual General Meeting and is therefore not required to be approved at this Annual General Meeting. It will be put to shareholders no later than the Company's Annual General Meeting in 2025. Re-election of Directors (Resolutions 3 to 11) In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the 'Code')  all Directors are subject to annual re-election. As previously announced  Sir John Armitt  Diana Brightmore-Armour  Andy Myers  Justin Tibaldi  Paul Vallone and Karl Whiteman will be stepping down from the Board at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting. At this Annual General Meeting all other Directors will retire and are offering themselves for re-election. The Board considers the effectiveness and independence of the current Non-executive Directors under the Code on an annual basis  taking into account each individual's professional characteristics  behaviour and their contribution to unbiased and independent debate. It has concluded that the Non-executive Directors have the skills  experience  independence and knowledge of the Company to enable them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities skilfully and effectively. The Board annually reviews the outside directorships and time commitments of the Non-executive Directors. The Non-executive Directors' letters of appointment set out the expected time commitment and the Board has determined that each Non-executive Director is able to allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge their responsibilities effectively. All of the Non-executive Directors presenting themselves for re-election are considered to have been independent in character and judgment throughout the year and are free of any other business or other relationship with the Group. Biographical details of the Directors  including details of their contribution and how it is and continues to be important to the Company's long term sustainable success  are set out in Appendix 1 to this notice. Following the annual evaluation of the Board and its Committees  which this year was carried out by the Group Company Secretary  the Board is satisfied that each Director standing for re-election  as appropriate  continues to and will make effective and valuable contributions to the Board and demonstrates commitment to the role. Reappointment of Auditor and Auditor's Remuneration (Resolutions 12 and 13) In accordance with Section 489 of the Act  the auditor of a company must be re-appointed at each general meeting at which accounts are laid. KPMG LLP was first appointed as the Group's auditor with effect from 1 May 2014. During the year to 30 April 2023  in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements  the Audit Committee conducted a competitive tender process in respect of the appointment of the external auditor of the Company and its subsidiaries. Following a comprehensive process  on the recommendation of the Audit Committee  the Board approved the re-appointment of KPMG LLP as the Group's external auditor. Resolution 12 therefore proposes the re-appointment of the Company's existing auditor  KPMG LLP  until the conclusion of the next general meeting of the Company at which accounts are laid. Resolution 13 gives authority to the Audit Committee to determine the auditor's remuneration. Allotment of Shares (Resolution 14) The Directors may allot shares and grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  shares only if authorised to do so by shareholders pursuant to Section 551 of the Act. The authority granted at the last Annual General Meeting is due to expire at the conclusion of this year's Annual General Meeting or on 31 October 2023  whichever is earlier. Accordingly  Resolution 14 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to grant new authorities to allot shares and grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  shares. If given  these authorities will expire at the conclusion of the Company's next Annual General Meeting or on 31 October 2024  whichever is the earlier. Paragraph (a) of Resolution 14 will allow the Directors to allot ordinary shares up to a maximum nominal amount of £1 921 375.55 representing approximately one third (33.33%) of the Company's existing issued share capital (excluding treasury shares)  calculated as at 27 July 2023 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document). In accordance with the latest institutional guidelines issued by the Investment Association (the 'IA')  paragraph (b) of Resolution 14 will also allow the Directors to allot  in addition to the ordinary shares referred to in paragraph (a) of Resolution 14  ordinary shares in connection with a fully pre-emptive offer to ordinary shareholders up to a further maximum nominal amount of £1 921 375.55  representing a further approximately one third (33.33%) of the Company's existing issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) calculated as at 27 July 2023 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document). The Directors have no present intention of allotting new ordinary shares other than in relation to the Company's employee share schemes. However  the Board considers it appropriate to maintain the flexibility that this authority provides. If they do exercise the authority  the Directors intend to follow emerging best practice as regards its use as recommended by the IA. As at 27 July 2023 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document)  the Company holds 8 959 264 shares in treasury. This represents 8.42% of the total ordinary share capital in issue (excluding treasury shares) as at 27 July 2023 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this notice). 4,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,positive,0.85,0.15,0.01,True,English,"['2023 Annual General Meeting', 'Berkeley', 'Notice', 'The Berkeley Group Holdings plc', 'other appropriate independent financial advisor', 'Herbert Smith Freehills LLP', 'Annual General Meeting Introduction', 'previous nine years', 'Corporate Governance section', 'independent Non-executive Director', '2023 Annual General Meeting', 'Sir John Armitt', 'London EC2A 2EG', 'Contents Page Letter', 'hard copy Form', 'Berkeley House', 'Financial Services', 'other agent', 'Annual Report', 'Berkeley Board', 'IMMEDIATE ATTENTION', 'tax advice', 'Markets Act', 'accompanying documents', 'Further details', 'Exchange House', 'Primrose Street', '19 Portsmouth Road', 'Surrey KT11', 'Dear Shareholder', 'above address', 'specific question', 'Nomination Committee', 'Remuneration Committee', 'significant transition', 'Committee changes', 'Natasha Adams', 'Rachel Downey', 'Sarah Sands', 'Audit Committee', 'significant contributions', 'current op', 'Non-executive Directors', 'proxy vote', 'Wednesday 6 September', 'first year', 'Glyn Barker', 'Diana Brightmore-Armour', 'Andy Myers', 'Justin Tibaldi', 'Paul Vallone', 'Karl Whiteman', 'bank manager', 'ordinary shares', 'outstanding service', 'CREST member', 'Friday 8 September', 'doubt', 'action', 'stockbroker', 'solicitor', 'accountant', 'purchaser', 'transferee', 'sale', 'delivery', 'part', 'website', 'registrar', 'signalshares', 'accordance', 'instructions', 'Euroclear', 'notes', 'pages', 'England', 'Wales', 'number', 'Notice', 'offices', 'Chairman', 'Appendix', 'Biographies', 'No.', 'Cobham', 'holders', 'opportunity', 'issues', 'event', 'person', '8 June', 'conclusion', 'stewardship', 'period', 'appointment', '23 July', '1 May', 'date', 'Accounts', 'April', '16 November', '21 June', 'Committees', 'tenure', 'tribute', '11:00']",2023-08-07,2023-08-08,marketscreener.com

(the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS- NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies  announced toda…,"NEW YORK  Aug. 07  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cellectis S.A. (the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS- NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies  announced today the release of the full report of the financial results for the second quarter 2023 (ended June 30  2023) and filing of the corresponding 6-K with the SEC.Financial ResultsThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis  have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”).We present certain financial metrics broken out between our two reportable segments – Therapeutics and Plants – in the appendices of this Q2 2023 financial results press release.On January 13  2023  Calyxt  Cibus Global LLC (Cibus) and certain other parties named therein  entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”)  pursuant to which  subject to the terms and conditions thereof  Calyxt and Cibus will merge in an all-stock transaction (the “Calyxt Merger”). As a consequence of the foregoing  Calyxt met the “held-for-sale” criteria specified in IFRS 5 and was classified as a discontinued operation until May 31  2023.On June 1  2023  Calyxt and Cibus closed the merger transaction and now operate under the name Cibus  Inc. Consequently  Calyxt was deconsolidated and Calyxt's cash  cash equivalent and restricted cash are no longer included in the Group's cash  cash equivalent and restricted cash since June 1  2023.Cash: As of June 30  2023  Cellectis  had $89 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash. This compares to $95 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31  2022. This $6 million difference mainly reflects $55 million of cash out  which include $15 million for R&D suppliers  $7 million for SG&A suppliers  $23 million for staff costs  $7 million for rents and taxes  $3 millions of reimbursement of the “PGE” loan  and a $1 million unfavorable impact on Forex partially offset by a $23 million net cash inflow from the capital raise closed in February  a $21 million net cash inflow from EIB loan  a $1 million cash inflow related to the grant and refundable advance from BPI  $2 millions of financial investments’ capital gain and interests  a $1 million reimbursement of social charges paid on stock options  and a $2 million net cash inflow from licenses and other cash receipts.Based on the current operating plan  Cellectis anticipates that the cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash as of June 30  2023 will fund Cellectis’ operations into the third quarter of 2024.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $5.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2023 compared to $6.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The decrease of $1.0 million reflects the recognition of two milestones related to Cellectis’ agreement with Cytovia for $1.5 million in 2022 and a milestone of $1.0 million with another partner while recognition of revenues in 2023 is not material  and partially offset by the increase of the research tax credit for $0.8 million and the partial recognition of a grant signed with “BPI” of $0.8 million.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $43.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $52.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $9.0 million decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a $3.4 million decrease in personal expenses due to departures not replaced (ii) a $4.7 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $28.0 million in 2022 to $23.2 million in 2023) mainly explained by internalization of our manufacturing and quality activities to support our R&D pipeline and (iii) a $0.8 million decrease of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses (from $3.1 million to $2.3 million).SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $8.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $10.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $2.0 million decrease primarily reflects (i) a $1.6 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $6.4 million in 2022 to $4.9 million in 2023) mainly explained by the implementation of our ERP in 2022 (ii) a $0.2 million decrease in personal expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.Net financial gain (loss): Consolidated net financial gain was $11.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $9.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $2.4 million increase primarily reflects (i) a $20.8 million increase of financial income  mainly attributable to the profit from Calyxt’s deconsolidation  partially offset by (ii) the loss in fair value on our retained investment in Calyxt since deconsolidation for $10.2 million  (iii) a $6.8 million decrease in the fair value of Cytovia’s note receivable.Net income (loss) from discontinued operations: Pursuant to Calyxt deconsolidation income from discontinued operation for the six-month period ended June 30  2023  2023 only include five months of activity. The $3.5 million increase of net loss from discontinued operations between the six-month period ended June 30  2022 and 2023 is primarily driven by (i) the increase of $9.2 million of net financial loss and (ii) the increase of $1.5 million of other operating expenses partially offset by (i) the decrease of $2.8 million of R&D expenses (from $6.3 million in 2022 to $3.5 in 2023) and (ii) the decrease of $4.5 million of SG&A expenses (from $6.8 million in 2022 to $2.3 million in 2023).Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $40.7 million (or $0.76 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2023  of which $35.7 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations  compared to $50.9 million (or $1.12 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2022  of which $47.3 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations. This $10.1 million decrease in net loss between the first six months of 2023 and 2022 was primarily driven by (i) a $9.0 million decrease of R&D expenses  (ii) a $2.0 million decrease of SG&A expenses and (iii) an increase of $2.4 million of the financial gain due to the deconsolidation of Calyxt compensated in part by the decrease of fair value of Cytovia’s note receivable. These downward impacts on the net loss were partially offset by (i) a decrease of $1.0 million of revenues and other income  (ii) an increase of $1.5 million of loss from discontinued operations attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $36.7 million (or $0.68 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to a net loss of $45.5 million (or $1.00 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2022.Please see ""Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis for 2023 in the following areas:Supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART123  UCART22  UCART 20x22 and potential new product candidates;Operating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France)  and Raleigh (North Carolina  USA); andContinuing to strengthen our manufacturing and clinical departments.CELLECTIS S.A.STATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION (unaudited)($ in thousands) As of December 31  2022 June 30  2023 ASSETS Non-current assets Intangible assets 718 695 Property  plant  and equipment 63 621 59 231 Right-of-use assets 44 275 41 457 Non-current financial assets 8 791 13 006 Total non-current assets 117 406 114 389 Current assets Trade receivables 772 422 Subsidies receivables 14 496 19 488 Other current assets 9 078 7 869 Cash and cash equivalent and Current financial assets 97 697 85 505 Total current assets 122 043 113 285 Total assets held for sale 21 768 0 TOTAL ASSETS 261 216 227 674 LIABILITIES Shareholders’ equity Share capital 2 955 3 491 Premiums related to the share capital 583 122 476 224 Currency translation adjustment (28 605 ) (37 050 ) Retained earnings (333 365 ) (305 392 ) Net income (loss) (106 139 ) (40 715 ) Total shareholders’ equity -

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock-based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOMEFor the three-month period ended June 30  2023(unaudited) - ($ in thousands except per share data) For the three-month period ended June 30  2022 * 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (18 946 ) (10 648 ) Adjustment: Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 2 684 2 074 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (16 263 ) (8 574 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.36 ) (0.15 ) Basic adjusted earnings from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($ /share) 0.00 (0.05 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 45 497 127 55 583 768 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1) (0.36 ) (0.15 ) Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) from discontinued operations 0.02 (0.04 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 45 497 127 55 583 768*These amounts reflect adjustments made in connection with the presentation of the discontinued operationRECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME (unaudited)First six months($ in thousands  except per share data) For the six-month period ended June 30  2022 * 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (50 858 ) (40 715 ) Adjustment: Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 5 331 4 053 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (45 527 ) (36 662 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1.00 ) (0.68 ) Basic adjusted earnings from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($ /share) (0.95 ) (0.71 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 45 497 127 53 541 010 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1.00 ) (0.68 ) Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) from discontinued operations (0.95 ) (0.71 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 45 497 127 53 541 010*These amounts reflect adjustments made in connection with the presentation of the discontinued operationAbout CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA stark report on the Irish stock exchange by Department of Finance officials lays bare the daunting challenges facing the historic market for Irish equities.Building materials giant CRH delists next month  cutting some €39 billion from the Irish share index. The company is pursuing a New York listing to access US infrastructure funding and higher share valuations. The possibility of gambling group Flutter following suit casts doubt over a further €30.8 billion. The owner of the Paddy Power brand sees copious opportunities in a largely untapped US market as federal states relax gambling laws.The drive for growth marks but the latest phase in the transformation of these Irish groups into corporations of scale with global reach. Yet it has left the Irish Stock Exchange with a conundrum. The potential loss of €70 billion in the capitalisation of the market will dim Dublin’s allure for international investors – and the glaring shortage of market entrants means there is no prospect of replacing the lost value any time soon.Euronext Dublin  the Dutch-controlled group that bought the exchange in 2018  asked Minister for Finance Michael McGrath to intervene as it sought to persuade CRH and Flutter to keep their Irish listings. McGrath’s department had contacts with “relevant market participants” but there is nothing to suggest minds will change.READ MORENow finance officials warn of “long-term decline” in the Irish market  saying nutrition company Glanbia  insulation maker Kingspan and Kerry  the food group might yet consider taking out US listings. In a briefing note released under the Freedom of Information Act  they say a study might yet be needed on the “loss of a functioning stock exchange for Irish-listed companies”. This is dire talk  reflecting a mood of drift and stagnation at odds with the high-growth open economy on the doorstep of the Anglesea Street exchange.The lack of new listings is not unique to Ireland. Recent industry research shows European flotations have slumped this year to the lowest level since the global crash more than a decade ago. That flows from rising interest rates  record inflation  deeper pools of stock market and private equity capital in the US and better liquidity in its markets. On a longer horizon  the strain in Dublin is greater because of lower equity exposure by domestic pension funds and their diversification from Irish equities. Fewer brokers and the rise of passive investment via exchange-traded funds are other factors  as are Irish stamp duty rates.By running a booming global business for listing debt and funds  the Irish exchange has proved it can be a winner. But a viable plan to boost the equity side of the business remains elusive. That must be a concern. The domestic stock market is but one capital source for business  but it is a critical one nonetheless.,neutral,0.06,0.92,0.02,mixed,0.07,0.25,0.68,True,English,"['The Irish Times view', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'concerns', 'future', 'Building materials giant CRH delists', 'Dara Mac Dónaill', 'Irish stamp duty rates', 'The Irish Stock Exchange', 'rising interest rates', 'higher share valuations', 'Paddy Power brand', 'high-growth open economy', 'Recent industry research', 'functioning stock exchange', 'Anglesea Street exchange', 'private equity capital', 'lower equity exposure', 'Irish share index', 'one capital source', 'relevant market participants', 'domestic stock market', 'US infrastructure funding', 'domestic pension funds', 'New York listing', 'Finance Michael McGrath', 'untapped US market', 'booming global business', 'Irish exchange', 'Irish market', 'equity side', 'Irish equities', 'Irish groups', 'Irish listings', 'new listings', 'critical one', 'Finance officials', 'global reach', 'global crash', 'market listings', 'historic market', 'market entrants', 'major companies', 'stark report', 'daunting challenges', 'copious opportunities', 'federal states', 'gambling laws', 'latest phase', 'international investors', 'glaring shortage', 'lost value', 'long-term decline', 'insulation maker', 'US listings', 'briefing note', 'Information Act', 'Irish-listed companies', 'dire talk', 'European flotations', 'lowest level', 'record inflation', 'deeper pools', 'longer horizon', 'Fewer brokers', 'passive investment', 'exchange-traded funds', 'other factors', 'viable plan', 'Dutch-controlled group', 'food group', 'potential loss', 'nutrition company', 'Euronext Dublin', 'questions', 'future', 'Photograph', 'Department', 'possibility', 'Flutter', 'suit', 'doubt', 'owner', 'drive', 'transformation', 'corporations', 'scale', 'conundrum', 'capitalisation', 'allure', 'prospect', 'Minister', 'contacts', 'minds', 'READ', 'Glanbia', 'Kingspan', 'Kerry', 'Freedom', 'study', 'mood', 'drift', 'stagnation', 'odds', 'doorstep', 'lack', 'Ireland', 'liquidity', 'markets', 'strain', 'diversification', 'rise', 'debt', 'winner', 'concern']",2023-08-07,2023-08-08,irishtimes.com

(the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS- NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies  announced today the release of the full report of the financial results for the second quarter 2023 (ended June 30  2023) and filing of the corresponding 6-K with the SEC.Financial ResultsThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis  have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”).We present certain financial metrics broken out between our two reportable segments – Therapeutics and Plants – in the appendices of this Q2 2023 financial results press release.On January 13  2023  Calyxt  Cibus Global LLC (Cibus) and certain other parties named therein  entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”)  pursuant to which  subject to the terms and conditions thereof  Calyxt and Cibus will merge in an all-stock transaction (the “Calyxt Merger”). As a consequence of the foregoing  Calyxt met the “held-for-sale” criteria specified in IFRS 5 and was classified as a discontinued operation until May 31  2023.On June 1  2023  Calyxt and Cibus closed the merger transaction and now operate under the name Cibus  Inc. Consequently  Calyxt was deconsolidated and Calyxt's cash  cash equivalent and restricted cash are no longer included in the Group's cash  cash equivalent and restricted cash since June 1  2023.Cash: As of June 30  2023  Cellectis  had $89 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash. This compares to $95 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31  2022. This $6 million difference mainly reflects $55 million of cash out  which include $15 million for R&D suppliers  $7 million for SG&A suppliers  $23 million for staff costs  $7 million for rents and taxes  $3 millions of reimbursement of the “PGE” loan  and a $1 million unfavorable impact on Forex partially offset by a $23 million net cash inflow from the capital raise closed in February  a $21 million net cash inflow from EIB loan  a $1 million cash inflow related to the grant and refundable advance from BPI  $2 millions of financial investments’ capital gain and interests  a $1 million reimbursement of social charges paid on stock options  and a $2 million net cash inflow from licenses and other cash receipts.Based on the current operating plan  Cellectis anticipates that the cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash as of June 30  2023 will fund Cellectis’ operations into the third quarter of 2024.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $5.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2023 compared to $6.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The decrease of $1.0 million reflects the recognition of two milestones related to Cellectis’ agreement with Cytovia for $1.5 million in 2022 and a milestone of $1.0 million with another partner while recognition of revenues in 2023 is not material  and partially offset by the increase of the research tax credit for $0.8 million and the partial recognition of a grant signed with “BPI” of $0.8 million.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $43.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $52.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $9.0 million decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a $3.4 million decrease in personal expenses due to departures not replaced (ii) a $4.7 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $28.0 million in 2022 to $23.2 million in 2023) mainly explained by internalization of our manufacturing and quality activities to support our R&D pipeline and (iii) a $0.8 million decrease of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses (from $3.1 million to $2.3 million).SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $8.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $10.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $2.0 million decrease primarily reflects (i) a $1.6 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $6.4 million in 2022 to $4.9 million in 2023) mainly explained by the implementation of our ERP in 2022 (ii) a $0.2 million decrease in personal expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.Net financial gain (loss): Consolidated net financial gain was $11.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to $9.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The $2.4 million increase primarily reflects (i) a $20.8 million increase of financial income  mainly attributable to the profit from Calyxt’s deconsolidation  partially offset by (ii) the loss in fair value on our retained investment in Calyxt since deconsolidation for $10.2 million  (iii) a $6.8 million decrease in the fair value of Cytovia’s note receivable.Net income (loss) from discontinued operations: Pursuant to Calyxt deconsolidation income from discontinued operation for the six-month period ended June 30  2023  2023 only include five months of activity. The $3.5 million increase of net loss from discontinued operations between the six-month period ended June 30  2022 and 2023 is primarily driven by (i) the increase of $9.2 million of net financial loss and (ii) the increase of $1.5 million of other operating expenses partially offset by (i) the decrease of $2.8 million of R&D expenses (from $6.3 million in 2022 to $3.5 in 2023) and (ii) the decrease of $4.5 million of SG&A expenses (from $6.8 million in 2022 to $2.3 million in 2023).Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $40.7 million (or $0.76 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2023  of which $35.7 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations  compared to $50.9 million (or $1.12 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2022  of which $47.3 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations. This $10.1 million decrease in net loss between the first six months of 2023 and 2022 was primarily driven by (i) a $9.0 million decrease of R&D expenses  (ii) a $2.0 million decrease of SG&A expenses and (iii) an increase of $2.4 million of the financial gain due to the deconsolidation of Calyxt compensated in part by the decrease of fair value of Cytovia’s note receivable. These downward impacts on the net loss were partially offset by (i) a decrease of $1.0 million of revenues and other income  (ii) an increase of $1.5 million of loss from discontinued operations attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $36.7 million (or $0.68 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to a net loss of $45.5 million (or $1.00 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2022.Please see ""Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis for 2023 in the following areas:Supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART123  UCART22  UCART 20x22 and potential new product candidates;Operating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France)  and Raleigh (North Carolina  USA); andContinuing to strengthen our manufacturing and clinical departments.CELLECTIS S.A.STATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION(unaudited)($ in thousands) As of December 31  2022 June 30  2023 ASSETS Non-current assets Intangible assets 718 695 Property  plant  and equipment 63 621 59 231 Right-of-use assets 44 275 41 457 Non-current financial assets 8 791 13 006 Total non-current assets 117 406 114 389 Current assets Trade receivables 772 422 Subsidies receivables 14 496 19 488 Other current assets 9 078 7 869 Cash and cash equivalent and Current financial assets 97 697 85 505 Total current assets 122 043 113 285 Total assets held for sale 21 768 0 TOTAL ASSETS 261 216 227 674 LIABILITIES Shareholders’ equity Share capital 2 955 3 491 Premiums related to the share capital 583 122 476 224 Currency translation adjustment (28 605 ) (37 050 ) Retained earnings (333 365 ) (305 392 ) Net income (loss) (106 139 ) (40 715 ) Total shareholders’ equity -

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock-based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOMEFor the three-month period ended June 30  2023(unaudited) - ($ in thousands except per share data) For the three-month period ended June 30  2022 * 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (18 946 ) (10 648 ) Adjustment: Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 2 684 2 074 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (16 263 ) (8 574 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.36 ) (0.15 ) Basic adjusted earnings from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($ /share) 0.00 (0.05 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 45 497 127 55 583 768 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1) (0.36 ) (0.15 ) Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) from discontinued operations 0.02 (0.04 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 45 497 127 55 583 768*These amounts reflect adjustments made in connection with the presentation of the discontinued operationRECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME (unaudited)First six months($ in thousands  except per share data) For the six-month period ended June 30  2022 * 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (50 858 ) (40 715 ) Adjustment: Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 5 331 4 053 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (45 527 ) (36 662 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1.00 ) (0.68 ) Basic adjusted earnings from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($ /share) (0.95 ) (0.71 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 45 497 127 53 541 010 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1.00 ) (0.68 ) Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) from discontinued operations (0.95 ) (0.71 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 45 497 127 53 541 010*These amounts reflect adjustments made in connection with the presentation of the discontinued operationAbout CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.
