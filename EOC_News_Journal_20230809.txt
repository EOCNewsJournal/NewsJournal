The Finteum Platform is an execution venue that brings intraday funding capabilities to the global interbank market. 19 banking groups with a combined balance sheet of $23.5trn attended a joint trial of the software in Q2 2023  together with observers from national prudential authorities. The Finteum Platform is expected to complete its first live trades by the end of 2023.In the recent trial  over three days  participants discussed the business case and market structure for intraday markets. Attendees were a diverse group of large and midsize global organisations and included clearing banks for six different home currencies CAD  CHF  EUR  GBP  JPY and USD.The banks progressing with the integration work and planning to go live soon include UBS and NatWest. Intraday FX swaps and intraday repo are recognised to be an increasingly important part of liquidity management strategies at global banks. The Federal Reserve included intraday liquidity risk management as a supervisory priority for 2023  and recent bank failures have highlighted the need for banks to have access to multiple tools and sources of liquidity.As there are few solutions to control the receipt of funds within a settlement window  bank treasury teams maintain large buffers of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) for intraday. Holding this HQLA is increasingly expensive  due to the rising interest rate environment.Banks require agile mechanisms that enable them to swiftly access and move funds when needed. Finteum trial participants responded to a poll on the tools they would like to possess to manage intraday liquidity; 94% selected intraday and overnight funding markets  such as the Finteum Platform. The second most popular tool was central banks (facilities  FX swap lines  and liquidity bridges) at 75%. Accessing commercial bank credit lines  and throttling and payment queue reordering  were less popular at 30% or less.By gaining faster and better access to a currency  and by holding it for only as long as is needed  banks can meet customer obligations  reduce the HQLA required and meet increasing regulatory expectations to be able to fund payment activity in real-time. This subsequently reduces bank costs  with estimates of up $75m per year for a large bank. In another trial poll  64% of respondents believed they had adequate real-time data on their payment patterns to execute intraday trades  with others indicating they could use historical patterns instead to model regular  useful  intraday transactions.The Finteum Platform uses R3’s Corda Enterprise distributed ledger technology (DLT) protocol. DLT enables both parties to a trade to send money and securities to each other  without needing to exchange and reconcile MT300 or similar confirmation messages. Post-trade actions such as 'early maturity’ or cancellation of a trade are also agreed through the DLT platform. All data records are stored on a shared ledger that is only visible to the parties to the trade – not to Finteum  R3 or anyone else.Trades during the interbank trial were agreed in a simulated settlement environment. Real money trades are scheduled for later in 2023. The banks integrating with Finteum are going live using existing Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems for intraday FX swaps. Following requests from banks  newly built “capacity” functionality helps bank teams to coordinate with each other regarding how much of each currency the bank should borrow or lend  and for which hours. Also  bank risk teams can now input intraday credit limits into the platform  to manage intraday counterparty credit risk.Finteum is built to be able to integrate with any market infrastructure  including BNY Mellon’s triparty repo platform  Euroclear Bank’s triparty repo platform  RTGS systems  T2S  as well as DLT-native technology such as the Fnality Payment System  HQLAX  Baton Systems' Core-FX and RTGS.global. Member banks plan to transition FX swap settlement from RTGS systems to ""Payment vs Payment"" solutions  when appropriate.Finteum is building out the second wave of banks that will go live on the platform in 2024 and will start benefiting from intraday markets. Incentive structures are in place for second wave banks.

The Advisory Services team also offers fair lending risk reviews that can help lenders: identify statistically significant disparities in raw and reported small business and small farm lending data relative to proxied demographic data; identify disparate treatment on prohibited bases; and potential redlining risks.Wolters Kluwer can help lenders geocode their reportable transactions to ensure accurate filings  and it can generate custom tables that allow lenders to analyze small business and small farm lending by geography and Gross Annual Revenue compared to related demographics  offering insights on where a covered institution may need to improve its marketing efforts to ensure that its lending volume meets or exceeds its peers in the marketplace prior to the mandatory reporting date.“We can also assist institutions in verifying the integrity of their data prior to their annual data submission  as well as help them in preparing for upcoming regulatory examinations ” Keller explains.He notes that while mandatory compliance is tiered  based on the volume of transactions that a covered institution expects to report in 2022 and 2023  a covered institution should not delay its preparations.“It’s essential for lenders to get started in assessing their small business lending profile and activity relative to the new rule  to develop a plan  and to begin implementing the necessary steps that will align their policies and procedures accordingly.”More information on managing Section 1071 requirements can be found at Wolters Kluwer’s dedicated website.Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions is a market leader and trusted provider of risk management and regulatory compliance solutions and services to U.S. banks  credit unions  insurers and securities firms.

Advances in technology  communications  and transportation have made global markets easier for investors to access. This allows them to diversify portfolios and take advantage of global economic trends. Investing in securities in different jurisdictions reduces concentration risk and allows them to take advantage of economic growth in different countries and industries  each with its own cycles and trends. Hence  these factors are expected to drive market growth during the forecast period.Major TrendsIncreasing focus on sustainable and environmental  social  and governance (ESG) investing is a major trend in the market. Growing awareness of environmental and social issues and their impact on a company's financial performance and long-term sustainability is a key driver of ESG investing. Therefore  to meet the growing demand in this field  security exchanges have introduced ESG-focused indices and offer investment products centered around ESG. Hence  the increasing focus on sustainable and ESG investing is expected to drive security exchange market growth during the forecast period.Significant ChallengesCybersecurity and data privacy concerns associated with trading are one of the significant challenges restricting market growth. Security exchanges' heavy reliance on digital technology makes them attractive targets for cybercriminals who exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Successful cyberattacks against these exchanges can have serious consequences  including disruption of trading operations  compromise of investor-related data  manipulation of market prices  and loss of investor confidence. Therefore  cybersecurity and data privacy concerns are expected to restrict security exchange market growth during the forecast period.Insights on Market Drivers  trends  & Challenges  historic period(2017 to 2021)  and forecast period(2023 to 2027)- Request a sample report!What are the key data covered in this Securities Exchanges Market report?CAGR of the market during the forecast periodDetailed information on factors that will drive the growth of the securities exchanges market between 2023 and 2027.Precise estimation of the size of the securities exchanges market and its contribution to the market with a focus on the parent marketAccurate predictions about upcoming trends and changes in consumer behaviorGrowth of the securities exchanges market across APAC  North America   Europe   South America   and the Middle East and Africa      and the and A thorough analysis of the market's competitive landscape and detailed information about companiesComprehensive analysis of factors that will challenge the growth of securities exchanges market companiesGain instant access to 17 000+ market research reports.Technavio's SUBSCRIPTION platformRelated ReportsThe security brokerage and stock exchange services market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 8.92% between 2022 and 2027.
