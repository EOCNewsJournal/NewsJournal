This was evident especially for Telko and ESL Shipping  whereas Leipurin experienced limited impact. Aspo’s net sales from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2023 decreased by 3% to EUR 132.6 (136.2) million. Telko and Leipurin showed growth  whereas ESL Shipping’s sales decreased due to softening demand and decline in fuel prices. Aspo’s comparable operating profit from continuing operations amounted to EUR 3.6 (11.7) million. Leipurin significantly improved its profitability  whereas ESL Shipping and Telko showed a clear decline.ESL Shipping suffered from weakened demand  especially in the spot market which had strong negative impact on the profitability of the two supramax vessels. In addition  pricing of time charted vessels  dockings and specific supply chain conditions had a negative impact on the financial performance of ESL shipping.Telko suffered from declining prices combined with soft demand in plastics. In addition  profitability was weakened by increased competing imports from Asia due to lower freight prices and lower domestic demand in Asia. Development in chemicals and especially lubricants was more positive.The financial development of Leipurin remained on a positive path. The acquisition of Kobia has proven to be successful in terms of synergy potential  and in particular after the sale and lease back of the three Swedish properties with a total sales price of approximately EUR 13.6 million  which represents a substantial share of the purchase price of Kobia. Also  the ongoing development actions in Leipurin  covering the leadership model as well as commercial and supply chain activities have started to deliver results.Sustainability KPIs have shown fairly flat development during year 2023 compared with last year. This includes emission intensity  employee safety  and employee satisfaction. We are working hard at Aspo to achieve the set sustainability targets for the year 2023.Aspo continues to execute its strategy. The war in Ukraine and exits of selected Eastern markets have caused a decline in Aspo’s net sales and profitability. The Russian exits are almost completed  which frees-up resources to pursue Aspo’s western focused strategy. As key priorities we are evaluating measures for accelerating ESL Shipping’s low-carbon growth strategy which will also decrease Aspo’s capex burden into ESL Shipping and free up capital to be invested into the other businesses of Aspo  including acquisitions of Telko and investments to grow the profitability of Leipurin. In addition  we continue to search for acquisition opportunities to achieve growth  while simultaneously enhancing cost efficiency in the current operations. All of these activities are executed systematically to support strong performance in any business environment.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsAspo's long-term financial targets are:Annual increase in net sales: 5–10% a yearOperating profit: 8%Return on equity: more than 20%Gearing: less than 130%On a business level  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%. The operating profit rate targets are evaluated against the comparable operating profit rate of Aspo Group and its businesses.In the second quarter of 2023  Aspo’s net sales from continuing operations decreased by 3% to EUR 132.6 (136.2) million. The comparable operating profit rate of the continuing operations was 2.7% (8.6%). Return on equity was 2.2% (23.4%) and gearing stood at 114.6% (108.4%). ROE was on modest level especially due to the loss from discontinued operations resulting mainly from the reclassification of translation differences with no impact on Group total equity.Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is calculated by adjusting the reported operating profit with rare and material items affecting the operating profit. These may include impairment losses  sales gains and losses from divested businesses and non-current assets  as well as financial losses caused by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine.Restructuring of the financial reportingTo provide a more transparent and clear view of its businesses  Aspo established a new reportable segment called Non-core businesses in the beginning of year 2023. The Non-core businesses segment includes Telko Russia and Belarus as well as Kauko GmbH previously reported in the Telko segment  Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan previously reported in the Leipurin segment  ESL Shipping Russia previously reported in the ESL Shipping segment. The Non-core businesses segment was established to separate the results of the on-core businesses of Aspo from the results of the continuing businesses. All the entities in the segment are either held for sale or in the process of being closed down or already divested. Thus  the Non-core businesses segment is reported as discontinued operations. The comparative figures of all segments and Aspo Group have been restated according to the new reporting structure. In the comparative periods of 2022  the result of the discontinued operations also includes the operative result and divestment loss of Kauko Oy  which was divested on October 31  2022. Thus  the results of Kauko and the Non-core businesses segment  which make up the result of the discontinued operations  are presented separately from the results of Aspo Group’s continuing operations  but the result of the discontinued operations is included in the presented “Group total” figures including the measure comparable operating profit  Group total.Net sales and operating profit rate  Group total 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales  Group total 136.4 165.3 283.9 327.9 652.6 Net sales  continuing operations 132.6 136.2 274.2 265.0 560.7 Net sales  discontinued operations 3.8 29.1 9.7 62.9 91.9 Operating profit  Group total -5.2 13.6 3.3 23.7 31.2 Operating profit  Group total  % -3.8 8.2 1.2 7.2 4.8 Items affecting comparability -8.8 -2.4 -8.3 -7.3 -24.1 Comparable operating profit  Group total 3.6 16.0 11.6 31.0 55.3 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 2.6 9.7 4.1 9.5 8.5 Operating profit and comparable operating profit  Group total 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping  operating profit 3.3 9.0 9.3 18.2 38.2 Telko  operating profit -0.1 4.4 2.6 2.4 8.2 Leipurin  operating profit 1.4 -0.3 2.6 -1.1 -1.4 Other operations  operating profit -1.8 -1.4 -3.1 -3.8 -6.6 Operating profit from continuing operations 2.8 11.7 11.4 15.7 38.4 Operating profit from discontinued operations -8.0 1.9 -8.1 8.0 -7.2 Operating profit  Group total -5.2 13.6 3.3 23.7 31.2 Items affecting comparability -8.8 -2.4 -8.3 -7.3 -24.1 Comparable operating profit  Group total 3.6 16.0 11.6 31.0 55.3Items affecting comparability 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping 0.0 -0.2 0.0 1.1 0.8 Telko -1.0 0.5 -1.0 -4.1 -3.1 Leipurin 0.3 -0.3 0.5 -1.2 -2.5 Other operations -0.1 0.0 -0.1 -0.5 -0.7 Continuing operations  total -0.8 0.0 -0.6 -4.7 -5.5 Discontinued operations -8.0 -2.4 -7.7 -2.6 -18.6 Total -8.8 -2.4 -8.3 -7.3 -24.1In the second quarter of 2023  items affecting comparability were EUR -8.8 million in total.

EUR -0.2 million reported for ESL Shipping related to an accrual for a legal claim. EUR 0.5 million reported in the Telko segment was an adjustment to the bad debt allowance in Ukraine.

EUR -2.4 million reported in discontinued operations included EUR -1.2 million of costs related to restructuring of Russia-related operations in the Non-core businesses segment and an impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million on Kauko’s goodwill.In January-June 2023 the items affecting comparability amounted to EUR -8.3 million in total.

EUR 0.5 million reported in Leipurin segment consisted of the gain on the sale and lease back transactions of Kobia’s properties in Sweden.

EUR -2.6 million reported in discontinued operations of which EUR -1.3 million was costs related to restructuring of Russia-related operations in the Non-core businesses segment and EUR -1.3 million was an impairment loss on Kauko’s goodwill.In 2022  items affecting comparability totaled EUR -24.1 million  of which EUR -20.7 million resulted from the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo Group’s business operations. Items affecting comparability relating to the Kauko segment totaled EUR -2.5 million. Other items affecting comparability totaled EUR -0.9 million.SustainabilitySustainability is a material factor which guides Aspo’s management system and especially the company’s investments. Aspo’s businesses aim to be forerunners in sustainability in their respective sectors. The key target is to reduce emission intensity  CO2 (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) was 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. According to the green transition in the shipping industry  ESL Shipping is engaged in close and long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation for its key customers in the future. ESL Shipping is investing in twelve new generation electric hybrid vessels  half of which will remain in its own ownership and half will be transferred to the other party of the pooling arrangement. The investment is instrumental in the company’s green transition.During the past 12 months  emission intensity has slightly increased despite the positive development in operational efficiency and the use of new operating models especially by ESL Shipping  and stood at 0.34 (0.33 for the full-year 2022). The slight increase is driven by decrease in net sales as the emissions during the past 12 months have decreased in absolute terms. Specifically for ESL Shipping  emission intensity was impacted also by fleet structure and the difficult ice conditions in the Northern Bay of Bothnia during April. The emission intensity target for the full-year 2023 is 0.36.Another key sustainability focus area of Aspo is employee safety. The Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) slightly increased and was 8.6 (8.1 for the full-year 2022) for the past 12 months. The TRIF target for 2023 is 7.0.Aspo’s employee survey completed in June 2023 resulted in an AA-rating and a people power index of 79  which equals the rating last year  and is clearly above the global industry benchmark (74).Operating environment and the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo’s operationsAspo’s commercial activities in eastern markets have significantly declined since Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and Aspo’s focus has been on full withdrawal from selected eastern markets. Major losses related to the withdrawal from selected eastern markets were accounted for already in 2022 and only minor valuation adjustments and translation differences are expected to be recognized in the profit and loss during 2023 following the divestments. The translation differences will be accounted for as part of the losses on divestments  but the reclassification will not impact the amount of total equity.The operating environment in the west has been more stable  however  changes in demand  development in market prices  inflation and rising interest rates impacted financial development and generated uncertainty. In addition  rising interest rates have impacted investment activities and particularly financing opportunities. The M&A market has slowed down due to limited financing opportunities and differing views on valuations among other things. Volatile exchange rates also reflect the high inflation  which varies from one area to another causing fluctuations in demand.Aspo continues its business operations in Ukraine despite of the war. The market conditions are  however  demanding with no significant improvement in sight in the short term. Aspo continues to operate in selected Central Asian countries including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.ESL Shipping’s all operations were discontinued in Russia in 2022 and the whole fleet capacity operates now in the western markets. Telko has sold its Russian subsidiary to GK Himik in the second quarter of 2023. Telko is in the process of winding-down its operations in Belarus. The sales and exit processes of Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan are ongoing and they are expected to be completed in the near future. Local governmental decision-making has postponed closing of the transaction.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 1-6/2023 Share 1-6/2022 Share 1-12/2022 Share MEUR % MEUR % MEUR % Finland 49.1 37.0 55.6 40.8 224.4 40.0 Scandinavian countries 38.5 29.0 32.3 23.7 137.6 24.5 Baltic countries 16.7 12.6 17.5 12.8 67.8 12.1 Other European countries 19.1 14.4 22.5 16.5 89.6 16.0 Other countries 9.2 6.8 8.3 6.1 41.3 7.4 Total 132.6 100 136.2 100 560.7 100From the beginning of year 2023  following the shift of the strategic focus towards western markets  Aspo changed the market areas when reporting net sales. The new reportable market areas are: Finland  Scandinavian countries  Baltic countries  Other European countries and Other countries. The acquisition of Kobia has significantly increased the contribution of Scandinavia to the Group’s total net sales.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s net cash flow from operating activities in January–June was EUR 18.7 (34.3) million. The cash flow of all businesses was positive  and the decrease compared to the comparative period came from the segment ESL Shipping. The cash flow impact of change in working capital was limited to EUR 0.8 (2.3) million. The positive cash impact is caused by the decrease in inventories which was partly offset by increased accounts receivables.The free cash flow in January–June was EUR 15.0 (27.6) million. Investments amounted to EUR 5.9 (8.2) million and consisted mainly of the ESL Shipping segment’s Green Coaster advance payments. The other items reported in cash flows used in investing activities included EUR 3.9 million cash outflow from the acquisitions of Eltrex  EUR 10.1 million cash inflow from the sale of Kobia’s properties in Sweden  EUR 4.4 million cash outflow from the sale of Telko’s subsidiary in Russia and other cash inflow of EUR 0.4 million.6/2023 6/2022 12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 188.1 192.8 189.2 Cash and cash equivalents  Group total 25.9 47.6 33.5 Net interest-bearing debt 162.2 145.2 155.7Net interest-bearing debt was EUR 162.2 (155.7) million and gearing increased to 114.6% (108.4%).

Current interest-bearing liabilities have increased  and non-current interest-bearing liabilities decreased as part of the non-current loans will fall due within the next twelve months. Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program also remained fully unused.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsAspo and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks and uncertainties. The most important risks and Aspo’s actions to mitigate these are summarized and reported to Aspo's Board of Directors through its Audit Committee.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes significant geopolitical uncertainties. It affects the general economic environment  including inflation  energy and raw material prices  interest rates  and consumers’ trust.The ongoing process to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets has and will change the Group’s structure significantly and will affect the revenue model of Aspo’s businesses. There are risks that the withdrawal from selected markets cause additional costs or losses  and that funds cannot be transferred from the markets or that the withdrawal is unsuccessful in full or in part. It is also possible that the official approvals required for the withdrawal from the markets are not obtained. As the money from the disposal of Telko Russia has been received these risks are now limited to Leipurin’s eastern operations.Overall economic development and energy price development cause changes in demand and price volatility of plastic and chemical based raw materials. Subsequently these will have an impact on the financial performance of Telko  who does though benefit from a focus on more technical products  wide product mix  and scalability of operations.Overall economic development and specific demand and production volumes in key industries  especially metal and forest products  impact the demand of shipping. In this respect  ESL Shipping benefits from long-term industrial partnerships and a general deficit of all year-round vessel capacity in the Baltic Sea area.In line with its strategy  Aspo aims to increase its profit-making ability through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial resources and consequently may reduce solvency. With its strategy  Aspo aims to reduce the impact of the possibly weakening general economic development on Aspo’s profit-making ability.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they involve significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESSESESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk sea transport company operating in the Baltic Sea area. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 42 vessels with a total capacity of 438 000 deadweight tons (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (78% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 17 vessels (20%) were time chartered.ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly and energy efficiently secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service.4-6/2023 4-6/2022 Change % 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 44.0 60.3 -27 96.7 117.1 -17 Operating profit  MEUR 3.3 9.0 -63 9.3 18.2 -49 Operating profit  % 7.5 14.9 9.6 15.5 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 0.0 -0.2 0.0 1.1 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 3.3 9.2 -64 9.3 17.1 -46 Comparable operating profit  % 7.5 15.3 9.6 14.6In the second quarter ESL Shipping’s net sales decreased significantly by 27% from the previous year to EUR 44.0 (60.3) million. The comparable operating profit for the quarter decreased by almost two thirds to EUR 3.3 (9.2) million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 7.5% (15.3%). The unsatisfactory financial development resulted from significantly weakened freight market conditions especially with the shipping company’s supramax-class vessels becoming lossmaking in Q2 and weaker spot market rates for all other vessel sizes. The second quarter is typically weakened by seasonal maintenance breaks at certain major clients and periodical docking of vessels. During the quarter  energy consumption and fuel costs increased due to heavier than usual ice conditions in April. Resulting from lower overall market activity and smaller capacity  cargo volumes transported by ESL Shipping decreased from the comparative period to 3.0 (3.3) million tons. The overall freight market activity in Scandinavia and Continental Europe slowed down significantly compared to the previous year.ESL Shipping’s handysize vessels had slightly lower than expected volume demand from long term partnership industries during the second quarter of 2023. To find a better supply and demand balance  one handysize vessel was time-chartered out during the second quarter. Energy shipping markets were depressed due to prevailing high stock levels after the warm winter season in Europe. Share of energy coal returned to a clearly decreasing trend  being approximately 5 % of transported volumes. The financial performance of the handysize segment suffered during Q2 from dockings of vessels. In addition  some key clients rearranged their sourcing of raw materials  which temporarily weakened ESL Shipping’s transportation volumes.Coaster vessel volumes remained at satisfactory levels despite capacity constraints. Both steel and forest industry contract volumes turned out close to forecasted levels. The result was negatively affected by higher time-charter unit costs than during the comparative period.During the second quarter  the prices of diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as ship fuels continued to decrease from the previous quarter. Ship fuel prices have almost halved from the extreme heights experienced during the comparative period last year and this had a 4 7 million euros negative impact on net sales during the second quarter due to lower fuel surcharges. Energy price fluctuations are managed through neutral fuel clauses in long-term transportation agreements.The newbuilding project of ESL Shipping’s Swedish subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping AB at the Chowgule & Company Private Limited shipyard in India proceeded as planned during the second quarter. A total of six vessels are already under construction and the first vessel in the series  Electramar  was successfully launched in June and is expected to be delivered during fall 2023. Every other vessel in the series of 12 next-generation electric hybrid vessels will be sold  as announced earlier  to the company established by the pooling investor group.During the second quarter four vessels were docked for 44 (45) days. Compared to the second quarter in previous year when mostly smaller coaster vessels were docked  maintained vessels were mainly larger and more profitable handy size vessel units and therefore operating result for the second quarter in 2023 was negatively affected.The net sales of ESL Shipping in January–June decreased by 17 % from the comparative period  amounting to EUR 96.7 (117.1) million. The comparable operating profit decreased to EUR 9.3 (17.1) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 9.6% (14.6%).ESL Shipping outlook for 2023ESL Shipping’s main markets in the Northern Baltic Sea  Scandinavia and Continental Europe are expected to suffer from a low level of industrial activity throughout the summer season. Typically  the dry bulk market activity picks up again during the second half of the year and especially in the autumn together with increased agriproduct volume demand from new harvest and increased demand from the energy industry.ESL Shipping’s long-term partners in the steel industry are expected to have fairly stable  albeit lower than in the previous year  volumes for the remaining part of the year. Steel demand in Europe has weakened especially in the construction industry and ESL Shipping’s steel industry clients are prepared to further adjust their production if needed. In the forest industry  pulp delivery volumes are looking less positive than in the early part of the year due to high stock levels. Resulting from present difficulties in European construction industries  sawn goods demand is likely to be lower than earlier expected  despite the fact that production capacity of our main customers is increasing.Most of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements with the exception of the supramax vessels  which operate more or less purely on the spot market.The availability of vessel capacity suitable for round-the-year operations in the Baltic Sea remains tight due to the ageing fleet. The high price expectations of the lessors of the time-chartered vessels may cause further uncertainties in the availability and pricing of a suitable tonnage.The shipping company’s investments in energy-efficient vessels will strengthen its competitiveness and market position in the future. ESL Shipping is finalizing development of a completely fossil-free sea transportation ecosystem in cooperation with its key partners and customers.During the remaining part of 2023  the two most profitable larger and two smaller vessels will be docked for a total of approximately 50 days  and consequently  result in Q3 will be negatively affected.The green transition is expected to substantially enlarge ESL Shipping’s market  and as informed in a separate stock exchange release on 26th April  Aspo‘s Board of Directors decided to initiate a review of strategic options to support and accelerate ESL Shipping’s low-carbon growth strategy. The ongoing program is assessing alternative measures  including launch of a second wave investment pool  a possible equity injection in ESL Shipping by a minority shareholder  and the sale of ESL Shipping’s two supramax vessels. The program has progressed according to plan  and first results are expected still during year 2023.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals  and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China.4-6/2023 4-6/2022 Change % 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 54.2 52.9 2 108.5 103.5 5 Operating profit  MEUR -0.1 4.4 -102 2.6 2.4 8 Operating profit  % -0.2 8.3 2.4 2.3 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -1.0 0.5 -1.0 -4.1 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 0.9 3.9 -77 3.6 6.5 -45 Comparable operating profit  % 1.7 7.4 3.3 6.3In the second quarter of 2023  Telko’s net sales increased by 2% to EUR 54.2 (52.9) million and its comparable operating profit decreased to EUR 0.9 (3.9) million. Telko’s comparable operating profit rate was 1.7% (7.4%). The comparable operating profit for the second quarter excludes items affecting comparability of EUR -1.0 million including an inventory write-down related to Russian specific products. There is a high risk that this inventory cannot be sold with positive sales margin  and hence write down to net realizable value was made in the second quarter. Telko’s reported operating profit for the second quarter decreased to EUR -0.1 (4.4) million and the operating profit rate was -0.2% (8.3%).Net sales of the plastics business decreased by 13% during the second quarter  amounting to EUR 24.7 (28.3) million. The main contributor to lower sales was a negative price trend. In general  the second quarter was very challenging in the plastics business due to rapidly declining prices combined with soft demand. Customers focused on further reducing inventory levels and adjusting purchasing to end customer demand. In some product groups prices were up to 40% lower than during the same time in 2022. Due to significant market price decreases average margins were under pressure  especially for volume plastics where oversupply was evident. Increasing imports to Europe due to changes in the sea freight market  including improved availability and collapsing freight prices  was one of the drivers for the rapid price decline in standard products. Despite the challenging market environment Telko was active in business development and gained new customers.Net sales of the chemicals business increased by 37% during the second quarter  amounting to EUR 16.7 (12.2) million. The recently acquired Polish distributor Eltrex contributed EUR 2.5 million to net sales during the quarter. The integration of Eltrex has started successfully and first sales synergies have been realized. Demand remained relatively healthy in the main markets during the second quarter  however  but started to slow down slightly during the quarter. Prices continued to decline in many product lines  but the development was quite balanced  still making margin management more challenging.Net sales of the lubricants business increased by 3% to EUR 12.8 (12.4) million. All business lines developed positively. The good development in Industrial lubricants continued and resulted in sales volume growth. In Automotive lubricants sales development was good in all markets and strongest in the Scandinavian market. Telko continued to strengthen its position in Marine Lubricants. During the second quarter the pressure on prices increased in all lubricant segments  but the impact was strongest in Automotive lubricants. Margin development in lubricants remained relatively flat.Telko’s net sales increased by 5% during January–June to EUR 108.5 (103.5) million  primarily driven by acquisitions. Telko’s comparable operating profit for the first half of the year was EUR 3.6 (6.5) million  and its comparable operating profit rate was 3.3% (6.3%). Telko’s operating profit was at EUR 2.6 (2.4) million for January-June 2023 and the operating profit rate was 2.4% (2.3%).Telko outlook for 2023Telko has faced significant changes in its business environment during the last year. Despite all the changes  the core of Telko´s strategy has remained and will remain the same. As a leading expert serving multiple industries  Telko is in a unique position to create value by improving its customers’ sustainability  productivity  and operational quality. Telko´s growth efforts will increasingly be focused on Europe  but the main components of the company´s value proposition will remain the same.In general  the business outlook in the European market looks weaker than a year ago. Telko serves industrial customers in various industries. The possible changes in demand will be softened by the heterogenic cyclicality of the diversified customer base  and hence Telko’s business is expected to remain fairly resilient to changes in overall market development.In plastics  overall market conditions will remain challenging for the coming months  as customer demand does not indicate recovery at present. Prices reached historically low levels in many product groups  and we expect them to stabilize during Q3. Sales margins are expected to recover as a result of more stable price development. Despite the challenging market environment  Telko expects to continue gaining market share in the main markets.In chemicals  the demand is expected to soften slightly during the second half of the year in key markets. Price erosion is expected to continue  but in a controlled way. The Baltics will face the biggest drop in demand  Finland and Scandinavia are expected to develop quite favorably. The integration of the recently acquired Eltrex will continue.It is expected that for lubricants demand will remain relatively stable during the second half of the year. A possible slower economic development might have an adverse impact on demand for lubricants. Market prices are expected to decline slightly. Telko expects to continue growing its market share in high performance lubricants  metal working fluids and marine lubricants.The recent acquisitions have proved to be successful  and they have had a positive impact on the existing businesses. Telko aims to accelerate its growth through acquisitions to achieve its strategic goals in all three business segments. Telko will also seek to strengthen its market share in existing markets through organic growth.In order to secure good profitability  Telko will further strengthen its cost efficiency and continue developing its operating model towards better scalability and flexibility. Good inventory control and capital efficiency will continue to be a high priority for Telko. The asset-light business model of Telko enables better ability to utilize new business opportunities and to react to changes in the business environment.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  sourcing raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies  and supplying them through its effective logistics chain to serve customer needs. With operations in six countries including Finland  Sweden  the Baltic countries  and Ukraine  Leipurin serves bakeries  the food industry  and food service customers by providing raw materials  supporting research & development  recipes  and innovations for new products. Leipurin offers also various supplies and machines for the same customer segments  partnering with leading international manufacturers for its raw material and machinery supply.4-6/2023 4-6/2022 Change % 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 34.4 23.0 50 69.0 44.4 55 Operating profit  MEUR 1.4 -0.3 2.6 -1.1 Operating profit  % 4.1 -1.3 3.8 -2.5 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 0.3 -0.3 0.5 -1.2 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.1 0.0 2.1 0.1 2000 Comparable operating profit  % 3.2 0.0 3.0 0.2Leipurin’s net sales increased by 50% during the second quarter to EUR 34.4 (23.0) million. In Finland net sales increased by 8% to EUR 12.6 (11.7) million. In the Baltic countries  net sales decreased by 4% to EUR 9.1 (9.5) million. Net sales in Ukraine decreased by 50% to EUR 0.1 (0.2) million. Sweden was established as a new business unit as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on September 1  2022  and it contributed with EUR 12.6 million and approximately 37% of Leipurin’s net sales in the second quarter of 2023. Net sales of the comparative period included EUR 1.7 million net sales of the divested Vulganus Oy. During the second quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 61% to EUR 24.9 (15.5) million  driven by the Kobia acquisition. Sales to the food industry increased by 7% to EUR 3.1 (2.9) million.Increasing raw material prices in global markets continued to drive Leipurin’s sales growth during the second quarter. Measured in kilo volume  the decline in sales continued in Finland  Sweden and the Baltic countries  although it slowed down significantly towards the end of the quarter. In the case of Leipurin  the volume decrease has been predominantly in the low-margin commodity items  resulting in an improved product mix  and hence the positive development in gross profits continued even at slightly lower total volumes.The comparable operating profit for the second quarter stood at EUR 1.1 (0.0) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 3.2% (0.0%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR 0.3 (-0.3) million  included the sales gain related to the sale and leaseback transaction of Kobia’s properties in Hässleholm and Tyresö. The comparative period was mainly affected by items related to the divestment of Vulganus. Leipurin’s operating profit for the second quarter was EUR 1.4 (-0.3) million and operating profit rate 4.1% (-1.3%).In January–June  Leipurin’s net sales increased by 55% to EUR 69.0 (44.4) million. Figures for the comparative year included EUR 4.2 million in net sales of the divested Vulganus Oy. Kobia AB’s acquisition contributed to the growth by EUR 25.5 million and its share of Leipurin’s net sales was 37% during the period. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets had a significant impact on the euro-denominated increase in sales particularly in the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter.Leipurin’s comparable operating profit in January–June 2023 was EUR 2.1 (0.1) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 3.0% (0.2%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR 0.5 (-1.2) million  were mainly related to the gain on the sale and leaseback transactions of Kobia’s properties in Sweden. The comparative period was mainly affected by the destroyed warehouse in Ukraine  and items related to the divestment of Vulganus. The operating profit was EUR 2.6 (-1.1) million and operating profit rate 3.8% (-2.5%).Leipurin completed the sale and leaseback of the property in Gothenburg  Sweden during the first quarter  and the properties in Hässleholm and Tyresö  Sweden during the second quarter. These actions generated sales proceeds of EUR 13.6 million  which represents a significant share of the capital that was invested when acquiring Kobia AB. The transactions will not have a significant impact on profitability going forward.Leipurin outlook for 2023Leipurin’s expansion to Sweden through the acquisition of Kobia AB will contribute to annual net sales by roughly EUR 50 million and generate considerable synergy benefits in product range development  supply chain  and procurement. It also enables partners to be served in a wider geographic area. The integration of operations and synergy capture have progressed according to plan.Decreased consumer purchasing power may continue to have a negative impact on demand especially for artisan bakeries  as consumers shift towards more affordable products. The sharpest effects of the consumer prices shock of late 2022 and early 2023 seem though to be flattening out on the food market  and some commodity prices have also declined. The outcome of the crop year in September typically sets the general direction of food raw material prices  which is expected to be rather down than up. Such development will put emphasis on efficient inventory management.The rapid inflation has decelerated considerably  but volatility across raw material categories will continue on a high level. The market is expected to be significantly more stable in the second half of the year than during the past 12 months.Volumes in the food market have generally declined starting in the second half of 2022 and continuing this year. This development has been prevalent not only in Leipurin’s markets and countries  but across food markets in Europe  presumably due to the consumer price shock caused by inflation  energy prices and interest rates. The market volume decline compared to the previous year is expected to flatten out during the second half of 2023.Leipurin has now completed the core parts of the reorganization and will continue to work on the Group and country-level strategies in Q3. Management sees clear opportunities for organic growth as well as efficiency improvements in the countries. To strengthen growth and company positioning  Leipurin evaluates possible acquisition opportunities  as well as opportunities to further strengthen business focus by divesting or discontinuing some non-core  low-profitability parts of the business. The impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on the global supply chains  the availability of certain raw materials  general delivery times and especially on market development and demand in Ukraine will continue  but with a reduced effect on Leipurin’s business.Management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges keep the risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among small customers at higher level  although such risks have not materially realized for Leipurin.Non-core businessesThe Non-core businesses segment includes Telko Russia and Belarus as well as Kauko GmbH previously reported in the Telko segment  Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan previously reported in the Leipurin segment and ESL Shipping Russia previously reported in the ESL Shipping segment. The Non-core businesses segment was established to separate the results of the non-core businesses of Aspo from the results of the continuing businesses. All the entities in the segment are either held for sale  in the process of being closed down or already divested.Non-core 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 Change % 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 3.8 25.2 -85 9.7 56.8 -83 Operating profit  MEUR -8.0 3.1 -358 -8.1 9.4 -186 Operating profit  % -210.5 12.3 -83.5 16.5 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -8.0 -1.2 -7.7 -1.4 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 0.0 4.3 -100 -0.4 10.8 -104 Comparable operating profit  % 0.0 17.1 -4.1 19.0The net sales of the Non-core businesses segment declined by 85% during the second quarter to EUR 3.8 (25.2) million.

The comparable operating profit was EUR 0.0 (4.3) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 0.0% (17.1%). The Leipurin entities contributed positively to the comparable operating profit  but the Telko entities were loss making leading to the zero comparable operating profit of the segment. The operating profit of the Non-core businesses was EUR -8.0 (3.1) million. The operating profit included EUR -8.0 (-1.2) million of items affecting comparability  which were caused by the sale of Telko’s subsidiary in Russia EUR -7.4 million  the write down of Telko Russia’s inventory EUR -1.7 million and EUR 1.1 million of valuation adjustments relating to the other eastern businesses held for sale due to their decreased net assets.The divestment of Telko’s Russian subsidiary was completed during the second quarter. The company was sold to the Russian industrial operator GK Himik. The received sales price was EUR 5.7 million. The money received corresponded materially to the remaining value of the company in Aspo Group considering the impairment losses recognized already in 2022 and the valuation adjustments done in 2023. The loss on sale was EUR -7.4 million  including accumulated translation differences of EUR -8.6 million that were reclassified from the translation reserve in equity to other operating expenses in the profit and loss. The sales loss is reported in Non-core business segment as an item affecting comparability. In Aspo Group the sales loss is presented in the result from discontinued operations.In January–June  the net sales of the Non-core businesses segment decreased by 83% to EUR 9.7 (56.8) million. The comparable operating profit in January–June 2023 was EUR -0.4 (10.8) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was -4.1% (19.0%).

The operating profit of the quarter was EUR -1.8 (-1.4) million. An item affecting comparability of EUR -0.1 million is reported in the second quarter and it relates to corporate restructuring.In January-June the comparable operating profit of other operations was EUR -3.0 (-3.3) million and the operating profit was EUR -3.1 (-3.8). The improved profitability derives from some restructuring activities at Aspo Group level. In 2022  items affecting comparability of EUR -0.5 million were related to the additional share-based remuneration granted to Aspo’s previous CEO.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

As of the beginning of the financial year  Aspo applies certain new or amended IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations as described in the 2022 consolidated financial statements. In other respects  the same accounting and measurement principles have been applied as in the 2022 consolidated financial statements. The information in this half-year report is unaudited.Aspo Plc applies the guidance on alternative key figures issued by ESMA. In addition to IFRS figures  the company releases other commonly used key figures  which are mainly derived from the statement of comprehensive income and balance sheet. According to the management  key figures clarify the view drawn by the statement of comprehensive income and balance sheet of Aspo’s financial performance and financial position. The calculation principles of key figures are explained on page 64 of Aspo’s Year 2022 publication.PersonnelAt the end of the review period  Aspo Group had 827 employees (886 at the end of 2022)  of which discontinued operations accounted for 81 (130) employees.Segment informationAspo Group’s reportable segments are ESL Shipping  Telko  Leipurin and Non-core businesses.From the beginning of year 2023 Aspo has reported the eastern businesses held for sale in a new segment called Non-core businesses and at the same time  Aspo has classified the new segment as discontinued operations. The comparative figures have been restated for all segments impacted by this financial reporting restructuring.The Non-core businesses segment includes Telko Russia and Belarus as well as Kauko GmbH previously reported in the Telko segment  Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan previously reported in the Leipurin segment as well as ESL Shipping Russia previously reported in the ESL Shipping segment. The Non-core businesses segment was established to separate the results of the non-core businesses of Aspo from the results of the continuing businesses. All the entities in the segment are either held for sale  in the process of being closed down or already divested.Reconciliation of segment operating profit to the Group's profit before taxes 1-6/2023 ESL ShippingTelko Leipurin Unallocated Group MEUR items total Operating profit 9.3 2.6 2.6 -3.1 11.4 Net financial expenses -4.1 -4.1 Profit before taxes 7.3 1-6/2022 ESL ShippingTelko Leipurin Unallocated Group MEUR items total Operating profit 18.2 2.4 -1.2 -3.7 15.7 Net financial expenses -2.1 -2.1 Profit before taxes 13.6Discontinued operations and other non-current assets and disposal groups held for saleThe Non-core businesses segment established in the beginning of the year has been classified as discontinued operations in accordance with the IFRS 5 standard. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures for the comparative periods have been restated. In the comparative periods the discontinued operations also include the figures of Kauko Oy  which was divested on October 31  2022.The divestment of Telko’s Russian subsidiary was completed during the second quarter. The company was sold to the Russian industrial operator GK Himik. The sales price received was EUR 5.7 million which materially corresponded to the carrying value of the divested company's net assets considering the impairment losses recognized already in 2022 and the valuation adjustments done in 2023. The loss on divestment was EUR -7.4 million  including accumulated translation differences of EUR -8.6 million that were reclassified from the translation reserve in equity to other operating expenses in profit and loss. The costs to sell amounted to EUR -0.6 million.Profit from discontinued operations 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales 3.8 29.1 9.7 62.9 91.9 Other operating income 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.3 Materials and services -5.7 -21.8 -8.2 -46.5 -77.6 Employee benefit expenses -0.6 -2.6 -1.5 -4.5 -7.1 Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 0.1 -1.3 0.2 -1.4 -3.1 Depreciation  leased assets -0.1 -0.2 -0.1 -0.3 -1.5 Other operating expenses -5.5 -1.3 -8.2 -2.3 -10.1 Operating profit -8.0 1.9 -8.1 8.0 -7.2 Financial income and expenses 0.7 -2.1 1.7 -2.8 -0.4 Profit before taxes -7.3 -0.2 -6.4 5.2 -7.6 Income taxes 0.1 -0.2 0.0 -1.4 -2.5 Profit for the period -7.2 -0.4 -6.4 3.8 -10.1Net cash flows of discontinued operations 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR Net cash inflow from operating activities 0.5 26.8 31.7 Net cash inflowithoutflow(-) from investing activities -4.3 0.0 -1.0 Net cash inflowithoutflow(-) from financing activities -0.3 -1.8 -2.1 Net change in cash generated by the discontinued operations-4.1 25.0 28.6Net cash flows of discontinued operations consist of the Non-core businesses segment’s share of Aspo Group’s cash flows. In the comparison periods the figures also include Kauko Oy’s cash flows.The cash flow from the sale of Telko’s subsidiary in Russia was EUR -4.4 million and it is presented in the cash flow from investing activities. The cash received as purchase consideration was EUR 5.7 million and the divested company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 10.1 million.In 2022  the cash flow from the divestment of Kauko Oy EUR -1.0 million is included in the cash flow from investing activities. The cost to sell Kauko of EUR -0.4 million is presented in the cash flow from operating activities. The cash flow from financing mainly consisted of repayments of Kauko Oy’s interest-bearing loans in 2022.Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale 6/2023 6/2022 12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR Assets of discontinued operations 4.1 3.8 12.4 Assets classified as held for sale  total 4.1 3.8 12.4 Liabilities of discontinued operations 1.2 2.8 3.9 Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale  total1.2 2.8 3.9At the end of the second quarter 2023 and at the end of year 2022 assets and liabilities of discontinued operations include the assets and liabilities of the Non-core businesses segment. In the comparative period 6/2022 they include the assets and liabilities of Kauko operating segment.The assets and businesses held for sale are measured at fair value less cost to sell. On divestment  the accumulated translation differences of foreign subsidiaries are recognized as part of the sales gain or loss. At the end of the second quarter  the translation differences of the eastern businesses held for sale amounted to EUR -5.4 million. The translation differences fluctuate according to changes in exchange rates. The reclassification of the translation differences from the translation difference reserve to the profit and loss has no impact on Aspo Group’s total equity.Restricted cash and cash equivalentsIn Russia  Aspo Group has EUR 3.4 million in cash and cash equivalents  the use of which is strictly restricted by the Russian Government and controlled by the banks. The value of these cash and cash equivalents in the Group balance sheet is EUR 3.3 million  as impairments of EUR 0.1 million have been recognized on them. Cash and cash equivalents in Russia are presented under assets held for sale on the balance sheet. In the first half of 2023 it was still possible to receive dividend payments and make commercial payments with Russian entities. Also  during the second quarter Aspo received the payment of EUR 5.7 million for the sale of Telko Russia. According to our understanding and experience  the sales price of the Leipurin entities classified as held for sale is also expected to be received in conjunction with the sale of the entities. However  there is a risk that the Group does not have access to the cash and cash equivalents in full in Russia  and therefore they are considered restricted in accordance with IAS 7.Acquisition of EltrexOn January 31  Telko acquired Eltrex  a Polish distributor of specialty chemicals and industrial packaging materials  with net sales of approximately EUR 8 million and operating profit slightly less than EUR 1.0 million in 2022.The estimated total consideration of EUR 4.9 million will be paid fully in cash  and EUR 3.9 million has already been paid. The rest of the consideration will be paid in the years 2024 and 2025 based on the earn-out clause of the purchase agreement. The assets and liabilities of the acquired company were measured at fair value on the acquisition date. A fair value adjustment of EUR 3.1 million was made on intangible assets based on customer relationships  non-compete clauses and trademarks  and the fair value adjustment relating to inventories was EUR 0.1 million. The deferred tax liability arising from the fair value adjustments was EUR 0.6 million. The carrying amount of the other acquired assets and liabilities corresponded to their fair values. A goodwill balance of EUR 1.3 million was recognized from the acquisition. The acquisition-related costs of approximately EUR 0.4 million were recognized in the Telko segment’s other operating expenses.Preliminary acquisition calculation of Eltrex 6/2023 MEUR Consideration Paid in cash 4.9 Total consideration 4.9 Assets acquired and liabilities assumed  fair value Intangible assets 3.4 Leased assets 0.6 Inventories 1.4 Accounts receivable and other receivables 1.1 Total assets 6.5 Interest bearing liabilities 1.3 Accounts payable and other liabilities 1.0 Deferred tax liability 0.6 Total liabilities 2.9 Net assets acquired 3.6 Goodwill 1.3Aspo Group disaggregation of net sales  from continuing operationsTelko net sales 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 Change 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 Change 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR % MEUR MEUR % MEUR Business area: Plastics business 24.7 28.3 -12.7 51.3 55.5 -7.6 110.1 Chemicals business 16.7 12.2 36.9 31.8 24.3 30.9 49.2 Lubricants business 12.8 12.4 3.2 25.4 23.7 7.2 50.1 Telko total 54.2 52.9 2.5 108.5 103.5 4.8 209.4Leipurin net sales 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 Change 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 Change 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR % MEUR MEUR % MEUR Regions: Finland 12.6 11.7 7.7 24.5 22.1 10.9 46.6 Sweden 12.6 25.6 17.3 Baltics 9.1 9.5 -4.2 18.5 17.4 6.3 36.8 Ukraine 0.1 0.2 -50.0 0.4 0.7 -42.9 0.9 Total 34.4 21.4 60.7 69.0 40.2 71.6 101.6of which: Bakeries 24.9 15.5 60.6 50.6 29.8 69.8 74.9 Food Industry 3.1 2.9 6.9 6.0 5.2 15.4 11.8 Retail  foodservice  other 6.4 2.9 120.7 12.4 5.2 138.5 14.9 Vulganus 1.7 -100.0 4.2 -100.0 4.3 Leipurin total 34.4 23.0 49.6 69.0 44.4 55.4 105.9Net sales by timing of revenue recognition4-6/2023 4-6/2022 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping At a point in time 0.0 0.9 0.1 1.9 3.5 Over time 44.0 59.4 96.6 115.2 241.9 44.0 60.3 96.7 117.1 245.4 Telko At a point in time 54.1 52.8 108.3 103.3 209.0 Over time 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.4 54.2 52.9 108.5 103.5 209.4 Leipurin At a point in time 34.4 21.6 69.0 41.1 102.6 Over time 0.0 1.4 0.0 3.3 3.3 34.4 23.0 69.0 44.4 105.9 Total At a point in time 88.5 75.3 177.4 146.3 315.1 Over time 44.1 60.9 96.8 118.7 245.6 132.6 136.2 274.2 265.0 560.7 Net sales by market area 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping Finland 24.4 28.5 46.7 56.1 121.5 Scandinavian countries 12.4 15.3 27.2 28.3 58.5 Baltic countries 0.1 1.3 0.4 1.9 2.9 Other European countries 6.3 13.1 15.1 25.4 48.2 Other countries 0.8 2.1 7.3 5.4 14.3 44.0 60.3 96.7 117.1 245.4 Telko Finland 12.1 14.2 25.6 27.9 53.5 Scandinavian countries 13.7 16.9 27.5 32.2 61.7 Baltic countries 7.5 7.0 14.8 13.9 28.3 Other European countries 12.5 8.7 22.6 18.9 39.0 Other countries 8.4 6.1 18.0 10.6 26.9 54.2 52.9 108.5 103.5 209.4 Leipurin Finland 12.6 12.9 24.5 24.9 49.4 Scandinavian countries 12.4 0.1 25.2 0.4 17.4 Baltic countries 9.1 9.2 18.5 17.3 36.6 Other European countries 0.3 0.7 0.8 1.7 2.4 Other countries 0.0 0.1 0.0 0.1 0.1 34.4 23.0 69.0 44.4 105.9 Total Finland 49.1 55.6 96.8 108.9 224.4 Scandinavian countries 38.5 32.3 79.9 60.9 137.6 Baltic countries 16.7 17.5 33.7 33.1 67.8 Other European countries 19.1 22.5 38.5 46.0 89.6 Other countries 9.2 8.3 25.3 16.1 41.3 132.6 136.2 274.2 265.0 560.7Investments by segment ESL ShippingTelko Leipurin Non-core Group MEUR businesses total Investments 1-6/2023 5.4 0.5 5.9 Investments 1-6/2022 7.8 0.3 0.1 8.2Green Coaster investment commitmentAtoBatC Shipping AB  reported in the ESL Shipping segment  is building a series of six highly energy-efficient electric hybrid vessels.

This was evident especially for Telko and ESL Shipping  whereas Leipurin experienced limited impact. Aspo’s net sales from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2023 decreased by 3% to EUR 132.6 (136.2) million. Telko and Leipurin showed growth  whereas ESL Shipping’s sales decreased due to softening demand and decline in fuel prices. Aspo’s comparable operating profit from continuing operations amounted to EUR 3.6 (11.7) million. Leipurin significantly improved its profitability  whereas ESL Shipping and Telko showed a clear decline.ESL Shipping suffered from weakened demand  especially in the spot market which had strong negative impact on the profitability of the two supramax vessels. In addition  pricing of time charted vessels  dockings and specific supply chain conditions had a negative impact on the financial performance of ESL shipping.Telko suffered from declining prices combined with soft demand in plastics. In addition  profitability was weakened by increased competing imports from Asia due to lower freight prices and lower domestic demand in Asia. Development in chemicals and especially lubricants was more positive.The financial development of Leipurin remained on a positive path. The acquisition of Kobia has proven to be successful in terms of synergy potential  and in particular after the sale and lease back of the three Swedish properties with a total sales price of approximately EUR 13.6 million  which represents a substantial share of the purchase price of Kobia. Also  the ongoing development actions in Leipurin  covering the leadership model as well as commercial and supply chain activities have started to deliver results.Sustainability KPIs have shown fairly flat development during year 2023 compared with last year. This includes emission intensity  employee safety  and employee satisfaction. We are working hard at Aspo to achieve the set sustainability targets for the year 2023.Aspo continues to execute its strategy. The war in Ukraine and exits of selected Eastern markets have caused a decline in Aspo’s net sales and profitability. The Russian exits are almost completed  which frees-up resources to pursue Aspo’s western focused strategy. As key priorities we are evaluating measures for accelerating ESL Shipping’s low-carbon growth strategy which will also decrease Aspo’s capex burden into ESL Shipping and free up capital to be invested into the other businesses of Aspo  including acquisitions of Telko and investments to grow the profitability of Leipurin. In addition  we continue to search for acquisition opportunities to achieve growth  while simultaneously enhancing cost efficiency in the current operations. All of these activities are executed systematically to support strong performance in any business environment.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsAspo's long-term financial targets are:Annual increase in net sales: 5–10% a yearOperating profit: 8%Return on equity: more than 20%Gearing: less than 130%On a business level  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%. The operating profit rate targets are evaluated against the comparable operating profit rate of Aspo Group and its businesses.In the second quarter of 2023  Aspo’s net sales from continuing operations decreased by 3% to EUR 132.6 (136.2) million. The comparable operating profit rate of the continuing operations was 2.7% (8.6%). Return on equity was 2.2% (23.4%) and gearing stood at 114.6% (108.4%). ROE was on modest level especially due to the loss from discontinued operations resulting mainly from the reclassification of translation differences with no impact on Group total equity.Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is calculated by adjusting the reported operating profit with rare and material items affecting the operating profit. These may include impairment losses  sales gains and losses from divested businesses and non-current assets  as well as financial losses caused by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine.Restructuring of the financial reportingTo provide a more transparent and clear view of its businesses  Aspo established a new reportable segment called Non-core businesses in the beginning of year 2023. The Non-core businesses segment includes Telko Russia and Belarus as well as Kauko GmbH previously reported in the Telko segment  Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan previously reported in the Leipurin segment  ESL Shipping Russia previously reported in the ESL Shipping segment. The Non-core businesses segment was established to separate the results of the on-core businesses of Aspo from the results of the continuing businesses. All the entities in the segment are either held for sale or in the process of being closed down or already divested. Thus  the Non-core businesses segment is reported as discontinued operations. The comparative figures of all segments and Aspo Group have been restated according to the new reporting structure. In the comparative periods of 2022  the result of the discontinued operations also includes the operative result and divestment loss of Kauko Oy  which was divested on October 31  2022. Thus  the results of Kauko and the Non-core businesses segment  which make up the result of the discontinued operations  are presented separately from the results of Aspo Group’s continuing operations  but the result of the discontinued operations is included in the presented “Group total” figures including the measure comparable operating profit  Group total.Net sales and operating profit rate  Group total 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales  Group total 136.4 165.3 283.9 327.9 652.6 Net sales  continuing operations 132.6 136.2 274.2 265.0 560.7 Net sales  discontinued operations 3.8 29.1 9.7 62.9 91.9 Operating profit  Group total -5.2 13.6 3.3 23.7 31.2 Operating profit  Group total  % -3.8 8.2 1.2 7.2 4.8 Items affecting comparability -8.8 -2.4 -8.3 -7.3 -24.1 Comparable operating profit  Group total 3.6 16.0 11.6 31.0 55.3 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 2.6 9.7 4.1 9.5 8.5 Operating profit and comparable operating profit  Group total 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping  operating profit 3.3 9.0 9.3 18.2 38.2 Telko  operating profit -0.1 4.4 2.6 2.4 8.2 Leipurin  operating profit 1.4 -0.3 2.6 -1.1 -1.4 Other operations  operating profit -1.8 -1.4 -3.1 -3.8 -6.6 Operating profit from continuing operations 2.8 11.7 11.4 15.7 38.4 Operating profit from discontinued operations -8.0 1.9 -8.1 8.0 -7.2 Operating profit  Group total -5.2 13.6 3.3 23.7 31.2 Items affecting comparability -8.8 -2.4 -8.3 -7.3 -24.1 Comparable operating profit  Group total 3.6 16.0 11.6 31.0 55.3Items affecting comparability 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping 0.0 -0.2 0.0 1.1 0.8 Telko -1.0 0.5 -1.0 -4.1 -3.1 Leipurin 0.3 -0.3 0.5 -1.2 -2.5 Other operations -0.1 0.0 -0.1 -0.5 -0.7 Continuing operations  total -0.8 0.0 -0.6 -4.7 -5.5 Discontinued operations -8.0 -2.4 -7.7 -2.6 -18.6 Total -8.8 -2.4 -8.3 -7.3 -24.1In the second quarter of 2023  items affecting comparability were EUR -8.8 million in total.

EUR -0.2 million reported for ESL Shipping related to an accrual for a legal claim. EUR 0.5 million reported in the Telko segment was an adjustment to the bad debt allowance in Ukraine. EUR -0.3 million reported for Leipurin consisted of the divestment loss of Vulganus of EUR -0.4 million and an adjustment of the bad debt allowance in Ukraine of EUR 0.1 million. EUR -2.4 million reported in discontinued operations included EUR -1.2 million of costs related to restructuring of Russia-related operations in the Non-core businesses segment and an impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million on Kauko’s goodwill.In January-June 2023 the items affecting comparability amounted to EUR -8.3 million in total. EUR -1.0 million reported in the Telko segment related to inventory write downs caused by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. EUR 0.5 million reported in Leipurin segment consisted of the gain on the sale and lease back transactions of Kobia’s properties in Sweden.

EUR -2.6 million in losses from the destruction of Telko’s warehouse in Ukraine  and a credit loss provision of EUR -1.5 million associated with Telko’s accounts receivables in Ukraine. EUR -0.7 million in losses from the destruction of Leipurin’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -0.1 million associated with Leipurin’s accounts receivable in Ukraine  and EUR -0.4 million divestment loss of Vulganus. EUR -0.5 million share-based payments granted to Aspo’s previous CEO reported in Other operations. EUR -2.6 million reported in discontinued operations of which EUR -1.3 million was costs related to restructuring of Russia-related operations in the Non-core businesses segment and EUR -1.3 million was an impairment loss on Kauko’s goodwill.In 2022  items affecting comparability totaled EUR -24.1 million  of which EUR -20.7 million resulted from the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo Group’s business operations. Items affecting comparability relating to the Kauko segment totaled EUR -2.5 million. Other items affecting comparability totaled EUR -0.9 million.SustainabilitySustainability is a material factor which guides Aspo’s management system and especially the company’s investments. Aspo’s businesses aim to be forerunners in sustainability in their respective sectors. The key target is to reduce emission intensity  CO2 (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) was 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. According to the green transition in the shipping industry  ESL Shipping is engaged in close and long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation for its key customers in the future. ESL Shipping is investing in twelve new generation electric hybrid vessels  half of which will remain in its own ownership and half will be transferred to the other party of the pooling arrangement. The investment is instrumental in the company’s green transition.During the past 12 months  emission intensity has slightly increased despite the positive development in operational efficiency and the use of new operating models especially by ESL Shipping  and stood at 0.34 (0.33 for the full-year 2022). The slight increase is driven by decrease in net sales as the emissions during the past 12 months have decreased in absolute terms. Specifically for ESL Shipping  emission intensity was impacted also by fleet structure and the difficult ice conditions in the Northern Bay of Bothnia during April. The emission intensity target for the full-year 2023 is 0.36.Another key sustainability focus area of Aspo is employee safety. The Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) slightly increased and was 8.6 (8.1 for the full-year 2022) for the past 12 months. The TRIF target for 2023 is 7.0.Aspo’s employee survey completed in June 2023 resulted in an AA-rating and a people power index of 79  which equals the rating last year  and is clearly above the global industry benchmark (74).Operating environment and the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo’s operationsAspo’s commercial activities in eastern markets have significantly declined since Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and Aspo’s focus has been on full withdrawal from selected eastern markets. Major losses related to the withdrawal from selected eastern markets were accounted for already in 2022 and only minor valuation adjustments and translation differences are expected to be recognized in the profit and loss during 2023 following the divestments. The translation differences will be accounted for as part of the losses on divestments  but the reclassification will not impact the amount of total equity.The operating environment in the west has been more stable  however  changes in demand  development in market prices  inflation and rising interest rates impacted financial development and generated uncertainty. In addition  rising interest rates have impacted investment activities and particularly financing opportunities. The M&A market has slowed down due to limited financing opportunities and differing views on valuations among other things. Volatile exchange rates also reflect the high inflation  which varies from one area to another causing fluctuations in demand.Aspo continues its business operations in Ukraine despite of the war. The market conditions are  however  demanding with no significant improvement in sight in the short term. Aspo continues to operate in selected Central Asian countries including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.ESL Shipping’s all operations were discontinued in Russia in 2022 and the whole fleet capacity operates now in the western markets. Telko has sold its Russian subsidiary to GK Himik in the second quarter of 2023. Telko is in the process of winding-down its operations in Belarus. The sales and exit processes of Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan are ongoing and they are expected to be completed in the near future. Local governmental decision-making has postponed closing of the transaction.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 1-6/2023 Share 1-6/2022 Share 1-12/2022 Share MEUR % MEUR % MEUR % Finland 49.1 37.0 55.6 40.8 224.4 40.0 Scandinavian countries 38.5 29.0 32.3 23.7 137.6 24.5 Baltic countries 16.7 12.6 17.5 12.8 67.8 12.1 Other European countries 19.1 14.4 22.5 16.5 89.6 16.0 Other countries 9.2 6.8 8.3 6.1 41.3 7.4 Total 132.6 100 136.2 100 560.7 100From the beginning of year 2023  following the shift of the strategic focus towards western markets  Aspo changed the market areas when reporting net sales. The new reportable market areas are: Finland  Scandinavian countries  Baltic countries  Other European countries and Other countries. The acquisition of Kobia has significantly increased the contribution of Scandinavia to the Group’s total net sales.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s net cash flow from operating activities in January–June was EUR 18.7 (34.3) million. The cash flow of all businesses was positive  and the decrease compared to the comparative period came from the segment ESL Shipping. The cash flow impact of change in working capital was limited to EUR 0.8 (2.3) million. The positive cash impact is caused by the decrease in inventories which was partly offset by increased accounts receivables.The free cash flow in January–June was EUR 15.0 (27.6) million. Investments amounted to EUR 5.9 (8.2) million and consisted mainly of the ESL Shipping segment’s Green Coaster advance payments. The other items reported in cash flows used in investing activities included EUR 3.9 million cash outflow from the acquisitions of Eltrex  EUR 10.1 million cash inflow from the sale of Kobia’s properties in Sweden  EUR 4.4 million cash outflow from the sale of Telko’s subsidiary in Russia and other cash inflow of EUR 0.4 million.6/2023 6/2022 12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 188.1 192.8 189.2 Cash and cash equivalents  Group total 25.9 47.6 33.5 Net interest-bearing debt 162.2 145.2 155.7Net interest-bearing debt was EUR 162.2 (155.7) million and gearing increased to 114.6% (108.4%).

The average interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  rose strongly and was 4.7% (1.4%)  increasing Aspo’s interest expenses.The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents  Group total stood at EUR 25.9 (33.5) million at the end of the review period  of which cash and cash equivalents related to businesses held for sale were EUR 3.6 (11.8) million.

Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program also remained fully unused.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsAspo and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks and uncertainties. The most important risks and Aspo’s actions to mitigate these are summarized and reported to Aspo's Board of Directors through its Audit Committee.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes significant geopolitical uncertainties. It affects the general economic environment  including inflation  energy and raw material prices  interest rates  and consumers’ trust.The ongoing process to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets has and will change the Group’s structure significantly and will affect the revenue model of Aspo’s businesses. There are risks that the withdrawal from selected markets cause additional costs or losses  and that funds cannot be transferred from the markets or that the withdrawal is unsuccessful in full or in part. It is also possible that the official approvals required for the withdrawal from the markets are not obtained. As the money from the disposal of Telko Russia has been received these risks are now limited to Leipurin’s eastern operations.Overall economic development and energy price development cause changes in demand and price volatility of plastic and chemical based raw materials. Subsequently these will have an impact on the financial performance of Telko  who does though benefit from a focus on more technical products  wide product mix  and scalability of operations.Overall economic development and specific demand and production volumes in key industries  especially metal and forest products  impact the demand of shipping. In this respect  ESL Shipping benefits from long-term industrial partnerships and a general deficit of all year-round vessel capacity in the Baltic Sea area.In line with its strategy  Aspo aims to increase its profit-making ability through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial resources and consequently may reduce solvency. With its strategy  Aspo aims to reduce the impact of the possibly weakening general economic development on Aspo’s profit-making ability.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they involve significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESSESESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk sea transport company operating in the Baltic Sea area. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 42 vessels with a total capacity of 438 000 deadweight tons (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (78% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 17 vessels (20%) were time chartered.ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly and energy efficiently secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service.4-6/2023 4-6/2022 Change % 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 44.0 60.3 -27 96.7 117.1 -17 Operating profit  MEUR 3.3 9.0 -63 9.3 18.2 -49 Operating profit  % 7.5 14.9 9.6 15.5 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 0.0 -0.2 0.0 1.1 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 3.3 9.2 -64 9.3 17.1 -46 Comparable operating profit  % 7.5 15.3 9.6 14.6In the second quarter ESL Shipping’s net sales decreased significantly by 27% from the previous year to EUR 44.0 (60.3) million. The comparable operating profit for the quarter decreased by almost two thirds to EUR 3.3 (9.2) million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 7.5% (15.3%). The unsatisfactory financial development resulted from significantly weakened freight market conditions especially with the shipping company’s supramax-class vessels becoming lossmaking in Q2 and weaker spot market rates for all other vessel sizes. The second quarter is typically weakened by seasonal maintenance breaks at certain major clients and periodical docking of vessels. During the quarter  energy consumption and fuel costs increased due to heavier than usual ice conditions in April. Resulting from lower overall market activity and smaller capacity  cargo volumes transported by ESL Shipping decreased from the comparative period to 3.0 (3.3) million tons. The overall freight market activity in Scandinavia and Continental Europe slowed down significantly compared to the previous year.ESL Shipping’s handysize vessels had slightly lower than expected volume demand from long term partnership industries during the second quarter of 2023. To find a better supply and demand balance  one handysize vessel was time-chartered out during the second quarter. Energy shipping markets were depressed due to prevailing high stock levels after the warm winter season in Europe. Share of energy coal returned to a clearly decreasing trend  being approximately 5 % of transported volumes. The financial performance of the handysize segment suffered during Q2 from dockings of vessels. In addition  some key clients rearranged their sourcing of raw materials  which temporarily weakened ESL Shipping’s transportation volumes.Coaster vessel volumes remained at satisfactory levels despite capacity constraints. Both steel and forest industry contract volumes turned out close to forecasted levels. The result was negatively affected by higher time-charter unit costs than during the comparative period.During the second quarter  the prices of diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as ship fuels continued to decrease from the previous quarter. Ship fuel prices have almost halved from the extreme heights experienced during the comparative period last year and this had a 4 7 million euros negative impact on net sales during the second quarter due to lower fuel surcharges. Energy price fluctuations are managed through neutral fuel clauses in long-term transportation agreements.The newbuilding project of ESL Shipping’s Swedish subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping AB at the Chowgule & Company Private Limited shipyard in India proceeded as planned during the second quarter. A total of six vessels are already under construction and the first vessel in the series  Electramar  was successfully launched in June and is expected to be delivered during fall 2023. Every other vessel in the series of 12 next-generation electric hybrid vessels will be sold  as announced earlier  to the company established by the pooling investor group.During the second quarter four vessels were docked for 44 (45) days. Compared to the second quarter in previous year when mostly smaller coaster vessels were docked  maintained vessels were mainly larger and more profitable handy size vessel units and therefore operating result for the second quarter in 2023 was negatively affected.The net sales of ESL Shipping in January–June decreased by 17 % from the comparative period  amounting to EUR 96.7 (117.1) million. The comparable operating profit decreased to EUR 9.3 (17.1) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 9.6% (14.6%).ESL Shipping outlook for 2023ESL Shipping’s main markets in the Northern Baltic Sea  Scandinavia and Continental Europe are expected to suffer from a low level of industrial activity throughout the summer season. Typically  the dry bulk market activity picks up again during the second half of the year and especially in the autumn together with increased agriproduct volume demand from new harvest and increased demand from the energy industry.ESL Shipping’s long-term partners in the steel industry are expected to have fairly stable  albeit lower than in the previous year  volumes for the remaining part of the year. Steel demand in Europe has weakened especially in the construction industry and ESL Shipping’s steel industry clients are prepared to further adjust their production if needed. In the forest industry  pulp delivery volumes are looking less positive than in the early part of the year due to high stock levels. Resulting from present difficulties in European construction industries  sawn goods demand is likely to be lower than earlier expected  despite the fact that production capacity of our main customers is increasing.Most of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements with the exception of the supramax vessels  which operate more or less purely on the spot market.The availability of vessel capacity suitable for round-the-year operations in the Baltic Sea remains tight due to the ageing fleet. The high price expectations of the lessors of the time-chartered vessels may cause further uncertainties in the availability and pricing of a suitable tonnage.The shipping company’s investments in energy-efficient vessels will strengthen its competitiveness and market position in the future. ESL Shipping is finalizing development of a completely fossil-free sea transportation ecosystem in cooperation with its key partners and customers.During the remaining part of 2023  the two most profitable larger and two smaller vessels will be docked for a total of approximately 50 days  and consequently  result in Q3 will be negatively affected.The green transition is expected to substantially enlarge ESL Shipping’s market  and as informed in a separate stock exchange release on 26th April  Aspo‘s Board of Directors decided to initiate a review of strategic options to support and accelerate ESL Shipping’s low-carbon growth strategy. The ongoing program is assessing alternative measures  including launch of a second wave investment pool  a possible equity injection in ESL Shipping by a minority shareholder  and the sale of ESL Shipping’s two supramax vessels. The program has progressed according to plan  and first results are expected still during year 2023.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals  and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China.4-6/2023 4-6/2022 Change % 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 54.2 52.9 2 108.5 103.5 5 Operating profit  MEUR -0.1 4.4 -102 2.6 2.4 8 Operating profit  % -0.2 8.3 2.4 2.3 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -1.0 0.5 -1.0 -4.1 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 0.9 3.9 -77 3.6 6.5 -45 Comparable operating profit  % 1.7 7.4 3.3 6.3In the second quarter of 2023  Telko’s net sales increased by 2% to EUR 54.2 (52.9) million and its comparable operating profit decreased to EUR 0.9 (3.9) million. Telko’s comparable operating profit rate was 1.7% (7.4%). The comparable operating profit for the second quarter excludes items affecting comparability of EUR -1.0 million including an inventory write-down related to Russian specific products. There is a high risk that this inventory cannot be sold with positive sales margin  and hence write down to net realizable value was made in the second quarter. Telko’s reported operating profit for the second quarter decreased to EUR -0.1 (4.4) million and the operating profit rate was -0.2% (8.3%).Net sales of the plastics business decreased by 13% during the second quarter  amounting to EUR 24.7 (28.3) million. The main contributor to lower sales was a negative price trend. In general  the second quarter was very challenging in the plastics business due to rapidly declining prices combined with soft demand. Customers focused on further reducing inventory levels and adjusting purchasing to end customer demand. In some product groups prices were up to 40% lower than during the same time in 2022. Due to significant market price decreases average margins were under pressure  especially for volume plastics where oversupply was evident. Increasing imports to Europe due to changes in the sea freight market  including improved availability and collapsing freight prices  was one of the drivers for the rapid price decline in standard products. Despite the challenging market environment Telko was active in business development and gained new customers.Net sales of the chemicals business increased by 37% during the second quarter  amounting to EUR 16.7 (12.2) million. The recently acquired Polish distributor Eltrex contributed EUR 2.5 million to net sales during the quarter. The integration of Eltrex has started successfully and first sales synergies have been realized. Demand remained relatively healthy in the main markets during the second quarter  however  but started to slow down slightly during the quarter. Prices continued to decline in many product lines  but the development was quite balanced  still making margin management more challenging.Net sales of the lubricants business increased by 3% to EUR 12.8 (12.4) million. All business lines developed positively. The good development in Industrial lubricants continued and resulted in sales volume growth. In Automotive lubricants sales development was good in all markets and strongest in the Scandinavian market. Telko continued to strengthen its position in Marine Lubricants. During the second quarter the pressure on prices increased in all lubricant segments  but the impact was strongest in Automotive lubricants. Margin development in lubricants remained relatively flat.Telko’s net sales increased by 5% during January–June to EUR 108.5 (103.5) million  primarily driven by acquisitions. Telko’s comparable operating profit for the first half of the year was EUR 3.6 (6.5) million  and its comparable operating profit rate was 3.3% (6.3%). Telko’s operating profit was at EUR 2.6 (2.4) million for January-June 2023 and the operating profit rate was 2.4% (2.3%).Telko outlook for 2023Telko has faced significant changes in its business environment during the last year. Despite all the changes  the core of Telko´s strategy has remained and will remain the same. As a leading expert serving multiple industries  Telko is in a unique position to create value by improving its customers’ sustainability  productivity  and operational quality. Telko´s growth efforts will increasingly be focused on Europe  but the main components of the company´s value proposition will remain the same.In general  the business outlook in the European market looks weaker than a year ago. Telko serves industrial customers in various industries. The possible changes in demand will be softened by the heterogenic cyclicality of the diversified customer base  and hence Telko’s business is expected to remain fairly resilient to changes in overall market development.In plastics  overall market conditions will remain challenging for the coming months  as customer demand does not indicate recovery at present. Prices reached historically low levels in many product groups  and we expect them to stabilize during Q3. Sales margins are expected to recover as a result of more stable price development. Despite the challenging market environment  Telko expects to continue gaining market share in the main markets.In chemicals  the demand is expected to soften slightly during the second half of the year in key markets. Price erosion is expected to continue  but in a controlled way. The Baltics will face the biggest drop in demand  Finland and Scandinavia are expected to develop quite favorably. The integration of the recently acquired Eltrex will continue.It is expected that for lubricants demand will remain relatively stable during the second half of the year. A possible slower economic development might have an adverse impact on demand for lubricants. Market prices are expected to decline slightly. Telko expects to continue growing its market share in high performance lubricants  metal working fluids and marine lubricants.The recent acquisitions have proved to be successful  and they have had a positive impact on the existing businesses. Telko aims to accelerate its growth through acquisitions to achieve its strategic goals in all three business segments. Telko will also seek to strengthen its market share in existing markets through organic growth.In order to secure good profitability  Telko will further strengthen its cost efficiency and continue developing its operating model towards better scalability and flexibility. Good inventory control and capital efficiency will continue to be a high priority for Telko. The asset-light business model of Telko enables better ability to utilize new business opportunities and to react to changes in the business environment.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  sourcing raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies  and supplying them through its effective logistics chain to serve customer needs. With operations in six countries including Finland  Sweden  the Baltic countries  and Ukraine  Leipurin serves bakeries  the food industry  and food service customers by providing raw materials  supporting research & development  recipes  and innovations for new products. Leipurin offers also various supplies and machines for the same customer segments  partnering with leading international manufacturers for its raw material and machinery supply.4-6/2023 4-6/2022 Change % 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 34.4 23.0 50 69.0 44.4 55 Operating profit  MEUR 1.4 -0.3 2.6 -1.1 Operating profit  % 4.1 -1.3 3.8 -2.5 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 0.3 -0.3 0.5 -1.2 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.1 0.0 2.1 0.1 2000 Comparable operating profit  % 3.2 0.0 3.0 0.2Leipurin’s net sales increased by 50% during the second quarter to EUR 34.4 (23.0) million. In Finland net sales increased by 8% to EUR 12.6 (11.7) million. In the Baltic countries  net sales decreased by 4% to EUR 9.1 (9.5) million. Net sales in Ukraine decreased by 50% to EUR 0.1 (0.2) million. Sweden was established as a new business unit as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on September 1  2022  and it contributed with EUR 12.6 million and approximately 37% of Leipurin’s net sales in the second quarter of 2023. Net sales of the comparative period included EUR 1.7 million net sales of the divested Vulganus Oy. During the second quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 61% to EUR 24.9 (15.5) million  driven by the Kobia acquisition. Sales to the food industry increased by 7% to EUR 3.1 (2.9) million.Increasing raw material prices in global markets continued to drive Leipurin’s sales growth during the second quarter. Measured in kilo volume  the decline in sales continued in Finland  Sweden and the Baltic countries  although it slowed down significantly towards the end of the quarter. In the case of Leipurin  the volume decrease has been predominantly in the low-margin commodity items  resulting in an improved product mix  and hence the positive development in gross profits continued even at slightly lower total volumes.The comparable operating profit for the second quarter stood at EUR 1.1 (0.0) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 3.2% (0.0%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR 0.3 (-0.3) million  included the sales gain related to the sale and leaseback transaction of Kobia’s properties in Hässleholm and Tyresö. The comparative period was mainly affected by items related to the divestment of Vulganus. Leipurin’s operating profit for the second quarter was EUR 1.4 (-0.3) million and operating profit rate 4.1% (-1.3%).In January–June  Leipurin’s net sales increased by 55% to EUR 69.0 (44.4) million. Figures for the comparative year included EUR 4.2 million in net sales of the divested Vulganus Oy. Kobia AB’s acquisition contributed to the growth by EUR 25.5 million and its share of Leipurin’s net sales was 37% during the period. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets had a significant impact on the euro-denominated increase in sales particularly in the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter.Leipurin’s comparable operating profit in January–June 2023 was EUR 2.1 (0.1) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 3.0% (0.2%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR 0.5 (-1.2) million  were mainly related to the gain on the sale and leaseback transactions of Kobia’s properties in Sweden. The comparative period was mainly affected by the destroyed warehouse in Ukraine  and items related to the divestment of Vulganus. The operating profit was EUR 2.6 (-1.1) million and operating profit rate 3.8% (-2.5%).Leipurin completed the sale and leaseback of the property in Gothenburg  Sweden during the first quarter  and the properties in Hässleholm and Tyresö  Sweden during the second quarter. These actions generated sales proceeds of EUR 13.6 million  which represents a significant share of the capital that was invested when acquiring Kobia AB. The transactions will not have a significant impact on profitability going forward.Leipurin outlook for 2023Leipurin’s expansion to Sweden through the acquisition of Kobia AB will contribute to annual net sales by roughly EUR 50 million and generate considerable synergy benefits in product range development  supply chain  and procurement. It also enables partners to be served in a wider geographic area. The integration of operations and synergy capture have progressed according to plan.Decreased consumer purchasing power may continue to have a negative impact on demand especially for artisan bakeries  as consumers shift towards more affordable products. The sharpest effects of the consumer prices shock of late 2022 and early 2023 seem though to be flattening out on the food market  and some commodity prices have also declined. The outcome of the crop year in September typically sets the general direction of food raw material prices  which is expected to be rather down than up. Such development will put emphasis on efficient inventory management.The rapid inflation has decelerated considerably  but volatility across raw material categories will continue on a high level. The market is expected to be significantly more stable in the second half of the year than during the past 12 months.Volumes in the food market have generally declined starting in the second half of 2022 and continuing this year. This development has been prevalent not only in Leipurin’s markets and countries  but across food markets in Europe  presumably due to the consumer price shock caused by inflation  energy prices and interest rates. The market volume decline compared to the previous year is expected to flatten out during the second half of 2023.Leipurin has now completed the core parts of the reorganization and will continue to work on the Group and country-level strategies in Q3. Management sees clear opportunities for organic growth as well as efficiency improvements in the countries. To strengthen growth and company positioning  Leipurin evaluates possible acquisition opportunities  as well as opportunities to further strengthen business focus by divesting or discontinuing some non-core  low-profitability parts of the business. The impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on the global supply chains  the availability of certain raw materials  general delivery times and especially on market development and demand in Ukraine will continue  but with a reduced effect on Leipurin’s business.Management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges keep the risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among small customers at higher level  although such risks have not materially realized for Leipurin.Non-core businessesThe Non-core businesses segment includes Telko Russia and Belarus as well as Kauko GmbH previously reported in the Telko segment  Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan previously reported in the Leipurin segment and ESL Shipping Russia previously reported in the ESL Shipping segment. The Non-core businesses segment was established to separate the results of the non-core businesses of Aspo from the results of the continuing businesses. All the entities in the segment are either held for sale  in the process of being closed down or already divested.Non-core 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 Change % 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 3.8 25.2 -85 9.7 56.8 -83 Operating profit  MEUR -8.0 3.1 -358 -8.1 9.4 -186 Operating profit  % -210.5 12.3 -83.5 16.5 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -8.0 -1.2 -7.7 -1.4 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 0.0 4.3 -100 -0.4 10.8 -104 Comparable operating profit  % 0.0 17.1 -4.1 19.0The net sales of the Non-core businesses segment declined by 85% during the second quarter to EUR 3.8 (25.2) million.

The comparable operating profit was EUR 0.0 (4.3) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 0.0% (17.1%). The Leipurin entities contributed positively to the comparable operating profit  but the Telko entities were loss making leading to the zero comparable operating profit of the segment. The operating profit of the Non-core businesses was EUR -8.0 (3.1) million. The operating profit included EUR -8.0 (-1.2) million of items affecting comparability  which were caused by the sale of Telko’s subsidiary in Russia EUR -7.4 million  the write down of Telko Russia’s inventory EUR -1.7 million and EUR 1.1 million of valuation adjustments relating to the other eastern businesses held for sale due to their decreased net assets.The divestment of Telko’s Russian subsidiary was completed during the second quarter. The company was sold to the Russian industrial operator GK Himik. The received sales price was EUR 5.7 million. The money received corresponded materially to the remaining value of the company in Aspo Group considering the impairment losses recognized already in 2022 and the valuation adjustments done in 2023. The loss on sale was EUR -7.4 million  including accumulated translation differences of EUR -8.6 million that were reclassified from the translation reserve in equity to other operating expenses in the profit and loss. The sales loss is reported in Non-core business segment as an item affecting comparability. In Aspo Group the sales loss is presented in the result from discontinued operations.In January–June  the net sales of the Non-core businesses segment decreased by 83% to EUR 9.7 (56.8) million. The comparable operating profit in January–June 2023 was EUR -0.4 (10.8) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was -4.1% (19.0%).

The comparable operating profit of Other operations was EUR -1.7 (-1.4) million in the second quarter. The cost increase compared with the previous year relates to the transformation of Aspo Group. The operating profit of the quarter was EUR -1.8 (-1.4) million. An item affecting comparability of EUR -0.1 million is reported in the second quarter and it relates to corporate restructuring.In January-June the comparable operating profit of other operations was EUR -3.0 (-3.3) million and the operating profit was EUR -3.1 (-3.8). The improved profitability derives from some restructuring activities at Aspo Group level. In 2022  items affecting comparability of EUR -0.5 million were related to the additional share-based remuneration granted to Aspo’s previous CEO.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

As of the beginning of the financial year  Aspo applies certain new or amended IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations as described in the 2022 consolidated financial statements. In other respects  the same accounting and measurement principles have been applied as in the 2022 consolidated financial statements. The information in this half-year report is unaudited.Aspo Plc applies the guidance on alternative key figures issued by ESMA. In addition to IFRS figures  the company releases other commonly used key figures  which are mainly derived from the statement of comprehensive income and balance sheet. According to the management  key figures clarify the view drawn by the statement of comprehensive income and balance sheet of Aspo’s financial performance and financial position. The calculation principles of key figures are explained on page 64 of Aspo’s Year 2022 publication.PersonnelAt the end of the review period  Aspo Group had 827 employees (886 at the end of 2022)  of which discontinued operations accounted for 81 (130) employees.Segment informationAspo Group’s reportable segments are ESL Shipping  Telko  Leipurin and Non-core businesses.From the beginning of year 2023 Aspo has reported the eastern businesses held for sale in a new segment called Non-core businesses and at the same time  Aspo has classified the new segment as discontinued operations. The comparative figures have been restated for all segments impacted by this financial reporting restructuring.The Non-core businesses segment includes Telko Russia and Belarus as well as Kauko GmbH previously reported in the Telko segment  Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan previously reported in the Leipurin segment as well as ESL Shipping Russia previously reported in the ESL Shipping segment. The Non-core businesses segment was established to separate the results of the non-core businesses of Aspo from the results of the continuing businesses. All the entities in the segment are either held for sale  in the process of being closed down or already divested.Reconciliation of segment operating profit to the Group's profit before taxes 1-6/2023 ESL ShippingTelko Leipurin Unallocated Group MEUR items total Operating profit 9.3 2.6 2.6 -3.1 11.4 Net financial expenses -4.1 -4.1 Profit before taxes 7.3 1-6/2022 ESL ShippingTelko Leipurin Unallocated Group MEUR items total Operating profit 18.2 2.4 -1.2 -3.7 15.7 Net financial expenses -2.1 -2.1 Profit before taxes 13.6Discontinued operations and other non-current assets and disposal groups held for saleThe Non-core businesses segment established in the beginning of the year has been classified as discontinued operations in accordance with the IFRS 5 standard. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures for the comparative periods have been restated. In the comparative periods the discontinued operations also include the figures of Kauko Oy  which was divested on October 31  2022.The divestment of Telko’s Russian subsidiary was completed during the second quarter. The company was sold to the Russian industrial operator GK Himik. The sales price received was EUR 5.7 million which materially corresponded to the carrying value of the divested company's net assets considering the impairment losses recognized already in 2022 and the valuation adjustments done in 2023. The loss on divestment was EUR -7.4 million  including accumulated translation differences of EUR -8.6 million that were reclassified from the translation reserve in equity to other operating expenses in profit and loss. The costs to sell amounted to EUR -0.6 million.Profit from discontinued operations 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales 3.8 29.1 9.7 62.9 91.9 Other operating income 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.3 Materials and services -5.7 -21.8 -8.2 -46.5 -77.6 Employee benefit expenses -0.6 -2.6 -1.5 -4.5 -7.1 Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 0.1 -1.3 0.2 -1.4 -3.1 Depreciation  leased assets -0.1 -0.2 -0.1 -0.3 -1.5 Other operating expenses -5.5 -1.3 -8.2 -2.3 -10.1 Operating profit -8.0 1.9 -8.1 8.0 -7.2 Financial income and expenses 0.7 -2.1 1.7 -2.8 -0.4 Profit before taxes -7.3 -0.2 -6.4 5.2 -7.6 Income taxes 0.1 -0.2 0.0 -1.4 -2.5 Profit for the period -7.2 -0.4 -6.4 3.8 -10.1Net cash flows of discontinued operations 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR Net cash inflow from operating activities 0.5 26.8 31.7 Net cash inflowithoutflow(-) from investing activities -4.3 0.0 -1.0 Net cash inflowithoutflow(-) from financing activities -0.3 -1.8 -2.1 Net change in cash generated by the discontinued operations-4.1 25.0 28.6Net cash flows of discontinued operations consist of the Non-core businesses segment’s share of Aspo Group’s cash flows. In the comparison periods the figures also include Kauko Oy’s cash flows.The cash flow from the sale of Telko’s subsidiary in Russia was EUR -4.4 million and it is presented in the cash flow from investing activities. The cash received as purchase consideration was EUR 5.7 million and the divested company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 10.1 million.In 2022  the cash flow from the divestment of Kauko Oy EUR -1.0 million is included in the cash flow from investing activities. The cost to sell Kauko of EUR -0.4 million is presented in the cash flow from operating activities. The cash flow from financing mainly consisted of repayments of Kauko Oy’s interest-bearing loans in 2022.Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale 6/2023 6/2022 12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR Assets of discontinued operations 4.1 3.8 12.4 Assets classified as held for sale  total 4.1 3.8 12.4 Liabilities of discontinued operations 1.2 2.8 3.9 Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale  total1.2 2.8 3.9At the end of the second quarter 2023 and at the end of year 2022 assets and liabilities of discontinued operations include the assets and liabilities of the Non-core businesses segment. In the comparative period 6/2022 they include the assets and liabilities of Kauko operating segment.The assets and businesses held for sale are measured at fair value less cost to sell. On divestment  the accumulated translation differences of foreign subsidiaries are recognized as part of the sales gain or loss. At the end of the second quarter  the translation differences of the eastern businesses held for sale amounted to EUR -5.4 million. The translation differences fluctuate according to changes in exchange rates. The reclassification of the translation differences from the translation difference reserve to the profit and loss has no impact on Aspo Group’s total equity.Restricted cash and cash equivalentsIn Russia  Aspo Group has EUR 3.4 million in cash and cash equivalents  the use of which is strictly restricted by the Russian Government and controlled by the banks. The value of these cash and cash equivalents in the Group balance sheet is EUR 3.3 million  as impairments of EUR 0.1 million have been recognized on them. Cash and cash equivalents in Russia are presented under assets held for sale on the balance sheet. In the first half of 2023 it was still possible to receive dividend payments and make commercial payments with Russian entities. Also  during the second quarter Aspo received the payment of EUR 5.7 million for the sale of Telko Russia. According to our understanding and experience  the sales price of the Leipurin entities classified as held for sale is also expected to be received in conjunction with the sale of the entities. However  there is a risk that the Group does not have access to the cash and cash equivalents in full in Russia  and therefore they are considered restricted in accordance with IAS 7.Acquisition of EltrexOn January 31  Telko acquired Eltrex  a Polish distributor of specialty chemicals and industrial packaging materials  with net sales of approximately EUR 8 million and operating profit slightly less than EUR 1.0 million in 2022.The estimated total consideration of EUR 4.9 million will be paid fully in cash  and EUR 3.9 million has already been paid. The rest of the consideration will be paid in the years 2024 and 2025 based on the earn-out clause of the purchase agreement. The assets and liabilities of the acquired company were measured at fair value on the acquisition date. A fair value adjustment of EUR 3.1 million was made on intangible assets based on customer relationships  non-compete clauses and trademarks  and the fair value adjustment relating to inventories was EUR 0.1 million. The deferred tax liability arising from the fair value adjustments was EUR 0.6 million. The carrying amount of the other acquired assets and liabilities corresponded to their fair values. A goodwill balance of EUR 1.3 million was recognized from the acquisition. The acquisition-related costs of approximately EUR 0.4 million were recognized in the Telko segment’s other operating expenses.Preliminary acquisition calculation of Eltrex 6/2023 MEUR Consideration Paid in cash 4.9 Total consideration 4.9 Assets acquired and liabilities assumed  fair value Intangible assets 3.4 Leased assets 0.6 Inventories 1.4 Accounts receivable and other receivables 1.1 Total assets 6.5 Interest bearing liabilities 1.3 Accounts payable and other liabilities 1.0 Deferred tax liability 0.6 Total liabilities 2.9 Net assets acquired 3.6 Goodwill 1.3Aspo Group disaggregation of net sales  from continuing operationsTelko net sales 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 Change 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 Change 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR % MEUR MEUR % MEUR Business area: Plastics business 24.7 28.3 -12.7 51.3 55.5 -7.6 110.1 Chemicals business 16.7 12.2 36.9 31.8 24.3 30.9 49.2 Lubricants business 12.8 12.4 3.2 25.4 23.7 7.2 50.1 Telko total 54.2 52.9 2.5 108.5 103.5 4.8 209.4Leipurin net sales 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 Change 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 Change 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR % MEUR MEUR % MEUR Regions: Finland 12.6 11.7 7.7 24.5 22.1 10.9 46.6 Sweden 12.6 25.6 17.3 Baltics 9.1 9.5 -4.2 18.5 17.4 6.3 36.8 Ukraine 0.1 0.2 -50.0 0.4 0.7 -42.9 0.9 Total 34.4 21.4 60.7 69.0 40.2 71.6 101.6of which: Bakeries 24.9 15.5 60.6 50.6 29.8 69.8 74.9 Food Industry 3.1 2.9 6.9 6.0 5.2 15.4 11.8 Retail  foodservice  other 6.4 2.9 120.7 12.4 5.2 138.5 14.9 Vulganus 1.7 -100.0 4.2 -100.0 4.3 Leipurin total 34.4 23.0 49.6 69.0 44.4 55.4 105.9Net sales by timing of revenue recognition4-6/2023 4-6/2022 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping At a point in time 0.0 0.9 0.1 1.9 3.5 Over time 44.0 59.4 96.6 115.2 241.9 44.0 60.3 96.7 117.1 245.4 Telko At a point in time 54.1 52.8 108.3 103.3 209.0 Over time 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.4 54.2 52.9 108.5 103.5 209.4 Leipurin At a point in time 34.4 21.6 69.0 41.1 102.6 Over time 0.0 1.4 0.0 3.3 3.3 34.4 23.0 69.0 44.4 105.9 Total At a point in time 88.5 75.3 177.4 146.3 315.1 Over time 44.1 60.9 96.8 118.7 245.6 132.6 136.2 274.2 265.0 560.7 Net sales by market area 4-6/2023 4-6/2022 1-6/2023 1-6/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping Finland 24.4 28.5 46.7 56.1 121.5 Scandinavian countries 12.4 15.3 27.2 28.3 58.5 Baltic countries 0.1 1.3 0.4 1.9 2.9 Other European countries 6.3 13.1 15.1 25.4 48.2 Other countries 0.8 2.1 7.3 5.4 14.3 44.0 60.3 96.7 117.1 245.4 Telko Finland 12.1 14.2 25.6 27.9 53.5 Scandinavian countries 13.7 16.9 27.5 32.2 61.7 Baltic countries 7.5 7.0 14.8 13.9 28.3 Other European countries 12.5 8.7 22.6 18.9 39.0 Other countries 8.4 6.1 18.0 10.6 26.9 54.2 52.9 108.5 103.5 209.4 Leipurin Finland 12.6 12.9 24.5 24.9 49.4 Scandinavian countries 12.4 0.1 25.2 0.4 17.4 Baltic countries 9.1 9.2 18.5 17.3 36.6 Other European countries 0.3 0.7 0.8 1.7 2.4 Other countries 0.0 0.1 0.0 0.1 0.1 34.4 23.0 69.0 44.4 105.9 Total Finland 49.1 55.6 96.8 108.9 224.4 Scandinavian countries 38.5 32.3 79.9 60.9 137.6 Baltic countries 16.7 17.5 33.7 33.1 67.8 Other European countries 19.1 22.5 38.5 46.0 89.6 Other countries 9.2 8.3 25.3 16.1 41.3 132.6 136.2 274.2 265.0 560.7Investments by segment ESL ShippingTelko Leipurin Non-core Group MEUR businesses total Investments 1-6/2023 5.4 0.5 5.9 Investments 1-6/2022 7.8 0.3 0.1 8.2Green Coaster investment commitmentAtoBatC Shipping AB  reported in the ESL Shipping segment  is building a series of six highly energy-efficient electric hybrid vessels.

Aug 11 (Interfax) - Certain Persian Gulf countries have expressed a willingness to host an alternative international settlement and depository hub  the creation of which was previously proposed by Russian state bank VTB .,"Some Persian Gulf countries open to hosting alternative depository hub - VTB headMOSCOW. Aug 11 (Interfax) - Certain Persian Gulf countries have expressed a willingness to host an alternative international settlement and depository hub  the creation of which was previously proposed by Russian state bank VTB .""We are also promoting the idea of creating a settlement and depository hub to replace Euroclear. As is known  Euroclear has compromised itself  having frozen huge amounts of funds  including of Russian citizens. But many countries  we've spoken with several Persian Gulf countries  are prepared to host such hubs in order to create an alternative. And this is not directed against anyone  it's just an alternative option that will not have any political  any other constraints "" VTB head Andrei Kostin said at a meeting with President Vladimir Putin.Kostin first called for the creation of an alternative international settlement and depository hub at the Bank of Russia's Financial Congress in early July. This point was included in the program to create a parallel system of international settlements and financial market infrastructure developed by the bank.""We have all faced the problems of Euroclear and Clearstream. [...] We believe a center for the transactions of a new financial depository could be located in a Persian Gulf country given the concentration of big capital in this region "" Kostin said at the time.Central Bank chief Elvira Nabiullina backed the idea. ""As for the creation of a regional  international depository hub  it seems to me that this is a very good idea. The specifics need to be discussed with the market and with partners to see if there is interest in the creation of this hub and what it might entail. But the ideal  in my view  is very productive for further elaboration. Specifically for the development of the international capital market "" Nabiullina said.At the meeting with Putin  Kostin also said that there has been active development of bilateral settlements between countries in recent months. ""We know that the largest countries of Asia  such as China  India  Indonesia  and Arab countries  particularly the Persian Gulf  Saudi Arabia  [...] in Africa these processes have begun  and African countries are starting to settle accounts among themselves in national currencies and  what's important  are creating new infrastructure "" he said.""Specifically  systems are emerging in place of SWIFT that are replacing it and are being created by these countries themselves.

This program will explore the advantages of adding the Biocartis IdyllaTM Platform to a molecular diagnostics workflow in global clinical labs via a study in hospitals across Spain. The focus will be to understand how the Idylla™ Platform can contribute to a more expeditious and comprehensive approach to identify targetable alterations when compared to various current clinical workflows for NSCLC patients.Roger Moody  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “I am pleased that Lillyshares our commitment to address the need forfaster identification of eligible patients for targeted therapy.” He also added: “Despite guidelines and reimbursement  patients  especially those in community hospital settings continue to receive treatment based on incomplete or untimely biomarker results. Our collaboration with Lilly supports our ambition to deliver results in time for all patients  including those being treated in community-based centers.”The intention of the Lilly-sponsored study in Spain is that the results will guide and improve US community-based diagnostic workflows by the introduction of the Idylla platform. The outcome data is expected to be presented in the fall of 2024.Anthony Sireci  MD  MSC  Senior Vice President  Clinical Biomarker and Diagnostics  Loxo Oncology at Lilly  added: “There is a need to improve the rates of molecular profiling of lung cancer patients before first line treatment decisions are made. One of the barriers to this are the long turnaround times associated with send out testing. This study aims to test the hypothesis that an in-house  rapid turnaround time and easy to use assay will deliver actionable results to patients and increase their likelihood of receiving biomarker-informed therapies.”----- END ----More information:Investor Relations Biocartise-mail ir@biocartis.comAbout BiocartisWith its revolutionary and proprietary Idylla™ platform  Biocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) aspires to enable personalized medicine for patients around the world through universal access to molecular testing  by making molecular testing actionable  convenient  fast and suitable for any lab.

This program will explore the advantages of adding the Biocartis IdyllaTM Platform to a molecular diagnostics workflow in global clinical labs via a study in hospitals across Spain. The focus will be to understand how the Idylla™ Platform can contribute to a more expeditious and comprehensive approach to identify targetable alterations when compared to various current clinical workflows for NSCLC patients.Roger Moody  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “I am pleased that Lilly shares our commitment to address the need for faster identification of eligible patients for targeted therapy.” He also added: “Despite guidelines and reimbursement  patients  especially those in community hospital settings  continue to receive treatment based on incomplete or untimely biomarker results. Our collaboration with Lilly supports our ambition to deliver results in time for all patients  including those being treated in community-based centers.”The intention of the Lilly-sponsored study in Spain is that the results will guide and improve US community-based diagnostic workflows by the introduction of the Idylla platform. The outcome data is expected to be presented in the fall of 2024.Anthony Sireci  MD  MSC  Senior Vice President  Clinical Biomarker and Diagnostics  Loxo Oncology at Lilly  added: “There is a need to improve the rates of molecular profiling of lung cancer patients before first line treatment decisions are made. One of the barriers to this are the long turnaround times associated with send out testing. This study aims to test the hypothesis that an in-house  rapid turnaround time and easy to use assay will deliver actionable results to patients and increase their likelihood of receiving biomarker-informed therapies.”----- END ----More information:Investor Relations Biocartise-mail ir@biocartis.comAbout BiocartisWith its revolutionary and proprietary Idylla™ platform  Biocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) aspires to enable personalized medicine for patients around the world through universal access to molecular testing  by making molecular testing actionable  convenient  fast and suitable for any lab.

The new shares will be fully paid up. A portion of the issue price of all new shares equal to the accounting par value of existing shares (at the time of the capital increase) multiplied by the number of new shares (and rounded up) shall be allocated to the ""capital"" account  and the balance shall be taken to one or several separate accounts available in the equity on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. All shares (new and existing shares) shall have the same representative value in the capital (and the same accounting par value). The Company will request the admission of new shares to trading on the Euronext Brussels regulated market. The new shares will be offered in a public offering in Belgium. Subject to the relevant legal provisions  the new shares may also be offered via one or more public offerings/or private investments to institutional  qualified  professional or other investors in Belgium  in other jurisdictions outside Belgium  pursuant to a decision of (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) the Committee (each of (i) and (ii) acting individually  with power to sub-delegate and substitute).

Capital increase by contribution in cash with statutory preferential right for existing shareholders Proposed decision:After reading the Board's report and the auditor's report drawn up in accordance with article 7:179 of the CAC  the extraordinary general meeting decides to increase the capital by contribution in cash with statutory preference right for existing shareholders up to a maximum amount of 200 000 000.00 euros (issue premium included) by the creation of new shares without par value. Confirmation of the capital increase must take place no later than 31 December 2023. The new shares to be issued when the share capital is increased: shall be of the same nature as the existing shares  will be in registered form or dematerialised  and will have the same rights and benefits as the existing shares  and will participate in particular in the result of the Company for the entire current financial year. The new shares will be underwritten by contribution in cash at the issue price  in euros  issue premium included  which shall be determined by (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) an ad hoc committee which shall be authorised to continue the implementation of the operation (see composition and powers below  point 6 of the agenda) (hereinafter the ""Committee"") (each of (i) and (ii) acting individually  and with a power of sub-delegation and substitution)  but which may not be less than 10.2344 euros per share (or the accounting par value of existing shares). The new shares will be fully paid up. A portion of the issue price of all new shares equal to the accounting par value of existing shares (at the time of the capital increase) multiplied by the number of new shares (and rounded up) shall be allocated to the ""capital"" account  and the balance shall be taken to one or several separate accounts available in the equity on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. All shares (new and existing shares) shall have the same representative value in the capital (and the same accounting par value). The Company will request the admission of new shares to trading on the Euronext Brussels regulated market. The new shares will be offered in a public offering in Belgium. Subject to the relevant legal provisions  the new shares may also be offered via one or more public offerings/or private investments to institutional  Page 2 sur 9qualified  professional or other investors in Belgium  in other jurisdictions outside Belgium  pursuant to a decision of (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) the Committee (each of (i) and (ii) acting individually  with power to sub-delegate and substitute). Existing shareholders of the Company will have a statutory preferential right to underwrite new shares in accordance with articles 7:188 and 7:189 of the CAC. Each existing share will give to the shareholder a statutory preferential right of subscription. The statutory preferential right of subscription shall be in the form of a coupon  detached from each share. The statutory preferential rights may be exercised and negotiated  separately from the existing shares  including for the benefit of persons who are not shareholders yet  for a public underwriting period of at least 15 calendar days  whose start and end dates shall be set by (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) the Committee (each of (i) and (ii) acting individually  with the power to sub-delegate and to substitute). The Company will request that the statutory preferential rights be admitted to trading on the Euronext Brussels regulated market during the public underwriting period. Subject to the relevant statutory provisions  the statutory preferential rights shall then be freely tradeable on the Euronext Brussels regulated market  separately from existing shares  including for the benefit of persons who are not shareholders yet  during the public underwriting period. Subject to the relevant statutory provisions  the statutory preferential rights will give entitlement to underwrite new shares at the subscription ratio which shall be determined by (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) the Committee (each of (i) and (ii) acting individually  with the power to sub-delegate and to substitute). The statutory preferential rights cannot be used to underwrite new fractional shares  as appropriate. Moreover  registered preferential rights may not be combined with dematerialised preferential rights to underwrite new shares. Company shareholders or persons having acquired statutory preferential rights who do not hold a sufficient number of statutory preferential rights to underwrite a round number of new shares at the applicable subscription ratio  may  during the public underwriting period  either acquire additional statutory preferential rights to underwrite new shares at the applicable subscription ratio  or sell all or part of their statutory preferential rights. Subject to the foregoing  the Company will prepare a prospectus for public offering in Belgium of new shares and the admission to trading of new shares and statutory preferential rights on the Euronext Brussels regulated market  which must be approved by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (hereinafter the ""FSMA"") in accordance with the applicable law. It is accepted that relevant legal provisions in jurisdictions other than Belgium may restrict or prohibit shareholders or other holders of statutory preferential rights outside Belgium to underwrite new shares  to negotiate statutory preferential rights or to exercise statutory preferential rights. Unless otherwise decided by (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) the Committee (each of (i) and (ii) acting individually  with the power to sub-delegate and to substitute)  the Company shall not be required to offer new shares or statutory preferential rights to the public in jurisdictions outside Belgium. The statutory preferential rights which are not exercised within the public underwriting period4 shall not be converted into ""scrips""  shall not be sold nor invested and will become null and void and will therefore have no value. 4 To avoid any misunderstanding  statutory preferential rights (a) in respect of which no valid subscription form has been received in due course or (b) in respect of which the full issue price has not been paid in due course  shall equally be deemed as not having been exercised.

Confirmation of the capital increase must take place no later than 31 December 2023. The new shares to be issued when the share capital is increased: shall be of the same nature as the existing shares  will be in registered form or dematerialised  and will have the same rights and benefits as the existing shares  and will participate in particular in the result of the Company for the entire current financial year.

The new shares will be fully paid up. A portion of the issue price of all new shares equal to the accounting par value of existing shares (at the time of the capital increase) multiplied by the number of new shares (and rounded up) shall be allocated to the ""capital"" account  and the balance shall be taken to one or several separate accounts available in the equity on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. All shares (new and existing shares) shall have the same representative value in the capital (and the same accounting par value). The Company will request the admission of new shares to trading on the Euronext Brussels regulated market. The new shares will be offered in a public offering in Belgium. Subject to the relevant legal provisions  the new shares may also be offered via one or more public offerings/or private investments to institutional  qualified  professional or other investors in Belgium  in other jurisdictions outside Belgium  pursuant to a decision of (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) the Committee (each of (i) and (ii) acting individually  with power to sub-delegate and substitute). Existing shareholders of the Company will have a statutory preferential right to underwrite new shares in accordance with articles 7:188 and 7:189 of the CAC.

The statutory preferential rights may be exercised and negotiated  separately from the existing shares  including for the benefit of persons who are not shareholders yet  for a public underwriting period of at least 15 calendar days  whose start and end dates shall be set by (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) the Committee (each of (i) and (ii) acting individually  with the power to sub-delegate and to substitute). The Company will request that the statutory preferential rights be admitted to trading on the Euronext Brussels regulated market during the public underwriting period.

Company shareholders or persons having acquired statutory preferential rights who do not hold a sufficient number of statutory preferential rights to underwrite a round number of new shares at the applicable subscription ratio  may  during the public underwriting period  either acquire additional statutory preferential rights to underwrite new shares at the applicable subscription ratio  or sell all or part of their statutory preferential rights. Subject to the foregoing  the Company will prepare a prospectus for public offering in Belgium of new shares and the admission to trading of new shares and statutory preferential rights on the Euronext Brussels regulated market  which must be approved by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (hereinafter the ""FSMA"") in accordance with the applicable law. It is accepted that relevant legal provisions in jurisdictions other than Belgium may restrict or prohibit shareholders or other holders Page 3of statutory preferential rights outside Belgium to underwrite new shares  to negotiate statutory preferential rights or to exercise statutory preferential rights. Unless otherwise decided by (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) the Committee (each of (i) and (ii) acting individually  with the power to sub-delegate and to substitute)  the Company shall not be required to offer new shares or statutory preferential rights to the public in jurisdictions outside Belgium. The statutory preferential rights which are not exercised within the public underwriting period5 shall not be converted into ""scrips""  shall not be sold nor invested and will become null and void and will therefore have no value.

The amount of Underwriting Commitments may be increased after the date of the capital increase. The underwriting of new remaining shares shall in any event be made at the sale issue price as that applicable during the public underwriting period  without additional compensation.

IDEX Biometrics secured two additional design wins with card manufacturers in the Middle East and Malaysia and formed reseller agreements with two high-volume card manufacturers to expand our market reach.During the quarter  the IDEX Pay complete solution passed all the required certification testing by Mastercard for use on its payment network. A formal Letter of Approval is anticipated in the coming weeks. This milestone provides smart card manufacturers and end-customers an expedited route to producing fully certified biometric payment cards  thereby minimizing the need for them to undertake the entire certification process  which is time-consuming and costly. We anticipate biometric payment cards based on this solution will stimulate growth for the entire market  starting in late 2023 and accelerating throughout 2024 and beyond.The IDEX Pay complete solution has been selected by 17 card manufacturers and resellers who will be bringing new biometric payment cards to market. We are actively engaged in enabling ourINTERIM REPORTFIRST half 2023card manufacturing partners  who collectively produce over 1.2 billion cards globally each year  to complete their card certification process and begin production shipments by the fourth quarter of this year.

Revenue increased 18% compared to the previous quarter and 32% year-over-year. For the first six months of 2023  revenues increased 29% compared to the same period in 2022.Gross profit margin was 22% for the second quarter of 2023 compared to 26% in the first quarter of 2023. Gross margin in the second quarter of 2023 was adversely impacted by inventory adjustments. Absent the inventory adjustments  gross margin would have been similar to the first quarter of 2023.Current revenues and product mix are based on high customer concentration with long-duration contracts. As we continue scaling the IDEX Pay solution  our margins are expected to expand as we broaden our customer base as well as increase software and solution sales as part of our product mix.Operating expenses  excluding cost of materials and depreciation  were $7.3 million in the second quarter and decreased from the previous quarter. As the company continues to transition from development to full commercial operations  further initiatives to streamline operations have been implemented after the second quarter of 2023. We aim to decrease operating expenses by approximately 30% compared to the first quarter of 2023. The cost reductions will impact the third quarter and take full effect by the end of 2023. The streamlined organization and expense optimization are aligned with the company's strategy and focus on commercial acceleration.In addition  the company's board of directors has voluntarily decided to delist the ADRs traded on Nasdaq (ticker IDBA). This action is part of the above reduction in the operating costs as the company's listing fees and additional public company costs related to the Nasdaq listing will lapse. The listing on the Euronext Oslo Børs of IDEX Biometrics shares (ticker IDEX) continues unchanged.Vince GrazianiChief Executive OfficerINTERIM REPORTFIRST half 2023IDEX BiometricsIDEX Biometrics is a global technology leader in fingerprint biometrics  offering authentication solutions across payments  access control  and digital identity.

Sequentially  second quarter revenue increased 18% from the first quarter of 2023  reflecting an increase in shipments to our two largest customers in the payment card segment. By comparison  second quarter 2022 revenue was $1.1 million for a year-over-year quarterly increase of 32%.For the first six months 2023  the Company recorded consolidated revenue of $2.7 million  compared to 2.1 million for the same period in 2022  representing an increase of 29%.Cost of materials increased by $0.1 million from $1.0 million for the second quarter of 2022  reflecting higher consumption of inventories associated with increased product sales.Cost of materials totaled $2.1 million the first six months 2023  compared to $1.7 million for the first six months 2022. Cost of materials as a percentage of revenue is impacted by product mix as well as costs of wafers  assembly services  and certain components. One-time costs such as the write-off of inventory are also included in cost of materials.Gross profit margin  as a percentage of revenue  was 22% for the second quarter of 2023  compared to 26% in the first quarter of 2023. The sequential decrease in gross margin was due inventory adjustments that adversely impacted gross margin. Absent the inventory adjustments  gross margin would have been similar to first quarter of 2023. For the second quarter of 2022  the gross profit margin was 7%. The lower margin in the second quarter of 2022 reflected higher costs of wafers  assembly services  and certain components  as well as the write-off of previous-generation products held in inventory.On a year-to-date basis  gross profit margin for the first six months of 2023 was 24%  compared to 18% for the first six months of 2022. Both product cost decreases  improved product pricing and an inventory write-off that was included in the second quarter of 2022 contributed to the increase in gross profit margin in the first half of 2023 as compared to the comparable prior period.Compensation and benefits expenses totaled $4.0 million for the second quarter of 2023  a decrease from $4.8 million for the second quarter of 2022. Compensation and benefits expenses totaled $8.4 million in the first six months of 2023 compared to $9.8 in 2022. The year-over-year decrease is due to staff reduction efforts implemented in 2022 partially offset by an increase in variable compensation.INTERIM REPORTFIRST half 2023Share-based compensation expense  which is non-cash  totaled $0.3 million for the second quarter of 2023  in contrast to $0.5 million recorded for the second quarter of 2022 and $0.4 million recorded for the first quarter of 2023. Quarterly variances in share-based compensation are attributable to the number of subscription rights vesting in the period  and changes in the price of an ordinary share which influences the accrual of estimated employer's tax which will be due when a subscription right is exercised. Share-based compensation expense totaled $0.7 million for the first six months of 2023  in contrast to $1.0 million recorded for the first six months of 2022  primarily because of reduced tax accruals due to lower share prices in 2023.Our staff is made up of employees and individual contractors. On a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis  our staff totaled 99 on June 30  2023  down from 108 on June 30  2022 and unchanged from the beginning of 2023. The year-over-year decrease in staff reflects the net of personnel additions in marketing and sales  offset by staff reductions in 2022 and attrition in R&D.Research and development (R&D) expenses include the external costs of product development  prototype manufacturing  and pre-release product testing. The cost of employees engaged in R&D is included in Compensation and benefits. R&D expenses are reported net of earned government grants in support of R&D activities.Timing of the receipt of such grants is generally subject to the completion of qualifying activities. Net R&D expenses  as presented  totaled $0.9 million for the second quarter of 2023  in contrast to $1.0 million for the second quarter of 2022 and $0.9 million for the first quarter of 2023.R&D expenses totaled $1.8 million for the first six months of 2023  in contrast to $2.0 million for the first six months of 2022. These costs are primarily design and development costs  product testing and qualification costs and costs related to patents and trademarks during the period.Other operating expenses  primarily expenses associated with marketing  sales  and administrative activities  totaled $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2023  in contrast to $2.3 million for the second quarter of 2022. Other operating expenses totaled $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase is associated largely with higher sales costs  reflecting the expansion of our commercial activities. Other operating expenses totaled $4.5 million for the first six months of 2023  in contrast to $4.3 million for the first six months of 2022  on similar factors to the quarter variation.Amortization and depreciation charges totaled $0.4 million for the second quarter of 2023  in contrast to $0.3 million for the second quarter of 2022 and $0.3 million for the first quarter of 2023. The depreciation charges are primarily associated with the depreciation of right-of-use assets.Amortization and depreciation charges totaled $0.7 million for the first six months of 2023  similar to $0.7 million for the first six months of 2022  due to stable depreciation of right-of-use assets.INTERIM REPORTFIRST half 2023Net financial items  consisting primarily of the net effect of currency adjustments and the net amount of interest income and interest expense  totaled expenses of $0.1 million for the second quarter of 2023  in contrast to expense of $0.9 million recorded for the second quarter of 2022. Net financial items totaled to an income of $0.2 million for the first quarter of 2023. Net financial items totaled income of $0.1 million for the first six months of 2023  compared to expense of $1.1 million in the first six months of 2022. The variation in net financial items between periods primarily is the result of fluctuations of the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar to other currencies of countries in which IDEX Biometrics has operations  mainly British Pounds to the U.S. dollar.The company recorded a minor amount of income tax expense for the first quarter of 2023 and no income tax expense in the first quarter of 2022.

The decreased year-over-year cash outflow for the second quarter was a consequence of the quarter's reduced net loss and lower working capital requirements.Operating cash outflow for the first six months of 2023 totaled $16.1 million  in contrast to an outflow of $17.4 million for the first six months of 2022. The year-over-year decrease in operating cash outflow was due to a lower net loss partially offset by higher working capital requirements.Investing activities (i.e.  capital expenditure) were insignificant for these periods.Total cash flow from financing activities  including the net proceeds from the issuance of shares and the net proceeds from the exercise of subscription rights  net of payments associated with lease liabilities  totaled $10.8 million for the second quarter of 2023  in contrast to an outflow $0.1 million for the second quarter of 2022.For the first six months of 2023  cash flow from financing activities totaled $10.9 million in contrast to an outflow $0.1 million for the first six months of 2022.IDEX Biometrics completed a private placement transaction during the second quarter of 2023.INTERIM REPORTFIRST half 2023The cash balance totaled $11.0 million as of June 30  2023  in contrast to $16.3 million as of June 30  2022  and $16.1 million as of December 31  2022.Statements of Financial PositionThe largest assets held on the company's Statements of financial position as of June 30  2023  were cash of $11.0 million  inventory of $6.5 and acquired intangible assets of $2.2 million  representing 40%  24% and 8% of total assets  respectively. Total intangible assets included goodwill of $968 thousand.IDEX Biometrics has developed intellectual property and has incurred product development costs. The value of self-developed IP is generally not recorded on the Statements of financial position  because it does not satisfy accounting criteria for capitalization. No development costs were capitalized during the six months ended June 30  2023. Tangible fixed assets  including the right-of-use value of leased assets  totaled  net of accumulated depreciation  $3.2 million as of June 30  2023  in contrast to $1.3 million as of June 30  2022  and $2.7 million at December 31  2022.Other than right-of-use leased assets  Tangible fixed assets are comprised of scientific and test equipment  engineering tools  leasehold improvements  office equipment  and furniture with useful lives of three to seven years.Inventory totaled $6.5 million as of June 30  2023  in contrast to $2.0 million as of June 30  2022  and $4.4 million as of December 31  2022. IDEX Biometrics is a fabless developer of semiconductor-based products  and its manufacturing operations are outsourced. Inventory consists of raw materials (primarily semiconductor components and substrates)  work-in-progress (primarily incomplete assemblies) and finished goods (completed fingerprint sensing devices available for sale). A large share of the inventories is physically located at the contract manufacturing partners' sites.There have been significant and uncertain lead times across the electronics industry in 2022. To reduce the risk of delays and reduce lead time for our customers  IDEX Biometrics increased inventory of long lead time materials and components such as silicon chips  as well as finished goods during 2022 and into 2023.Customer accounts receivable totaled $1.1 million as of June 30  2023  in contrast to $1.4 million as of June 30  2022  and $1.3 million as of December 31  2022. No customer accounts necessitated a bad debt reserve as of June 30  2023.Total short-term liabilities totaled $6.0 million as of June 30  2023  compared to $2.7 million as of June 30  2022  and $5.0 million as of December 31  2022. Variations in short-term liabilities are the result of activity levels such as increased accounts payable levels associated with higher purchases of inventories and the timing of expense accruals and the settlement of payables.INTERIM REPORTFIRST half 2023Net working capital (i.e.  short-term assets  excluding cash  less short-term liabilities) totaled $9.7 million as of June 30  2023  $4.6 million as of June 30  2022  and $6.2 million as of December 31  2022.As revenues continue to increase  net working capital will increase with the levels of inventory and customer accounts receivable. The increase will likely be partially offset by an increase in trade accounts payable.Equity totaled $19.6 million as of June 30  2023  in contrast to $22.8 million as of June 30  2022  and $22.8 million as of December 31  2022. The change during the periods was primarily the result of the private placements  offset by the net losses in the respective periods.At the end of 2022  IDEX Biometrics allocated $18.0 million of Paid-in capital against Accumulated losses. Total equity was not affected by the allocation.As of June 30  2023  the Company had no debt to financial institutions or lenders.LiquidityIDEX Biometrics incurred an operating cash deficit of $7.1 million for the second quarter of 2023  in contrast to operating cash deficits of $9.0 million for the second quarter of 2022 and $9.0 million for the first quarter of 2023.The operating cash deficit for the first six months of 2023 totaled $16.1 million  in contrast to a deficit of $17.4 million for the first six months of 2022.The primary operating cash items are the operating losses in each period  less non-cash expenses  including share-based compensation  depreciation  and amortization. Net working capital varies between quarters  mainly due to the timing of shipments  collections from customers  receipt of inventoried materials  and disbursements to vendors.The Company incurred capital expenditures of $190 thousand for the second quarter of 2023  in contrast to capital expenditures of $51 thousand for the second quarter of 2022  and a net income due to a vendor credit of $18 thousand for the first quarter of 2023.The Company's balance sheet solvency  defined as the value of cash and accounts receivable  less short-term liabilities  totaled $7.4 million as of June 30  2023  in contrast to $15.6 million as of June 30  2022  and $13.4 million as of December 31  2022.We have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows during the development stage of our business. While the Company has taken measures to significantly reduce operating expenses  it does not expect that its existing cash would enable it to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements for the next twelve months. The Company is exploring all options to raise additional capital by the end of 2023 to fund commercialization efforts.INTERIM REPORTFIRST half 2023While the Company has been successful in the past in raising funds through private placements of shares  there is no assurance that we will be successful in the future.The Company's failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on its financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategies.U.S. regulatory mattersThe Company's American Depositary Shares (each representing 75 of the Company's ordinary shares  which are listed on the Euronext Oslo Børs) are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol IDBA.

These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited annual financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022  which were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (""IASB"") and IFRS as endorsed by the European Union. The accounting policies applied herein are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022. Amounts presented may not sum precisely due to rounding.IDEX Biometrics operates in one operating segment  fingerprint imaging and recognition technology  and these interim financial statements present the full consolidation of the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries  reflecting this operational focus.Pursuant to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements  a going concern assumption has been applied in the preparation of these interim financial statements. The Company does not expect that its existing cash would enable it to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements for the next twelve months.INTERIM REPORTFIRST half 2023The Company plans to undertake a private placement of shares or procure other substantial funding by the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 to provide additional funding to support research and development and fund working capital. While the Company has been successful in the past in raising funds through private placements of shares  there is no assurance that we will be successful in the future. The Company's failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on its financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategies.These interim financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on August 9  2023.RisksIt is the duty of the Board of Directors to present the principal risks facing the Company in the conduct of its business. The Company's major risk is its business risk  broadly meaning risks to its ability to generate revenue and earn profit. Future revenue generation will depend  among other such risks  on the Company's ability to market and profitably deliver products on a sustained basis  its ability to legally protect its intellectual property rights  its ability to scale its operations to maximize efficiencies  and its ability to retain current employees and to attract new employees. The ability to generate future revenue is also highly dependent on the pace of development of the market for biometric payment cards  which remains in an early stage.We have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows during the development stage of our business. While the Company has taken measures to significantly reduce operating expenses  it does not expect that its existing cash would enable it to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements for the next twelve months. The Company is exploring all options to raise additional capital by the end of 2023 to fund commercialization efforts.The Company's assets primarily consist of cash  working capital  and intangible assets. As of June 30  2023  the Company had no indebtedness to financial institutions or other third-party lenders. The Company maintains liquidity by investing available funds in readily accessible  floating-interest rate bank accounts. The Company's exposure to currency exchange rate changes is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix of cash deposits in the various currencies it utilizes for its operations. The Company does not engage in any active hedging strategies. The U.S. Dollar is the dominant currency of the Company's receivables and payables.During 2022  the Company has experienced vendor shipment delays associated with supply chain constraints within the semiconductor industry. Continued supply chain constraints may further affect future inventory planning and timing of customer shipments. Semiconductor component availability may become a more significant risk factor as the Company's order stock and unit volumes expand.Revenue from contracts with customersThe Company records revenue from the sale of biometric fingerprint sensor products and the delivery of technical development and other engineering services to its customers. Product-related revenue is recognized upon shipment  generally on an Incoterms EXW (i.e.  ex-works) basis. Revenue is recognized according to the criteria of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.INTERIM REPORTFIRST half 2023The balances of customer accounts receivable as of June 30  2023  and December 31  2022  were $1.1 million and $1.3 million  respectively. There were no contract asset or contract liability balances at either of these dates.IDEX Biometrics categorizes customers by geographic region utilizing the addresses to which we invoice our products or services. The Company's products and service revenue by geographic region is as follows:Compensation and benefitsCompensation and benefit expenses consist of costs for direct employees of the Company. Individual contractors are classified as Research and development expenses or Other operating expenses  as applicable.The table below sets forth the number of employees and individual contractors by their function measured in full-time equivalents (FTE). Certain individuals are contractors because they live in countries in which the Company does not have a business presence.IDEX Biometrics presents operating expenses by nature  in contrast to function. Accordingly  Compensation and benefits expenses includes the compensation and benefit costs for all employees. Cost of materials  netINTERIM REPORTFIRST half 2023of inventory change  Research and development expenses  and Other operating expenses do not include the cost of personnel assigned to those activities.Research and development expensesResearch costs are expensed when incurred. Development costs are expensed unless they qualify for capitalization. The Company's patents and other intellectual property rights created are capitalized and recorded on the Statement of financial position only if they satisfy the criteria for capitalization. The Company has not capitalized development costs in any of the periods presented. Development costs related to the creation of intellectual property have been expensed when incurred.Government support is recognized when it is probable the Company will qualify and receive support  and the amount can be measured reliably. Norwegian SkatteFUNN grants are recorded in the fourth quarter each year.Related party transactionsThe chair of the Board of Directors  Lawrence J. Ciaccia  provides to the Company  pursuant to a written agreement  consulting services for a fixed fee of $50 thousand per year.Morten Opstad  a member of the Board  is a partner in the law firm Advokatfirma Ræder AS (Ræder). Ræder provided legal services to the Company during the first six months of 2023  resulting in charges of $35 thousand. Mr. Opstad's work on behalf of the Company beyond his Director duties is invoiced by Ræder.INTERIM REPORTFIRST half 2023Non-current assetsAcquired intangible assets and intellectual property rights have been capitalized at the time of acquisition. These assets are depreciated over their respective economic lives. The major items depreciate over 9.5 years and 17 years from acquisition  through July 2024 and to the end of 2030  respectively. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently  if circumstances merit. The Company is one cash generating unit for purposes of impairment testing.Financial itemsIncome tax expense 10The Company has significant accumulated tax losses. No deferred tax asset associated with these accumulated tax losses has been recorded on the Statement of financial position  as there is not sufficient evidence that taxable profit will be generated  against which the unused tax losses could be applied. There are no restrictions as to how long tax losses may be carried forward in Norway.INTERIM REPORTFIRST half 2023Loss per share 11The profit or loss per share is calculated by dividing the profit (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. Loss per share is calculated per basic share (i.e.  without consideration for the anti-dilutive effect of exercisable subscription rights).Shares and subscription rights 12From time to time  on a discretionary basis  IDEX Biometrics awards subscription rights for the purchase of Ordinary Shares to employees and individual contractors  pursuant to the terms of an annual subscription rights program approved by shareholders at that year's annual general meeting (AGM). Such subscription rights are denominated in Norwegian Krone. Unless specifically resolved otherwise by the Board of Directors  25% of each grant of subscription rights vests per year  and the grant expires on the fifthINTERIM REPORTFIRST half 2023anniversary of the AGM at which the program was approved. Unvested subscription rights terminate on the holder's last day of employment or termination of contract. Vested subscription rights may be exercised up to 90 days after such termination date. The weighted average exercise price of outstanding incentive subscription rights on June 30  2023  was NOK 1.67 per share.The fair value at grant date of a subscription right is expensed over the vesting period of each tranche of the grant. The fair value of each tranche of a subscription right is determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model  based on Ordinary Share prices quoted on the Euronext Oslo Børs and published interest rates. The Company's social security tax obligations related to share-based remuneration are recorded on each balance sheet date  based on the earned value of the subscription rights outstanding  and the adjustment to the accrued balance is recorded as cost.The Company operates an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP)  whereby employees may elect to invest a portion of their after-tax compensation in newly issued ordinary shares. Employees make payroll contributions to the ESPP over the course of six-month contribution periods  March-August  and September-February. At the end of each period  they purchase shares at a 15% discount to the lesser of the share price at the beginning and ending of the contribution period.The cost of the ESPP is amortized over each contribution period. The cost is based on the contribution amount  the 15% discount  and a Black-Scholes option pricing model at the beginning of the period.Inventory 13Inventory  consisting of raw materials (primarily semiconductor components and substrates)  work-in-progress  and finished goods (completed fingerprint sensing devices available for sale)  is valued at the lower of cost or recoverable value  reflecting reserves based on aging and obsolescence. Period to period variations in reserve balances are mainly caused by time between the identification of an impairment (i.e.  the calculation of a reserve charge) and the physical disposal of the inventory in question.Events after the balance sheet date 14On July 21  2023 IDEX Biometrics gave notice to the Nasdaq Stock Market of the Company's intention to voluntary delist American Depositary Shares (ADSs) representing its ordinary shares. The ADS delisting will have no impact on the Company's accounting standards  and IDEX Biometrics intends to continue its disclosures in compliance with applicable Norwegian financial market regulations.

With the American market now liberalised for gambling  the opportunity in the US is potentially huge. That was the spur for the company’s decision to pursue a New York stock market listing.Such a move is intended to give Flutter and its US subsidiary  FanDuel  a higher profile and access to deeper capital markets there  promote great liquidity in the shares and give it the potential to pursue a primary US listing and access to indices across the Atlantic.Shareholders have already given the green light for a listing in the US  which the company said would happen either late this year or in the first quarter of 2024. It is then a question of whether this listing becomes its primary one and what Flutter then does with the London and Dublin listings. London is the primary listing and news of Flutter’s likely switch to New York is regarded there as a reputational blow to the FTSE 100.Challenging times ahead for Irish Stock Exchange as big companies look to the US Listen | 43:24It remains to be seen what happens to the Dublin listing.

Price competition increased amid volatile market conditions  putting further pressure on our volumes and thus also on our gross profit. The answer to this challenge lies in implementing the strategy  in which local responsibility with commercial flexibility and a differentiated approach is key. The reorganisation that this requires is being implemented this year. The outcome is a given: fewer management positions and short lines to the customer. Feed quality is paramount in our offering to customers. We use our knowledge of nutrition and are enforcing cost saving programmes to offer competitive selling prices in our local markets. This approach must lead to improved volume and thus gross profit development. We are convinced that in our markets we can contribute to a strong agricultural chain in which sustainability and returns go hand in hand. We are making progress in ESG; we are increasingly working with farmers and chain partners to further reduce our carbon footprint by  for example  using more residual flows and by providing specific advice. Geographically  choices have been made.We expect to finalise the announced sale of the activities in Belgium by the end of the third quarter. An associated impairment charge has already been included in these results. The choices we have made in the Germany/Poland cluster are encouraging  as evidenced by the results  as is our choice for a differentiated approach to the ruminant sector in the United Kingdom.

Annualised return on tangible equity at 14.3%Paris  10 August 2023 – 17.35Turnover for the first half of the year: €960m  up 11.1% at constant FX and perimeter and 9.9% on a reported basis Trade credit insurance rose +11.2% at constant FX  driven by increased client activity and growth in fee and commission income (+11.3%) Client retention stood at a record high (94.4%); the price effect was still negative (-2.0%) but less so than in H1-22 Business information momentum continues with double-digit growth (+14.8% at constant FX); factoring up by +5.4%  reflecting clear economic slowdown in Germany and PolandNet loss ratio at 40.3% in H1-23  up by 3.8 ppts; net combined ratio at 65.5%  up by 2.2 ppts (and +8.3 ppts compared to H1-22  excluding the impact of government schemes) Gross loss ratio at 39.4%  up 7.4 ppts in a risk environment that is still normalising Net cost ratio down by 1.6 ppt to 25.2% as a result of an improved product mix and high reinsurance commissions  while investments continueNet income (group share) at €128.8m  including €67.7m for Q2-23; annualised RoATE 1 at 14.3% Estimated solvency ratio at 19 2 % 2 above the target range (155% - 175%)Unless otherwise indicated  change comparisons refer to the pro forma IFRS 17 results as at 30 June 2022.Xavier Durand  Coface’s Chief Executive Officer  commented:“In the first half of the year  Coface’s turnover grew by 11.1%  against a backdrop of falling commodity prices with lower energy prices easing  at least temporarily  inflationary pressures. With economic growth still weak particularly in China and Europe  and rising financing costs  the financial health of many companies is deteriorating. Since the beginning of the year  Coface  in close collaboration with its customers  has thus significantly stepped up its preventive actions on its risk portfolio.Over the past quarter  Coface’s results amounted to €68m  a high level reflecting our proactive management of an increasing loss environment and tight cost control. Combined ratio for the quarter stands at 65.5% under the new IFRS 17 accounting standards.Our strong performance is also reflected in the growth of services  such as business information  which recorded another quarter of double-digit increase (+14.8% during the first semester). All these elements have enabled Coface to deliver an annualised RoATE of 14.3% since the beginning of the year  well above its mid-cycle targets.Finally  Coface will present its new strategic plan on 5th March 2024.”Key figures at 30 June 2023The Board of Directors of COFACE SA examined the consolidated financial statements at 30 June 2023 at its meeting of 10 August 2023. The Audit Committee  at its meeting on 9 August 2023  also previously reviewed them. These interim consolidated financial statements have been subject to limited review by the statutory auditors.

The final calculation may differ from this preliminary calculation. The estimated solvency ratio is not audited.1. TurnoverCoface recorded a consolidated turnover of €959.7m  up +11.1% compared to H1-22  at constant FX and perimeter. As reported (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover rose +9.9%.Turnover from the insurance business (including surety bonds and single risk) increased +11.2% at constant perimeter and FX. Growth benefited from a sharp increase in client activity as well as a record retention level of 94.4%  up +0.5% compared to H1-22. New business totalled €63m  up €5m compared to H1-22 driven by the mid-market engine  and has now returned to pre-COVID levels (€65m in H1-19).The growth in Coface’s client activity had a positive impact of +2.8% during H1-23. This increase continues to reflect the scale of the recent economic recovery and inflation  but the pace of growth is now slowing sharply (-5.2 ppts compared to H1-22). The price effect remained negative at -2.0% in H1-23 but improved compared to H1-22 (-3.0%). This decrease is largely explained by a very low past claims experience and was limited by the normalisation of the risk environment.Turnover from non-insurance activities was up +10.4% compared to H1-22. All the business lines are experiencing positive trends but at different scales. Turnover from factoring rose +5.4%  mainly due to the increase in volumes refinanced in Germany. Information services turnover rose +14.8%  maintaining its growth trend. Fee and commission income (debt collection commissions) increased +35.0% due to the increase in claims to be collected. Commissions were up +11.3%.Total revenue - in €m(by country of invoicing) H1-22 H1-23 Variation % ex.

Trade credit insurance benefited from the increase in client activity and a high retention rate. Turnover from factoring and services increased +7.6% and +30.3% respectively.In Western Europe  turnover was up +16.5% at constant FX (+16.5% at current FX) due to a high retention rate and client activity. Q1-23 benefited from a positive one-off on alignment of accounting methodology.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover was up by +0.4% and +1.8% at current FX  due to the decline in business in Russia. Excluding Russia  growth would be +5.7%.In the Mediterranean and Africa region  which is driven by Italy and Spain  turnover rose +15.2% and +12.7% at current FX due to a high retention rate and client activity. Service revenues and commissions increased by +13.5%.In North America  turnover increased +7.1% at constant FX and +7.2% as reported  driven by client activities and a high retention rate.In Latin America  turnover was up +23.2% at constant FX and +13.0% at current FX  driven by high retention and the increase in client activity.In Asia-Pacific  turnover increased +4.9% at constant FX and +3.5% at current FX. This growth was driven by high retention and a recovery in activity in the second quarter.2. ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio net of reinsurance was 65.5% in H1-23  up +2.2 ppts year on year. This ratio was up 8.3 ppts compared to H1-22 when excluding the effect of government schemes.(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 39.4%  up 7.4 ppts compared to the previous year. This reflects an increased claims frequency since H1-21  with the number of claims close to pre-COVID levels  and the return of relatively large claims  which nevertheless remain below average. Reserve releases remain high.The Group’s reserving policy remains unchanged. The amount of provisions related to the underwriting year  although discounted  remains in line with the historical average. Strict management of past claims enabled the Group to record 36.3 ppts of recoveries.The net loss ratio rose to 40.3%  an increase of 3.8 ppts compared to H1-22 (and up 9.6 ppts compared to H1-22 excluding the impact of government schemes).(ii) Cost ratioCoface follows a strict cost management policy. In the second quarter 2023  Coface maintained its discipline  with costs growing by +10.2% at constant FX and perimeter  and +7.7% at current FX. This increase in costs is lower than the growth in turnover  even though Coface continued to invest. The cost ratio before reinsurance was 29.8%  an increase of 0.2 ppt year on year.The cost ratio net of reinsurance was 25.2% in H1-23  an improvement of 1.6 ppt year on year.Financial resultNet financial income for the first half was €1.4m. This amount includes market value adjustments for -€15.2m (particularly on real estate funds)  positive hedging results  and a currency effect of -€17.4m due to the application of IAS 29 (hyperinflation) in Argentina and Turkey and the rise in the euro against the other currencies in which the group does business.The portfolio’s current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  depreciation and FX impact) was €31.9m. The accounting yield4  excluding capital gains and the fair value effect  was 1.1% in H1-23. The yield on new investments was 3.4%.Operating income and net incomeOperating income amounted to €184.8m in H1-23  down -1.8%. It continues to benefit mainly from revenue growth.The effective tax rate was 24% (unchanged from H1-22).In total  net income (group share) stood at €128.8m  down -4.4% compared to H1-22  of which €67.7m in Q2-23.3. Shareholders’ equityAt 30 June 2023  Group shareholders’ equity stood at €1 925.3m  down €93.3m  or -4.6% (compared to €2 018.6m at 31 December 2022).This change is mainly due to positive net income of €128.8m  the payment of the dividend (-€227.0m) and a rise in unrealised capital gains (€16.7m).The annualised return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 14.3% at 30 June 2023  mainly due to the improvement in underwriting income.The solvency ratio reached 192%5  stable compared to H1-22. It remains well above the upper end of the target range (155%-175%).4. OutlookIn the second quarter of the year  the global economy benefited from a decline in commodity prices  which concerned both energy and non-energy. In particular  oil prices suffered from a weak demand outlook  notably due to the lack of a real rebound of the Chinese economy. This latter is experiencing a persistently soft industrial cycle and is suffering from the relocation of some production facilities to other countries because of geostrategic uncertainties.Inflation remains the key concern for central banks. The recent decline in oil prices brought a welcome relief in inflationary pressure but it could rapidly revert should demand recover. Central banks are therefore expected to continue tightening their monetary policies  which should keep global growth at a modest level both in 2023 and 2024.Against this backdrop of slow growth and rising interest rates  Coface anticipates a further increase in business defaults. Accordingly  Coface has significantly stepped up its preventive actions on the risk portfolio in close relationship with its clients  in line with its strategy.The credit insurance sector is entering a new phase of its cycle  which will see weaker and potentially negative client activity  a rise in business failures  and insurance prices bottoming out. Against this clearly less favourable backdrop  Coface continues to manage its risks rigorously  while remaining faithful to its strategy of close collaboration with its customers.As the Build to Lead strategic plan nears its end  Coface is actively preparing its next plan  which will be presented to investors on 5th March 2024.Coface’s operations continue to be backed by a solid balance sheet. The solvency ratio reached 192%6  above the target range (155% - 175%).Conference call for financial analystsCoface’s results for H1-2023 will be discussed with financial analysts during the conference call on 10 August 2023 at 18.00 (Paris time).

With economic growth still weak particularly in China and Europe  and rising financing costs  the financial health of many companies is deteriorating. Since the beginning of the year  Coface  in close collaboration with its customers  has thus significantly stepped up its preventive actions on its risk portfolio.Over the past quarter  Coface’s results amounted to €68m  a high level reflecting our proactive management of an increasing loss environment and tight cost control. Combined ratio for the quarter stands at 65.5% under the new IFRS 17 accounting standards.Our strong performance is also reflected in the growth ofservices  such as business information  which recorded another quarter of double-digit increase (+14.8% during the first semester). All these elements have enabled Coface to deliver an annualised RoATE of 14.3% since the beginning of the year  well above its mid-cycle targets.Finally  Coface will present its new strategic plan on 5th March 2024.”Key figures at 30 June 2023The Board of Directors of COFACE SA examined the consolidated financial statements at 30 June 2023 at its meeting of 10 August 2023.

The final calculation may differ from this preliminary calculation. The estimated solvency ratio is not audited.1. TurnoverCoface recorded a consolidated turnover of €959.7m  up +11.1% compared to H1-22  at constant FX and perimeter. As reported (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover rose +9.9%.Turnover from the insurance business (including surety bonds and single risk) increased +11.2% at constant perimeter and FX. Growth benefited from a sharp increase in client activity as well as a record retention level of 94.4%  up +0.5% compared to H1-22. New business totalled €63m  up €5m compared to H1-22 driven by the mid-market engine  and has now returned to pre-COVID levels (€65m in H1-19).The growth in Coface’s client activity had a positive impact of +2.8% during H1-23. This increase continues to reflect the scale of the recent economic recovery and inflation  but the pace of growth is now slowing sharply (-5.2 ppts compared to H1-22). The price effect remained negative at -2.0% in H1-23 but improved compared to H1-22 (-3.0%). This decrease is largely explained by a very low past claims experience and was limited by the normalisation of the risk environment.Turnover from non-insurance activities was up +10.4% compared to H1-22. All the business lines are experiencing positive trends but at different scales. Turnover from factoring rose +5.4%  mainly due to the increase in volumes refinanced in Germany. Information services turnover rose +14.8%  maintaining its growth trend. Fee and commission income (debt collection commissions) increased +35.0% due to the increase in claims to be collected. Commissions were up +11.3%.Total revenue - in €m(by country of invoicing) H1-22 H1-23 Variation % ex.

Trade credit insurance benefited from the increase in client activity and a high retention rate. Turnover from factoring and services increased +7.6% and +30.3% respectively.In Western Europe  turnover was up +16.5% at constant FX (+16.5% at current FX) due to a high retention rate and client activity. Q1-23 benefited from a positive one-off on alignment of accounting methodology.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover was up by +0.4% and +1.8% at current FX  due to the decline in business in Russia. Excluding Russia  growth would be +5.7%.In the Mediterranean and Africa region  which is driven by Italy and Spain  turnover rose +15.2% and +12.7% at current FX due to a high retention rate and client activity. Service revenues and commissions increased by +13.5%.In North America  turnover increased +7.1% at constant FX and +7.2% as reported  driven by client activities and a high retention rate.In Latin America  turnover was up +23.2% at constant FX and +13.0% at current FX  driven by high retention and the increase in client activity.In Asia-Pacific  turnover increased +4.9% at constant FX and +3.5% at current FX. This growth was driven by high retention and a recovery in activity in the second quarter.2. ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio net of reinsurance was 65.5% in H1-23  up +2.2 ppts year on year. This ratio was up 8.3 ppts compared to H1-22 when excluding the effect of government schemes.(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 39.4%  up 7.4 ppts compared to the previous year. This reflects an increased claims frequency since H1-21  with the number of claims close to pre-COVID levels  and the return of relatively large claims  which nevertheless remain below average. Reserve releases remain high.The Group’s reserving policy remains unchanged. The amount of provisions related to the underwriting year  although discounted  remains in line with the historical average. Strict management of past claims enabled the Group to record 36.3 ppts of recoveries.The net loss ratio rose to 40.3%  an increase of 3.8 ppts compared to H1-22 (and up 9.6 ppts compared to H1-22 excluding the impact of government schemes).(ii) Cost ratioCoface follows a strict cost management policy. In the second quarter 2023  Coface maintained its discipline  with costs growing by +10.2% at constant FX and perimeter  and +7.7% at current FX. This increase in costs is lower than the growth in turnover  even though Coface continued to invest. The cost ratio before reinsurance was 29.8%  an increase of 0.2 ppt year on year.The cost ratio net of reinsurance was 25.2% in H1-23  an improvement of 1.6 ppt year on year.Financial resultNet financial income for the first half was €1.4m. This amount includes market value adjustments for -€15.2m (particularly on real estate funds)  positive hedging results  and a currency effect of -€17.4m due to the application of IAS 29 (hyperinflation) in Argentina and Turkey and the rise in the euro against the other currencies in which the group does business.The portfolio’s current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  depreciation and FX impact) was €31.9m. The accounting yield4  excluding capital gains and the fair value effect  was 1.1% in H1-23. The yield on new investments was 3.4%.Operating income and net incomeOperating income amounted to €184.8m in H1-23  down -1.8%. It continues to benefit mainly from revenue growth.The effective tax rate was 24% (unchanged from H1-22).In total  net income (group share) stood at €128.8m  down -4.4% compared to H1-22  of which €67.7m in Q2-23.3. Shareholders’ equityAt 30 June 2023  Group shareholders’ equity stood at €1 925.3m  down €93.3m  or -4.6% (compared to €2 018.6m at 31 December 2022).This change is mainly due to positive net income of €128.8m  the payment of the dividend (-€227.0m) and a rise in unrealised capital gains (€16.7m).The annualised return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 14.3% at 30 June 2023  mainly due to the improvement in underwriting income.The solvency ratio reached 192%5  stable compared to H1-22. It remains well above the upper end of the target range (155%-175%).4. OutlookIn the second quarter of the year  the global economy benefited from a decline in commodity prices  which concerned both energy and non-energy. In particular  oil prices suffered from a weak demand outlook  notably due to the lack of a real rebound of the Chinese economy. This latter is experiencing a persistently soft industrial cycle and is suffering from the relocation of some production facilities to other countries because of geostrategic uncertainties.Inflation remains the key concern for central banks. The recent decline in oil prices brought a welcome relief in inflationary pressure but it could rapidly revert should demand recover. Central banks are therefore expected to continue tightening their monetary policies  which should keep global growth at a modest level both in 2023 and 2024.Against this backdrop of slow growth and rising interest rates  Coface anticipates a further increase in business defaults. Accordingly  Coface has significantly stepped up its preventive actions on the risk portfolio in close relationship with its clients  in line with its strategy.The credit insurance sector is entering a new phase of its cycle  which will see weaker and potentially negative client activity  a rise in business failures  and insurance prices bottoming out. Against this clearly less favourable backdrop  Coface continues to manage its risks rigorously  while remaining faithful to its strategy of close collaboration with its customers.As the Build to Lead strategic plan nears its end  Coface is actively preparing its next plan  which will be presented to investors on 5th March 2024.Coface’s operations continue to be backed by a solid balance sheet. The solvency ratio reached 192%6  above the target range (155% - 175%).Conference call for financial analystsCoface’s results for H1-2023 will be discussed with financial analysts during the conference call on 10 August 2023 at 18.00 (Paris time).
