He reiterated his desire to leave the club that trained him  during the current off-season  and join RB Leipzig. Given the player's reluctance and the fact that he was not part of the club's team strategy  Olympique Lyonnais agreed to open negotiations with Leipzig  the third-place finisher in the Bundesliga last season.Castello's departure marks the end of a successful career with OL. Castello joined OL in 2011 at the age of eight. After climbing the ranks of the Academy  he signed his first professional contract in July 2021  for a duration of three years. He appeared in his first professional match a month later in the season opener against Brest in Groupama Stadium. The U21 French international (12 caps) started four Euro matches for the U21 national team this summer. He appeared in 68 matches and scored four goals with OL  all competitions combined.Olympique Lyonnais regrets that it could not keep Castello Lukeba on its squad but also wants its team to be composed of players who are fully engaged and determined to contribute to the club's strategy so that it can achieve the best possible results this season.OL GROUPETel: +33 (0)4 81 07 55 00Fax: +33 (0)4 81 07 45 65Email: investisseurs@ol.frwww.ol.frEuronext Paris - Segment CIndices: CAC Small – CAC Mid & Small – CAC All-Tradable – CAC All-Share – CAC Consumer DiscretionaryISIN code: FR0010428771Reuters: OLG.PABloomberg: OLG FPICB: 40501030 Recreational servicesThis publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: lWxqYpmZZG2WnHFuYZeanJJmmmpmk5WaamWcmmhomJfGb21kmJqUb5SVZnFimWps- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Inside Information:- other releases Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/81456-olg-110823-transfert-de-castello-lukeba-gb.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2023 ActusNews",neutral,0.03,0.95,0.01,mixed,0.19,0.29,0.52,True,English,"['Olympique Lyonnais Groupe', 'Castello Lukeba', 'RB Leipzig', 'The U21 French international (12 caps', 'German club RB Leipzig', 'first professional match', 'U21 national team', 'best possible results', 'Segment C Indices', 'original press release', 'next press releases', 'first professional contract', 'four Euro matches', 'SECURITY MASTER Key', 'Actusnews SECURITY MASTER', 'back Castello Lukeba', 'four goals', 'other releases', 'Olympique Lyonnais', 'capital gain', 'future transfer', 'John Textor', 'new extension', 'third-place finisher', 'successful career', 'three years', 'Groupama Stadium', 'Euronext Paris', 'ISIN code', 'OLG.PA', 'OLG FP', 'Recreational services', 'team strategy', 'season opener', 'OL GROUPE', 'Regulated information', 'OL.

Those impacts may include closer regulatory scrutiny for both traditional and non-bank lenders  according to Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions expert Kevin Wilzbach.“Depository institutions can expect closer scrutiny of financial positions and investment strategies. We'll almost certainly see a push for more oversight by both federal and state authorities of risk management at nonbanks – not just mortgage banks  but fintechs  hedge funds  crypto  etc. ” Wilzbach argues in his article  “How Bank Failures May Soon Impact Non-Bank Lenders ” published by National Mortgage News.“The Financial Stability Oversight Council has already proposed rules that would facilitate the designation of nonbanks as systemically important  subjecting them to Federal Reserve supervision  and an ‘analytic framework’ that it would use when evaluating a company's ‘potential risk or threat to U.S. financial stability ’” he writes.Wilzbach also discusses how fair lending practices  servicing loss mitigation efforts and unfair  deceptive  and abusive practices will likely be under increased focus.“Data and analytics and advanced compliance systems are essential in preventing ‘failures’ in the broadest sense of that term – not only catastrophic financial events  but major  significant compliance problems that can create reputational damage. Data is a strategic asset  enabling deep insight into customer behavior  and informed decision-making ” Wilzbach notes. “It also is essential in meeting compliance obligations  a core element in risk management and can be a competitive differentiator. Better data and analytics and dashboards can provide greater transparency for your C-Suite and Board. Data can also provide early warning signs for major lending issues  such as redlining  appraisal bias or to identify practices that could be deemed unfair or abusive.”National Mortgage News is an award-winning  comprehensive digital information resource serving the entire residential mortgage industry  including depositories  nonbank lenders and servicers  brokerage firms  vendors  and regulators.Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions is a market leader and trusted provider of risk management and regulatory compliance solutions and services to U.S. banks  credit unions  insurers and securities firms.

You don’t waste time finding someone who wants to sell the exact number of Apple shares you need. And if you want to sell a Treasury Bond  you don’t need to post an ad and wait for a buyer—you click a button.Since modern financial exchanges got their start a few hundred years ago  a role has emerged for “market makers”—once individuals  now firms that buy whatever people want to sell  and sell whatever people want to buy  again  and again  and again. This provides market participants liquidity  or the ability to quickly cash into (or out of) a security.AdvertisementMarket makers profit from the small difference between the cost to buy and the cost to sell  racking up gains by trading constantly  but they have to carefully hedge risk during changes in sentiment and not hold any one asset for too long. Originally the decision-makers were individuals  then partnerships  and then desks at major banks.But if market-making sounds like something that could be automated  congratulations  you understand the financial industry. Now  software is doing most of the market-making at independent securities firms  and in the brave new world of decentralized finance  even doing it without supervision.Advertisement AdvertisementAre you ready to bid  fellow human?By the digits$6.3 billion: Average daily value of stocks bought and sold in the US during five days in August 2023Advertisement29.1: Average spread  in basis points  between bids to buy stock and offers to sell it on the NYSE during heavy trading in 20190.12 seconds: Average execution speed of a stock trade performed for a retail investor by E*TRADE in June 2023Advertisement40%: Share of US retail stock trades handled by Citadel Securities  the largest market maker in the US$4.2 billion: Revenue earned by Citadel Securities in 2022  a record for the firmAdvertisementChatNYSEAdvertisementThe rise of robotic market makersThe business of making markets has always been high intensity—consider the classic stock exchange image of men in funny jackets screamin g at each other .

Finding the right algorithms isn’t so simple  since the real world (and its effects on the markets) is so hard to predict.AdvertisementHigh-frequency trading—a strategy that uses computers to arbitrage orders in minutes—has taken on some of the liquidity provision once done by market makers. The approach  however  has been blamed for “flas h crashes ” dramatic plunges in market value caused by haywire trading computers.In the crypto world  meanwhile  proponents of decentralized finance want the market making to b e done not just by algorithm  but by algorithms that aren’t controlled by any one institution.
