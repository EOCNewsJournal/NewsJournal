Chiemeka stressed that the tech board is geared at encouraging tech firms to come to the market and raise capital in local currency  which would prove beneficial amid the high interest rate environment that had made foreign investors hawkish.While stating that the issue of settlements may discourage fintechs from accessing capital in US dollars on the public market  Chiemeka revealed that the Exchange was working on a partnership that is directed at fixing that problem.He said  “NGX is working with CSCS and Euroclear to create a dollar settlement platform that allows tech companies (start-ups or existing ones) to raise capital in dollars. We have reviewed listing procedures for tech companies who want to list. Requirements around number of shareholders  years of operation among others have been relaxed to catalyse these listings.”Owing to the high interest rate environment  Chiemeka said that domestic investors had been allocating their Assets under Management (AuM) to majorly FGN bonds. He further revealed that there had been more outflows than inflows from FPIs and that had impacted the performance of equities in recent times  especially as regards volume and value of transactions.He called on the present administration to eke out deliberate and enabling policies to drive listings on the exchange’s platform.“The government needs to be deliberate on policies that will encourage corporates to list and now that it is thinking of creating palliatives due to removal of subsidy  they can also consider those that will incentivise companies list and see the domestic capital markets as choice platforms to raise capital. Publicly traded companies pay more taxes and are better governed so there is an upside for government in driving more listings.This will go a long way to encourage these institutions to look into the local markets.” Chiemeka said.READ ALSO FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.0,mixed,0.29,0.33,0.37,True,English,"['dollar settlement platform', 'NGX partners', 'CSCS', 'Euroclear', 'Fintechs', 'Annual A&O Fintech webinar', 'high interest rate environment', 'Central Securities Clearing System', 'dollar settlement platform', 'stricter governance requirements', 'NIGERIAN Exchange Limited', 'domestic capital markets', 'Fueling Fintech', 'domestic investors', 'Nigerian economy', 'NIGERIAN TRIBUNE', 'public markets', 'private markets', 'local markets', 'same time', 'Divisional Head', 'viable options', 'regulatory rule', 'local currency', 'foreign investors', 'listing procedures', 'FGN bonds', 'recent times', 'present administration', 'choice platforms', 'long way', 'The Exchange', 'Exchange Commission', 'CSCS) Plc', 'technology board', 'capital formation', 'US dollars', 'Jude Chiemeka', 'NGX', 'Euroclear', 'startups', 'partnership', 'opportunities', 'access', 'shares', 'growth', 'democratisation', 'theme', 'Power', 'Role', 'Regulation', 'fintechs', 'disclosure', 'issue', 'approval', 'companies', 'firms', 'settlements', 'problem', 'start-ups', 'existing', 'number', 'shareholders', 'years', 'operation', 'others', 'listings', 'Assets', 'Management', 'AuM', 'outflows', 'inflows', 'FPIs', 'performance', 'equities', 'volume', 'value', 'transactions', 'policies', 'government', 'corporates', 'palliatives', 'removal', 'subsidy', 'taxes', 'upside', 'institutions']",2023-08-14,2023-08-14,tribuneonlineng.com

In the first nine months of the current financial year  DKR was thus able to achieve annualised rent increases of around 3.7% (l-f-l) or EUR 2.1 million from rent indexations. The annualised rent of the real estate portfolio thus rose to EUR 78.9 million.Rental income rose from EUR 36.5 million to EUR 38.2 million (adjusted for one-off effects). At 4.6%  this increase was slightly lower than the rise in rental income  which is primarily due to price increases in operating and maintenance costs.Funds from operations (""FFO"")  on the other hand  fell by around 15% or EUR 4.6 million to EUR 27.0 million (EUR 0.77 per share). This decline is mainly due to the increase in borrowing costs of around EUR 3.4 million and the higher operating costs of the portfolio.In addition  aFFO (FFO after deduction of capitalised modernisation measures) fell by 38.5% to EUR 12.7m due to a higher investment volume for modernisation measures.Real estate valuation cycle changed to 30 SeptemberDue to the volatile interest rate and Inflation environment  the Company has now changed the regular valuation of the real estate portfolio by an external and independent real estate appraiser from 30 June to 30 September of each year  in contrast to previous years  and will continue to do so in the future. In this respect  no current property valuation is available as of the reporting date.Balance sheet value of the real estate portfolio at EUR 1.1 billion with annual rents of EUR 78.9 millionDKR's real estate portfolio recognised on 30 June 2023 comprises of 184 retail properties with a balance sheet value of around EUR 1 112.5 million (30 September 2022: EUR 1 050.7 million) and a rental area of around 1 085 000 sqm. As of the balance sheet date  the annualised rent amounts to EUR 78.9 million (30 September 2022: EUR 73.2 million).The average acquisition yield of the total portfolio is currently around 10.0%.Apart from the acquisition of a food discounter in Suhl (Thuringia) with an initial yield of around 10%  no further acquisitions have been made so far. In the coming months  DKR expects an improving price equilibrium on the transaction market  which will result in attractive acquisition opportunities.In contrast  a DIY store in Chemnitz was sold in 9M 2022/2023 for a sales price of around 17.5 times the annual rent (or 5.7% initial yield)  and two vacant properties in Bavaria (Scheyern and Salzweg) were sold for around EUR 2.3 million. In addition  DKR notarised the sale of the former Real hypermarket in Trier-Kenn in June. The transfer of benefits and encumbrances is expected to take place in the course of 2024 after the conditions for maturity have been met.EPRA NTA rises to EUR 11.37 per share / Net LTV at 51.2%EPRA NTA per share increased to EUR 11.37 as at the balance sheet date of 30 June 2023 (30 September 2022: EUR 10.98 per share) due to the positive result for the period.Net LTV as of the balance sheet date is 51.2%  which is slightly above the target level of around 50%.Brandenburg Fiscal Court denied appeals against tax paymentsBy notification dated 17 July 2023  DKR reported that the Brandenburg Fiscal Court has for the time being denied DKRs appeals against tax payments in the legal dispute over the recognition of DKR's REIT status with the Potsdam tax office. Accordingly  DKR now has to pay corporation and trade taxes in the amount of EUR 16.2 million  which are to be paid from existing funds. In the main case  the Company is still in internal discussions about the further procedural possibilities and prospects of success.FFO forecast confirmedFor the current financial year  the Management Board confirms an FFO of between EUR 36 million and EUR 39 million on the basis of current conditions.Webcast and Conference CallDeutsche Konsum REIT-AG will hold an analyst conference (webcast and conference call) on the results of the first nine months of 2022/2023 financial year today   14 August 2023   at 10:00 a.m. CEST/SAST.
