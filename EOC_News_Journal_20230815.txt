28995,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/esg-cheerleaders-suddenly-pivoting-running-cover,ESG cheerleaders are suddenly pivoting and and running for cover,Some of the leaders of the biggest investment firms in the country have been champions for ESG or environmental  social and governance investments schemes.,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!The more the dirty little secrets about environmental  social and governance (ESG) investment schemes are revealed  the faster even its most strident proponents run away from it. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink  the poster CEO for ESG investing  recently said he’ll no longer be using the term ""ESG"" and that he's ""ashamed"" to be part of the debate on the issue.There should be little wonder that those involved with the nefarious ESG scheme are running for cover. The influential German-owned proxy advisory firm ISS appears to be the latest to distance itself from ESG.With the assistance of ISS  investment firm giants such as BlackRock  StateStreet and Vanguard have been leveraging their massive investment portfolios — which include state pension funds and hardworking Americans’ retirement nest eggs – to force companies to advance radical political goals.GOP ATTACKS BLACKROCK AS FINK PIVOTS ON ESGIt’s certainly egregious that these firms are using their investors’ assets – without the investors’ knowledge or consent – to pursue an activist ESG agenda with which many of those investors vehemently disagree. But it’s even more important that these ESG investing schemes diminish returns for state pension and retirement funds  and that crosses a line  compelling state treasurers and financial officers to step in and exercise their fiduciary responsibilities.Several state treasurers and financial officers have been examining the role of proxy-advisory services in the context of shareholder proposals that in recent years have been dominated by ESG items  some of which appear to be ideological efforts to undermine companies at their very foundations  reducing profits and investors’ returns.It would be an understatement to say that proxy-advisory firms such as ISS and its main competitor Glass Lewis have an outsized influence over how thousands of their corporate clients vote on shareholder proposals.S&P GLOBAL RATINGS IS ‘NO LONGER PUBLISHING’ ESG SCORES IN ITS REPORTSCombined  ISS and Glass Lewis control 97% of all proxy advisory business. In the 2020 proxy season alone  114 institutional investors with over $5 trillion in assets under management voted in line with ISS and Glass Lewis guidance on 99.5% or more of proposals. Such profound influence upon the outcomes of millions of votes at public companies directly impacts the financial well-being of millions of retail investors over time—including the taxpayers and pension beneficiaries who rely on elected state financial officials to safeguard their public funds.In a recent joint letter to proxy-advisory services  22 state treasurers and financial officers representing 19 states expressed concern over proxy advisors’ secretive vote recommendations and the effects of those ""influential recommendations  in whole or in part  on factors other than enhancing or protecting shareholder value."" Enclosed with the letter was a questionnaire designed to help shed light on the process.A response from ISS bears close scrutiny. ""You might also be interested to know that in 2022  a record year in terms of the number of environmental and social shareholder resolutions on the ballots of S&P 500 constituents  ISS’ benchmark policy supported just 52 percent of all such shareholder proposals while supporting more than 96 percent of all management resolutions. That is hardly the track record of an advocacy organization ‘pushing political agendas.’""WHAT ESG INVESTING IS  AND WHY SOME POLITICIANS ARE AGAINST ITDespite the claims in the letter that they remain independent and neutral in their offerings  ISS is not an independent company. Conspicuously absent from the letter is any mention that ISS is majority owned by Frankfurt-based Deutsche Börse AG  a firm that makes no claims of being objective. ""We at Deutsche Börse are not only committed to supporting the sustainable transformation of our economy with the constant development of our ESG offerings. Reaching net zero climate neutrality by 2025 – 25 years ahead of the official target of the European Union – shows that sustainability is also part of our DNA as a company as we ambitiously lead the way.""""The quality  precision and breadth of ISS’ data and research is unique in the market. Especially the company’s ESG expertise and data capabilities are highly complementary to Deutsche Börse’s businesses along the entire value chain "" remarked Deutsche Börse executive board member Stephan Leithner in a 2021 press release. ""The acquisition of ISS is a further demonstration of Deutsche Börse’s commitment to ESG.""CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONObviously  ISS has a glaring conflict of interest related to their German ownership. Specifically  when purchased a couple years ago  Deutsche Börse said that it wanted to gain access to ISS’s client base -- and their business is selling ESG related products which  according to Leithner  is a $1 billion per year market. What remains unclear is how its German owner’s prioritization of ESG squares with ISS’ voting recommendations.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe more that becomes known about ESG  the angrier investors become.It’s no surprise that ISS apparently wishes to obfuscate and resist transparency on the matter. It’s also no surprise that state financial officers are shining – and will continue to shine – a light on ISS’s ESG voting trends.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DEREK KREIFELS",neutral,0.05,0.87,0.09,negative,0.03,0.35,0.62,True,English,"['ESG cheerleaders', 'cover', 'Deutsche Börse executive board member', 'hardworking Americans’ retirement nest eggs', 'proxy advisors’ secretive vote recommendations', 'Frankfurt-based Deutsche Börse AG', 'influential German-owned proxy advisory firm', 'net zero climate neutrality', 'S&P GLOBAL RATINGS', 'MORE FOX NEWS OPINION', 'BlackRock CEO Larry Fink', 'Fox News articles', 'S&P 500 constituents', 'proxy advisory business', 'investment firm giants', 'massive investment portfolios', 'dirty little secrets', 'radical political goals', 'entire value chain', 'ESG) investment schemes', 'nefarious ESG scheme', 'activist ESG agenda', 'ESG related products', 'Such profound influence', 'Several state treasurers', 'state financial officials', 'Glass Lewis guidance', 'ESG investing schemes', 'state pension funds', 'recent joint letter', 'influential recommendations', 'social shareholder resolutions', 'retirement funds', '2020 proxy season', 'poster CEO', 'FINK PIVOTS', '22 state treasurers', 'shareholder value', 'little wonder', 'recent years', 'political agendas', 'pension beneficiaries', 'public funds', 'financial officers', 'financial well-being', 'ESG items', 'ESG SCORES', 'ESG expertise', 'ESG squares', 'strident proponents', 'fiduciary responsibilities', 'proxy-advisory services', 'ideological efforts', 'main competitor', 'corporate clients', 'LONGER PUBLISHING', 'close scrutiny', 'record year', 'management resolutions', 'track record', 'advocacy organization', 'SOME POLITICIANS', 'sustainable transformation', 'constant development', 'official target', 'European Union', 'data capabilities', '2021 press release', 'glaring conflict', 'German ownership', 'client base', 'shareholder proposals', 'investors’ knowledge', '114 institutional investors', 'retail investors', 'ESG offerings', 'proxy-advisory firms', 'Stephan Leithner', 'year market', 'investors’ assets', 'investors’ returns', 'public companies', 'independent company', 'governance', 'term', 'part', 'debate', 'issue', 'cover', 'assistance', 'StateStreet', 'Vanguard', 'GOP', 'consent', 'line', 'role', 'context', 'very', 'foundations', 'profits', 'understatement', 'thousands', 'REPORTS', 'Combined', 'outcomes', 'millions', 'votes', 'time', 'taxpayers', '19 states', 'concern', 'effects', 'factors', 'questionnaire', 'light', 'process', 'response', 'number', 'environmental', 'ballots', '52 percent', '96 percent', 'claims', 'mention', 'economy', 'sustainability', 'DNA', 'way', 'quality', 'precision', 'breadth', 'research', 'businesses', 'acquisition', 'demonstration', 'commitment', 'interest', 'access', 'prioritization']",2023-08-15,2023-08-15,foxnews.com

The world’s largest ESG exchange-traded fund  which is managed by BlackRock  lists Amazon among its top three holdings. The company is also held in over 900 ESG funds registered in the European Union alone  representing about 2% of outstanding shares  according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Amazon is in contact with SBTi  according to Elizabeth Fine  a spokeswoman for the company.“We’ve collaborated with the Science Based Targets initiative over the last several years in order to determine appropriate submission guidelines and methodologies for complex businesses like Amazon ” Fine said by email. Amazon intends to “continue to work with” SBTi “to establish a path forward for submission.” But “in tandem ” Amazon “will also seek to set science-based targets with other organizations ” she said.Amazon has the largest market value of the roughly 120 companies to have been stripped of the SBTi endorsement. Just over 5 700 companies have made SBTi commitments or targets  including Microsoft Corp.  Walmart Inc.  Dell Technologies Inc.  Cisco Systems Inc.  Apple Inc. and eBay Inc.Story continuesAmazon in 2019 said it would eliminate or offset all of its carbon emissions by 2040  and a year later the company committed to submitting its goals through SBTi’s verification process. The retailer and cloud-computing company is working to electrify its last-mile vehicle fleet and remove fossil fuels from its electricity sources  but hasn’t offered a detailed roadmap for how it plans to eliminate the other sources of carbon from its business.Amazon’s emissions are up by about 40% since setting out its net zero target  though they ticked lower in 2022 as the company’s growth slowed and renewable energy projects came online. The Seattle-based company earlier this year retracted a sustainability goal that aimed to have Amazon deliver half its packages with zero carbon by 2030. The commitment  it said  was superseded by a company-wide net zero goal.Meanwhile  SBTi’s foothold in financial markets keeps growing. Euronext recently launched a series of indexes that only include companies with SBTi approved emissions reduction targets. The new products  launched in July  “respond to the growing demand for sustainable investment tools from investors and from the market ” Euronext said in a statement.Paul Chandler  director of stewardship at the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investing  said it’s “disappointing” that “some companies are failing to meet the expectations of initiatives like the SBTi ” which he said is among a small handful of bodies providing “key tools” for investors in their “engagement with companies on climate change.”“Corporate progress on climate in line with the Paris Agreement is essential to meeting investors long term return needs and obligations to clients and beneficiaries ” Chandler said in an emailed statement.A stamp of approval from SBTi helps investors figure out whether portfolio companies have committed to credible climate goals. Such data is increasingly tracked by the world’s biggest money managers. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund  the world’s largest owner of publicly traded stocks  recently said it’s putting companies on notice as it raises the bar for credible transition plans.Amazon says that since committing to set a net zero target with SBTi in 2020  the organization’s requirements for submission have changed and new methodologies were developed. SBTi’s current metrics to tally emissions aren’t aligned to Amazon’s business model  making it “difficult” to submit a target in a “meaningful and accurate way ” according to the company.SBTi introduced a stricter compliance policy in January  giving companies 24 months to set a specific target after committing to do so. The organization used to remove companies from its public database if they didn’t live up to that goal  but has instead started singling laggards out by stating clearly that a given company has had its “commitment removed.”The goal is to “increase transparency and accountability around commitments and eventual validation ” SBTi said. And the expectation is that the move will serve “as a major disincentive for companies to make commitments without taking action ” it said.The new policy only impacts non-financial corporates for now  while financial firms have until April 2024 to comply  or six months after SBTi publishes its standard for financial institutions  whichever is later.“We encourage any and all companies that are removed to re-engage with the process to set science-based targets for validation as soon as possible ” SBTi said. “Urgent corporate climate action is required to limit the worst effects of climate change.”--With assistance from Frances Schwartzkopff  Amine Haddaoui and Carlo Maccioni.(Updates SBTi data.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2023 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.04,0.57,0.39,mixed,0.13,0.27,0.6,True,English,"['Key Backer', 'Carbon Emissions', 'Amazon', 'Years', 'Plan', 'The Science Based Targets initiative', 'long term return needs', 'largest ESG exchange-traded fund', 'company-wide net zero goal', 'sovereign wealth fund', 'United Nations-backed entity', 'top three holdings', 'last several years', 'last-mile vehicle fleet', 'renewable energy projects', 'biggest money managers', 'net zero plans', 'Dell Technologies Inc.', 'Cisco Systems Inc', 'sustainable investment tools', 'stricter compliance policy', 'The Seattle-based company', 'net zero target', 'largest market value', 'emissions reduction targets', 'appropriate submission guidelines', 'Amazon.com Inc.', 'corporate climate goals', 'science-based targets', 'largest owner', 'zero carbon', 'Walmart Inc.', 'Apple Inc.', 'eBay Inc', 'key tools', 'Corporate progress', 'transition plans', 'new policy', 'key endorsement', 'leading watchdog', 'preferred stock', 'European Union', 'outstanding shares', 'complex businesses', 'other organizations', 'Microsoft Corp.', 'verification process', 'fossil fuels', 'electricity sources', 'detailed roadmap', 'other sources', 'sustainability goal', 'financial markets', 'new products', 'growing demand', 'Responsible Investing', 'small handful', 'climate change', 'Paris Agreement', 'current metrics', 'accurate way', 'specific target', 'public database', 'eventual validation', 'major disincentive', 'non-financial corporates', 'financial firms', 'financial institutions', '900 ESG funds', 'carbon emissions', 'Elizabeth Fine', 'Paul Chandler', 'Such data', 'new methodologies', 'business model', 'cloud-computing company', 'SBTi endorsement', 'portfolio companies', 'SBTi commitments', '120 companies', '5,700 companies', 'Bloomberg', 'world', 'list', 'action', 'behemoth', 'move', 'questions', 'status', 'BlackRock', 'contact', 'spokeswoman', 'order', 'email', 'path', 'tandem', 'Story', 'retailer', 'growth', 'half', 'packages', 'foothold', 'Euronext', 'series', 'indexes', 'July', 'investors', 'statement', 'director', 'stewardship', 'Principles', 'expectations', 'initiatives', 'bodies', 'engagement', 'obligations', 'clients', 'beneficiaries', 'stamp', 'approval', 'Norway', 'stocks', 'notice', 'bar', 'requirements', 'meaningful', 'January', '24 months', 'laggards', 'transparency', 'accountability', 'April', 'standard', 'remo']",2023-08-14,2023-08-15,finance.yahoo.com

No additional clinical data have been requested for the approval process.Valneva is committed to working with the FDA in its ongoing review of the BLA  and to potentially delivering the world’s first chikungunya vaccine. The Company reconfirms its previous guidance for potential BLA approval  initial launch  and potential award of a priority review voucher (PRV) still in 2023. This PDUFA extension does not impact Valneva’s current regulatory submission in Canada or its planned submission with the European Medicines Agency (EMA).Juan Carlos Jaramillo  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We appreciate and take pride in the fact that our BLA for VLA1553  if approved  will represent the first vaccine candidate to be approved under the accelerated approval pathway in an outbreak disease  and hence the necessary Phase 4 activities will set a future standard. We are continuing to work closely and collaboratively with the FDA  and we believe it may be possible to obtain an approval before the new PDUFA date.”About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases.

Capital increase with Preemptive Subscription Rights for shareholders.Egide  the global specialist in hermetic packaging  is today announcing the launch of a €1 921 561.20 Capital Increase with preemptive subscription rights (the “Preemptive Subscription Rights”) for shareholders to be subscribed in cash (the “Capital Increase”) through the issuing of 2 956 248 ordinary shares (the “New Shares”) at a unit price of €0.65  representing a discount of 26.4% compared to the closing price on 11 August 2023 (€0.883) and a discount of 14.3% compared to the volume-weighted mean price of the 20 trading sessions preceding the determination of the issue price by the Board of Directors (€0.759).Egide’s shareholders will be able to subscribe to the Capital Increase at the rate of two (2) New Shares for seven (7) existing shares.Compagnie Nationale de Navigation  an entity affiliated to Mr Patrick Molis  has given Egide a commitment to subscribe on a non-preemptive basis (i.e. without preemptive subscription rights) to the Capital Increase in a maximum amount of €1 921 561.20  representing 100% of the planned Capital Increase and thus guaranteeing that the transaction will be completed.The Company does not know the other shareholders’ intentions.2. €750 000 bond loanAlongside the Capital Increase  on 9 August 2023 Egide entered into a bond issue and subscription agreement in the amount of €750 000 (the “Bond Issue”) with Compagnie Nationale de Navigation. This loan  maturing on 14 December 2023  will be repayable in cash or  subject to approval by Egide’s general shareholders’ meeting  in shares.3. Use of the fundsThe €2 671 561.20 raised by the Capital Increase and the Bond Loan will enable the Company:to begin work on turning around its US subsidiaries;to recruit a sales team to boost sales;to finance the increase in its working capital requirement due to higher revenue.4. Strengthening corporate governanceCompagnie de Navigation Nationale  chaired by Mr Patrick Molis  an entrepreneur in the maritime transport  logistics  energy  aeronautics and defence industries  is demonstrating its confidence in the Egide Group’s future by giving a commitment to subscribe to 100% of the capital increase.The Company and the Compagnie Nationale de Navigation have agreed that  in return for the latter’s investment under the Capital Increase and for as long as it holds more than 5% of the Company’s capital on a fully diluted basis (after the exercise of any other security that may be issued in the future giving access to the Company’s capital)  the Company will make its best efforts to ensure that the Compagnie Nationale de Navigation has the right to appoint a director on the Board of Directors.Its representation on Egide’s Board of Directors will strengthen the Group’s corporate governance through the presence of a successful business leader who is destined to become the Company’s largest shareholder. This presence will also facilitate the Company’s growth in the defence industry.5. Turnaround plan and abandonment of the sale of the US subsidiariesEgide has decided to terminate the sale of its US subsidiaries and is launching a reorganisation and turnaround plan for its subsidiaries.In this context  Egide is also announcing Jim Collins’ resignation from his position as director of Egide SA early August and his departure as an employee at the end of September 2023. A new management team will be put in place in the United States tasked with turning around the two subsidiaries.Philippe Bringuier  CEO of Egide says: “I am delighted by the launch of these two financial transactions  which will provide Egide Group with resources needed to pursue its plan for a return to profitability and to turn its US subsidiaries around. They will also strengthen its shareholder structure with the Compagnie Nationale de Navigation becoming a shareholder of Egide and the arrival on its Board of Directors of Compagnie Nationale de Navigation’s chairman Patrick Molis  an entrepreneur in the maritime transport  logistics  energy  aeronautics and defence industries.The Egide Group is opening a new chapter in its history: following the change in governance  it is refocusing on the high-growth defence and aerospace markets  which provide higher added value than the telecoms industry in which the Group has traditionally operated  and putting in place a plan for a return to profitability.We thank all our shareholders  employees and partners who are supporting us in this new strategy.”6.

Shareholders or purchasers of Preemptive Subscription Rights who do not hold  for subscription to the basic entitlement  a sufficient number of existing shares or Preemptive Subscription Rights to obtain a whole number of New Shares must purchase or sell on the market a number of Preemptive Subscription Rights that will result in their holding a multiple enabling them to acquire a whole number of New Shares.It is stated  for information  that as of 11 August 2023 the Company does not hold any of its own shares.Subscription to excess New SharesShareholders are given a right of pre-emption to subscribe to excess New Shares. This right will be exercised in proportion to their rights and up to the number of shares they have applied for.At the same time as they submit their applications to subscribe to their basic entitlement  shareholders or purchasers of Preemptive Subscription Rights may subscribe to any number of excess New Shares they wish over and above the number of New Shares resulting from the exercise of their preemptive subscription rights in respect of their basic entitlement.Any New Shares not subscribed for in the subscriptions to basic entitlements will be distributed and allotted to subscribers for excess New Shares up to the number of shares applied for and pro rata to the number of existing shares for which they have exercised their preemptive subscription rights in respect of their basic entitlement  provided that no fraction of a New Share will be allotted.If the same subscriber submits several separate subscription applications  the number of excess New Shares to be allotted to such subscriber will be calculated on the basis of the totality of their Preemptive Subscription Rights only if they have specifically requested this in writing no later than the closing date for subscriptions. This request must be attached to one of the subscription applications and must provide all information necessary for the rights to be combined  stating the number of subscription applications made and the authorised intermediary or intermediaries with which such applications have been deposited.Subscriptions in the names of different subscribers cannot be combined in order to obtain excess New Shares.Euronext will publish a notice announcing  where relevant  the allocation scale for subscriptions to excess New Shares.Exercising Preemptive Subscription RightsHolders wishing to exercise their Preemptive Subscription Rights must submit a request to do so to their authorised financial intermediary at any time during the subscription period  i.e. between 21 August 2023 and 31 August 2023 inclusive  and pay the corresponding subscription price.Each subscription must be accompanied by payment of the subscription price by payment in cash or by set-off against liquid  due receivables from the company. Subscriptions that have not been fully paid up will be cancelled automatically with no requirement for formal notice.The Preemptive Subscription Rights must be exercised by their beneficiaries before expiry of the subscription period  failing which they will be lost.The Preemptive Subscription Rights will be tradable from 17 August 2023 to 29 August 2023 inclusive  on the same conditions as the existing shares.A seller of a Preemptive Subscription Right will transfer that right to the purchaser and for the purpose of exercising the preemptive subscription right thus acquired the purchaser will be substituted for the owner of the existing share in all the latter’s its rights and obligations thereunder.Any Preemptive Subscription Rights not exercised at the end of the subscription period will lapse automatically.Listing of the Preemptive Subscription RightsAt the end of the trading session on 16 August 2023  Egide’s shareholders will receive one (1) Preemptive Subscription Right for each share held (i.e. a total of 10 346 868 Preemptive Subscription Rights issued). Each shareholder holding seven (7) Preemptive Subscription Rights (and multiples of this number) will be able to subscribe to two (2) New Shares (and multiples of this number) at the unit price of €0.65.The Preemptive Subscription Rights will be listed and traded on the Euronext Growth market  under ISIN FR001400KBC2  from 17 August 2023 to 29 August 2023 inclusive.Theoretical value of the preemptive subscription right€0.052 (on the basis of the Egide share closing price on 11 August 2023. i.e. €0.883). The subscription price of €0.65 per share represents a discount of 20.5% compared to the theoretical ex-rights value of the share.Subscription applications on a non-preemptive basis (i.e. without preemptive subscription rights)In addition to the possibility of subscribing for basic entitlements and excess New Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions set out above  any natural or legal person may subscribe to the Capital Increase on a non-preemptive basis  whether or not they hold Preemptive Subscription Rights.Persons wishing to subscribe on a non-preemptive basis must submit their applications to their authorised financial intermediaries at any time during the subscription period and pay the corresponding subscription price.Pursuant to Article L.225-134 of the French Commercial Code  subscriptions on a non-preemptive basis will be taken into account only if subscriptions to basic entitlements and subscriptions to excess New Shares do not cover the whole of the Capital Increase. The Board of Directors will be entitled to allocate all or some of the unsubscribed shares at its discretion among the persons (shareholders or third parties) of its choice who have submitted applications for subscription on a non-preemptive basis.Preemptive subscription rights detached from own shares held by the CompanyIt is stated  for information  that at 11 August 2023 the Company does not hold any of its own shares.Restricting the amount of the capital increasePursuant to Article L. 225-134 of the French Commercial Code  if the subscriptions for basic entitlements  subscriptions for excess New Shares and subscriptions made on a non-preemptive basis do not cover the whole of the issue  the Board of Directors may restrict the amount of the issue to the amount of the subscriptions received  provided such amount is at least 75% of the amount of the Capital Increase.Paying agents – Payment of subscriptionsSubscriptions for New Shares and payments by subscribers whose securities are held in administered registered form (forme nominative administrée) or bearer form will be accepted up to and including the subscription period closing date at their authorised intermediaries acting in their name and on their behalf.Subscriptions and payments by subscribers whose shares are held in pure registered form (forme nominative pure) will be accepted free of charge at CIC Market Solutions (6 avenue de Provence - 75009 Paris; 34318@cic.fr).The New Shares must be paid up in full on subscription  by payment in cash  for the whole of their nominal value plus issue premium. The amount of the issue premium paid will be recognised on the liabilities side of the balance sheet in a special “Issue Premium” account over which all existing and new shareholders will have rights.The funds paid for subscriptions will be centralised at CIC Market Solutions (6 avenue de Provence - 75009 Paris; 34318@cic.fr)  which will draw up the certificate of deposit of the funds recording the completion of the Capital Increase.Subscriptions for which payments have not been made will be cancelled automatically with no requirement for a formal notice.Investment restrictionsSale of the New Shares and the Preemptive Subscription Rights may be subject to specific regulations in some countries.

Consequently  trading in the security will begin only after settlement and after the registrar’s certificate has been issued.Subscription commitmentIn a letter signed 11 August 2023  Compagnie Nationale de Navigation  an entity affiliated to Mr Patrick Molis  gave the Company a commitment to subscribe on a non-preemptive basis for a maximum amount of €1 921 561.20  representing 100% of the planned Capital Increase and thus guaranteeing completion of the transaction.Accordingly  the Company has undertaken that the Board of Directors will allot to the investor as a priority any New Shares not covered by subscriptions to basic entitlements or to excess New Shares  in accordance with Article L.225-134 of the French Commercial Code.If the Compagnie Nationale de Navigation’s subscription commitment were to be used in full  the Compagnie Nationale de Navigation would hold around 22% of the Company’s capital and voting rights on the settlement date and would thus become the Company’s largest shareholder.The Company does not know the other shareholders’ intentions.Governance rightThe Company and the Compagnie Nationale de Navigation have agreed that  in return for the latter’s investment under the Capital Increase and for as long as it holds more than 5% of the Company’s capital on a fully diluted basis (after the exercise of any other security that may be issued in the future giving access to the Company’s capital)  the Company will make its best efforts to ensure that the Compagnie Nationale de Navigation has the right to appoint a director on the Board of Directors.Retention commitmentCompagnie Nationale de Navigation has given a commitment to retain the New Shares to be allotted to it under the Capital Increase for a period of 180 days following the settlement date of the issue  subject to certain usual exceptions.Settlement of the New SharesAccording to the indicative timetable of the Capital Increase  the settlement date for the New Shares is scheduled to be 7 September 2023.Characteristics of the New SharesEntitlement to dividends: The New Shares  which will be subject to all the provisions of the Articles of Association  will bear current dividend rights and be fungible with the Company’s existing shares from the time they are issued.

An offer ranging from EUR21 billion to EUR23 billion in value  depending on how certain assets shape up. But now all the spotlight is on the next meeting of the Council of Ministers  scheduled for August 28  when government work resumes after the summer break.""Indiscretions not denied by the executive speak of a four-way agreement between the Ministry of Economy  Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (which has 10 percent of Telecom Italia)  F2i and KKR. A formal step in Palazzo Chigi is obviously needed to make the Treasury's entry into the field official.

MeijerAMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Exor NV  the investment arm of Italy's Agnelli family  has become the top investor in Philips by buying 15% of the healthcare technology group for about 2.6 billion euros ($2.8 billion)  the companies said.The deal is a welcome vote of confidence in the Dutch company  which is in the late stages of a huge product recall that began in 2021 and that knocked two thirds off its share price.Philips shares rose 4.4% to 19.30 euros  while Exor (OTC: ) dipped 0.3% to 81.22 euros. Philips fits two of the three sectors Exor targets in its investment strategy - healthcare and technology. The third sector is luxury.Exor purchased its stake on the open market and may later raise it to up to 20%.Under a relationship agreement with Philips  it will take a seat on the company's supervisory board. Once proposed  Exor's representative will attend meetings as an observer until they formally join the board  a person close to Exor said.While not an activist investor  Exor aims to play an active role in supporting Philips' strategy  the source said.""Exor's substantial investment underlines their confidence in Philips' transformation into a healthcare technology company and its growth and value potential "" Philips Chairman Feike Sijbesma said in a statement.Philips executives told a media call that Exor had been researching a possible investment since last year but the share purchases  which trigger disclosure requirements under Euronext rules  came together in only several days with the assistance of an unnamed investment bank.Exor  led by John Elkann  47  the leading figure among Italy's Agnelli clan  still has some 2 billion euros left to invest after taking holdings in French healthcare group Institut Merieux and Italian hospital manager Lifenet.Italy's most prominent business family also owns a stake in luxury shoemaker Christian Louboutin.New York-born Elkann chairs car companies Stellantis and Ferrari (NYSE: )  both in Exor's portfolio with other investments such as The Economist magazine and Italian soccer club Juventus.ING analysts said Exor's investments currently focus on listed firms because they are ""more interesting from a valuation perspective"" than private markets  where values have not yet caught up with ""reality.""Philips shares have rallied by 35% this year to close at 18.50 euros on Friday. That compares with more than 60 euros per share before the recall.""On top of being a med-tech company  Philips is also perceived as a value stock  having been impacted by the Respironics recall saga "" ING said.Philips has taken a 575 million euro provision for lawsuits related to the recall  and CEO Roy Jakobs said on Monday that Exor has not received any information beyond what has been made public about its ongoing talks with the U.S. Department of Justice over a settlement.Philips last month reported core profit of 453 million euros and slightly upgraded financial targets for the full year.($1 = 0.9147 euros)",neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,mixed,0.36,0.34,0.3,True,English,"['Agnelli family', '$2.8 billion stake', 'Exor', 'Philips', 'Reuters', 'REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw', 'Philips Chairman Feike Sijbesma', 'Bart H.

Ipsos ESG Watch acts as a benchmark for brands to measure their performance against  helping to determine whether they are seen on the right or wrong ESG track — and by whom.Of the 30 companies and 6 sectors evaluated in the inaugural report   reflecting a survey conducted with 3 000 Americans  Google earned the highest combined score on environment  social and governance issues  indicating widespread favorable perception toward its historical performance and current momentum.Other top-performing brands included Costco (in second place) and Lowes (ranking third)  with fourth and fifth place going to Visa and Apple  respectively.Ipsos' research indicates that citizens  consumers  employees  and investors increasingly agree that public and private sector organizations should improve both their internal governance and their external impact on the environment and society — a perception that can have an outsized impact on other key business metrics.""ESG has captured the attention of citizens. The impact of the polycrisis and the perception that some institutions are failing (or not capable) in the new operating environment has raised the stakes for public and private sector organizations "" said Claire Hanlon  ESG Country Lead for Ipsos in the U.S.""While ESG considerations should be central to all decision-making  public perception of performance in these areas can be just as important. Ipsos ESG Watch enables companies to understand how they rank so they can develop enhanced approaches to better align with public sentiment.""Ipsos ESG Watch offers an in-depth look at how public perception on ESG shapes brand value  along with other impactful sector-wide insights.In the inaugural report  the bank and investment sector scored highest for performance on environment issues  followed closely by the retail and tech sectors. The retail sector  however  ranked highest both for its impact on society  and in terms of ethical and law-complaint decision-making. Conversely  the oil and gas sector earned lowest marks on these dimensions.""The wide variation in perceptions of company performance within sectors suggests that ESG can be an important source of differentiation "" noted Lauren Demar  Chief Sustainability Officer and Global Head of ESG for Ipsos.""With 60% of Americans saying they 'don't know' or hold neutral perceptions of how companies are performing on ESG  and 64% of global citizens saying they try to buy products from brands that act responsibly  now is the time for businesses to communicate their ESG initiatives and shape citizen-consumer perceptions — before they are defined for them.""Highlights of the sector-specific data and the company performance rankings can be accessed at: https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/ipsos-esg-watchFor more information on Ipsos ESG Watch and Ipsos' other market-leading ESG insights and services  contact [email protected]About IpsosIpsos is one of the largest market research and polling companies globally  operating in 90 markets and employing over 18 000 people.Our passionately curious research professionals  analysts and scientists have built unique multi-specialist capabilities that provide true understanding and powerful insights into the actions  opinions and motivations of citizens  consumers  patients  customers or employees.
