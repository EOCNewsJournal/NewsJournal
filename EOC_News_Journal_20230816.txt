Under the Tender Offer  each Shareholder is entitled to have up to 5.9% of its shareholding purchased by the Company at the Tender Price.The Tender Offer is to be funded from the Company’s existing and available cash resources and remains open until 1.00 p.m. on 8 September 2023.Eligible Shareholders will be able to decide whether to tender none  some or all of their Ordinary Shares within the overall limits of the Tender Offer.The Tender Offer will provide Eligible Shareholders with an opportunity to sell part or all of their Ordinary Shares and to receive their respective share of the cash which the Company is seeking to return.Directors who are beneficially interested in Ordinary Shares have indicated that they will not tender Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer.The Tender Offer will provide Eligible Shareholders holding 1 000 Ordinary Shares or fewer in certificated form an opportunity to sell their entire shareholding in the Company without the dealing costs or commissions that might otherwise make such sale uneconomic (subject to there being capacity to purchase those Ordinary Shares in accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer; if there is insufficient capacity to purchase all of such Ordinary Shares  as many tenders as possible from such Eligible Shareholders will be accepted in full).Background to and reasons for the Tender OfferThe Board continually reviews the Company's capital allocation to maximise long-term returns to Shareholders. The Board seeks to return value to Shareholders through a combination of capital appreciation  share buybacks and dividend payments.Kenmare began paying dividends in 2019 and in each of the last three years the Company has paid dividends representing 25% of profit after tax. Since 2019  the Company has returned $103.6 million in total to shareholders by way of dividends and previously completed a share buyback of £61.8 million (approximately $82.7 million) in December 2021.In March 2023  Kenmare reported record revenues of $526.0 million and record EBITDA of $298.0 million for the year to 31 December 2022 as well as moving into a net cash position of $27.5 million at 31 December 2022. In its financial results for the six-month period ended 30 June 2023  the Group reported profit after tax of $67.8 million in H1 2023 (H1 2022: $62.5 million) and cash and cash equivalents of $108.8 million as at 30 June 2023.In April of this year the Company announced that  based on its current and anticipated financial performance and strong balance sheet position  it intended to evolve its dividend policy towards a payout range of 20% to 40% of underlying profit after tax  and that additional special dividends and share buybacks would be considered  subject to market conditions  balance sheet position and capital requirements. In July  the Company announced that it was considering a share buyback of approximately $30 million  subject to trading conditions  business performance and Board and other necessary approvals.The Tender Offer launched by the Company today executes on the Company’s stated intention to occasionally supplement shareholder returns by buying back shares when sufficient capital is available supported by the operational performance and strong financial position of the Group and wider commodity market conditions. Whilst the Board continues to explore further growth opportunities  it currently considers that  following strong cash generation which is expected to continue through 2023 and beyond  the Company has a level of cash on its balance sheet that is surplus to its short-term requirements.Having regard to the Group’s ongoing earnings  cash flow generation and funding of the potential future capital expenditures of the business  the Board (with the exception of Mr. Issa Al Balushi  who  as the representative on the Board of the Company’s largest shareholder  the Oman Investment Authority (through its investment vehicle African Acquisition S.à r.l.) absented himself from deliberations relating to the proposed Tender Offer) unanimously determined that a return of capital is in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. The Tender Offer provides Shareholders with both choice (that is  the discretion to participate) and ability to realise value without incurring fees. The Board believes that a return of capital in the amount proposed represents an effective use of shareholder funds and that the continued strength of the Group’s balance sheet  and its cashflow generation after the return of those funds  will be sufficient to pursue the Group’s strategic objectives.EGMThe Tender Offer is subject to shareholder approval. A circular (the “Circular”) containing a notice of an extraordinary general meeting to be held at the Company’s offices at 4th Floor  Styne House  Hatch Street Upper  Dublin  D02 DY27  Ireland at 11:00 a.m. on Friday  8 September 2023 (the “EGM”) and details of the resolution (the “Resolution”) to be proposed at the EGM will be posted today on the Investors section of the Company’s website and will be mailed to Eligible Shareholders. This Circular has been submitted to the UK Financial Conduct Authority via the National Storage Mechanism (the “NSM”) and will be available for inspection on the NSM’s website at www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/nsm. This Circular has also been submitted to Euronext Dublin (“Euronext”) and will be available for inspection on Euronext’s website at https://direct.euronext.com/#/oamfiling.The Tender OfferThe Tender Offer is to be effected by Peel Hunt LLP (“Peel Hunt”) (acting as principal and not as agent  nominee or trustee) purchasing Ordinary Shares from Eligible Shareholders at the Tender Price by means of on-market purchases. Peel Hunt  in turn  has the right to require the Company to purchase from it  and can be required by the Company to sell to it  such Ordinary Shares at the Tender Price under a Repurchase Agreement by way of an on-market transaction. All of these transactions will be carried out on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market. All of the Shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement will be cancelled and will not rank for any future dividends including  without limitation  the interim dividend declared by the Company on 15 August 2023 and payable on 13 October 2023.Each Eligible Shareholder will be entitled to sell up to 5.9% of the Ordinary Shares registered in its name on the Record Date under the Tender Offer  rounded down to the nearest whole number of Ordinary Shares (that being an Eligible Shareholder’s “Basic Entitlement”). Any resulting fractional entitlements of Eligible Shareholders will be aggregated and used to satisfy tenders in excess of Eligible Shareholders’ Basic Entitlements. Ordinary Shares validly tendered by Eligible Shareholders up to their respective Basic Entitlement will be accepted and repurchased in full. Tendering Shareholders may also be able to participate in the Tender Offer in excess of their Basic Entitlement to the extent that other Eligible Shareholders tender less than their respective Basic Entitlement  resulting in Ordinary Shares in excess of the tendering Shareholders’ Basic Entitlement becoming available for sale (known as “Excess Tender Offer Shares”). Any Excess Tender Offer Shares will be purchased from tendering Shareholders pro rata to the amount in excess of each eligible shareholder’s Basic Entitlement so tendered (save that tenders from Eligible Shareholders who hold no more than 1 000 Ordinary Shares in certificated form will be accepted in full subject to there being capacity to purchase those Ordinary Shares in accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer; if there is insufficient capacity to purchase all of such Ordinary Shares  as many tenders as possible from such Eligible Shareholders will be accepted in full).The formal terms and conditions of the Tender Offer are set out in the Circular and the Tender Form. The results of the Tender Offer will be announced on 11 September 2023 and published on the Company’s website ( www.kenmareresources.com ).Directors’ intentionsThe Board considers the Tender Offer and the Resolution to be in the best interests of Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly  the Board recommends that Shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution to be proposed at the EGM  as the Directors intend to do for their respective individual beneficial holdings of  in aggregate  550 129 Ordinary Shares  representing approximately 0.58% of the issued Ordinary Share capital as at the Latest Practicable Date.The Directors are making no recommendation in relation to participation in the Tender Offer itself. Whether or not Shareholders  Euroclear Participants or CDI Holders decide to tender their interests in Ordinary Shares will depend  amongst other things  on their own individual circumstances  including their own tax position. Shareholders  Euroclear Participants and CDI Holders are recommended to consult their duly authorised independent advisers in making their own decisions. Each of the Directors who holds Ordinary Shares has confirmed to the Board that he or she will not participate in the Tender Offer.Peel Hunt is acting as broker to the Company in connection with the Tender Offer and the matters described in the Circular.Expected timetable2023 Tender Offer opens 15 August Latest time and date for receipt of Forms of Proxy for the EGM 11.00 a.m. on 6 September Extraordinary General Meeting 11.00 a.m. on 8 September Latest time and date for Admitted Institutions to communicate tender instructions to Euroclear Bank 12.00 noon on 8 September Latest time and date for receipt of Tender Forms from Eligible Shareholders and tender instructions from Euroclear Bank 1.00 p.m. on 8 September Closing Date for the Tender Offer 1.00 p.m. on 8 September Record Date for the Tender Offer 6.00 p.m. on 8 September Announcement of results of the Tender Offer and expected date of debit of tendered Ordinary Shares 11 September Euroclear Bank accounts credited with Tender Offer proceeds (Settlement Date) by no later than ten Business Days following the Closing Date Despatch of cheques for Tender Offer proceeds for certificated Ordinary Shares by no later than ten Business Days following the Closing Date Despatch of balance share certificates for unsold Ordinary Shares and share certificates for unsuccessful tenders (certificated holders only) by no later than ten Business Days following the Closing DateInformation in connection with the Tender Offer is available on the Company’s website (www.kenmareresources.com).Capitalised terms used in this announcement (this “Announcement”)  which have not been defined have the meanings given to them in the Circular  unless the context provides otherwise.This Announcement does not constitute  or form part of  an offer or any solicitation of an offer  to purchase or repurchase securities in any jurisdiction or constitute a recommendation or advice in respect of any securities or other financial instruments or any other matter.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Michael StarkeInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresouces.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221Important Notice:This Announcement contains inside information.Forward Looking StatementsCertain statements contained in this Announcement are or may constitute “forward-looking statements”.

We are excited about the partnership with Jacobi and  as a leader in the development of institutional grade digital asset benchmarks  we are committed to helping accelerate the advancement of the entire digital asset ecosystem.”The Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF offers an ESG-aligned digital asset solution where environmentally conscious ETF buyers can consider Bitcoin within their investment portfolio  as well as independently audit the environmental claims. Jacobi’s solution differs from carbon offsetting products by quantifying the electricity consumption attributable to Bitcoin in the ETF and purchasing equivalent RECs  the standardised instrument for procuring clean power. This provides digital proof of RECs  transparently recorded on a blockchain.Kirsteen Harrison  Environmental Manager  Zumo  commented: ""The decarbonisation of crypto is one of the most pressing challenges facing the nascent digital assets sector  and there is increasing pressure on all businesses to have credible plans to decarbonise. We've been working closely with Jacobi Asset Management to help them build out an ESG-aligned  future-proofed crypto offering for their customers. It's hugely exciting to see it come to life in the shape of Europe's first Bitcoin ETF. We're creating the investment products of tomorrow - what a moment for the industry.""Emanuel van Praag  lawyer at Kennedy Van der Laan  commented: “We are proud to have provided legal counsel to Jacobi AM in its listing of the first SFDR Article 8 digital assets fund.”",neutral,0.03,0.97,0.01,positive,0.87,0.13,0.01,True,English,"['first spot Bitcoin ETF', 'Jacobi Asset Management', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Europe', 'FT Wilshire Bitcoin Blended Price Index', 'The Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF', 'first SFDR Article 8 digital assets fund', 'institutional grade digital asset benchmarks', 'nascent digital assets sector', 'Kennedy Van der Laan', 'entire digital asset ecosystem', 'first spot Bitcoin ETF', 'first digital asset fund', 'Guernsey Financial Services Commission', 'innovative, environmentally sound solution', 'digital asset market evolution', 'ESG-aligned digital asset solution', 'first Bitcoin ETF', 'digital asset platform', 'Fidelity Digital AssetsSM', 'Emanuel van Praag', 'digital asset industry', 'Jacobi Asset Management', 'Renewable Energy Certificate', 'safe, secure access', 'global financial industry', 'carbon offsetting products', 'future-proofed crypto offering', 'Wilshire Indexes', 'digital proof', 'underlying asset', 'Fund benchmark', 'institutional investors', 'Custodial services', 'ETF buyers', 'Jacobi AM', 'market makers', 'European market', 'other products', 'investment products', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'ESG goals', 'Flow Traders', 'Jane Street', 'Authorised Participants', 'Martin Bednall', 'regulated structures', 'debt instruments', 'Tier1 partners', 'European investors', 'Mark Makepeace', 'important milestone', 'investment portfolio', 'environmental claims', 'electricity consumption', 'standardised instrument', 'clean power', 'Kirsteen Harrison', 'Environmental Manager', 'pressing challenges', 'increasing pressure', 'legal counsel', 'REC solution', 'decarbonisation strategy', 'transformative moment', 'equivalent RECs', 'Source', 'verifiable', 'benefits', 'GFSC', 'trades', 'ticker', 'BCOIN', 'DRW', 'collaboration', 'Zumo', 'CEO', 'familiar', 'forefront', 'launch', 'partnership', 'leader', 'development', 'advancement', 'blockchain', 'businesses', 'plans', 'customers', 'life', 'shape', 'tomorrow', 'lawyer', 'listing']",2023-08-15,2023-08-16,finextra.com
29029,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://cointelegraph.com/news/europe-first-bitcoin-etf-hits-euronext-amsterdam-exchange,First EU spot Bitcoin ETF hits Euronext Amsterdam exchange,The Jacobi Bitcoin ETF is finally going live on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange  more than a year after its planned launch.,Europe will welcome a first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF after the long-awaited launch of Jacobi Asset Management’s Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF.The London-based digital asset management firm announced that its new investment product was going live on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange on Aug. 15  more than a year later than its planned launch in 2022.The Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is now trading. Source: Euronext AmsterdamAs previously reported by Cointelegraph  the offering was touted as the first spot or physical-backed Bitcoin (BTC) fund that would allow investors to gain exposure to a financial product that is physically backed by BTC.The new exchange-traded fund (ETF) is set to trade under the BCOIN ticker  while the product was approved by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission back in October 2021. As reported by Blockworks  Fidelity Digital Assets will handle the custodial elements of the BCOIN ETF.Related: Grayscale Bitcoin ETF decision could happen this week  pundits sayThe asset management firm also highlighted the environment and socially friendly nature of the fund  having added a renewable energy certificate (REC) to the ETF.The fund taps into external data to measure the energy usage of the Bitcoin network and buys and retires the RECs. The RECs are also accounted for on a blockchain service  which is aimed to allow investors to verify the eco-friendly claims of the fund.BCOIN makes use of the FT Wilshire Bitcoin Blended Price Index to access real-time average Bitcoin price data from certain cryptocurrency exchanges. The spot ETF allows investors to gain exposure to the Bitcoin market without having direct ownership or custody of the underlying asset.The launch of the spot Bitcoin ETF marks a milestone for Europe  while United States regulators are yet to approve a number of similar spot Bitcoin ETF applications from major asset managers  including BlackRock and Fidelity.A statement from Jacobi CEO Martin Bednall highlighted the continent’s progressive attitude toward cryptocurrency investment products as a potential catalyst for further adoption:“It is exciting to see Europe moving ahead of the US in opening up Bitcoin investing for institutional investors who want safe  secure access to the benefits of digital assets using familiar and regulated structures like our ETF.”The launch of the Jacobi Bitcoin ETF follows the debut of a Bitcoin Equities ETF on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange by Melanion Capital in June 2023. The ETF is designed to track the Melanion Bitcoin Exposure Index  which is a custom basket of European and American stocks closely tied to BTC’s market price.This differs from the spot ETF in that investors gain exposure to the fund  which comprises stocks from companies with significant investments in Bitcoin holdings  cryptocurrency exchanges and mining operations.This includes the likes of technology firm MicroStrategy  which holds over 140 000 BTC  as well as major Bitcoin mining companies  such as Riot  Marathon Digital and Hut8.Collect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.Magazine: SBF ordered to jail  Bitcoin ETF delayed and SEC to appeal Ripple case: Hodler’s Digest  Aug. 6–12,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,positive,0.7,0.29,0.01,True,English,"['First EU spot Bitcoin ETF', 'Euronext Amsterdam exchange', 'FT Wilshire Bitcoin Blended Price Index', 'The Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF', 'real-time average Bitcoin price data', 'similar spot Bitcoin ETF applications', 'London-based digital asset management firm', 'Jacobi CEO Martin Bednall', 'Guernsey Financial Services Commission', 'Grayscale Bitcoin ETF decision', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', 'Melanion Bitcoin Exposure Index', 'first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF', 'major Bitcoin mining companies', 'Jacobi Asset Management', 'Jacobi Bitcoin ETF', 'major asset managers', 'Euronext Amsterdam exchange', 'Bitcoin Equities ETF', 'socially friendly nature', 'United States regulators', 'safe, secure access', 'renewable energy certificate', 'cryptocurrency investment products', 'new investment product', 'new exchange-traded fund', 'Fidelity Digital Assets', 'market price', 'spot ETF', 'physical-backed Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin network', 'Bitcoin market', 'Bitcoin investing', 'Bitcoin holdings', 'external data', 'technology firm', 'underlying asset', 'financial product', 'Melanion Capital', 'mining operations', 'Marathon Digital', 'first spot', 'energy usage', 'The RECs', 'BCOIN ETF', 'cryptocurrency exchanges', 'custodial elements', 'blockchain service', 'eco-friendly claims', 'direct ownership', 'progressive attitude', 'potential catalyst', 'regulated structures', 'custom basket', 'significant investments', 'independent journalism', 'crypto space', 'Ripple case', 'BCOIN ticker', 'American stocks', 'institutional investors', 'BTC) fund', '140,000 BTC', 'Europe', 'launch', 'Aug.', 'Source', 'Cointelegraph', 'offering', 'October', 'Blockworks', 'pundits', 'environment', 'use', 'custody', 'milestone', 'number', 'BlackRock', 'statement', 'continent', 'adoption', 'benefits', 'familiar', 'debut', 'June', 'likes', 'MicroStrategy', 'Riot', 'Hut', 'article', 'NFT', 'moment', 'history', 'support', 'Magazine', 'SBF', 'Hodler', 'Digest']",2023-08-15,2023-08-16,cointelegraph.com

The Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF  trading under the ticker “BCOIN”  repr…,In a groundbreaking move for the European digital asset market  London-based Jacobi Asset Management has officially listed the continent’s first spot Bitcoin ETF on Euronext Amsterdam. The Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF  trading under the ticker “BCOIN”  represents a significant leap forward for institutional Bitcoin investment in Europe  especially with its unique decarbonisation strategy.The ETF  which has been regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC)  stands out not only as the first of its kind in Europe but also for its compliance with SFDR Article 8. This compliance is achieved through a pioneering decarbonisation strategy  which includes a verifiable built-in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution. This solution  supplied by digital asset platform Zumo  “transparently and quantifiably addressing electricity consumption of BTC investing ” as the official press release states.Europe Wins The Race For A Bitcoin Spot ETF Over The USMartin Bednall  CEO of Jacobi Asset Management  remarked  “It is exciting to see Europe moving ahead of the US in opening up Bitcoin investing for institutional investors who want safe  secure access to the benefits of digital assets using familiar and regulated structures like our ETF. Unlike other products in the European market which are debt instruments  our fund owns the underlying asset directly.”The ETF’s benchmark  the FT Wilshire Bitcoin Blended Price Index  is provided by Wilshire Indexes. Mark Makepeace  CEO of Wilshire Indexes  emphasized the significance of this launch  stating  “The launch of the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is an important milestone for the digital asset industry and a transformative moment for the global financial industry.”Kirsteen Harrison  Environmental Manager at Zumo  highlighted the environmental implications of the ETF  commenting  “The decarbonisation of crypto is one of the most pressing challenges facing the nascent digital assets sector… We’ve been working closely with Jacobi Asset Management to help them build out an ESG-aligned  future-proofed crypto offering for their customers.”This listing is particularly noteworthy given the backdrop of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) repeated rejections of numerous applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF over the past few years. Europe’s move to list a spot Bitcoin ETF ahead of the U.S. underscores the continent’s progressive approach to digital asset regulation and investment.It’s worth noting that Jacobi had initially secured approval for the fund back in October 2021 and had plans for a 2022 listing. However  due to unforeseen challenges in the digital asset market  including the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and the bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX  the firm decided to delay its plans.While exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are commonplace in Europe  Jacobi’s offering distinguishes itself as the first ETF. Unlike ETNs  where investors own a debt security  ETF shareholders own a portion of the product’s underlying shares. Jacobi has clarified that its ETF will not leverage or use derivatives.At press time  the Bitcoin price remained stagnant  trading at $29 409.[UPDATE:] Bloomberg’s James Seyffart has weighed in on the listing  noting  “While there are already numerous spot Bitcoin ETPs in Europe  labeling this as the ‘first European spot bitcoin ETF’ might be a bit of a stretch. It seems more like a regulatory arbitrage nuance than a genuine first in the market.”Adding to the conversation  Gabor Gurbacs  founder of PointsVille and strategy advisor at VanEck and Tether  highlighted that there’s “no such thing as a spot Bitcoin ETF in Europe. He added that a product registered in Guernsey isn’t automatically distributable into Europe without further registration. Such a product is distinct from those that are exchange-listed and registered within the EU.He further emphasized that in the EU  a financial product can’t bear the ‘ETF’ label if it isn’t diversified. “It’s crucial to note that Guernsey isn’t an EU member but a self-governing dependency of the UK. Moreover  the majority of Bitcoin ETPs maintain a 1-1 physical Bitcoin pledge through an SPV ” Gurbacs added.Featured image from Forkast News  chart from TradingView.com,neutral,0.04,0.95,0.01,mixed,0.24,0.26,0.5,True,English,"['First Bitcoin Spot ETF', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Europe', 'FT Wilshire Bitcoin Blended Price Index', 'The Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF', 'first European spot bitcoin ETF', '1-1 physical Bitcoin pledge', 'nascent digital assets sector', 'London-based Jacobi Asset Management', 'numerous spot Bitcoin ETPs', 'first spot Bitcoin ETF', 'ESG-aligned, future-proofed crypto offering', 'European digital asset market', 'Guernsey Financial Services Commission', 'Bitcoin Spot ETF', 'digital asset platform', 'digital asset industry', 'digital asset regulation', 'Renewable Energy Certificate', 'safe, secure access', 'global financial industry', 'regulatory arbitrage nuance', 'official press release', 'institutional Bitcoin investment', 'crypto exchange FTX', 'unique decarbonisation strategy', 'pioneering decarbonisation strategy', 'U.S. Securities', 'Bitcoin price', 'Wilshire Indexes', 'European market', 'first ETF', 'Bitcoin investing', 'Exchange Commission', 'genuine first', 'underlying asset', 'numerous applications', 'ETF shareholders', 'ETF’ label', 'strategy advisor', 'press time', 'financial product', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'significant leap', 'SFDR Article', 'electricity consumption', 'BTC investing', 'Martin Bednall', 'institutional investors', 'regulated structures', 'other products', 'debt instruments', 'Mark Makepeace', 'important milestone', 'transformative moment', 'Kirsteen Harrison', 'Environmental Manager', 'environmental implications', 'pressing challenges', 'repeated rejections', 'progressive approach', 'unforeseen challenges', 'Terra ecosystem', 'exchange-traded notes', 'debt security', 'underlying shares', 'James Seyffart', 'self-governing dependency', 'Forkast News', 'groundbreaking move', 'REC) solution', 'Gabor Gurbacs', 'EU member', 'continent', 'ticker', 'BCOIN', 'GFSC', 'kind', 'compliance', 'verifiable', 'Zumo', 'Race', 'CEO', 'benefits', 'familiar', 'fund', 'benchmark', 'significance', 'launch', 'customers', 'listing', 'backdrop', 'past', 'years', 'approval', 'October', 'plans', 'collapse', 'bankruptcy', 'firm', 'ETNs', 'portion', 'derivatives', 'UPDATE', 'Bloomberg', 'stretch', 'conversation', 'founder', 'PointsVille', 'VanEck', 'Tether', 'thing', 'registration', 'UK', 'majority', 'SPV', 'image', 'chart', 'TradingView']",2023-08-15,2023-08-16,bitcoinist.com

Discover SCENEEurope has beaten the U.S. with the roll-out of the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) as London-based Jacobi Asset Management today announced the product's listing on Euronext Amsterdam.After receiving approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) in October 2021  the firm initially planned to launch its Bitcoin ETF product last year.ADADIt  however  decided to postpone the launch  deeming it an inopportune time due to the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange.Today  the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is finally live  trading under the ticker BCOIN. It charges investors a 1.5% annual management fee.Fidelity Digital Assets handles custodial services for the fund  while Flow Traders takes on the role of market maker. Authorized participants include Jane Street and DRW.“This fund has been designed to give institutional investors a simple  secure  and transparent access to Bitcoin whilst addressing their sustainability requirements "" Jacobi CEO Martin Bednall told Decrypt. ""We believe this ETF launch will be the catalyst for institutional adoption of digital assets.""Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is also billed as the first decarbonized digital asset fund compliant with Article 8 of the European Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)  which applies to funds promoting environmental and social objectives.The firm partnered with digital asset platform Zumo to implement a verifiable built-in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution  which offers institutional investors the ability to deal in Bitcoin while also meeting their Environmental  Social  and Governance (ESG) objectives.ADADAs the Jacobi CEO explained to Decrypt  RECs  and offsets are inherently different and should not be confused. Whilst offsets can be used for any aspect of a company’s carbon footprint (one offset represents one tonne of CO2e)  RECs relate to electricity consumption only (one REC represents 1 MWh of electricity).The REC solution verifies the utilization of renewable energy sources  contributing to the fund's overall decarbonization and adherence to sustainable principles.“This makes RECs an ideal tool to use for crypto  where the most material part of the carbon footprint relates to electricity consumption "" Bednall told Decrypt. ""Furthermore  the use of RECs is recognized under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol as a Market-Based accounting method and can be used to claim full decarbonization  whereas the same claim cannot be used for offsets.”Jacobi makes leap from crypto ETNsThe firm emphasized that as an open-ended fund  its Bitcoin ETF will mark a major shift from the traditional exchange-traded notes (ETNs)  to date the most widely spread structure in Europe for crypto-backed financial instruments.One key distinction between an ETN and an ETF lies in the ownership structure and the nature of the investment. In the case of an ETF  shareholders possess a stake in the underlying assets held by the fund. ETN investors  on the other hand  own a debt-security.“ETFs are approved by regulators and are overseen by regulated managers. These managers sign off all activities and report on a regular basis to the regulator.

Thereafter  it decided to launch the product in 2022.However  the company decided to postpone its plans owing to unfavorable circumstances in the crypto asset market. These included the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and the bankruptcy of cryptocurrency exchange FTX last year.The ETF tracks the Melanion Bitcoin Exposure Index. The Index is a custom basket of European and American stocks closely tied to BTC’s market price.Unlike the spot ETF  investors acquire exposure to the fund. This is made up of equities from firms with major assets in Bitcoin holdings  cryptocurrency exchanges  and crypto mining activities.Jacobi announced in its press release that Fidelity Digital Assets would provide custody for the fund. The trading firm Flow Traders operates as its market maker. It charges a 1.5% annual management fee to its investors.The firm also emphasized the environment-friendly nature of its Bitcoin fund. It has added a renewable energy certificate (REC) to the ETF.The fund utilizes external data to calculate the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption and then purchases and retires RECs. The RECs are also recorded on a blockchain platform which allows investors to verify the fund’s eco-friendly promises.U.S. left behind as authorities unleash regulatory tentaclesThe launch of the spot BTC ETF marks a watershed moment for the European crypto market. Regulators in the U.S. are yet to permit approval of a number of spot Bitcoin ETF applications as it is taking regulatory action against major crypto exchanges.At press time  BTC was trading at $29 349.

Specifically  the ETF is touted as the first decarbonized digital asset fund that aligns with SFDR Article 8. To achieve this  Jacobi has integrated a Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution  enabling institutional investors to harness the benefits of Bitcoin while simultaneously meeting ESG targets.The ETF  which operates under the ticker “BCOIN”  is regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission. Fidelity Digital AssetsSM is responsible for custodial duties  with Flow Traders serving as market makers. Jane Street and DRW have been appointed as the Authorized Participants. The ETF’s benchmark is derived from the FT Wilshire Bitcoin Blended Price Index  courtesy of Wilshire Indexes. The innovative REC solution was conceptualized and executed in partnership with the digital asset platform  Zumo.According to a report by ETF Express  Martin Bednall  the CEO of Jacobi Asset Management  expressed his enthusiasm about Europe’s forward-thinking approach in facilitating institutional Bitcoin investments through familiar and regulated structures like ETFs. He emphasized the uniqueness of their fund  which directly owns the underlying asset  in contrast to some European products that function as debt instruments. Bednall also expressed gratitude for the support from leading partners in the digital asset market evolution and underscored Jacobi’s dedication to offering a pioneering and eco-conscious solution for European investors.Furthermore  in a conversation with Decrypt  Jacobi emphasized the ETF’s open-ended nature  marking a departure from the prevalent exchange-traded notes (ETNs) that have dominated Europe’s crypto-backed financial instruments. The distinction is crucial: ETF shareholders own a piece of the fund’s underlying assets  while ETN investors hold a debt-security. Bednall pointed out the enhanced investor protection offered by ETFs  which are approved and monitored by regulators. Unlike ETNs  which might incorporate leverage or derivatives  ETFs are devoid of such elements  reducing the risk of market manipulation.Mark Makepeace  the CEO of Wilshire Indexes  conveyed his excitement about partnering with Jacobi. He views the launch of the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF as a transformative event for the global financial landscape. Wilshire Indexes  renowned for developing institutional-grade digital asset benchmarks  is committed to fostering the growth of the entire digital asset domain.The ETF’s design caters to ESG-focused investors  allowing them to incorporate Bitcoin in their portfolios and independently verify the environmental claims. Instead of merely offsetting carbon emissions  Jacobi’s approach involves assessing the electricity consumption associated with the Bitcoin in the ETF. They then purchase equivalent RECs  which serve as standardized instruments for acquiring clean energy. This method ensures a transparent digital record of RECs on a blockchain.Kirsteen Harrison  Zumo’s Environmental Manager  emphasized the pressing need to decarbonize the crypto sector. She acknowledged the increasing demand for businesses to present credible decarbonization strategies. Harrison expressed her excitement about collaborating with Jacobi Asset Management to develop an ESG-aligned crypto solution  culminating in the unveiling of Europe’s pioneering Bitcoin ETF.Emanuel van Praag  a legal expert at Kennedy Van der Laan  confirmed their role in offering legal guidance to Jacobi AM during the ETF’s listing process  emphasizing its distinction as the first SFDR Article 8 digital assets fund.,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.49,0.36,0.15,True,English,"['First Spot Bitcoin ETF', 'Jacobi Asset Management', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Europe', 'FT Wilshire Bitcoin Blended Price Index', 'first SFDR Article 8 digital assets fund', 'first decarbonized digital asset fund', 'Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF', 'Kennedy Van der Laan', 'institutional-grade digital asset benchmarks', 'entire digital asset domain', 'Guernsey Financial Services Commission', 'digital asset market evolution', 'first spot Bitcoin ETF', 'digital asset platform', 'Fidelity Digital AssetsSM', 'transparent digital record', 'Emanuel van Praag', 'global financial landscape', 'prevalent exchange-traded notes', 'crypto-backed financial instruments', 'Jacobi Asset Management', 'Renewable Energy Certificate', 'institutional Bitcoin investments', 'innovative REC solution', 'ESG-aligned crypto solution', 'pioneering Bitcoin ETF', 'underlying assets', 'Wilshire Indexes', 'REC) solution', 'market makers', 'market manipulation', 'institutional investors', 'eco-conscious solution', 'clean energy', 'crypto sector', 'debt instruments', 'standardized instruments', 'Jacobi AM', 'significant milestone', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'pioneering status', 'ESG) standards', 'ESG targets', 'custodial duties', 'Flow Traders', 'Jane Street', 'Authorized Participants', 'regulated structures', 'European products', 'leading partners', 'European investors', 'open-ended nature', 'ETN investors', 'investor protection', 'Mark Makepeace', 'transformative event', 'ESG-focused investors', 'environmental claims', 'carbon emissions', 'electricity consumption', 'Environmental Manager', 'pressing need', 'increasing demand', 'decarbonization strategies', 'legal expert', 'legal guidance', 'listing process', 'ETF Express', 'ETF shareholders', 'The ETF', 'forward-thinking approach', 'equivalent RECs', 'Kirsteen Harrison', 'Martin Bednall', 'commitment', 'governance', 'benefits', 'ticker', 'BCOIN', 'DRW', 'courtesy', 'partnership', 'Zumo.', 'report', 'CEO', 'enthusiasm', 'familiar', 'ETFs', 'uniqueness', 'contrast', 'gratitude', 'support', 'dedication', 'conversation', 'Decrypt', 'departure', 'ETNs', 'distinction', 'piece', 'debt-security', 'enhanced', 'regulators', 'leverage', 'derivatives', 'elements', 'risk', 'excitement', 'launch', 'growth', 'design', 'portfolios', 'method', 'blockchain', 'businesses', 'unveiling', 'role']",2023-08-15,2023-08-16,cryptoglobe.com

29056,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.cityam.com/would-cvc-ever-consider-a-london-listing/,Would CVC ever consider a London listing?,Buyout giant CVC is reported to have revived its listing plans in recent weeks and is heading for a blockbuster float on Amsterdam’s Euronext bourse.,Would CVC ever consider a London listing?News broke this week that buyout giant CVC Capital Partners has revived its shelved listing plans and is lining up a blockbuster float on Amsterdam’s Euronext bourse.While CVC has declined to publicly comment on the reports  City A.M. understands that it is indeed dusting off its plans for a float  but no formal decision or timelines have been made.The Six Nations and PG Tips owner  fresh off the back of a record-breaking and downturn-defying €26bn fundraise  shelved its float plans last year among the wild volatility that largely shuttered the IPO market globally.While Amsterdam has long been the intended destination and fits as a home for the firm  given the euro denomination of its funds and its EU headquarters in Luxembourg  the revival triggers questions over whether London could tempt in the IPO of a similar buyout behemoth.London’s public markets are not known for their public private equity pedigree. FTSE100 member 3i has proved a hit with investors but CVC rival Bridgepoint  which floated in 2021 in the first London private equity IPO since 1994  has faced a torrid time on the public markets.After a stellar start in which shares surged 29 per cent on the first day of trading  Bridgepoint has cratered. Shares are currently trading at a near 62 per cent discount to their IPO price.Analysts say that Bridgepoint’s performance is a sign that London might struggle to attract another major private equity float – and point to why it would never really have been considered a serious option by CVC.“If you look at the share price performance of other listed PE firms [listed in New york] over the same horizon  they are not down by this much ” Nicolas Moura  EMEA Private Capital Analyst at PitchBook  tools City A.M.“If I were in CVC’s shoes  here’s what I would consider: more regulation  more transparency  and higher costs to list in London; share price moves on companies listed not in the UK have done comparably better than those in the UK  all else equal.”The IPO market in Europe and beyond still looks shaky. Global IPOs plunged 36 per cent in the first half of the year  according to EY  and investors are still skittish on the private equity industry amid a period of rising rates and still subdued deals.“Nerves are still on edge in terms of sentiment towards private equity industry given the high interest rate environment and the stubborn nature of inflation is a test of confidence ” Susannah Streeter  head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown  said.“When central bank policymakers do press the pause button for a longer duration and underlying price pressures subside more significantly  there is likely to be a greater appetite for a listing ” she added.Echoing Moura  Streeter said the recent travails of Bridgepoint would be a nail in the coffin to any faint and flickering hope that a buyout firm like CVC would consider the capital.“Given Bridgepoint’s performance since its listing in London in 2021  there may still be considerable reticence about a UK IPO ” she added. “Its shares have slumped since its launch and just last month it warned of a tougher environment facing private equity firms.”,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.17,0.28,0.55,True,English,"['London listing', 'CVC', 'near 62 per cent discount', 'other listed PE firms', 'high interest rate environment', 'EMEA Private Capital Analyst', 'first London private equity IPO', 'public private equity pedigree', 'major private equity float', 'giant CVC Capital Partners', 'private equity firms', 'private equity industry', 'City A.M.', 'The Six Nations', 'PG Tips owner', 'downturn-defying €26bn fundraise', 'FTSE100 member 3i', 'central bank policymakers', 'share price moves', 'underlying price pressures', 'similar buyout behemoth', 'The IPO market', 'share price performance', 'shelved listing plans', 'CVC rival Bridgepoint', 'IPO price', 'first day', 'first half', 'tougher environment', 'public markets', 'blockbuster float', 'float plans', 'Euronext bourse', 'formal decision', 'wild volatility', 'intended destination', 'euro denomination', 'EU headquarters', 'torrid time', 'stellar start', 'New york', 'same horizon', 'higher costs', 'Global IPOs', 'rising rates', 'stubborn nature', 'Hargreaves Lansdown', 'pause button', 'longer duration', 'greater appetite', 'recent travails', 'considerable reticence', 'UK IPO', 'Nicolas Moura', 'Susannah Streeter', 'buyout firm', 'London listing', 'News', 'Amsterdam', 'reports', 'timelines', 'back', 'record-breaking', 'home', 'funds', 'Luxembourg', 'revival', 'questions', 'hit', 'investors', 'shares', 'trading', 'Analysts', 'sign', 'option', 'PitchBook', 'tools', 'shoes', 'regulation', 'transparency', 'companies', 'Europe', 'year', 'EY', 'period', 'deals', 'Nerves', 'edge', 'terms', 'sentiment', 'inflation', 'test', 'confidence', 'nail', 'coffin', 'faint', 'hope', 'launch']",2023-08-15,2023-08-16,cityam.com

This marks Ebusco's first-ever order in the aerospace sector.Fraport is one of the leading players in the global airport business and has set itself the mission of reducing its CO 2 emissions continuously  reaching net zero by 2045. This order of 4 Ebusco 3.0 12-metre buses with three doors  low floor and a battery pack of >250 kWh  marks an important step towards this goal.Ebusco has a strong affiliation with the aerospace industry. For the development of the Ebusco 3.0  a team of key experts have drawn inspiration from various fields such as the aerospace industry to develop a lightweight and highly efficient electric bus. Due to its composite construction  this bus configuration can drive with the smallest battery pack available  up to 350 km on a single charge  making it possible to easily run the day-to-day airport operation.Although multiple Ebusco 3.0 buses are already on the road in the Netherlands and Germany  this will be the first time the Ebusco buses will be deployed at an airport. As a result  the Fraport buses will feature a layout specifically designed for efficient airport transportation. With this new step  Ebusco is making an additional impact outside urban areas  providing travellers with a clean and comfortable start to their journey.Wolfgang Hackauf  Sales Director of Ebusco  comments: ""It is great to see that the aerospace industry and the Ebusco 3.0 once again come together. Our buses are available in different configurations and can therefore easily be applied for different purposes  such as airport transportation. We look forward to working with Fraport and are eager to expand our presence in the airport sector.""Thorsten Clemens  Project Manager Fleetmanagement of Fraport: ""Electromobility is a key element of our climate protection efforts and stands for future-oriented ground handling operations at Germany's largest airport. These new Ebusco buses are among the first electric buses in our fleet and will set the tone for the coming years. In the tender process  Ebusco was able to respond to our specific height restrictions. We are looking forward to the arrival of the Ebusco 3.0 buses  and are excited about the partnership with Ebusco for the coming years.""",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,positive,0.77,0.22,0.01,True,English,"['Ebusco N', 'Frankfurt Airport', 'wings', 'order', 'future-oriented ground handling operations', 'Project Manager Fleetmanagement', 'climate protection efforts', 'specific height restrictions', 'efficient electric bus', 'global airport business', 'smallest battery pack', 'efficient airport transportation', 'first electric buses', '4 Ebusco 3.0 12-metre buses', 'multiple Ebusco 3.0 buses', 'new Ebusco buses', 'bus configuration', 'first time', 'new step', 'Frankfurt Airport', 'airport operation', 'airport sector', 'largest airport', 'charging systems', 'aerospace sector', 'leading players', 'CO 2 emissions', 'three doors', 'low floor', 'important step', 'strong affiliation', 'aerospace industry', 'key experts', 'various fields', 'composite construction', 'single charge', 'additional impact', 'urban areas', 'comfortable start', 'Wolfgang Hackauf', 'Sales Director', 'different configurations', 'different purposes', 'Thorsten Clemens', 'key element', 'coming years', 'tender process', 'fixed order', 'first-ever order', 'two-year framework', 'Fraport buses', '4 buses', 'Deurne', 'Euronext', 'pioneer', 'frontrunner', 'development', 'option', '>250 kWh', 'goal', 'team', 'inspiration', 'lightweight', 'highly', 'day', 'road', 'Netherlands', 'Germany', 'result', 'layout', 'travellers', 'clean', 'journey', 'presence', 'Electromobility', 'tone', 'arrival', 'partnership', '350']",2023-08-15,2023-08-16,marketscreener.com

Under the Tender Offer  each Shareholder is entitled to have up to 5.9% of its shareholding purchased by the Company at the Tender Price.The Tender Offer is to be funded from the Company’s existing and available cash resources and remains open until 1.00 p.m. on 8 September 2023.Eligible Shareholders will be able to decide whether to tender none  some or all of their Ordinary Shares within the overall limits of the Tender Offer.The Tender Offer will provide Eligible Shareholders with an opportunity to sell part or all of their Ordinary Shares and to receive their respective share of the cash which the Company is seeking to return.Directors who are beneficially interested in Ordinary Shares have indicated that they will not tender Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer.The Tender Offer will provide Eligible Shareholders holding 1 000 Ordinary Shares or fewer in certificated form an opportunity to sell their entire shareholding in the Company without the dealing costs or commissions that might otherwise make such sale uneconomic (subject to there being capacity to purchase those Ordinary Shares in accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer; if there is insufficient capacity to purchase all of such Ordinary Shares  as many tenders as possible from such Eligible Shareholders will be accepted in full).Background to and reasons for the Tender OfferThe Board continually reviews the Company's capital allocation to maximise long-term returns to Shareholders. The Board seeks to return value to Shareholders through a combination of capital appreciation  share buybacks and dividend payments.Kenmare began paying dividends in 2019 and in each of the last three years the Company has paid dividends representing 25% of profit after tax. Since 2019  the Company has returned $103.6 million in total to shareholders by way of dividends and previously completed a share buyback of £61.8 million (approximately $82.7 million) in December 2021.In March 2023  Kenmare reported record revenues of $526.0 million and record EBITDA of $298.0 million for the year to 31 December 2022 as well as moving into a net cash position of $27.5 million at 31 December 2022. In its financial results for the six-month period ended 30 June 2023  the Group reported profit after tax of $67.8 million in H1 2023 (H1 2022: $62.5 million) and cash and cash equivalents of $108.8 million as at 30 June 2023.In April of this year the Company announced that  based on its current and anticipated financial performance and strong balance sheet position  it intended to evolve its dividend policy towards a payout range of 20% to 40% of underlying profit after tax  and that additional special dividends and share buybacks would be considered  subject to market conditions  balance sheet position and capital requirements. In July  the Company announced that it was considering a share buyback of approximately $30 million  subject to trading conditions  business performance and Board and other necessary approvals.The Tender Offer launched by the Company today executes on the Company’s stated intention to occasionally supplement shareholder returns by buying back shares when sufficient capital is available supported by the operational performance and strong financial position of the Group and wider commodity market conditions. Whilst the Board continues to explore further growth opportunities  it currently considers that  following strong cash generation which is expected to continue through 2023 and beyond  the Company has a level of cash on its balance sheet that is surplus to its short-term requirements.Having regard to the Group’s ongoing earnings  cash flow generation and funding of the potential future capital expenditures of the business  the Board (with the exception of Mr. Issa Al Balushi  who  as the representative on the Board of the Company’s largest shareholder  the Oman Investment Authority (through its investment vehicle African Acquisition S.à r.l.) absented himself from deliberations relating to the proposed Tender Offer) unanimously determined that a return of capital is in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. The Tender Offer provides Shareholders with both choice (that is  the discretion to participate) and ability to realise value without incurring fees. The Board believes that a return of capital in the amount proposed represents an effective use of shareholder funds and that the continued strength of the Group’s balance sheet  and its cashflow generation after the return of those funds  will be sufficient to pursue the Group’s strategic objectives.EGMThe Tender Offer is subject to shareholder approval. A circular (the “Circular”) containing a notice of an extraordinary general meeting to be held at the Company’s offices at 4th Floor  Styne House  Hatch Street Upper  Dublin  D02 DY27  Ireland at 11:00 a.m. on Friday  8 September 2023 (the “EGM”) and details of the resolution (the “Resolution”) to be proposed at the EGM will be posted today on the Investors section of the Company’s website and will be mailed to Eligible Shareholders. This Circular has been submitted to the UK Financial Conduct Authority via the National Storage Mechanism (the “NSM”) and will be available for inspection on the NSM’s website at www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/nsm. This Circular has also been submitted to Euronext Dublin (“Euronext”) and will be available for inspection on Euronext’s website at https://direct.euronext.com/#/oamfiling.The Tender OfferThe Tender Offer is to be effected by Peel Hunt LLP (“Peel Hunt”) (acting as principal and not as agent  nominee or trustee) purchasing Ordinary Shares from Eligible Shareholders at the Tender Price by means of on-market purchases. Peel Hunt  in turn  has the right to require the Company to purchase from it  and can be required by the Company to sell to it  such Ordinary Shares at the Tender Price under a Repurchase Agreement by way of an on-market transaction. All of these transactions will be carried out on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market. All of the Shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement will be cancelled and will not rank for any future dividends including  without limitation  the interim dividend declared by the Company on 15 August 2023 and payable on 13 October 2023.Each Eligible Shareholder will be entitled to sell up to 5.9% of the Ordinary Shares registered in its name on the Record Date under the Tender Offer  rounded down to the nearest whole number of Ordinary Shares (that being an Eligible Shareholder’s “Basic Entitlement”). Any resulting fractional entitlements of Eligible Shareholders will be aggregated and used to satisfy tenders in excess of Eligible Shareholders’ Basic Entitlements. Ordinary Shares validly tendered by Eligible Shareholders up to their respective Basic Entitlement will be accepted and repurchased in full. Tendering Shareholders may also be able to participate in the Tender Offer in excess of their Basic Entitlement to the extent that other Eligible Shareholders tender less than their respective Basic Entitlement  resulting in Ordinary Shares in excess of the tendering Shareholders’ Basic Entitlement becoming available for sale (known as “Excess Tender Offer Shares”). Any Excess Tender Offer Shares will be purchased from tendering Shareholders pro rata to the amount in excess of each eligible shareholder’s Basic Entitlement so tendered (save that tenders from Eligible Shareholders who hold no more than 1 000 Ordinary Shares in certificated form will be accepted in full subject to there being capacity to purchase those Ordinary Shares in accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer; if there is insufficient capacity to purchase all of such Ordinary Shares  as many tenders as possible from such Eligible Shareholders will be accepted in full).The formal terms and conditions of the Tender Offer are set out in the Circular and the Tender Form. The results of the Tender Offer will be announced on 11 September 2023 and published on the Company’s website ( www.kenmareresources.com ).Directors’ intentionsThe Board considers the Tender Offer and the Resolution to be in the best interests of Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly  the Board recommends that Shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution to be proposed at the EGM  as the Directors intend to do for their respective individual beneficial holdings of  in aggregate  550 129 Ordinary Shares  representing approximately 0.58% of the issued Ordinary Share capital as at the Latest Practicable Date.The Directors are making no recommendation in relation to participation in the Tender Offer itself. Whether or not Shareholders  Euroclear Participants or CDI Holders decide to tender their interests in Ordinary Shares will depend  amongst other things  on their own individual circumstances  including their own tax position. Shareholders  Euroclear Participants and CDI Holders are recommended to consult their duly authorised independent advisers in making their own decisions. Each of the Directors who holds Ordinary Shares has confirmed to the Board that he or she will not participate in the Tender Offer.Peel Hunt is acting as broker to the Company in connection with the Tender Offer and the matters described in the Circular.Expected timetable2023 Tender Offer opens 15 August Latest time and date for receipt of Forms of Proxy for the EGM 11.00 a.m. on 6 September Extraordinary General Meeting 11.00 a.m. on 8 September Latest time and date for Admitted Institutions to communicate tender instructions to Euroclear Bank 12.00 noon on 8 September Latest time and date for receipt of Tender Forms from Eligible Shareholders and tender instructions from Euroclear Bank 1.00 p.m. on 8 September Closing Date for the Tender Offer 1.00 p.m. on 8 September Record Date for the Tender Offer 6.00 p.m. on 8 September Announcement of results of the Tender Offer and expected date of debit of tendered Ordinary Shares 11 September Euroclear Bank accounts credited with Tender Offer proceeds (Settlement Date) by no later than ten Business Days following the Closing Date Despatch of cheques for Tender Offer proceeds for certificated Ordinary Shares by no later than ten Business Days following the Closing Date Despatch of balance share certificates for unsold Ordinary Shares and share certificates for unsuccessful tenders (certificated holders only) by no later than ten Business Days following the Closing DateInformation in connection with the Tender Offer is available on the Company’s website (www.kenmareresources.com).Capitalised terms used in this announcement (this “Announcement”)  which have not been defined have the meanings given to them in the Circular  unless the context provides otherwise.This Announcement does not constitute  or form part of  an offer or any solicitation of an offer  to purchase or repurchase securities in any jurisdiction or constitute a recommendation or advice in respect of any securities or other financial instruments or any other matter.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Michael StarkeInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresouces.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221Important Notice:This Announcement contains inside information.Forward Looking StatementsCertain statements contained in this Announcement are or may constitute “forward-looking statements”.

The 2023 Annual Reports and Accounts comprise the Company's directors' report  strategic report  directors' remuneration report and annual accounts and auditor's report for the financial year ended March 31  2023  prepared in accordance with the Companies Act. The 2023 Annual Reports and Accounts were considered and approved unanimously by the Board on July 28  2023.Resolution 2 (Directors' remuneration report)The Directors' remuneration report sets out the pay and benefits received by each of the directors in respect of the financial year ended March 31  2023  prepared in accordance with the Companies Act. The Company is required to seek shareholders' approval of this report. The directors' remuneration report can be found on pages 63 to 78 of the 2023 Annual Reports and Accounts. The remuneration report  which was based on the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee  was considered and approved unanimously by the Board on July 7  2023.Resolutions 3 to 8 (Approval of directors' re-appointment and appointment)The Company appointed independent non-executive directors for an initial period of two years from August 23  2021  to August 22  2023. In accordance with the terms and conditions of their appointment  their re-appointment was subject to continued satisfactory performance. In anticipation of the expiry of their current tenure  the Board has considered the performance and qualifications of each director seeking confirmation of their re-appointment and determined that each of them contributes effectively and demonstrates commitment to their role. The skills and experience of each director  as summarized in their biographies set out herein after  demonstrate why their contribution is important and how the contribution  commitment and performance they make continue to be important to the Company's long-term sustainable success.The Board unanimously approved the re-appointment of Manoj Singh  Sir Sumantra Chakrabarti and Vanitha Narayanan at its meeting on July 7  2023 for a period of approximately another two years with effect from August 23  2023 up to the annual general meeting of the Company scheduled to be held in the calendar year 2025  on substantially the same terms and conditions  including the requirement for approval by the shareholders at the AGM following their appointment by the Board. Michelle Robyn Grew and Ram Charan have decided not to stand for re-appointment. The tenure of Mr. Philip Kassin  MKC Investments LLC Nominee and Independent Director will end on August 22  2023 due to expirationof the director nomination rights of MKC Investments LLC.On July 17  2023 the Board  on the recommendation of the Nomination and Board Governance Committee  unanimously approved the appointment of Ms. Paula Gold-Williams  Ms. Nicoletta Giadrossi and Mr. Philip Graham New for a period of approximately two years with effect from August 23  2023  up to the annual general meeting of the Company scheduled to be held in the calendar year 2025. The Board considers that these directors have appropriate skills and experience to replace those of the retiring directors and to meet the Company's ongoing requirements. The terms of appointment of these directors are materially the same as those of the current independent non-executive directors  including the requirement for approval by the shareholders at the AGM following their appointment by the Board.If any of these resolutions is not passed  the relevant director's appointment will be terminated immediately from the conclusion of this AGM  in accordance with the terms of his or her appointment.Brief biographical details of each of the current and proposed directors to which the resolutions relate are set out set out on pages 7 to 9 of this document.Resolution 9 (Re-appointment of auditor)The current appointment of KNAV Limited (""KNAV"") as Auditor of the Company will terminate at the conclusion of this year's AGM. KNAV has expressed its willingness to continue in office. The Audit Committee and the Board have unanimously recommended that KNAV be re-appointed until the conclusion of the next general meeting of the Company at which the Company's annual accounts and reports are laid.4Resolution 10 (Auditor's remuneration)The directors may set the remuneration of the auditor if authorized to do so by the shareholders. The Board has recommended that the Audit Committee be authorized to determine the remuneration of KNAV. This resolution seeks authority for the Board and the Audit Committee severally to set the remuneration of the Auditor for the financial year 2023-24.Resolution 11 (Amendment of 2021 Incentive Plan to increase Overall Share Limit)In order to retain and motivate qualified employees  the Company previously established the 2021 Incentive Award Plan (the ""2021 Incentive Plan"")  which was approved and adopted at the general meeting of the Company held on 20 August 2021. Under the terms of the 2021 Incentive Plan  the Overall Share Limit  representing the maximum number of Class A Ordinary Shares of $0.0001 each in the capital of the Company (""Shares"") in respect of which the Board has authority to grant awards  was initially set at 65 030 161 Shares. As at March 31  2023  the Company had granted / made commitments to grant options to purchase 62 190 263 Shares under the 2021 Incentive Plan  of which 217 426 had been exercised  953 750 had lapsed (so that the underlying Shares became available for re-grant) and 61 019 087 were yet to be exercised (including from those Shares that the Company had committed to grant but not yet granted). At that date  the Company therefore had authority to grant awards in respect of up to a further 3 793 648 Shares under the 2021 Incentive Plan.Given the aforesaid limited availability of ESOP pool for additional grant  the Board now proposes to raise the Overall Share Limit under the 2021 Incentive Plan by 22 969 839 Shares to 88 000 000 Shares. The Board considers this necessary in order to retain sufficient headroom to grant appropriate awards to incentivize employees in the near future. The Board intends to utilize some of this headroom to grant awards of restricted stock units (vesting subject only to the recipient's continued employment over a specified period) and performance shares (the vesting of which will additionally be subject to performance measures) to the Group's employees (including the Company's CEO  Mr. Sinha) pursuant to a new Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ""LTIP"") to be established under the terms of the 2021 Incentive Plan. The Board considers this necessary in order to ensure that the Group is able to continue to attract and incentivize senior employees appropriately. In addition  the Board has  on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee  approved the grant of options to purchase 8 000 000 Shares to Mr. Sinha in respect of the financial year ending March 31  2024  in addition to his current entitlements. Under the options  the exercise price for each of the 8 000 000 Shares would be average fair market value (volume-weighted average price of a Class A Ordinary Share on Nasdaq) over the period of 90 calendar days prior to the grant date. All remaining Shares under the Overall Share Limit will be available for future awards as the Board determines in due course in accordance with the terms of the 2021 Incentive Plan and  as applicable  the Company's Remuneration Policy.Resolution 12 (Amendment of Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan to increase Overall Share Limit)In order to retain and motivate qualified non-employee service-providers including non-executive directors  the Company previously established the Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Award Plan (the ""Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan"")  which was approved and adopted at the general meeting of the Company held on August 20  2021. Under the terms of the Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan  the Overall Share Limit  representing the maximum number of Shares in respect of which the Board has authority to grant awards  was initially set at 300 000 Shares. In addition  awards may not be made if they would take the total awards made under this plan and the 2021 Incentive Plan above the Overall Share Limit applicable to the 2021 Incentive Plan. As at March 31  2023  the Company had granted restricted share units (""RSUs"") in respect of 232 302 Shares under the Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan  of which 100 000 had vested  none had lapsed and 132 302 were yet to be exercised. At that date  the Company therefore had authority to grant awards in respect of up to a further 67 698 Shares under the Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan.The Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan has till date been used for the grant of RSUs to Non-executive Independent directors and is close to being fully utilized. Approximately 60% of the total compensation (excluding committee fee) paid to Non-executive Independent directors are paid in the form of RSUs. The total RSUs granted to Non-executive Independent directors for financial year 2021-22 and 2022-23 were 100 000 and 132 302  respectively. The Company therefore as on 31st March 2023 had authority to grant awards in respect of up to a further 67 698 Shares under the Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan. Therefore  the Company needs to increase the Overall Share Limit under the Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan.Accordingly  the Board now proposes to raise the Overall Share Limit under the Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan by 1 000 000 Shares to 1 300 000 Shares. The Board considers this necessary in order to retain sufficient headroom5to grant appropriate awards to incentivize eligible service-providers  including non-executive directors from time to time in accordance with the Company's Remuneration Policy in the near future. All Shares under the Overall Share Limit will be available for future awards as the Board determines in due course in accordance with the terms of the Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan and  as applicable  the Company's Remuneration Policy.Resolutions 13 and 14 (Authority to allot shares and disapplication of pre-emption rights)Under the Companies Act  in order to allot (or grant rights to subscribe) shares in the Company the Board must be given authority by an ordinary resolution of the Company's shareholders. Upon any allotment of equity securities (ordinary shares or rights to subscribe for  or convert securities into  them) or sale of ordinary shares held as treasury shares wholly for cash  the Company's existing shareholders have statutory pre-emption rights (entitling them to be offered the shares pro rata to their existing shareholdings) under the Companies Act  unless these rights have been disapplied by a special resolution of the Company's shareholders or an exemption (such as for certain employees' share schemes) applies. These are requirements of United Kingdom company law and are additional to the requirements of the 2021 Incentive Plan and the Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan in respect of their amendment.The Board has a number of existing authorities to allot (or grant rights to subscribe) shares in the Company  in respect of which shareholders' statutory pre-emption rights have been disapplied  that were granted at the general meeting of the Company held on August 20  2021 for five-year periods. These include an authority to grant awards under the 2021 Incentive Plan and the Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan in respect of an aggregate nominal value up to US$ 6 503.02 (equivalent to 65 030 200 Shares)  granted pursuant to resolution 8 at that meeting. As at March 31  2023  the Board had outstanding authority under this resolution to allot (or grant rights to subscribe) shares with an aggregate nominal value up to approximately US$ 6 503.02 (equivalent to 65 030 200 Shares).The Board proposes resolution 13 to refresh this allotment authority to reflect the increase in the share limits under the Company's incentive award plans pursuant to resolutions 11 and 12  by increasing the nominal value to which it applies by US$ 2 296.98 (equivalent to 22 969 800 Shares) to US$ 8 800.00 (equivalent to 88 000 000 Shares). The new authority will again have a five-year term from the date of the resolution.The Board proposes resolution 14 to renew the current disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights in respect of awards under the 2021 Incentive Plan and the Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan  to increase it to cover an aggregate nominal value up to US$ 8 800.00 (equivalent to 88 000 000 Shares)  matching the allotment authority granted under resolution 13. The wording of the resolution will also clarify that it applies to the sale of treasury shares as well as the allotment of new shares pursuant to resolution 13. The Board considers this appropriate at this juncture  since the Company now holds a considerable number of Shares as treasury shares  acquired pursuant to its ongoing share buyback programme. Although awards made under the 2021 Incentive Plan are generally expected to be exempt from pre-emption rights  the Board again seeks this resolution in order to ensure that pre-emption rights will not apply to any such awards or to awards under the Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan.The Board's current intentions for the use of these authorities are set out in the explanatory notes on resolutions 11 and 12.Resolutions 13 and 14 will replace the equivalent authority and power in respect of the 2021 Incentive Plan and the Non-Employee 2021 Incentive Plan granted at the general meeting of the Company held on August 20  2021  but will not affect the other share allotment authorities and disapplication of pre-emption rights approved at that meeting.Resolution 15 (Amendment to articles of association)On July 24  2023  the shareholders' agreement dated August 23  2021 between certain of the Company's significant investors (the ""Investors"") and the Company (the ""SHA"") was amended with immediate effect  principally to change the parties' agreements as to the rights of Investors in the Company under the SHA to appoint directors and associated provisions.As required by the amended SHA  the Company is therefore proposing Resolution 15 to amend its articles of association to the form produced to the meeting (the ""New Articles"") so as to remove the inconsistencies between the Company's current articles of association (the ""Current Articles"") and the SHA that have arisen as a result of the latter's amendment.There follows a summary of the key changes as per the New Articles. This summary does not contain a full description of the changes. To understand the changes in full  shareholders are encouraged to review the full text of6the New Articles  which will be available from the date of this document until the conclusion of the AGM at the Company's website https://investor.renew.com/.

As such  while these resolutions may be familiar and routine to shareholders accustomed to being shareholders of companies incorporated in England and Wales  other shareholders may be less familiar with these routine resolutions and should review and consider each resolution carefully.2. In accordance with the Articles  all resolutions will be taken on a poll. Voting on a poll will mean that all votes attaching to each Voting Share represented in person or by proxy will be counted in the vote.3. All resolutions will be proposed as ordinary resolutions  save for resolutions 14 and 15  which will be proposed as special resolutions. The ordinary resolutions will be passed by a simple majority of the total voting rights of shareholders who vote on them  whether in person or by proxy. The special resolutions will be passed by a majority of 75% of the total voting rights of shareholders who vote on them  whether in person or by proxy.4.

Recoveries have improved since June due to the introduction of supplementary clean water to the spirals to aid the efficiency of separation processes.WCP B was unable to operate in a fully automated mode in Q2 because of a shortage of spares following the lightning strike in Q1. This impacted recoveries from mining  as did lower-than-expected grades. WCP B is now operating on a fully automated basis. Mining rates and recoveries were also impacted by buried root matter; while these conditions are not expected to recur in 2023  screening improvements have been implemented and successfully addressed this issue.WCP C undertook a planned transition through a tailings area from March 2023 to reach a new mining zone: this took longer than expected but was completed in June.Kenmare expects higher HMC production in H2 2023  benefitting from higher grades at WCP A  full production at WCP C and the resolution of the issues detailed above.H1 2023 has seen a significant improvement in the performance of the positive displacement pumps used to transport HMC from WCP B to the Mineral Separation Plant (“MSP”)  which have consistently run at design throughputs and utilisations. As a result  all transportation of HMC from WCP B to the Mineral Separation Plant (“MSP”) is now being undertaken by pumping  eliminating the need for trucking of HMC and benefitting operating efficiencies and costs.Ilmenite production was 425 500 tonnes  a 15% decrease compared to H1 2022 (499 700 tonnes)  as a result of the 14% reduction in HMC processed.The Mine has experienced an under-recovery of ilmenite in the HMC at WCP B. The higher-grade fraction of ilmenite in an area of Pilivili appears more weathered  reducing the apparent density and magnetism of the material  impacting recoveries to final product. Further test work and calibration of equipment is ongoing to maximise the recoveries of this high titanium grade ilmenite.Primary zircon production was 23 000 tonnes in H1 2023  a 13% decrease compared to H1 2022 (26 500 tonnes). Despite higher zircon grades in feed  particularly from WCP B  zircon production was affected by lower HMC availability. There was also a build of non-magnetic intermediate stocks  reducing zircon production  which is expected to unwind in H2 2023.The Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply (“RUPS”) was not operational in Q2  due to the failure of some of its electrical components. Design corrections have been implemented and the RUPS has resumed full operations.Rutile production was 3 600 tonnes  down 10% (H1 2022: 4 000 tonnes). As with zircon  this reflects lower HMC processed  offset by increased rutile in feed.Concentrates production was 20 500 tonnes  in line with H1 2022 (20 500 tonnes)  with higher content of monazite. Higher recoveries were also achieved in the secondary zircon circuit.Total shipments in H1 2023 were 556 800 tonnes  a 31% increase compared to H1 2022 (424 300 tonnes)  benefitting from increased shipping capacity in the period and the drawdown of finished product stocks. Shipments comprised 517 100 tonnes of ilmenite  19 800 tonnes of primary zircon  3 400 tonnes of rutile  and 16 500 tonnes of concentrates.Closing stock of HMC at the end of H1 2023 was 15 000 tonnes  compared to 18 800 tonnes at the end of 2022. Closing stock of finished products at the end of H1 2023 was 129 000 tonnes  compared to 213 500 tonnes at the end of 2022  reflecting a drawdown of finished product inventories to meet shipment requirements  satisfy customer demand and maintain strong operating cashflows in the period.Capital projectsThe transition of WCP A to Nataka is expected to commence in 2025. Over an 18-month period  WCP A will mine its way to the Nataka ore zone. Following this  WCP A will continue to mine in Nataka for the remainder of its economic life.Capital expenditure for the transition of WCP A to Nataka is estimated at $247 million  including a $37 million contingency. This capital is expected to be phased over a three-year period from 2023 to 2025  with the majority of the expenditure incurred in 2024 and 2025. A significant proportion of the expenditure covers the cost of replacing WCP A’s two existing dredges  the addition of a desliming circuit and the implementation of a Tailings Storage Facility. During 2026 and 2027  a further $23 million of capital expenditure will be required for additional pumping infrastructure along with up to $25 million on potential power infrastructure upgrades  the latter subject to ongoing studies.Kenmare has also identified an opportunity to upgrade WCP B by redeploying one of the current dredges from WCP A and increasing the processing capacity of the wet concentrator plant from 2 400 tph to 3 400 tph. This provides sufficient HMC for constant production at 1.2 million tonnes per annum ilmenite as WCP A is transitioning to Nataka from 2025. Based on prefeasibility studies  the capital cost is estimated at $41 million  with a Definitive Feasibility Study underway.The Company plans to fund capital expenditure requirements from existing resources and operating cash flows whilst maintaining conservative gearing levels. In addition  Kenmare is considering potential refinancing options to optimise its debt facilities in order to maintain financial flexibility.Market updateDemand for Kenmare’s products remained strong in H1 2023 with higher sales volumes compared with H1 2022. While ilmenite prices were broadly flat  slightly higher prices were achieved for zircon and rutile products compared with H1 2022. However  Kenmare’s average price for all products decreased in H1 2023  compared to H1 2022  due to a higher proportion of ilmenite shipments.Downstream titanium pigment demand was subdued in H1 2023  as higher interest rates globally affected industrial activity and the housing markets in many regions. Underlying demand in China has not rebounded as quickly as expected  but domestic pigment production remains robust. As a result  pigment producers outside China are facing increased competition from Chinese pigment exports. Lower global demand for titanium pigment is likely to continue in the short term; however  Kenmare has contracted a high proportion of Q3 2023 ilmenite sales.Demand for ilmenite in China has benefitted from the sustained production of pigment  particularly given record chloride pigment production in H1 2023. However  outside China slower pigment market conditions reduced demand for high-grade feedstocks. While the feedstock market has been kept in balance by increasing concentrates production for processing in China  continued disruption to and depletion of supply means that underlying market fundamentals remain supportive.Challenging macroeconomic conditions have softened demand for zircon. Ceramics producers are operating at reduced utilisation levels  leading to higher inventories. Reported zircon sand prices have remained stable in H1 2023  although spot prices for shipments to China and India softened in H1 2023 and remain below contracted prices moving into Q3 2023.Financial reviewIn H1 2023  Kenmare delivered a strong financial performance  generating a 26% increase in mineral products revenue to $229.7 million (H1 2022: $182.1 million) and a 6% increase in EBITDA to $110.4 million (H1 2022: $104.5 million). Record first half revenues and profits were supported by stable markets for all finished products.Kenmare’s balance sheet strengthened during the period  with net cash increasing by $16.6 million to $42.3 million (31 December 2022: $25.7 million)  after paying the $41.1 million 2022 final dividend. The Company is targeting a full year dividend of approximately $50 million for 2023  subject to prevailing product market and other conditions  and is pleased to announce a 2023 interim dividend of USc17.5 (H1 2022: USc10.98) per share. This represents a 59% increase compared to the 2022 interim dividend.RevenueMineral products revenue increased by 26% in H1 2023 to $229.7 million (H1 2022: $182.1 million)  driven by a 31% increase in volumes shipped offset by a decrease of 4% in the average received price to $413 per tonne (H1 2022: $429 per tonne).Freight revenue in H1 2023 decreased to $13.2 million (H1 2022: $15.2 million)  despite the higher volumes shipped reflecting a more favourable freight market in the period.Ilmenite revenue increased by 34% to $179.2 million in H1 2023 (H1 2022: $133.5 million)  as a result of a 35% increase in ilmenite shipment volumes. Average ilmenite pricing remained robust at $347 per tonne (H1 2022: $349 per tonne). Primary zircon revenue increased by 2% to $33.1 million (H1 2022: $32.5 million) due to a 5% price increase offset by a 3% decrease in volumes shipped.Operating costsTotal operating costs in H1 2023 were $162.6 million  a 32% increase compared to H1 2022 ($123.3 million). Increased costs reflect higher staff  fuel and power costs. Included in total operating costs is $1.7 million in relation to property damage as a result of the lightning strike on the power transmission line at the Mine in February 2023.Total cash operating costs were $108.8 million  a 7% increase compared to H1 2022 ($102.0 million). This was due primarily to the inflationary increases noted net of the drawdown of finished product inventory. Combined with a 10% decrease in production of finished products  this resulted in a 24% increase in cash operating costs per tonne of finished product to $230 in H1 2023 (H1 2022: $185 per tonne). Cash operating cost per tonne of ilmenite increased by 28% to $137 as a result of a 15% reduction in ilmenite production net of slightly higher co-product revenues.Finance income and costsKenmare recognised finance income of $3.6 million in H1 2023 (H1 2022: $0.3 million)  primarily consisting of interest on bank deposits. Finance costs were $6.3 million in H1 2023 (H1 2022: $5.7 million)  including loan interest of $4.2 million (H1 2022: $4.4 million). The decrease in principal outstanding has been offset by higher interest rates in the period. Letter of credit and other fees were $0.8 million in the period (H1 2022: $0.6 million) and the unwinding of the mine closure provision amounted to $0.3 million (H1 2022: $0.4 million). Commitment fees under the debt facilities were $0.3 million (H1 2022: $0.2 million) and lease interest was $0.05 million (H1 2022: $0.1 million).TaxThe tax charge for H1 2023 amounted to $9.7 million (H1 2022: $6.1 million). Kenmare’s subsidiary  Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited  had taxable profits of $16.3 million (H1 2022: $16.1 million)  resulting in an income tax charge of $5.6 million (H1 2022: $5.6 million). During the period Kenmare Resources plc had taxable profits of $58.6 million (H1 2022: $3.8 million) resulting in an income tax expense of $4.1 million (H1 2022: $0.5 million) being recognised. $60 million (H1 2022: $nil) of the taxable income relates to dividend income received from the subsidiary undertaking Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited with the balance relating to trading losses net of deposit income of $1.4 million (H1 2022: $3.8 million).Cash flowsNet cash from operations in H1 2023 was $82.6 million (H1 2022: $68.6 million)  reflecting higher profitability. Working capital outflow of $14.6 million (H1 2022: $29.5 million) reflects primarily increased trade receivables as a result of shipments during the period coupled with the fact that trade receivables were not discounted in the period.Investing activities of $20.2 million (H1 2022: $24.2 million) represented additions to property  plant and equipment. $15.7 million of debt repayments were made (H1 2022: $55.7 million) and a final dividend for 2022 of $41.1 million (2021: $24.1 million) was paid in May 2023. Lease repayments of $0.08 million (H1 2022: $0.6 million) were also made in the period.Consequently  Kenmare finished H1 2023 with $108.8 million of cash and cash equivalents  representing a slight increase of $0.5 million compared to year-end 2022 ($108.3 million).Balance sheetIn H1 2023 there were additions to property  plant and equipment of $20.2 million (H1 2022: $24.2 million). Additions consisted of $7.4 million development expenditure mainly in relation to preparing for the relocation of WCP A to the Nataka ore zone and $12.8 million in relation to sustaining capital.As stated above  depreciation of $30.2 million  was in line with the prior period (H1 2022: $30.5 million). The mine closure provision asset was increased by $0.8 million in H1 2023 (H1 2022: $13.5 million). This was due to a decrease in the discount rate used to estimate the closure cost provision from 4.0% to 3.85%.The Group conducted an impairment review of property  plant and equipment at the period-end and the key assumptions of this review are set out in Note 8 of the financial statements. No impairment provision is required as a result of this review.Inventory at period-end amounted to $73.3 million (31 December 2022: $84.2 million)  consisting of intermediate and finished mineral products of $34.1 million (31 December 2022: $43.7 million) and consumables and spares of $39.3 million (31 December 2022: $40.5 million).Trade and other receivables amounted to $141.1 million (31 December 2022: $124.0 million). This was comprised of $114.6 million (31 December 2022: $105.0 million) of trade receivables from the sale of mineral products  $20.1 million (31 December 2022: $14.5 million) of supplier prepayments and other miscellaneous debtors  and $6.4 million (31 December 2022: $4.5 million) of VAT receivable. Trade receivables are a function of shipments made before period-end and credit terms specific to the relevant customer. There have been no credit impairments during the period. The expected credit loss was reduced by $0.6 million (H1 2022: increased $0.2 million) during the period.Cash and cash equivalents increased by $0.5 million in the period and at 30 June 2023 amounted to $108.8 million (31 December 2022: $108.3 million).Lease liabilities amounted to $1.6 million (31 December 2022: $1.7 million) at period-end.Tax liabilities amounted to $5.5 million (31 December 2022: $8.9 million) and trade and other payables amounted to $27.7 million at period-end (31 December 2022: $35.3 million).Debt facilitiesAt period-end  reported debt amounted to $63.4 million (31 December 2022: $78.6 million). This consists of the Term Loan Facility of $62.9 million and accrued interest of $2.1 million  net of transaction costs of $1.5 million. The Group is in compliance with all debt covenants as at 30 June 2023. A semi-annual principal repayment ($15.7 million) under the Term Loan Facility was paid in March 2023. The RCF was repaid in full during 2022 and remains available to be redrawn by the Group until December 2023.Kenmare’s financial position  credit risk profile and operating performance have materially improved since the refinancing in December 2019. To reflect this  Kenmare is considering potential refinancing options to optimise its debt facilities.Financial outlookKenmare’s strategic priorities are to operate responsibly  deliver long-life  low-cost production  and to allocate capital efficiently  including developing accretive growth opportunities. The Group is focused on maintaining a robust and flexible balance sheet to enable it to deliver all these goals  particularly to fund its capital investment requirements and shareholder returns.Kenmare will continue to manage its operating cost base in a conservative and sustainable manner  cognisant of inflationary pressures and other risks that face its business  in order to minimise unit costs.While market demand remains slightly muted  we expect strong financial performance in H2  with cash flows continuing to support all expected expenditures and shareholder returns.Interim dividendKenmare generated record first half profit after tax of $67.8 million in H1 2023 (H1 2022: $62.5 million). The Board has therefore approved an interim 2023 dividend of USc17.5 per share (H1 2022: USc10.98). The financial statements do not reflect this interim dividend.The Company will pay the interim dividend on 13 October 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 22 September 2023; shares purchased by the Company under the proposed Tender Offer announced today will thus not qualify for the interim dividend. Irish Dividend Withholding Tax (25%) must be deducted from dividends paid by the Company  unless a shareholder is entitled to an exemption and has submitted a properly completed exemption form to the Company’s Registrar.The dividend timetable is as follows:Announcement of interim dividend 15 August 2023 Ex-Dividend Date 21 September 2023 Record Date 22 September 2023 Currency election cut-off date 26 September 2023 at 12:00 noon (IST) Payment Date 13 October 2023Principal risks and uncertaintiesThere are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on Kenmare’s performance over the remaining six months of the 2023 financial year and which could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historic results.These principal risks and uncertainties are disclosed in Kenmare’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2022. A detailed explanation of these principal risks and uncertainties and how Kenmare seeks to mitigate these risks  can be found on pages 70 to 79 of the 2022 Annual Report under the following headings: grant  maintenance renewal and extension of agreements and licences  country risk  geotechnical risk  severe weather events  uncertainty over and/or changes in physical characteristics of the orebody  power supply and transmission risk  asset damage or loss  health  safety and environment  mineral resource statement risk  IT security risk  development project risk  industry cyclicality  customer concentration  foreign currency risk and cost inflation.The Group’s climate risks disclosure is set out on pages 60 to 65 of the 2022 Annual Report. These have not changed in the first half of the year and outline the Group’s objectives in relation to climate risk. We have continued with these objectives in H1 of 2023 and will provide an update in the 2023 Annual Report.Related party transactionsThere have been no material changes in the related party transactions affecting the financial position or the performance of the Group in the period since publication of the 2022 Annual Report other than those disclosed in Note 20 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.Going concernAs stated in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements  based on the Group’s forecasts and projections  the Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future  a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly  they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements.Events after the Statement of Financial Position DateShare buy backOn 14 August 2023  the Board approved a Tender Offer. Details of the offer are set out in a separate announcement which the Company is making today.Interim dividendAn interim dividend for the period ended 30 June 2023 of USc17.5 per share was approved by the Board on 14 August 2023. The dividend payable has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. The interim dividend is payable to all shareholders on the Register of Members on 22 September 2023.There have been no other significant events since 30 June 2023 that would have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group.Forward-looking statementsThis report contains certain forward-looking statements. These statements are made by the Directors in good faith based on the information available to them up to the time of their approval of this report  and such statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties  including both economic and business risk factors  underlying any such forward-looking information.On behalf of the Board Managing Director Financial DirectorMichael Carvill Tom Hickey14 August 2023 14 August 2023Independent Review Report to Kenmare Resources plc (“the Entity”)ConclusionWe have been engaged by the Entity to review the Entity’s condensed set of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2023 which comprises the condensed consolidated interim income statement  the condensed consolidated interim statement of other comprehensive income  the condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position  the condensed consolidated interim statement of cash flows  the condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in equity  a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.Based on our review  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2023 is not prepared  in all material respects in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”) as adopted by the EU and the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (“Transparency Directive”)  and the Central Bank (Investment Market Conduct) Rules 2019 (“Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland”).Basis for conclusionWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (Ireland) 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (“ISRE (Ireland) 2410”) issued for use in Ireland. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries  primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters  and applying analytical and other review procedures.A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly  we do not express an audit opinion.We read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report to identify material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of consolidated financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on  or materially inconsistent with  the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the review. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies  we consider the implications for our report.Conclusions relating to going concernBased on our review procedures  which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting  or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that have not been appropriately disclosed.This conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (Ireland) 2410. However  future events or conditions may cause the Entity to cease to continue as a going concern  and the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Entity will continue in operation.Directors’ responsibilitiesThe half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of  and has been approved by  the Directors.

The Group Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months ended 30 June 2023 have been prepared in accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007  as amended  the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland  Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4.2 of the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’  as adopted by the European Union.The financial information presented in this document does not constitute statutory financial statements. The amounts presented in the half-yearly financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2023 and the corresponding amounts for the six months ended 30 June 2022 have been reviewed but not audited. The independent review report is on pages 11 and 12.The financial information for the year ended 31 December 2022  presented herein  is an abbreviated version of the annual financial statements for the Group in respect of the year ended 31 December 2022. The Group’s annual financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2022 have been filed in the Companies Registration Office and the independent auditor issued an unqualified audit report thereon. The annual report is available on the Company’s website at www.kenmareresources.com.Use of Judgements and EstimatesThe preparation of the half-yearly financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements  estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses together with disclosure of assets and liabilities. Estimates and underlying assumptions relevant to these financial statements are the same as those described in the last annual financial statements.Going ConcernThe Directors have  at the time of approving the financial statements  a reasonable expectation that the Group has or will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Based on the Group’s cash flow forecast  liquidity and solvency position the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources for the foreseeable future and  therefore  they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.The Group forecast has been prepared by management with best estimates of production  pricing and cost assumptions over the period. Key assumptions upon which the Group forecast is based include a mine plan covering production using the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. Production levels for the purpose of the forecast are approximately 1.2 million tonnes of ilmenite plus co-products  zircon  concentrates and rutile  over the next twelve months. Assumptions for product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers or  where contract prices are based on market prices or production is not presently contracted  prices are forecast taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise and management expectations. Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2023  taking into account the current and future running costs of the Mine and escalated by 2% per annum thereafter. Capital costs are based on the capital plans and include escalation at 2% per annum. Current operating costs and forecast capital costs take into account the current inflationary environment. The 2% inflation rate used to escalate these costs over the life of mine is an estimated long-term inflation rate.Sensitivity analysis is applied to the assumptions above to test the robustness of the cash flow forecasts for reductions in market prices  reductions in production  increases in operating costs and a combined case of the aforementioned factors. Changes in these assumptions affect the level of sales and profitability of the Group and the amount of capital required to deliver the projected production levels. As a result of this assessment  the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next 12 months.Changes in accounting policiesThe accounting policies applied in the half-yearly financial statements are those set out in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.The following new and revised standards  all of which are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023  have been adopted in the current financial period;• IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and Amendments to IFRS 17 effective 1 January 2023• Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 effective 1 January 2023• Definition of Accounting Estimate – Amendments to IAS 8 effective 1 January 2023• Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction – Amendments to IAS 12 effective 1 January 2023None of the new and revised standards have a material effect on the Group’s condensed consolidated financial statements.2.

Mineral stock movement in the period was a decrease of $9.6 million (H1 2022: $27.8 million increase). Distribution costs of $2.9 million (H1 2022: $2.9 million) represent the cost of running the Mine’s finished product storage  jetty and marine fleet. Freight costs of $13.2 million (H1 2022: $15.2 million) arise from sales to customers on a Cost  Insurance and Freight (CIF) or Cost and Freight (CFR) basis. There were no exceptional items within operating profit in H1 2023 (H1 2022 restated: $nil). The H1 2022 income statement has been restated in order to reclassify freight costs and distribution costs from other operating costs to cost of sales. In addition  foreign exchange gains and losses have been reclassified to cost of sales and administrative costs and are no longer presented separately on the face of the income statement. Management believes these presentational changes more appropriately reflect the nature of each category of expense.As previously reportedAdjustment As restated 30 June 2022 30 June 2022 $’000 $’000 $’000 Revenue 197 294 - 197 294 Cost of sales (95 236) (22 618) (117 854) Other operating costs/Administrative expenses (27 082) 21 661 (5 421) Net Finance costs (5 635) 253 (5 382) Foreign exchange (704) 704 - Taxation (6 098) - (6 098) Profit for the financial year and total comprehensive income for the financial year 62 539- 62 5395Net finance costsUnaudited 30 June 2023$’000 RestatedUnaudited 30 June 2022$’000 Finance costs Interest on bank borrowings (4 229) (4 350) Interest on lease liabilities (46) (77) Factoring and other trade facility fees (807) (681) Commitment and other fees (294) (222) Unwinding of discount on mine closure provision (334) (376) Foreign exchange loss (614) - Total Finance Costs (6 324) (5 706) Finance income Interest earned on bank deposits 2 919 89 Foreign exchange gain 670 235 Total Finance Income 3 589 324 Net finance costs recognised in profit or loss (2 735) (5 382)All interest has been expensed in the financial period.

Income tax expenseUnaudited30 June 2023$’000 Unaudited30 June 2022$’000 Corporation tax 9 727 6 098During the period the KMML Mozambique Branch had taxable profits of $16.3 million (H1 2022: $16.1 million) resulting in an income tax expense of $5.6 million (H1 2022: $5.6 million) being recognised. The income tax rate applicable to taxable profits of KMML Mozambique Branch is 35% (H1 2022: 35%).KMML Mozambique Branch has elected  and the fiscal regime applicable to mining allows for  the option to deduct  as an allowable deduction  depreciation of exploration and development expense and capital expenditure over the life of mine. Tax losses may be carried forward for three years. There are no tax losses carried forward at 30 June 2023.During the period Kenmare Resources plc had taxable profits of $58.6 million (H1 2022: $3.8 million) resulting in an income tax expense of $4.9 million (H1 2022: $0.5 million) being recognised. Tax adjustments of $0.8 million were recognised in relation to prior year estimates and returns and have the effect of reducing the charge in the period. $60 million (H1 2022: $nil) of the taxable income relates to dividend income received from the subsidiary undertaking Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited with the balance relating to trading losses net of deposit income of $1.4 million (H1 2022: $3.8 million).7.

The Group considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and its book value  among other factors  when reviewing for indicators for impairment. As at 30 June 2023  the market capitalisation of the Group was below the book value of net assets  which is considered an indicator of impairment of assets.The Group carried out an impairment review of property  plant and equipment as at 30 June 2023. As a result of the review  and given the performance and outlook of the Group  no impairment provision was recognised in the current financial period. No impairment was recognised in the prior financial year. Given the historic volatility in product pricing and sensitivities of the forecast to the discount rate and to a lesser extent operating costs  the impairment loss of $64.8 million  which was recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in 2014  was not reversed.The cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing is the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine. The basis on which the Mine is assessed is its value in use. The cash flow forecast employed for the value-in-use computation is from a life of mine financial model. The recoverable amount obtained from the financial model represents the present value of the future discounted pre-tax  pre-finance cash flows discounted at 13.0% (31 December 2022: 14.0%).Key assumptions in the value in use calculation include the following:The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. This rate is a best estimate of the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Mine  taking into consideration country risk  currency risk and price risk. The factors comprising the cost of equity and cost of debt have changed from the year-end review  in particular the equity risk premium which has decreased  resulting in a discount rate of 13.0% (31 December 2022: 14.0%). The Group’s estimation of the country risk premium included in the discount rate has remained unchanged from the prior year. The Group does not consider it appropriate to apply the full current country risk premium for Mozambique to the calculation of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital as it believes the specific circumstances which have resulted in the risk premium increase over the past number of years are not relevant to Kenmare’s operations. Hence  country risk premium applicable to the calculation of the cost of equity has been adjusted accordingly. Using a discount rate of 13.0%  the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying amount by $346.0 million (31 December 2022: $86.9 million). The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the recoverable amount. A 4.0% increase in the discount rate to 17.0% reduces the recoverable amount by $346.0 million to $nil  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged. The increase in the recoverable amount from the year-end review is a result of increased cash flows over the life of mine as a result of updated forecast sales prices and a decrease in the discount rate from 14.0% to 13.0%.The mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi proved and probable reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine life assumption of 40 years has not changed from the year-end review. Average annual production is approximately 1.2 million tonnes (31 December 2022: 1.2 million tonnes) of ilmenite and co-products zircon  rutile and concentrates over the life of the Mine and remains unchanged from the year-end review. The mine plan does not include investment in additional mining capacity. Certain minimum stocks of final and intermediate products are assumed to be maintained at period ends.Product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers  or where contracts are based on market prices or production is not currently contracted  prices are forecasted by the Group taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise provided by TiPMC Solutions and management expectations including general inflation of 2% per annum. Forecast prices provided by TiPMC Solutions have been reviewed and found to be consistent with other external sources of information. Average forecast product sales prices have increased over the life of mine from the year-end review as a result of revised forecast pricing. A 9% reduction in average sales prices over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $346.0 million  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2023 taking into account the current running costs of the Mine and estimated inflation for 2023. From 2024 onwards  operating costs are escalated by 2% per annum as management expects inflation to normalise and average 2% over the life of mine period. Average forecast operating costs have decreased slightly from the year-end review. Increased costs associated with estimated future power consumption and price for the mining in Nataka have been included in the forecast cashflows in the period. A 17.5% increase in operating costs over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $346.0 million  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.Whilst the Group has set ambitions to be net zero by 2040  the financial impact is still being assessed as the Group considers how it will work towards meeting this target. As such  estimates and judgements within these financial statements do not consider the expenditure (or any related savings) associated with the Company’s ambition to become net zero nor the financial impact of the climate risks disclosed within the Group’s TCFD reporting as a reliable estimate cannot currently be made.Capital costs are based on a life of mine capital plan including inflation at 2% per annum from 2024. Average forecast capital costs have increased  and their scheduling changed from the year-end review based on updated capital plans required to maintain the existing plants over the life of mine. A 39% increase in capital costs over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $346.0 million  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.9.

The lease for the electricity generators was renewed in November 2017 for a five-year period and rental payments were fixed for the five years. The lease agreement expired in November 2022 and following negotiations the Group completed the acquisition process of the electricity generators in February 2023.On 1 January 2019  the Group recognised a lease liability of $1.7 million in respect of the rental of its Irish head office. The lease has a term of 10 years commencing August 2017 and rental payments are fixed for the remainder of this term. This lease obligation is denominated in Euros.In December 2022  the lease in respect of the Group’s Mozambican country office in Maputo was amended. The lease term was extended to 10 years commencing 1 December 2022. This lease obligation is denominated in US Dollars.The weighted average rate applied to the leases is 8.4%.At each reporting date  the Company assesses whether there is any indication that right-of-use assets may be impaired. No impairment indicators were identified as at 30 June 2023 or 31 December 2022.Set out below are the carrying amounts of lease liabilities at each reporting date:Unaudited30 June 2023$’000 Audited31 Dec 2022$’000 Current 255 245 Non-Current 1 389 1 540 1 644 1 78510.

The finance documentation also provides for a Mine Closure Guarantee Facility (provided by either the existing lenders or other finance providers) of up to $40 million  with the provider(s) of such a facility sharing in the common security package. The potential total aggregate principal amount of indebtedness secured under the finance documentation is therefore $190 million.The Term Loan Facility has a final maturity date of 11 March 2025. Interest is at SOFR plus 5.40% per annum. Repayment is in seven equal semi-annual instalments and the first repayment was made on 11 March 2022.The Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of 11 December 2023  which is extendable by a further 12 months at the lenders’ discretion. Interest is at SOFR plus 4.25% per annum.The Group entered into a mine closure guarantee facility with Absa Bank Moçambique SA effective from 1 July 2023 for an amount of $26.6 million. This guarantee shares the security package with the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility on a pro rata and pari passu basis.The security package consists of (a) security over the Group’s bank accounts (subject to certain exceptions)  (b) pledges of the shares of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited and Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (the “Project Companies”)  (c) security over intercompany loans and (d) Mozambican law security interests over certain rights and agreements with Mozambican authorities  including over the Implementation Agreement  the Mineral Licensing Contract and the Mining Licence.The carrying amount of the secured bank accounts of the Group was $102.0 million as at 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022: $102.9 million). The shares of the Project Companies and intercompany loans are not included in the consolidated statement of financial position as they are eliminated on consolidation. They therefore do not have a carrying amount but  upon enforcement of the pledges on behalf of the lender group  the shares in the Project Companies would cease to be owned or controlled by the Group. The secured rights and agreements do not have a carrying amount. They are  however  necessary for the Project Companies to operate the Mine in Mozambique.During the period $15.7 million of the Term Loan Facility was repaid. At the period-end  reported debt amounted to $63.4 million (31 December 2022: $78.6 million). This consists of the Term Loan Facility of $62.9 million (31 December 2022: $78.9 million) and accrued loan interest of $2.1 million (31 December 2022: $1.9 million)  net of transaction costs of $1.5 million (31 December 2022: $2.2 million).Reconciliation of movements of debt to cashflows arising from financing activities Unaudited30 June 2023$’000 Audited31 Dec 2022$’000 Bank Loans Balance at 1 January 78 578 148 099 Cash movements Loan interest paid (3 646) (6 921) Principal repaid (15 715) (91 429) Loan drawn down - 20 000 Non-cash movements Loan interest accrued 4 229 8 829 Balance at 30 June/31 December 63 446 78 578Financial CovenantsAs at30 June 2023 As at31 December 2022 CovenantInterest Coverage Ratio 56.17:1 34.96:1 Not less than 4.00:1 Net Debt to EBITDA (0.15):1 (0.09):1 Not greater than 2.00:1 Debt Service Coverage Ratio 6.71:1 3.11:1 Not less than 1.20:1 Liquidity (million) $148.8 $148.3 Not less than $15.0 Reserve Tail Ratio 81% 81% Not less than 30%All financial covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement have been complied with during the period.

A corresponding amount equal to the provision is recognised as part of property  plant and equipment.The costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan  are subject to regular review and are estimated based on the net present value of estimated future costs. Mine closure costs are a normal consequence of mining  and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the life of the Mine. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost and $0.3 million (H1 2022: $0.4 million) has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the financial period.The main assumptions used in the calculation of the estimated future costs include:• a discount rate of 3.85% (31 December 2022: 4.0%);• an inflation rate of 2% (31 December 2022: 2%);• an estimated life of mine of 40 years (31 December 2022: 40 years). It is assumed that all licences and permits required to operate will be renewed or extended during the life of mine; and• an estimated closure cost of $34.1 million (31 December 2022: $34.1 million) and an estimated post-closure monitoring provision of $3.9 million (31 December 2022: $3.9 million).The life of mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine closure provision has been increased by $0.8 million from 31 December 2022 to reflect a change in the discount rate from 4.0% at 31 December 2022 to 3.85% at 30 June 2023.The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the Mine closure provision. The Group uses a Thirty-year US Treasury yield as this is the longest period for which yields are quoted. This discount rate is deemed to provide the best estimate of the current market assessment of risk-free time value of money. Risks specific to the liability are included in the cost estimate.The Mine rehabilitation provision represents the Directors’ best estimate of the Company’s liability for rehabilitating areas disturbed by mining activities. Rehabilitation costs are recognised based on the area disturbed and estimated cost of rehabilitation per hectare which is reviewed regularly against actual rehabilitation cost per hectare. Actual rehabilitation expenditure is incurred approximately twelve months after the area has been disturbed. During the financial period there was a release of $0.5 million (H1 2022: $0.3 million) to reflect the actual mine rehabilitation costs incurred  and an addition to the provision of $1.3 million (H1 2022: $1.0 million) for areas newly disturbed.17.

The table does not include fair value information for other receivables  prepayments  trade payables and accruals as these are not measured at fair value as the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Trade receivables which are factored through the Absa Bank facility or letters of credit which are always confirmed and discounted through the Barclays Bank facility are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Trade receivables or letters of credit where it is not known at initial recognition if they will be factored are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Group derecognises the original receivable to which the arrangement applies when payment is received from the bank as the terms of the arrangement are non-recourse. The payment to the bank by the Group’s customers are considered non-cash transactions. Trade receivables not measured at fair value are receivables whose payment is received under the sale contract credit terms.The valuation technique used in measuring Level 2 fair values is discounted cash flows  which considers the expected receipts or payments discounted using adjusted market discount rates or where these rates are not available estimated discount rates.Credit riskThe Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual circumstances of each customer. The Group also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base  including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate.Before entering into sales contracts with new customers  the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits attributed to customers are reviewed regularly during the year.The Group’s customers have been transacting with the Group for a significant number of years  and no customer’s balances have been written off or are credit impaired at the financial period end. In monitoring customer credit risk  customers are reviewed individually  and the Group has not identified any factors that would merit reducing exposure to any particular customer. The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade receivables.For trade receivables measured at fair value through OCI and trade receivables measured at amortised cost  the Group allocates to each customer a credit risk grade based on data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss (including but not limited to external ratings  financial statements and available market information about customers) and applying experienced credit judgement.The movement in expected credit losses in respect of trade receivables were measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income during the period was as follows:Unaudited30 June 2023$’000 Audited31 Dec 2022$’000 Opening balance 1 534 424 Net remeasurement of loss allowance (601) 1 110 Closing 933 1 534The increase in the loss allowance is mainly attributable to increases in industry specific externally published forward looking default rates which are used as the basis of estimating the Group’s expected credit losses. The methodology for the calculation of expected credit losses is the same as described in the last annual statements.Interest rate benchmark reformA fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally  including the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as “IBOR reform”)  including LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate).Pursuant to an Amendment and Restatement Agreement entered into on 9 March 2023 in respect of the Group’s debt facilities  the basis on which interest is calculated in respect of those facilities were amended with effect from 11 March 2023. As a result of the amendment  interest rates for interest periods commencing from 11 March 2023 onwards are no longer determined by reference to US LIBOR; instead they are determined on the basis of the applicable Term SOFR Rate. While US LIBOR represented an inter-bank lending rate  Term SOFR is a published screen rate derived from SOFR  being the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. As SOFR represents a risk-free rate  a credit adjustment spread is applied in addition  which spread varies according to the length of the relevant interest period.The six-month SOFR rate set on 11 March 2023 relating to the next interest period to 11 September 2023 was 5.4%. The credit adjustment spread of 0.4% plus the margin of 5.4% results in an interest rate of 11.2% on the Term Loan. The Group has concluded that the new basis for determining cashflows is economically equivalent to the previous basis.19. Share-based paymentsKenmare Restricted Share Plan (KRSP)During the financial period  864 481 (H1 2022: 653 174) shares were granted to employees under the 2023 KRSP award. The estimated fair value of the shares awarded is $5.0 million (H1 2022: $3.7 million). These share awards vest  subject to continued employment on the third anniversary or  in the case of Executive Directors and certain other staff  subject to continued employment and to the Remuneration Committee’s assessment against a discretionary underpin  on the third anniversary of grant.During the financial period  the Group recognised a share-based payment expense of $1.4 million (H1 2022: $3.2 million).During the period  awards in respect of 1 073 896 shares were exercised at a cost of $5.8 million.20. Related party transactionsTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries  which are related parties  have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.Apart from existing remuneration arrangements there were no material transactions or balances between the Group and its key management personnel or members of their close families during the period under review.21.

This presentational change had no impact on underlying earnings. Further details are set out in Note 4 to the Financial Statements. Additional information in relation to Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”) is disclosed in the Glossary. Concentrates includes secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate. Total operating costs consists of cost of sales and administration costs as reported in the income statement. Included in operating costs are depreciation and amortisation. Total cash costs consists of total operating costs less freight and non-cash costs  including inventory movements.OperationsKenmare’s rolling 12-month LTIFR to 30 June 2023 was 0.18 per 200 000 hours worked (H12022: 0.0)  with one Lost Time Injury recorded during Q2 2023. Kenmare is committed to continuing to build a strong  employee-led safety culture at Moma and is focused on improving safety leadership and ensuring best practices for identifying  assessing and mitigating risks are fully implemented.HMC production was 633 900 tonnes in H1 2023  representing a 14% decrease compared to H1 2022 (738 300 tonnes). This was a product of a 4% decrease in ore grades to 4.19% (H1 2022: 4.35%) and a 6% decrease in excavated ore volumes to 18.4 million tonnes (H1 2022: 19.5 million tonnes).HMC production in H1 was impacted by:Poor power quality as interruptions from the grid and unplanned maintenance by Electricidade de Moçambique reduced mining operating hours.Lower recoveries at WCP A due to high slimes levels. Recoveries have improved since June due to the introduction of supplementary clean water to the spirals to aid the efficiency of separation processes.WCP B was unable to operate in a fully automated mode in Q2 because of a shortage of spares following the lightning strike in Q1. This impacted recoveries from mining  as did lower-than-expected grades. WCP B is now operating on a fully automated basis. Mining rates and recoveries were also impacted by buried root matter; while these conditions are not expected to recur in 2023  screening improvements have been implemented and successfully addressed this issue.WCP C undertook a planned transition through a tailings area from March 2023 to reach a new mining zone: this took longer than expected but was completed in June.Kenmare expects higher HMC production in H2 2023  benefitting from higher grades at WCP A  full production at WCP C and the resolution of the issues detailed above.H1 2023 has seen a significant improvement in the performance of the positive displacement pumps used to transport HMC from WCP B to the Mineral Separation Plant (“MSP”)  which have consistently run at design throughputs and utilisations. As a result  all transportation of HMC from WCP B to the Mineral Separation Plant (“MSP”) is now being undertaken by pumping  eliminating the need for trucking of HMC and benefitting operating efficiencies and costs.Ilmenite production was 425 500 tonnes  a 15% decrease compared to H1 2022 (499 700 tonnes)  as a result of the 14% reduction in HMC processed.The Mine has experienced an under-recovery of ilmenite in the HMC at WCP B. The higher-grade fraction of ilmenite in an area of Pilivili appears more weathered  reducing the apparent density and magnetism of the material  impacting recoveries to final product. Further test work and calibration of equipment is ongoing to maximise the recoveries of this high titanium grade ilmenite.Primary zircon production was 23 000 tonnes in H1 2023  a 13% decrease compared to H1 2022 (26 500 tonnes). Despite higher zircon grades in feed  particularly from WCP B  zircon production was affected by lower HMC availability. There was also a build of non-magnetic intermediate stocks  reducing zircon production  which is expected to unwind in H2 2023.The Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply (“RUPS”) was not operational in Q2  due to the failure of some of its electrical components. Design corrections have been implemented and the RUPS has resumed full operations.Rutile production was 3 600 tonnes  down 10% (H1 2022: 4 000 tonnes). As with zircon  this reflects lower HMC processed  offset by increased rutile in feed.Concentrates production was 20 500 tonnes  in line with H1 2022 (20 500 tonnes)  with higher content of monazite. Higher recoveries were also achieved in the secondary zircon circuit.Total shipments in H1 2023 were 556 800 tonnes  a 31% increase compared to H1 2022 (424 300 tonnes)  benefitting from increased shipping capacity in the period and the drawdown of finished product stocks. Shipments comprised 517 100 tonnes of ilmenite  19 800 tonnes of primary zircon  3 400 tonnes of rutile  and 16 500 tonnes of concentrates.Closing stock of HMC at the end of H1 2023 was 15 000 tonnes  compared to 18 800 tonnes at the end of 2022. Closing stock of finished products at the end of H1 2023 was 129 000 tonnes  compared to 213 500 tonnes at the end of 2022  reflecting a drawdown of finished product inventories to meet shipment requirements  satisfy customer demand and maintain strong operating cashflows in the period.Capital projectsThe transition of WCP A to Nataka is expected to commence in 2025. Over an 18-month period  WCP A will mine its way to the Nataka ore zone. Following this  WCP A will continue to mine in Nataka for the remainder of its economic life.Capital expenditure for the transition of WCP A to Nataka is estimated at $247 million  including a $37 million contingency. This capital is expected to be phased over a three-year period from 2023 to 2025  with the majority of the expenditure incurred in 2024 and 2025. A significant proportion of the expenditure covers the cost of replacing WCP A’s two existing dredges  the addition of a desliming circuit and the implementation of a Tailings Storage Facility. During 2026 and 2027  a further $23 million of capital expenditure will be required for additional pumping infrastructure along with up to $25 million on potential power infrastructure upgrades  the latter subject to ongoing studies.Kenmare has also identified an opportunity to upgrade WCP B by redeploying one of the current dredges from WCP A and increasing the processing capacity of the wet concentrator plant from 2 400 tph to 3 400 tph. This provides sufficient HMC for constant production at 1.2 million tonnes per annum ilmenite as WCP A is transitioning to Nataka from 2025. Based on prefeasibility studies  the capital cost is estimated at $41 million  with a Definitive Feasibility Study underway.The Company plans to fund capital expenditure requirements from existing resources and operating cash flows whilst maintaining conservative gearing levels. In addition  Kenmare is considering potential refinancing options to optimise its debt facilities in order to maintain financial flexibility.Market updateDemand for Kenmare’s products remained strong in H1 2023 with higher sales volumes compared with H1 2022. While ilmenite prices were broadly flat  slightly higher prices were achieved for zircon and rutile products compared with H1 2022. However  Kenmare’s average price for all products decreased in H1 2023  compared to H1 2022  due to a higher proportion of ilmenite shipments.Downstream titanium pigment demand was subdued in H1 2023  as higher interest rates globally affected industrial activity and the housing markets in many regions. Underlying demand in China has not rebounded as quickly as expected  but domestic pigment production remains robust. As a result  pigment producers outside China are facing increased competition from Chinese pigment exports. Lower global demand for titanium pigment is likely to continue in the short term; however  Kenmare has contracted a high proportion of Q3 2023 ilmenite sales.Demand for ilmenite in China has benefitted from the sustained production of pigment  particularly given record chloride pigment production in H1 2023. However  outside China slower pigment market conditions reduced demand for high-grade feedstocks. While the feedstock market has been kept in balance by increasing concentrates production for processing in China  continued disruption to and depletion of supply means that underlying market fundamentals remain supportive.Challenging macroeconomic conditions have softened demand for zircon. Ceramics producers are operating at reduced utilisation levels  leading to higher inventories. Reported zircon sand prices have remained stable in H1 2023  although spot prices for shipments to China and India softened in H1 2023 and remain below contracted prices moving into Q3 2023.Financial reviewIn H1 2023  Kenmare delivered a strong financial performance  generating a 26% increase in mineral products revenue to $229.7 million (H1 2022: $182.1 million) and a 6% increase in EBITDA to $110.4 million (H1 2022: $104.5 million). Record first half revenues and profits were supported by stable markets for all finished products.Kenmare’s balance sheet strengthened during the period  with net cash increasing by $16.6 million to $42.3 million (31 December 2022: $25.7 million)  after paying the $41.1 million 2022 final dividend. The Company is targeting a full year dividend of approximately $50 million for 2023  subject to prevailing product market and other conditions  and is pleased to announce a 2023 interim dividend of USc17.5 (H1 2022: USc10.98) per share. This represents a 59% increase compared to the 2022 interim dividend.RevenueMineral products revenue increased by 26% in H1 2023 to $229.7 million (H1 2022: $182.1 million)  driven by a 31% increase in volumes shipped offset by a decrease of 4% in the average received price to $413 per tonne (H1 2022: $429 per tonne).Freight revenue in H1 2023 decreased to $13.2 million (H1 2022: $15.2 million)  despite the higher volumes shipped reflecting a more favourable freight market in the period.Ilmenite revenue increased by 34% to $179.2 million in H1 2023 (H1 2022: $133.5 million)  as a result of a 35% increase in ilmenite shipment volumes. Average ilmenite pricing remained robust at $347 per tonne (H1 2022: $349 per tonne). Primary zircon revenue increased by 2% to $33.1 million (H1 2022: $32.5 million) due to a 5% price increase offset by a 3% decrease in volumes shipped.Operating costsTotal operating costs in H1 2023 were $162.6 million  a 32% increase compared to H1 2022 ($123.3 million). Increased costs reflect higher staff  fuel and power costs. Included in total operating costs is $1.7 million in relation to property damage as a result of the lightning strike on the power transmission line at the Mine in February 2023.Total cash operating costs were $108.8 million  a 7% increase compared to H1 2022 ($102.0 million). This was due primarily to the inflationary increases noted net of the drawdown of finished product inventory. Combined with a 10% decrease in production of finished products  this resulted in a 24% increase in cash operating costs per tonne of finished product to $230 in H1 2023 (H1 2022: $185 per tonne). Cash operating cost per tonne of ilmenite increased by 28% to $137 as a result of a 15% reduction in ilmenite production net of slightly higher co-product revenues.Finance income and costsKenmare recognised finance income of $3.6 million in H1 2023 (H1 2022: $0.3 million)  primarily consisting of interest on bank deposits. Finance costs were $6.3 million in H1 2023 (H1 2022: $5.7 million)  including loan interest of $4.2 million (H1 2022: $4.4 million). The decrease in principal outstanding has been offset by higher interest rates in the period. Letter of credit and other fees were $0.8 million in the period (H1 2022: $0.6 million) and the unwinding of the mine closure provision amounted to $0.3 million (H1 2022: $0.4 million). Commitment fees under the debt facilities were $0.3 million (H1 2022: $0.2 million) and lease interest was $0.05 million (H1 2022: $0.1 million).TaxThe tax charge for H1 2023 amounted to $9.7 million (H1 2022: $6.1 million). Kenmare’s subsidiary  Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited  had taxable profits of $16.3 million (H1 2022: $16.1 million)  resulting in an income tax charge of $5.6 million (H1 2022: $5.6 million). During the period Kenmare Resources plc had taxable profits of $58.6 million (H1 2022: $3.8 million) resulting in an income tax expense of $4.1 million (H1 2022: $0.5 million) being recognised. $60 million (H1 2022: $nil) of the taxable income relates to dividend income received from the subsidiary undertaking Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited with the balance relating to trading losses net of deposit income of $1.4 million (H1 2022: $3.8 million).Cash flowsNet cash from operations in H1 2023 was $82.6 million (H1 2022: $68.6 million)  reflecting higher profitability. Working capital outflow of $14.6 million (H1 2022: $29.5 million) reflects primarily increased trade receivables as a result of shipments during the period coupled with the fact that trade receivables were not discounted in the period.Investing activities of $20.2 million (H1 2022: $24.2 million) represented additions to property  plant and equipment. $15.7 million of debt repayments were made (H1 2022: $55.7 million) and a final dividend for 2022 of $41.1 million (2021: $24.1 million) was paid in May 2023. Lease repayments of $0.08 million (H1 2022: $0.6 million) were also made in the period.Consequently  Kenmare finished H1 2023 with $108.8 million of cash and cash equivalents  representing a slight increase of $0.5 million compared to year-end 2022 ($108.3 million).Balance sheetIn H1 2023 there were additions to property  plant and equipment of $20.2 million (H1 2022: $24.2 million). Additions consisted of $7.4 million development expenditure mainly in relation to preparing for the relocation of WCP A to the Nataka ore zone and $12.8 million in relation to sustaining capital.As stated above  depreciation of $30.2 million  was in line with the prior period (H1 2022: $30.5 million). The mine closure provision asset was increased by $0.8 million in H1 2023 (H1 2022: $13.5 million). This was due to a decrease in the discount rate used to estimate the closure cost provision from 4.0% to 3.85%.The Group conducted an impairment review of property  plant and equipment at the period-end and the key assumptions of this review are set out in Note 8 of the financial statements. No impairment provision is required as a result of this review.Inventory at period-end amounted to $73.3 million (31 December 2022: $84.2 million)  consisting of intermediate and finished mineral products of $34.1 million (31 December 2022: $43.7 million) and consumables and spares of $39.3 million (31 December 2022: $40.5 million).Trade and other receivables amounted to $141.1 million (31 December 2022: $124.0 million). This was comprised of $114.6 million (31 December 2022: $105.0 million) of trade receivables from the sale of mineral products  $20.1 million (31 December 2022: $14.5 million) of supplier prepayments and other miscellaneous debtors  and $6.4 million (31 December 2022: $4.5 million) of VAT receivable. Trade receivables are a function of shipments made before period-end and credit terms specific to the relevant customer. There have been no credit impairments during the period. The expected credit loss was reduced by $0.6 million (H1 2022: increased $0.2 million) during the period.Cash and cash equivalents increased by $0.5 million in the period and at 30 June 2023 amounted to $108.8 million (31 December 2022: $108.3 million).Lease liabilities amounted to $1.6 million (31 December 2022: $1.7 million) at period-end.Tax liabilities amounted to $5.5 million (31 December 2022: $8.9 million) and trade and other payables amounted to $27.7 million at period-end (31 December 2022: $35.3 million).Debt facilitiesAt period-end  reported debt amounted to $63.4 million (31 December 2022: $78.6 million). This consists of the Term Loan Facility of $62.9 million and accrued interest of $2.1 million  net of transaction costs of $1.5 million. The Group is in compliance with all debt covenants as at 30 June 2023. A semi-annual principal repayment ($15.7 million) under the Term Loan Facility was paid in March 2023. The RCF was repaid in full during 2022 and remains available to be redrawn by the Group until December 2023.Kenmare’s financial position  credit risk profile and operating performance have materially improved since the refinancing in December 2019. To reflect this  Kenmare is considering potential refinancing options to optimise its debt facilities.Financial outlookKenmare’s strategic priorities are to operate responsibly  deliver long-life  low-cost production  and to allocate capital efficiently  including developing accretive growth opportunities. The Group is focused on maintaining a robust and flexible balance sheet to enable it to deliver all these goals  particularly to fund its capital investment requirements and shareholder returns.Kenmare will continue to manage its operating cost base in a conservative and sustainable manner  cognisant of inflationary pressures and other risks that face its business  in order to minimise unit costs.While market demand remains slightly muted  we expect strong financial performance in H2  with cash flows continuing to support all expected expenditures and shareholder returns.Interim dividendKenmare generated record first half profit after tax of $67.8 million in H1 2023 (H1 2022: $62.5 million). The Board has therefore approved an interim 2023 dividend of USc17.5 per share (H1 2022: USc10.98). The financial statements do not reflect this interim dividend.The Company will pay the interim dividend on 13 October 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 22 September 2023; shares purchased by the Company under the proposed Tender Offer announced today will thus not qualify for the interim dividend. Irish Dividend Withholding Tax (25%) must be deducted from dividends paid by the Company  unless a shareholder is entitled to an exemption and has submitted a properly completed exemption form to the Company’s Registrar.The dividend timetable is as follows:Announcement of interim dividend 15 August 2023 Ex-Dividend Date 21 September 2023 Record Date 22 September 2023 Currency election cut-off date 26 September 2023 at 12:00 noon (IST) Payment Date 13 October 2023Principal risks and uncertaintiesThere are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on Kenmare’s performance over the remaining six months of the 2023 financial year and which could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historic results.These principal risks and uncertainties are disclosed in Kenmare’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2022. A detailed explanation of these principal risks and uncertainties and how Kenmare seeks to mitigate these risks  can be found on pages 70 to 79 of the 2022 Annual Report under the following headings: grant  maintenance renewal and extension of agreements and licences  country risk  geotechnical risk  severe weather events  uncertainty over and/or changes in physical characteristics of the orebody  power supply and transmission risk  asset damage or loss  health  safety and environment  mineral resource statement risk  IT security risk  development project risk  industry cyclicality  customer concentration  foreign currency risk and cost inflation.The Group’s climate risks disclosure is set out on pages 60 to 65 of the 2022 Annual Report. These have not changed in the first half of the year and outline the Group’s objectives in relation to climate risk. We have continued with these objectives in H1 of 2023 and will provide an update in the 2023 Annual Report.Related party transactionsThere have been no material changes in the related party transactions affecting the financial position or the performance of the Group in the period since publication of the 2022 Annual Report other than those disclosed in Note 20 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.Going concernAs stated in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements  based on the Group’s forecasts and projections  the Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future  a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly  they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements.Events after the Statement of Financial Position DateShare buy backOn 14 August 2023  the Board approved a Tender Offer. Details of the offer are set out in a separate announcement which the Company is making today.Interim dividendAn interim dividend for the period ended 30 June 2023 of USc17.5 per share was approved by the Board on 14 August 2023. The dividend payable has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. The interim dividend is payable to all shareholders on the Register of Members on 22 September 2023.There have been no other significant events since 30 June 2023 that would have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group.Forward-looking statementsThis report contains certain forward-looking statements. These statements are made by the Directors in good faith based on the information available to them up to the time of their approval of this report  and such statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties  including both economic and business risk factors  underlying any such forward-looking information.On behalf of the Board Managing Director Financial DirectorMichael Carvill Tom Hickey14 August 2023 14 August 2023Independent Review Report to Kenmare Resources plc (“the Entity”)ConclusionWe have been engaged by the Entity to review the Entity’s condensed set of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2023 which comprises the condensed consolidated interim income statement  the condensed consolidated interim statement of other comprehensive income  the condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position  the condensed consolidated interim statement of cash flows  the condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in equity  a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.Based on our review  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2023 is not prepared  in all material respects in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”) as adopted by the EU and the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (“Transparency Directive”)  and the Central Bank (Investment Market Conduct) Rules 2019 (“Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland”).Basis for conclusionWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (Ireland) 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (“ISRE (Ireland) 2410”) issued for use in Ireland. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries  primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters  and applying analytical and other review procedures.A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly  we do not express an audit opinion.We read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report to identify material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of consolidated financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on  or materially inconsistent with  the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the review. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies  we consider the implications for our report.Conclusions relating to going concernBased on our review procedures  which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting  or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that have not been appropriately disclosed.This conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (Ireland) 2410. However  future events or conditions may cause the Entity to cease to continue as a going concern  and the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Entity will continue in operation.Directors’ responsibilitiesThe half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of  and has been approved by  the Directors. The Directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Transparency Directive and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland.The Directors are responsible for preparing the condensed set of consolidated financial statements included in the half-yearly financial report in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the EU.As disclosed in Note 1  the annual financial statements of the Entity for the year ended 31 December 2022 are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.In preparing the condensed set of consolidated financial statements  the Directors are responsible for assessing the Entity’s ability to continue as a going concern  disclosing  as applicable  matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Entity or to cease operations  or have no realistic alternative but to do so.Our responsibilityOur responsibility is to express to the Entity a conclusion on the condensed set of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review.Our conclusion  including our conclusions relating to going concern  are based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures  as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report.The purpose of our review work and to whom we owe our responsibilitiesThis report is made solely to the Entity in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the Entity in meeting the requirements of the Transparency Directive and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland. Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the Entity those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law  we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Entity for our review work  for this report  or for the conclusions we have reached.Keith Watt 14 August 2023KPMGChartered Accountants1 Stokes PlaceSt. Stephen’s GreenDublin 2Group condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive incomeFor the financial period ended 30 June 2023Notes Unaudited6 Months30 June 2023$’000 Restated*Unaudited6 Months30 June2022$’000 Revenue 2 242 879 197 294 Cost of sales 4 (157 200) (117 854) Gross profit 85 679 79 440 Administration Expenses 4 (5 440) (5 421) Operating profit 80 239 74 019 Finance income 3 589 324 Finance costs 5 (6 324) (5 706) Profit before tax 77 504 68 637 Income tax expense 6 (9 727) (6 098) Profit for the financial period and total comprehensive income for the financial period 67 777 62 539 Attributable to equity holders 67 777 62 539 $ per share $ pershare Profit per share: Basic 7 0.71 0.66 Profit per share: Diluted 7 0.70 0.65*Refer to Note 4 for further details on the 2022 restatement.The accompanying notes form part of these financial statements.Group condensed consolidated statement of financial positionAs at 30 June 2023Notes Unaudited30 June 2023$’000 Audited31 Dec 2022$’000 Assets Non-current assets Property  plant and equipment 8 921 749 930 759 Right-of-use assets 9 1 505 1 608 923 254 932 367 Current assets Inventories 10 73 350 84 171 Trade and other receivables 11 141 127 124 018 Cash and cash equivalents 12 108 819 108 271 323 296 316 460 Total assets 1 246 550 1 248 827 Equity Capital and reserves attributable to the Company’s equity holders Called-up share capital 13 104 104 Share premium 545 950 545 950 Other reserves 230 600 232 759 Retained earnings 348 934 324 721 Total equity 1 125 588 1 103 534 Liabilities Non-current liabilities Bank loans 14 30 885 46 180 Lease liabilities 9 1 389 1 540 Provisions 16 21 909 19 746 54 183 67 466 Current liabilities Bank loans 14 32 561 32 398 Lease liabilities 9 255 245 Trade and other payables 15 27 668 35 293 Current tax liabilities 17 5 483 8 893 Provisions 16 812 998 66 779 77 827 Total liabilities 120 962 145 293 Total equity and liabilities 1 246 550 1 248 827The accompanying notes form part of these financial statements.On behalf of the Board:M.

The Group Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months ended 30 June 2023 have been prepared in accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007  as amended  the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland  Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4.2 of the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’  as adopted by the European Union.The financial information presented in this document does not constitute statutory financial statements. The amounts presented in the half-yearly financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2023 and the corresponding amounts for the six months ended 30 June 2022 have been reviewed but not audited. The independent review report is on pages 11 and 12.The financial information for the year ended 31 December 2022  presented herein  is an abbreviated version of the annual financial statements for the Group in respect of the year ended 31 December 2022. The Group’s annual financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2022 have been filed in the Companies Registration Office and the independent auditor issued an unqualified audit report thereon. The annual report is available on the Company’s website at www.kenmareresources.com.Use of Judgements and EstimatesThe preparation of the half-yearly financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements  estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses together with disclosure of assets and liabilities. Estimates and underlying assumptions relevant to these financial statements are the same as those described in the last annual financial statements.Going ConcernThe Directors have  at the time of approving the financial statements  a reasonable expectation that the Group has or will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Based on the Group’s cash flow forecast  liquidity and solvency position the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources for the foreseeable future and  therefore  they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.The Group forecast has been prepared by management with best estimates of production  pricing and cost assumptions over the period. Key assumptions upon which the Group forecast is based include a mine plan covering production using the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. Production levels for the purpose of the forecast are approximately 1.2 million tonnes of ilmenite plus co-products  zircon  concentrates and rutile  over the next twelve months. Assumptions for product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers or  where contract prices are based on market prices or production is not presently contracted  prices are forecast taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise and management expectations. Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2023  taking into account the current and future running costs of the Mine and escalated by 2% per annum thereafter. Capital costs are based on the capital plans and include escalation at 2% per annum. Current operating costs and forecast capital costs take into account the current inflationary environment. The 2% inflation rate used to escalate these costs over the life of mine is an estimated long-term inflation rate.Sensitivity analysis is applied to the assumptions above to test the robustness of the cash flow forecasts for reductions in market prices  reductions in production  increases in operating costs and a combined case of the aforementioned factors. Changes in these assumptions affect the level of sales and profitability of the Group and the amount of capital required to deliver the projected production levels. As a result of this assessment  the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next 12 months.Changes in accounting policiesThe accounting policies applied in the half-yearly financial statements are those set out in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.The following new and revised standards  all of which are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023  have been adopted in the current financial period;• IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and Amendments to IFRS 17 effective 1 January 2023• Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 effective 1 January 2023• Definition of Accounting Estimate – Amendments to IAS 8 effective 1 January 2023• Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction – Amendments to IAS 12 effective 1 January 2023None of the new and revised standards have a material effect on the Group’s condensed consolidated financial statements.2.

The Group allocates revenue from external customers to individual countries and discloses revenues in each country where revenues represent 10% or more of the Group’s total revenue. Thereafter  where total disclosed revenue disaggregated by country constitutes less than 75% of total Group revenue  additional disclosures are made until at least 75% of the Group’s disaggregated revenue is disclosed. This treatment results in the amendment of comparatives.Unaudited30 June 2023$’000Unaudited30 June 2022$’000 Revenue from external customers China 109 166 59 830 Europe 47 035 56 801 Asia (excluding China) 24 169 29 384 Rest of the world 49 298 36 057 Total revenue from mineral products 229 668 182 072 Revenue derived from freight 13 211 15 222 Total revenue 242 879 197 294All revenues are generated by the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine.

Mineral stock movement in the period was a decrease of $9.6 million (H1 2022: $27.8 million increase). Distribution costs of $2.9 million (H1 2022: $2.9 million) represent the cost of running the Mine’s finished product storage  jetty and marine fleet. Freight costs of $13.2 million (H1 2022: $15.2 million) arise from sales to customers on a Cost  Insurance and Freight (CIF) or Cost and Freight (CFR) basis. There were no exceptional items within operating profit in H1 2023 (H1 2022 restated: $nil). The H1 2022 income statement has been restated in order to reclassify freight costs and distribution costs from other operating costs to cost of sales. In addition  foreign exchange gains and losses have been reclassified to cost of sales and administrative costs and are no longer presented separately on the face of the income statement. Management believes these presentational changes more appropriately reflect the nature of each category of expense.As previously reportedAdjustment As restated 30 June 2022 30 June 2022 $’000 $’000 $’000 Revenue 197 294 - 197 294 Cost of sales (95 236) (22 618) (117 854) Other operating costs/Administrative expenses (27 082) 21 661 (5 421) Net Finance costs (5 635) 253 (5 382) Foreign exchange (704) 704 - Taxation (6 098) - (6 098) Profit for the financial year and total comprehensive income for the financial year 62 539- 62 5395 Net finance costsUnaudited 30 June 2023$’000 RestatedUnaudited 30 June 2022$’000 Finance costs Interest on bank borrowings (4 229) (4 350) Interest on lease liabilities (46) (77) Factoring and other trade facility fees (807) (681) Commitment and other fees (294) (222) Unwinding of discount on mine closure provision (334) (376) Foreign exchange loss (614) - Total Finance Costs (6 324) (5 706) Finance income Interest earned on bank deposits 2 919 89 Foreign exchange gain 670 235 Total Finance Income 3 589 324 Net finance costs recognised in profit or loss (2 735) (5 382)All interest has been expensed in the financial period.

Income tax expenseUnaudited30 June 2023$’000 Unaudited30 June 2022$’000 Corporation tax 9 727 6 098During the period the KMML Mozambique Branch had taxable profits of $16.3 million (H1 2022: $16.1 million) resulting in an income tax expense of $5.6 million (H1 2022: $5.6 million) being recognised. The income tax rate applicable to taxable profits of KMML Mozambique Branch is 35% (H1 2022: 35%).KMML Mozambique Branch has elected  and the fiscal regime applicable to mining allows for  the option to deduct  as an allowable deduction  depreciation of exploration and development expense and capital expenditure over the life of mine. Tax losses may be carried forward for three years. There are no tax losses carried forward at 30 June 2023.During the period Kenmare Resources plc had taxable profits of $58.6 million (H1 2022: $3.8 million) resulting in an income tax expense of $4.9 million (H1 2022: $0.5 million) being recognised. Tax adjustments of $0.8 million were recognised in relation to prior year estimates and returns and have the effect of reducing the charge in the period. $60 million (H1 2022: $nil) of the taxable income relates to dividend income received from the subsidiary undertaking Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited with the balance relating to trading losses net of deposit income of $1.4 million (H1 2022: $3.8 million).7.

The Group considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and its book value  among other factors  when reviewing for indicators for impairment. As at 30 June 2023  the market capitalisation of the Group was below the book value of net assets  which is considered an indicator of impairment of assets.The Group carried out an impairment review of property  plant and equipment as at 30 June 2023. As a result of the review  and given the performance and outlook of the Group  no impairment provision was recognised in the current financial period. No impairment was recognised in the prior financial year. Given the historic volatility in product pricing and sensitivities of the forecast to the discount rate and to a lesser extent operating costs  the impairment loss of $64.8 million  which was recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in 2014  was not reversed.The cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing is the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine. The basis on which the Mine is assessed is its value in use. The cash flow forecast employed for the value-in-use computation is from a life of mine financial model. The recoverable amount obtained from the financial model represents the present value of the future discounted pre-tax  pre-finance cash flows discounted at 13.0% (31 December 2022: 14.0%).Key assumptions in the value in use calculation include the following:The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. This rate is a best estimate of the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Mine  taking into consideration country risk  currency risk and price risk. The factors comprising the cost of equity and cost of debt have changed from the year-end review  in particular the equity risk premium which has decreased  resulting in a discount rate of 13.0% (31 December 2022: 14.0%). The Group’s estimation of the country risk premium included in the discount rate has remained unchanged from the prior year. The Group does not consider it appropriate to apply the full current country risk premium for Mozambique to the calculation of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital as it believes the specific circumstances which have resulted in the risk premium increase over the past number of years are not relevant to Kenmare’s operations. Hence  country risk premium applicable to the calculation of the cost of equity has been adjusted accordingly. Using a discount rate of 13.0%  the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying amount by $346.0 million (31 December 2022: $86.9 million). The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the recoverable amount. A 4.0% increase in the discount rate to 17.0% reduces the recoverable amount by $346.0 million to $nil  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged. The increase in the recoverable amount from the year-end review is a result of increased cash flows over the life of mine as a result of updated forecast sales prices and a decrease in the discount rate from 14.0% to 13.0%.The mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi proved and probable reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine life assumption of 40 years has not changed from the year-end review. Average annual production is approximately 1.2 million tonnes (31 December 2022: 1.2 million tonnes) of ilmenite and co-products zircon  rutile and concentrates over the life of the Mine and remains unchanged from the year-end review. The mine plan does not include investment in additional mining capacity. Certain minimum stocks of final and intermediate products are assumed to be maintained at period ends.Product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers  or where contracts are based on market prices or production is not currently contracted  prices are forecasted by the Group taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise provided by TiPMC Solutions and management expectations including general inflation of 2% per annum. Forecast prices provided by TiPMC Solutions have been reviewed and found to be consistent with other external sources of information. Average forecast product sales prices have increased over the life of mine from the year-end review as a result of revised forecast pricing. A 9% reduction in average sales prices over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $346.0 million  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2023 taking into account the current running costs of the Mine and estimated inflation for 2023. From 2024 onwards  operating costs are escalated by 2% per annum as management expects inflation to normalise and average 2% over the life of mine period. Average forecast operating costs have decreased slightly from the year-end review. Increased costs associated with estimated future power consumption and price for the mining in Nataka have been included in the forecast cashflows in the period. A 17.5% increase in operating costs over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $346.0 million  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.Whilst the Group has set ambitions to be net zero by 2040  the financial impact is still being assessed as the Group considers how it will work towards meeting this target. As such  estimates and judgements within these financial statements do not consider the expenditure (or any related savings) associated with the Company’s ambition to become net zero nor the financial impact of the climate risks disclosed within the Group’s TCFD reporting as a reliable estimate cannot currently be made.Capital costs are based on a life of mine capital plan including inflation at 2% per annum from 2024. Average forecast capital costs have increased  and their scheduling changed from the year-end review based on updated capital plans required to maintain the existing plants over the life of mine. A 39% increase in capital costs over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $346.0 million  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.9.

The lease for the electricity generators was renewed in November 2017 for a five-year period and rental payments were fixed for the five years. The lease agreement expired in November 2022 and following negotiations the Group completed the acquisition process of the electricity generators in February 2023.On 1 January 2019  the Group recognised a lease liability of $1.7 million in respect of the rental of its Irish head office. The lease has a term of 10 years commencing August 2017 and rental payments are fixed for the remainder of this term. This lease obligation is denominated in Euros.In December 2022  the lease in respect of the Group’s Mozambican country office in Maputo was amended. The lease term was extended to 10 years commencing 1 December 2022. This lease obligation is denominated in US Dollars.The weighted average rate applied to the leases is 8.4%.At each reporting date  the Company assesses whether there is any indication that right-of-use assets may be impaired.

The finance documentation also provides for a Mine Closure Guarantee Facility (provided by either the existing lenders or other finance providers) of up to $40 million  with the provider(s) of such a facility sharing in the common security package. The potential total aggregate principal amount of indebtedness secured under the finance documentation is therefore $190 million.The Term Loan Facility has a final maturity date of 11 March 2025. Interest is at SOFR plus 5.40% per annum. Repayment is in seven equal semi-annual instalments and the first repayment was made on 11 March 2022.The Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of 11 December 2023  which is extendable by a further 12 months at the lenders’ discretion. Interest is at SOFR plus 4.25% per annum.The Group entered into a mine closure guarantee facility with Absa Bank Moçambique SA effective from 1 July 2023 for an amount of $26.6 million. This guarantee shares the security package with the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility on a pro rata and pari passu basis.The security package consists of (a) security over the Group’s bank accounts (subject to certain exceptions)  (b) pledges of the shares of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited and Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (the “Project Companies”)  (c) security over intercompany loans and (d) Mozambican law security interests over certain rights and agreements with Mozambican authorities  including over the Implementation Agreement  the Mineral Licensing Contract and the Mining Licence.The carrying amount of the secured bank accounts of the Group was $102.0 million as at 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022: $102.9 million). The shares of the Project Companies and intercompany loans are not included in the consolidated statement of financial position as they are eliminated on consolidation. They therefore do not have a carrying amount but  upon enforcement of the pledges on behalf of the lender group  the shares in the Project Companies would cease to be owned or controlled by the Group. The secured rights and agreements do not have a carrying amount. They are  however  necessary for the Project Companies to operate the Mine in Mozambique.During the period $15.7 million of the Term Loan Facility was repaid. At the period-end  reported debt amounted to $63.4 million (31 December 2022: $78.6 million). This consists of the Term Loan Facility of $62.9 million (31 December 2022: $78.9 million) and accrued loan interest of $2.1 million (31 December 2022: $1.9 million)  net of transaction costs of $1.5 million (31 December 2022: $2.2 million).Reconciliation of movements of debt to cashflows arising from financing activities Unaudited30 June 2023$’000 Audited31 Dec 2022$’000 Bank Loans Balance at 1 January 78 578 148 099 Cash movements Loan interest paid (3 646) (6 921) Principal repaid (15 715) (91 429) Loan drawn down - 20 000 Non-cash movements Loan interest accrued 4 229 8 829 Balance at 30 June/31 December 63 446 78 578Financial CovenantsAs at30 June 2023 As at31 December 2022 CovenantInterest Coverage Ratio 56.17:1 34.96:1 Not less than 4.00:1 Net Debt to EBITDA (0.15):1 (0.09):1 Not greater than 2.00:1 Debt Service Coverage Ratio 6.71:1 3.11:1 Not less than 1.20:1 Liquidity (million) $148.8 $148.3 Not less than $15.0 Reserve Tail Ratio 81% 81% Not less than 30%All financial covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement have been complied with during the period.

A corresponding amount equal to the provision is recognised as part of property  plant and equipment.The costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan  are subject to regular review and are estimated based on the net present value of estimated future costs. Mine closure costs are a normal consequence of mining  and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the life of the Mine. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost and $0.3 million (H1 2022: $0.4 million) has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the financial period.The main assumptions used in the calculation of the estimated future costs include:• a discount rate of 3.85% (31 December 2022: 4.0%);• an inflation rate of 2% (31 December 2022: 2%);• an estimated life of mine of 40 years (31 December 2022: 40 years). It is assumed that all licences and permits required to operate will be renewed or extended during the life of mine; and• an estimated closure cost of $34.1 million (31 December 2022: $34.1 million) and an estimated post-closure monitoring provision of $3.9 million (31 December 2022: $3.9 million).The life of mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine closure provision has been increased by $0.8 million from 31 December 2022 to reflect a change in the discount rate from 4.0% at 31 December 2022 to 3.85% at 30 June 2023.The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the Mine closure provision. The Group uses a Thirty-year US Treasury yield as this is the longest period for which yields are quoted. This discount rate is deemed to provide the best estimate of the current market assessment of risk-free time value of money. Risks specific to the liability are included in the cost estimate.The Mine rehabilitation provision represents the Directors’ best estimate of the Company’s liability for rehabilitating areas disturbed by mining activities. Rehabilitation costs are recognised based on the area disturbed and estimated cost of rehabilitation per hectare which is reviewed regularly against actual rehabilitation cost per hectare. Actual rehabilitation expenditure is incurred approximately twelve months after the area has been disturbed. During the financial period there was a release of $0.5 million (H1 2022: $0.3 million) to reflect the actual mine rehabilitation costs incurred  and an addition to the provision of $1.3 million (H1 2022: $1.0 million) for areas newly disturbed.17.

The table does not include fair value information for other receivables  prepayments  trade payables and accruals as these are not measured at fair value as the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Trade receivables which are factored through the Absa Bank facility or letters of credit which are always confirmed and discounted through the Barclays Bank facility are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Trade receivables or letters of credit where it is not known at initial recognition if they will be factored are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Group derecognises the original receivable to which the arrangement applies when payment is received from the bank as the terms of the arrangement are non-recourse. The payment to the bank by the Group’s customers are considered non-cash transactions. Trade receivables not measured at fair value are receivables whose payment is received under the sale contract credit terms.The valuation technique used in measuring Level 2 fair values is discounted cash flows  which considers the expected receipts or payments discounted using adjusted market discount rates or where these rates are not available estimated discount rates.Credit riskThe Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual circumstances of each customer. The Group also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base  including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate.Before entering into sales contracts with new customers  the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits attributed to customers are reviewed regularly during the year.The Group’s customers have been transacting with the Group for a significant number of years  and no customer’s balances have been written off or are credit impaired at the financial period end. In monitoring customer credit risk  customers are reviewed individually  and the Group has not identified any factors that would merit reducing exposure to any particular customer. The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade receivables.For trade receivables measured at fair value through OCI and trade receivables measured at amortised cost  the Group allocates to each customer a credit risk grade based on data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss (including but not limited to external ratings  financial statements and available market information about customers) and applying experienced credit judgement.The movement in expected credit losses in respect of trade receivables were measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income during the period was as follows:Unaudited30 June 2023$’000 Audited31 Dec 2022$’000 Opening balance 1 534 424 Net remeasurement of loss allowance (601) 1 110 Closing 933 1 534The increase in the loss allowance is mainly attributable to increases in industry specific externally published forward looking default rates which are used as the basis of estimating the Group’s expected credit losses. The methodology for the calculation of expected credit losses is the same as described in the last annual statements.Interest rate benchmark reformA fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally  including the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as “IBOR reform”)  including LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate).Pursuant to an Amendment and Restatement Agreement entered into on 9 March 2023 in respect of the Group’s debt facilities  the basis on which interest is calculated in respect of those facilities were amended with effect from 11 March 2023. As a result of the amendment  interest rates for interest periods commencing from 11 March 2023 onwards are no longer determined by reference to US LIBOR; instead they are determined on the basis of the applicable Term SOFR Rate. While US LIBOR represented an inter-bank lending rate  Term SOFR is a published screen rate derived from SOFR  being the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. As SOFR represents a risk-free rate  a credit adjustment spread is applied in addition  which spread varies according to the length of the relevant interest period.The six-month SOFR rate set on 11 March 2023 relating to the next interest period to 11 September 2023 was 5.4%. The credit adjustment spread of 0.4% plus the margin of 5.4% results in an interest rate of 11.2% on the Term Loan. The Group has concluded that the new basis for determining cashflows is economically equivalent to the previous basis.19. Share-based paymentsKenmare Restricted Share Plan (KRSP)During the financial period  864 481 (H1 2022: 653 174) shares were granted to employees under the 2023 KRSP award. The estimated fair value of the shares awarded is $5.0 million (H1 2022: $3.7 million). These share awards vest  subject to continued employment on the third anniversary or  in the case of Executive Directors and certain other staff  subject to continued employment and to the Remuneration Committee’s assessment against a discretionary underpin  on the third anniversary of grant.During the financial period  the Group recognised a share-based payment expense of $1.4 million (H1 2022: $3.2 million).During the period  awards in respect of 1 073 896 shares were exercised at a cost of $5.8 million.20. Related party transactionsTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries  which are related parties  have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.Apart from existing remuneration arrangements there were no material transactions or balances between the Group and its key management personnel or members of their close families during the period under review.21.

Tune in to watch Cointelegraph’s resident expert Marcel Pechman discuss the spot Bitcoin ETF that was just launched in Europe and explore why the U.,In the latest episode of Cointelegraph’s The Market Report  analyst Marcel Pechman discusses the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved in the European Union  which went live on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange on Aug. 15. Despite the seemingly unconventional choice of the Guernsey regulator for its constitution  the fund’s listing on Euronext suggests a strategic maneuver  though its meager 1 million euro launch and unfamiliar management casts a shadow over its appeal.Moving on  Pechman shifts focus to the United States Bitcoin ETF landscape  where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again delayed its decision on approving a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF  setting a potential deadline for early 2024. This recurrent cycle of postponements echoes the challenges faced over the past decade.The lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. cryptocurrency market underscores the SEC’s reluctance to endorse a spot crypto ETF.Pechman also discusses Bitcoin’s price trajectory. According to Bitcoin investor Jesse Myers  breaking the $100 000 barrier is intricately tied to the block subsidy halving in mid-2024. Myers challenges the efficient market hypothesis  positing that the market will take 12 to 18 months post-halving to fully assimilate the implications.Pechman conveys skepticism about predicting market outcomes  acknowledging many factors that can sway Bitcoin’s trajectory  including Federal Reserve decisions  banking liquidity  economic conditions and unforeseen events.Pechman concludes by circling back to the primary drivers of Bitcoin’s value: the abundance of fiat currency and government debt. He foresees Bitcoin surpassing $100 000  but the real-world purchasing power of that sum might be diminished due to inflation.Listen to the full episode of The Market Report on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel  and don’t forget to click “Like” and “Subscribe” to keep up-to-date with all our latest content.,neutral,0.04,0.94,0.02,negative,0.02,0.3,0.68,True,English,"['Spot Bitcoin ETF', 'US', 'United States Bitcoin ETF landscape', 'first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund', 'meager 1 million euro launch', 'U.S. cryptocurrency market', 'spot crypto ETF', 'block subsidy halving', 'Federal Reserve decisions', 'real-world purchasing power', 'Research YouTube channel', 'The Market Report', 'efficient market hypothesis', 'new Cointelegraph Markets', 'Euronext Amsterdam exchange', 'analyst Marcel Pechman', 'BTC) ETF', 'market outcomes', 'Exchange Commission', 'Bitcoin investor', 'latest episode', 'European Union', 'unconventional choice', 'Guernsey regulator', 'strategic maneuver', 'unfamiliar management', 'potential deadline', 'recurrent cycle', 'past decade', 'regulatory clarity', '12 to 18 months', 'many factors', 'banking liquidity', 'economic conditions', 'unforeseen events', 'primary drivers', 'fiat currency', 'government debt', 'full episode', 'latest content', 'price trajectory', 'Jesse Myers', 'Aug.', 'constitution', 'listing', 'shadow', 'appeal', 'focus', 'Securities', 'early 2024', 'postponements', 'challenges', 'lack', 'reluctance', '$100,000 barrier', 'mid-2024', 'implications', 'skepticism', 'value', 'abundance', 'sum', 'inflation']",2023-08-16,2023-08-16,cointelegraph.com

Sellers can face the challenge of safeguarding against fraudulent activities in unfamiliar payment methods. (Photo: Business Wire)In addition  the speed with which fraud is mutating to evade detection is alarming many companies engaged in global ecommerce. Now with the ability to employ artificial intelligence (AI) tools in fraud  the fraudsters themselves will be able to scale and continue to evolve their methods.At the same time  the rise of ecommerce is providing small and midmarket businesses with the opportunity to expand to new markets. Selling products and services in international markets requires accepting payment methods common in those markets.While paying with VISA  PayPal  or MasterCard is common in the Americas  there are many other payment methods that customers use in international markets.

The purpose of these meetings will be to gather recommendations from the EMA and the FDA to fine-tune COVA's development plan prior to marketing approval.These discussions will enable Biophytis to present the available data (preclinical  clinical  product and industrialization) and specify the additional information to be provided in the context of marketing authorization applications  in particularly the design of a confirmatory phase 3 clinical study.Biophytis will also present the agencies with the possibility of extending the scope of its indication to viral respiratory pathologies other than Covid-19  notably influenza  based on its non-specific mechanism of action. This extension would significantly increase the number of patients eligible for treatment and optimize the commercial potential of Sarconeos (BIO101).About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of drug candidates for age-related diseases. Sarconeos (BIO101)  our lead drug candidate  is a small molecule in development for age-related neuromuscular (sarcopenia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy) and cardiorespiratory (Covid-19) diseases. Promising clinical results were obtained in the treatment of sarcopenia in an international phase 2 study  enabling the launch of a phase 3 study in this indication (SARA project). The safety and efficacy of Sarconeos (BIO101) in the treatment of severe COVID-19 were studied in a positive international phase 2-3 clinical trial (COVA project)  enabling the preparation of conditional marketing authorization (CMA) applications in Europe and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) applications in the United States. A pediatric formulation of Sarconeos (BIO101) is currently being developed for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD  MYODA project). The company is based in Paris  France  and Cambridge  Massachusetts. The Company's ordinary shares are listed on Euronext Growth (Ticker: ALBPS -ISIN: FR0012816825) and the ADSs (American Depositary Shares) are listed on Nasdaq Capital Market (Ticker BPTS - ISIN: US09076G1040).Story continuesFor more information  visit www.biophytis.comDisclaimerThis press release contains forward-looking statements.
