But he said it did not make sense for Adyen to engage in a price war with them.""If there is any place that you could say is most prone to price competition it would be the U.S. because you can switch more easily "" he said.He said Adyen had not lost any of its large platform customers and the competition was an ""isolated phenomenon"" for one kind of customer: merchants that process both online and in-store payments.Adyen's rivals in the US include Stripe  Braintree  Fiserv and PayPal.The company's shares fell sharply after a delayed start on Euronext due to volatility and were down 35% at 951 euros at 1233 GMT. At current prices  the shares are down more than 20% in the year to date  surrendering gains up to Wednesday's close.""These are disappointing results  particularly the sales miss  and the key question will be whether the company can quickly revert to mid-term trend growth "" JPMorgan analysts said.Earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were 320 million euros ($348 million)  down 10% from a year earlier and below analyst forecasts of 386 million euros  Refinitiv data showed.Story continuesRevenue rose 21% to 739 million euros  against Adyen's mid-term forecasts of more than 25% growth.""In some areas the business grew at a lower rate than anticipated "" the company said.Jefferies analyst Hannes Leitner said some concerns are focused on Adyen  which is still more profitable and more highly valued than peers  and some on the sector and economy.He said the economy overall is slowing and online payments growth may not be quite as fast as it was in the pre-COVID era. ""This is impacting Adyen a little more than others.""Adyen's EBITDA margin fell to 43% from 59%  which the company said was mostly because of higher wage costs as it takes on more staff. The company hired 550 full time employees as part of an accelerated hiring push  a 17% increase.A similar margin decline led to a sell-off in Adyen shares when the company reported full-year earnings in February.Adyen CFO Ethan Tandowsky told analysts hiring would remain at similar levels in the second half of 2023 before slowing.He said the company is maintaining its medium-term targets for revenue growth above 25% and an improving EBITDA margin that it expects to reach 65% in the long term. But he said it would take time for margins to expand toward that target after the current hiring push had slowed.($1 = 0.9177 euros)(Reporting by Toby Sterling  additional reporting by Sinead Cruise.Editing by David Goodman  Barbara Lewis and Jane Merriman)",neutral,0.02,0.74,0.24,negative,0.02,0.22,0.76,True,English,"['Payments company Adyen', 'shares', 'earnings', 'CEO Pieter van der Does', 'Jefferies analyst Hannes Leitner', 'Adyen CFO Ethan Tandowsky', 'large platform customers', 'Dutch payments processor', 'higher wage costs', 'similar margin decline', '550 full time employees', 'online payments growth', 'digital payments sector', 'mid-term trend growth', 'improving EBITDA margin', 'The Adyen logo', 'current hiring push', 'analyst forecasts', 'store payments', 'hiring costs', 'mid-term forecasts', 'similar levels', 'sales growth', 'Toby Sterling', 'Elizabeth Howcroft', 'market value', 'general slowdown', 'North America', 'U.S.', 'largest market', 'European base', 'price war', 'isolated phenomenon', 'one kind', 'current prices', 'disappointing results', 'sales miss', 'key question', 'Refinitiv data', 'lower rate', 'pre-COVID era', 'second half', 'medium-term targets', 'long term', 'Sinead Cruise', 'David Goodman', 'Barbara Lewis', 'Jane Merriman', 'revenue growth', 'first-half earnings', 'full-year earnings', '13 billion euros', '386 million euros', '739 million euros', 'Adyen NV', 'price competition', 'additional reporting', 'high-growth business', 'JPMorgan analysts', 'Adyen shares', '25% growth', '951 euros', '0.9177 euros', 'PHOTO', 'company', 'headquarters', 'Amsterdam', 'Reuters', 'Thursday', 'estimates', 'margins', 'performance', 'concerns', 'worries', 'services', 'likes', 'Netflix', 'Meta', 'Microsoft', 'Spotify', 'competitors', 'sense', 'place', 'merchants', 'rivals', 'Stripe', 'Braintree', 'Fiserv', 'PayPal', 'start', 'Euronext', 'volatility', '1233 GMT', 'date', 'gains', 'Wednesday', 'interest', 'tax', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'Story', 'areas', 'peers', 'economy', 'others', 'staff', 'part', '17% increase', 'sell-off', 'February']",2023-08-17,2023-08-18,finance.yahoo.com

This upgrade assumes a normal final production cycle of the year  without any impact of shortage in components nor any important changes linked to the pricing of components.The long-term order book - beyond 2023 - is growing to EUR 61.7 million  an increase of EUR 5.8 million compared to the beginning of the year 2023.The gross margin percentage is expected to be marginally negatively impacted in 2H23 compared to the results of 1H23  as a consequence of the projected cost of BOM.As a consequence of the upgrade in revenue guidance and the strong profit performance  the full year EBIT guidance is being upgraded from an initial range of EUR 27.5-32.5 million to a new range of EUR 32.5-38.5 million  clearly demonstrating our sustainable and profitable growth ambition.Key figuresEUR millions  except earnings per share expressed in EUR Reviewed 1H23 1H22 Variance Revenue 87.4 67.7 19.7 Gross profit 61.2 45.8 15.4 Gross margin % 70.1% 67.7% +2.4 Pts Operating profit – EBIT 25.0 15.7 9.3 Operating margin – EBIT % 28.6% 23.3% +5.3 Pts Net profit (Group share) 21.2 15.5 5.7 Fully diluted earnings per share (Group share) 1.52 1.15 0.37CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO  comments:“I continue to be very grateful to our customers  our team members and our channel partners for further supporting and enabling our growth mode  especially during this uneven year 2023. With fewer major sport events scheduled during uneven years  EVS typically suffered from a slowdown in revenue and profitability compared to even years. With H1 revenue of EUR 87.4 million at its highest level ever and with a Net Profit of EUR 21.2 million  I am proud to say that our PlayForward strategy is producing the expected sustainable and profitable growth. Based on this strong H1 revenue result  it is safe to say that our revenues for the whole year will achieve a new record level. While we are still facing challenges in our electronic component supply chain  we are now sufficiently confident to increase our earlier revenue guidance for 2023 of EUR 150 million to EUR 160 million to a new guidance of EUR 160 million to EUR 170 million.Our 2 main Market Pillars (Live Service Providers and Live Audience Business) show strong revenue growth compared to H1 2022. As expected in an uneven year  our third Market Pillar (Big Event Rental) generated close to no revenues in H1. The growth of our 2 main Market Pillars largely outperforms the absence of Big Event Rental revenues in H1. Geographically we see a strong growth performance of all regions (EMEA  NALA and APAC).This revenue growth in 2023 is only possible thanks to the hirings done in 2022. In order to increase efficiency and keep our operational costs under control  we had no further additions to our team member base in 2023. We do expect though to increase our hiring efforts in H2 2023 in order to sustain and enable our profitable growth into 2024.The high and global inflation has clearly a negative impact on our BOM (bill of material) cost and on our remuneration costs. We have started compensating the impact of those increased costs by applying price adaptations in 2022. Those price adaptations are contributing to an improved profitability in H1 2023. We expect that we will need to continue adapting our pricing to compensate for the raising inflation.Despite the persistently challenging economic market conditions marked by high inflation  component shortages  and the ongoing war in Ukraine  I maintain a sense of cautious optimism about our future. The growing recognition among our customers for the reliability  performance  and innovative nature of our solutions and services provides us with a solid foundation for what lies ahead.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:“The results of the 1st half of 2023 demonstrate our growth trajectory. We will realize growth in 2023  even in a year with no Big Event Rental revenue. This is a turning point for EVS. Next to a strong topline performance  we also see the positive effects of our pricing strategy: our gross profit is demonstrating that we can balance price increases  taking into account macro-economic challenges. Whilst keeping our costs under control  this performance results in a net profit margin of 24.2%  demonstrating our ability to realize sustainable and profitable growth. Finally  our balance sheet remains strong with a solid cash position and open receivables that restored well compared to end of December 2022  clearly demonstrated by an improvement in our days of sales outstanding. All these promising results lead to an upgrade of our guidance both in revenue and EBIT  and this clearly underpins the sustainable and profitable growth ambition that we have set for ourselves.”EVS Market Dynamics and customer winsIn the LiveCeption domain  EVS now proposes a MultiReview experience driven by the LSM-VIA  very well appreciated for the fast conception of multi-angle highlights. EVS did also optimize the XNET-VIA internal network protocol to further reduce the delay between replays when content is hosted on different servers. Inline with “Balanced computing” concept  XtraMotion now supports different deployment models (in the cloud and in an OBVAN) to cope with the respective constraints of the production (budget and “delay to live"").The upgrade of the XT3 continues at the right pace thanks to the compelling upgrade offers and the continuously broader feature set now covered by XT-VIA and XT-GO  as described above. Not all XT3s will be migrated to XT-VIA since one single large capacity XT-VIA can replace 2 early version XT3s. Moreover  not all customers will proceed with an upgrade of their large capacity XT3 to XT-VIA before the pre-announced end of life. It all depends on their investment lifecycles driven by their customer contracts  including number of events and the size of the contracted productions.About MediaCeption solutions  EVS continues the deployment of IPD-VIA create  the new editing tool focused on speed and creativity to create valuable content during live productions. Besides XT-VIA and XS-VIA  EVS also deploys more and more software versions of the server with XS-NEO as part of the LAB modernization projects.As every year  EVS supported its customers (facility companies and broadcasters) delivering the NFL Superbowl: one of the most watched events on earth. EVS also supports more and more events with MediaHub  allowing “Rights owners” to share valuable sports content with “Rights holders” disseminated on the planet. The same platform that is running the major events is now offered in SAAS and used every month on events with multi-country audiences.Neuron product family is welcoming a new software “Neuron View” as a multiviewer that can be virtualized on Neuron platform  thus strengthening the competitiveness of the overall Media Infrastructure solution. Cerebrum Software Defined Network control has also been improved in terms of user experience to support the transition of our customers towards centralized IP backbones across different control rooms and studios.For the 2023 first semester  both LAB and LSP market pillars beat a record in terms of revenues. For LAB  the shape of the revenue trend is also depending on the speed of the transformation project and the related revenue recognition. If LSP market pillar is higher in revenue  LAB is significantly higher in the order intake  beating another record.Yet as another record  the order intake for Media Infrastructure during this semester is higher than the Media Infrastructure revenues for the full 2020 year  demonstrating the attractivity of our solutions in this new domain for EVS.The traction for EVS solutions has been impressive at NAB. Our customers and channel partners are better understanding the value of our portfolio of solutions. The channel partner event was a great success with more and more partners preferring to attend EVS event than the ones organised by other larger vendors at the same time. Another event - co-organised with an IP vendor – was also overbooked  demonstrating the attractivity of the IP migration approach proposed by EVS. And  cherry on the cake  EVS did receive the “Best of Show award” for XTRAMOTION 2.0 Edge  proving the values of “Balanced Computing” concept with smooth and smart adoption of cloud technology. EVS now prepares the IBC mid-September.Supply chain of electronic components remains a point of attention for the company  considering the evolutions of the economy and the current geo-political tensions.As announced in our 2022 annual report  the Group has decided early March 2023 to call the end-of-life of certain activities linked to our operations in Darmstadt. This within the context of our strategy to focus on sustainable and profitable growth. Several months after the announcement  we can confirm that impacts on the financial statements have been limited and immaterial  thanks to the pro-active conversations with our customers.The company continues to progress as well in terms of ESG and received a ""low risk"" Environmental  Social  and Governance (ESG) rating from Morningstar Sustainalytics. With a risk score of 13.5  EVS is ranked in the 7th percentile in Sustainalytics’ global universe of more than 15 000 rated companies  indicating a significant improvement from the previous year  with a decrease of 9.2 points.First half revenueRevenue reached EUR 87.4 million in 1H23  representing an increase of EUR 19.7 million or 29.2% compared to 1H22.The impact of exchange rate conversions was minimal  resulting in a growth of revenue at constant currency of 28.7% YoY. Finally  taking out the seasonal impact of the Big Event Rental  the growth of 1H23 was of 40.3%.Revenue – EUR millions 1H23 1H22 Variance Total reported 87.4 67.7 29.2% Total at constant currency 87.1 67.7 28.7% Total at constant currency and excluding Big Event Rentals 87.0 62.0 40.3%Currency fluctuations primarily impact EVS revenues by the EUR/USD conversion  which can have a significant impact on our results even if EUR/USD fluctuations also impact the cost of our US operations and partially our cost of goods sold.In the first half of the year  excluding Big Event Rentals  LSP represented 56% of the revenue (59% in 1H22) and LAB 44% (41% in 1H22). The trend demonstrated by this performance is reflecting the long-term growth patterns laid out in our PLAYForward strategic plan.Geographically  revenues are distributed as follows in 1H23 (excl. Big Event Rentals):Europe  Middle East and Africa (EMEA): EUR 41.8 million (EUR 28.7 million in 1H22)  growing 45.8% and demonstrating a strong recovery compared to 1H22 in that region.EUR 41.8 million (EUR 28.7 million in 1H22)  growing 45.8% and demonstrating a strong recovery compared to 1H22 in that region.

Asia & Pacific (APAC): EUR 17.0 million (EUR 7.7 million in 1H22)  growing 120.9%  despite a slow recovery in China  demonstrating strong growth in several countries.First half earningsConsolidated gross margin was 70.1% for 1H23  compared to 67.7% in 1H22. The Bill Of Material cost is increasing compared to 1H22 (+0.7Pts)  though is at a very sound level of 15.7% thanks to the success of our pricing strategy and our ability to model macro-economic events. Every solution is improving marginally the profitability  demonstrating the balanced approach. The investments over the past quarters in the operations & support teams is being diluted  given the strong revenue performance.Operating expenses increased by 21% YoY as a consequence of investments in resources (+54 FTE on average) made in the past 12 months as well as some transformation projects we are running as a company. All these investments are done to support our long term ambition. Next to an impact linked to team members  the operating expenses are growing mainly following increased energy prices and increased travel spend.In terms of intangible assets  EVS continues to invest in 2 specific projects that should fuel our future growth. The investments (a total of EUR 3.0 million in 1H23) are in line with the budgeted spend and are assumed to start contributing to our topline as of 2024.The 1H23 EBIT margin was strong at 28.5%  compared to 23.3% in 1H22: a demonstration that the past investments are supporting our growth trajectory and are positioning us for the future.Income taxes are at EUR 3.7 million  compared to EUR 1.9 million last year: this increase is linked to the higher profit before taxes in 1H23 (EUR +7.6 million compared to 1H22) and to the limitation on the deduction of tax latencies from previous years in Belgium (the threshold has been reduced from 70% to 40% of the taxable profit exceeding the amount of EUR 1 million since January 2023).The group net profit amounted to EUR 21.2 million in 1H23  compared to EUR 15.5 million in 1H22. Fully diluted earnings per share amounted to EUR 1.52 in 1H23  compared to EUR 1.15 in 1H22.Second half outlookBased on the secured revenue on June 30  2023 at EUR 158.7 million (+35.8% growth compared to EUR 116.9 million of last year at the same date)  and based on the strong profit performance  we are confident to achieve our ambitions of profitable growth for the year 2023.The results of the first semester lead to an upgrade of our revenue guidance to a range of EUR 160-170 million (versus EUR 150-160 million previously). Based on the current production calendar and the preparation of the big events in 2024  we will have limited orders that will still contribute to our topline in 2023. Our full year EBIT range is also upgraded  to a range of EUR 32.5-38.5 million (from an initial range EUR 27.5-32.5 million)  benefiting from the strong revenue performance and the positive margin evolution.Next to our progress on 2023  we also continue to build the future. In addition to secured revenue for 2023  EVS has secured a long-term order book worth EUR 61.7 million (EUR +5.8 million compared to the situation at the beginning of the year).On top of this order book  we have also secured in June 2023  an important contract for the delivery of integrated solutions and related services linked to major multisport events occurring 2024 and beyond. The associated order intake linked to this contract will get recognized progressively  as soon as the technical requirements for the events are known.GlossaryTerm Definition Secured revenue Revenue already recognized as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in the fiscal year.

This upgrade assumes a normal final production cycle of the year  without any impact of shortage in components nor any important changes linked to the pricing of components.The long-term order book - beyond 2023 - is growing to EUR 61.7 million  an increase of EUR 5.8 million compared to the beginning of the year 2023.The gross margin percentage is expected to be marginally negatively impacted in 2H23 compared to the results of 1H23  as a consequence of the projected cost of BOM.As a consequence of the upgrade in revenue guidance and the strong profit performance  the full year EBIT guidance is being upgraded from an initial range of EUR 27.5-32.5 million to a new range of EUR 32.5-38.5 million  clearly demonstrating our sustainable and profitable growth ambition.Key figuresEUR millions  except earnings per share expressed in EUR Reviewed 1H23 1H22 Variance Revenue 87.4 67.7 19.7 Gross profit 61.2 45.8 15.4 Gross margin % 70.1% 67.7% +2.4 Pts Operating profit – EBIT 25.0 15.7 9.3 Operating margin – EBIT % 28.6% 23.3% +5.3 Pts Net profit (Group share) 21.2 15.5 5.7 Fully diluted earnings per share (Group share) 1.52 1.15 0.37CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO  comments:“I continue to be very grateful to our customers  our team members and our channel partners for further supporting and enabling our growth mode  especially during this uneven year 2023. With fewer major sport events scheduled during uneven years  EVS typically suffered from a slowdown in revenue and profitability compared to even years. With H1 revenue of EUR 87.4 million at its highest level ever and with a Net Profit of EUR 21.2 million  I am proud to say that our PlayForward strategy is producing the expected sustainable and profitable growth. Based on this strong H1 revenue result  it is safe to say that our revenues for the whole year will achieve a new record level. While we are still facing challenges in our electronic component supply chain  we are now sufficiently confident to increase our earlier revenue guidance for 2023 of EUR 150 million to EUR 160 million to a new guidance of EUR 160 million to EUR 170million.Our 2 main Market Pillars (Live Service Providers and Live Audience Business) show strong revenue growth compared to H1 2022. As expected in an uneven year  our third Market Pillar (Big Event Rental) generated close to no revenues in H1. The growth of our 2 main Market Pillars largely outperforms the absence of Big Event Rental revenues in H1. Geographically we see a strong growth performance of all regions (EMEA  NALA and APAC).This revenue growth in 2023 is only possible thanks to the hirings done in 2022. In order to increase efficiency and keep our operational costs under control  we had no further additions to our team member base in 2023. Wedoexpectthough toincrease our hiring efforts in H2 2023 in order to sustain and enable our profitable growth into 2024.The high and global inflation has clearly a negative impact on our BOM (bill of material) cost and on our remuneration costs. We have started compensating the impact of those increased costs by applying price adaptations in 2022. Those price adaptations are contributing to an improved profitability in H1 2023. We expect that we will need to continue adapting our pricing to compensate for the raising inflation.Despite the persistently challenging economic market conditions marked by high inflation  component shortages  and the ongoing war in Ukraine  I maintain a sense of cautious optimism about our future. The growing recognition among our customers for the reliability  performance  and innovative nature of our solutions and services provides us with a solid foundation for what lies ahead.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:“The results of the 1st half of 2023 demonstrate our growth trajectory. We will realize growth in 2023  even in a year with no Big Event Rental revenue. This is a turning point for EVS. Next to a strong topline performance  we also see the positive effects of our pricing strategy: our gross profit is demonstrating that we can balance price increases taking into accountmacro-economic challenges. Whilst keeping our costs under control  this performance results in a net profit margin of 24.2%  demonstrating our ability to realize sustainable and profitable growth. Finally  our balance sheet remains strong with a solid cash position and open receivables that restored well compared to end of December 2022  clearly demonstrated by an improvement in our days of sales outstanding. All these promising results lead to an upgrade of our guidance both in revenue and EBIT  and this clearly underpins the sustainable and profitable growth ambition that we have set for ourselves.”EVS Market Dynamics and customer winsIn the LiveCeption domain  EVS now proposes a MultiReview experience driven by the LSM-VIA  very well appreciated for the fast conception of multi-angle highlights. EVS did also optimize the XNET-VIA internal network protocol to further reduce the delay between replays when content is hosted on different servers. Inline with “Balanced computing” concept  XtraMotion now supports different deployment models (in the cloud and in an OBVAN) to cope with the respective constraints of the production (budget and “delay to live"").The upgrade of the XT3 continues at the right pace thanks to the compelling upgrade offers and the continuously broader feature set now covered by XT-VIA and XT-GO  as described above. Not all XT3s will be migrated to XT-VIA since one single large capacity XT-VIA can replace 2 early version XT3s. Moreover  not all customers will proceed with an upgrade of their large capacity XT3 to XT-VIA before the pre-announced end of life. It all depends on their investment lifecycles driven by their customer contracts  including number of events and the size of the contracted productions.About MediaCeption solutions  EVS continues the deployment of IPD-VIA create  the new editing tool focused on speed and creativity to create valuable content during live productions. Besides XT-VIA and XS-VIA  EVS also deploys more and more software versions of the server with XS-NEO as part of the LAB modernization projects.As every year  EVS supported its customers (facility companies and broadcasters) delivering the NFL Superbowl: one of the most watched events on earth. EVS also supports more and more events with MediaHub  allowing “Rights owners” to share valuable sports content with “Rights holders” disseminated on the planet. The same platform that is running the major events is now offered in SAAS and used every month on events with multi-country audiences.Neuron product family is welcoming a new software “Neuron View” as a multiviewer that can be virtualized on Neuron platform  thus strengthening the competitiveness of the overall Media Infrastructure solution. Cerebrum Software Defined Network control has also been improved in terms of user experience to support the transition of our customers towards centralized IP backbones across different control rooms and studios.For the 2023 first semester  both LAB and LSP market pillars beat a record in terms of revenues. For LAB  the shape of the revenue trend is also depending on the speed of the transformation project and the related revenue recognition. If LSP market pillar is higher in revenue  LAB is significantly higher in the order intake  beating another record.Yet as another record  the order intake for Media Infrastructure during this semester is higher than the Media Infrastructure revenues for the full 2020 year  demonstrating the attractivity of our solutions in this new domain for EVS.The traction for EVS solutions has been impressive at NAB. Our customers and channel partners are better understanding the value of our portfolio of solutions. The channel partner event was a great success with more and more partners preferring to attend EVS event than the ones organised by other larger vendors at the same time. Another event - co-organised with an IP vendor – was also overbooked  demonstrating the attractivity of the IP migration approach proposed by EVS. And  cherry on the cake  EVS did receive the “Best of Show award” for XTRAMOTION 2.0 Edge  proving the values of “Balanced Computing” concept with smooth and smart adoption of cloud technology. EVS now prepares the IBC mid-September.Supply chain of electronic components remains a point of attention for the company  considering the evolutions of the economy and the current geo-political tensions.As announced in our 2022 annual report  the Group has decided early March 2023 to call the end-of-life of certain activities linked to our operations in Darmstadt. This within the context of our strategy to focus on sustainable and profitable growth. Several months after the announcement  we can confirm that impacts on the financial statements have been limited and immaterial  thanks to the pro-active conversations with our customers.The company continues to progress as well in terms of ESG and received a ""low risk"" Environmental  Social  and Governance (ESG) rating from Morningstar Sustainalytics. With a risk score of 13.5  EVS is ranked in the 7th percentile in Sustainalytics’ global universe of more than 15 000 rated companies  indicating a significant improvement from the previous year  with a decrease of 9.2 points.First half revenueRevenue reached EUR 87.4 million in 1H23  representing an increase of EUR 19.7 million or 29.2% compared to 1H22.The impact of exchange rate conversions was minimal  resulting in a growth of revenue at constant currency of 28.7% YoY. Finally  taking out the seasonal impact of the Big Event Rental  the growth of 1H23 was of 40.3%.Revenue – EUR millions 1H23 1H22 Variance Total reported 87.4 67.7 29.2% Total at constant currency 87.1 67.7 28.7% Total at constant currency and excluding Big Event Rentals 87.0 62.0 40.3%Currency fluctuations primarily impact EVS revenues by the EUR/USD conversion  which can have a significant impact on our results even if EUR/USD fluctuations also impact the cost of our US operations and partially our cost of goods sold.In the first half of the year  excluding Big Event Rentals  LSP represented 56% of the revenue (59% in 1H22) and LAB 44% (41% in 1H22). The trend demonstrated by this performance is reflecting the long-term growth patterns laid out in our PLAYForward strategic plan.Geographically  revenues are distributed as follows in 1H23 (excl. Big Event Rentals):Europe  Middle East and Africa (EMEA): EUR 41.8 million (EUR 28.7 million in 1H22)  growing 45.8% and demonstrating a strong recovery compared to 1H22 in that region.EUR 41.8 million (EUR 28.7 million in 1H22)  growing 45.8% and demonstrating a strong recovery compared to 1H22 in that region. Americas (NALA): EUR 28.6 million (EUR 25.6 million in 1H22)  growing 11.3% continuing the strong performance since multiple quarters.EUR 28.6 million (EUR 25.6 million in 1H22)  growing 11.3% continuing the strong performance since multiple quarters. Asia & Pacific (APAC): EUR 17.0 million (EUR 7.7 million in 1H22)  growing 120.9%  despite a slow recovery in China  demonstrating strong growth in several countries.First half earningsConsolidated gross margin was 70.1% for 1H23  compared to 67.7% in 1H22. The Bill Of Material cost is increasing compared to 1H22 (+0.7Pts)  though is at a very sound level of 15.7% thanks to the success of our pricing strategy and our ability to model macro-economic events. Every solution is improving marginally the profitability  demonstrating the balanced approach. The investments over the past quarters in the operations & support teams is being diluted  given the strong revenue performance.Operating expenses increased by 21% YoY as a consequence of investments in resources (+54 FTE on average) made in the past 12 months as well as some transformation projects we are running as a company. All these investments are done to support our long term ambition. Next to an impact linked to team members  the operating expenses are growing mainly following increased energy prices and increased travel spend.In terms of intangible assets  EVS continues to invest in 2 specific projects that should fuel our future growth. The investments (a total of EUR 3.0 million in 1H23) are in line with the budgeted spend and are assumed to start contributing to our topline as of 2024.The 1H23 EBIT margin was strong at 28.5%  compared to 23.3% in 1H22: a demonstration that the past investments are supporting our growth trajectory and are positioning us for the future.Income taxes are at EUR 3.7 million  compared to EUR 1.9 million last year: this increase is linked to the higher profit before taxes in 1H23 (EUR +7.6 million compared to 1H22) and to the limitation on the deduction of tax latencies from previous years in Belgium (the threshold has been reduced from 70% to 40% of the taxable profit exceeding the amount of EUR 1 million since January 2023).The group net profit amounted to EUR 21.2 million in 1H23  compared to EUR 15.5 million in 1H22. Fully diluted earnings per share amounted to EUR 1.52 in 1H23  compared to EUR 1.15 in 1H22.Second half outlookBased on the secured revenue on June 30  2023 at EUR 158.7 million (+35.8% growth compared to EUR 116.9 million of last year at the same date)  and based on the strong profit performance  we are confident to achieve our ambitions of profitable growth for the year 2023.The results of the first semester lead to an upgrade of our revenue guidance to a range of EUR 160-170 million (versus EUR 150-160 million previously). Based on the current production calendar and the preparation of the big events in 2024  we will have limited orders that will still contribute to our topline in 2023. Our full year EBIT range is also upgraded  to a range of EUR 32.5-38.5 million (from an initial range EUR 27.5-32.5 million)  benefiting from the strong revenue performance and the positive margin evolution.Next to our progress on 2023  we also continue to build the future. In addition to secured revenue for 2023  EVS has secured a long-term order book worth EUR 61.7 million (EUR +5.8 million compared to the situation at the beginning of the year).On top of this order book  we have also secured in June 2023  an important contract for the delivery of integrated solutions and related services linked to major multisport events occurring 2024 and beyond. The associated order intake linked to this contract will get recognized progressively  as soon as the technical requirements for the events are known.GlossaryTerm Definition Secured revenue Revenue already recognized as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in the fiscal year.

(""AMG""  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ""AMG"") announces that AMG Brasil S.A. (“AMG Brazil”)  has signed an exclusive memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with Grupo Lagoa  which operates a pegmatite mine supplying the Portuguese ceramic and glass industry since 1984. The intention of the partnership is to concentrate the lithium minerals contained in the pegmatite to produce commercial grade Spodumene concentrate.To date  we have performed comprehensive metallurgical tests on a laboratory scale and have confirmed a viable mineral processing route to convert a representative sample of 1.1% Li2O yielding an output of 5.6% Li2O spodumene concentrate at 15.5% mass recovery and 76.2% metallurgical recovery. This partnership presents a unique opportunity for both parties  as we can significantly leverage AMG’s operating experience in Brazil due to the similarities of our mine and operations. Leveraging our experience in Brazil  the planned process will allow for the continued supply of ceramic & glass materials to local customers.Basic engineering of a sizeable Pilot Plant with a capacity to process up to 80 000 tonnes per annum of pegmatite has been initiated. Additional geological studies  including diamond drilling  are currently being conducted to confirm present estimates of the size and quality of the resources which we believe will support an industrial Spodumene operation similar in size to our existing Brazilian operations. The industrial plant will be pursued subject to permitting from the relevant Portuguese authorities and other concerned stakeholders  the successful operation of the pilot plant  and confirmation of the available resource base.Fabiano Costa  President of AMG Brazil  commented  “The intended joint venture is targeting the development of a lithium operation similar to AMG Brazil. Producing spodumene concentrate in Europe is a key part of AMG Lithium’s overall integration strategy.”About AMGAMG's mission is to provide critical materials and related process technologies to advance a less carbon-intensive world. To this end  AMG is focused on the production and development of energy storage materials such as lithium  vanadium  and tantalum. In addition  AMG's products include highly engineered systems to reduce CO 2 in aerospace engines  as well as critical materials addressing CO 2 reduction in a variety of other end use markets.AMG Clean Energy Materials segment combines AMG’s recycling and mining operations  producing materials for infrastructure and energy storage solutions while reducing the CO 2 footprint of both suppliers and customers. AMG Clean Energy Materials segment spans the vanadium  lithium  and tantalum value chains.

Subsequently  Aegon's group supervision will transfer to the Bermuda Monetary Authority  the current regulator of Aegon's three insurance entities incorporated in Bermuda under the Transamerica name. Following the combination of our Dutch insurance business with a.s.r. on July 4  2023  we no longer have a regulated insurance business in the Netherlands. Under Solvency II rules  Aegon's current de facto group supervisor  the Dutch Central Bank  or DNB  can therefore no longer remain Aegon's group supervisor. After consulting the members of the college of supervisors  the BMA has informed Aegon that the BMA will become its group supervisor if Aegon were to transfer its legal seat to Bermuda. The Solvency II Regime will continue to apply to our insurance businesses located in the European Union. Aegon's regulated insurance entities in the US  UK  Spain  Portugal and in other jurisdictions will continue to be supervised by their current local regulators.The change of legal domicile to Bermuda allows us to maintain our headquarters in the Netherlands and to remain a Dutch tax resident. Bermuda has a well-developed system of corporate law  enabling application of international governance standards going forward  and is a well-known location for insurance companies  including three of Aegon's current subsidiaries. In addition  Bermuda's regulatory regime is well recognized  having been granted equivalent status by the EU under the Solvency II regime  and by the UK under its own solvency regime. It is also considered to be a qualified jurisdiction and reciprocal jurisdiction by the U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners (subject to certain limitations and exceptions). While DNB ceased to be our default group supervisor following the combination of the Dutch insurance business with a.s.r. on the basis of the Solvency II regime  DNB has agreed to temporarily stay on as de facto group supervisor on the basis of a delegation agreement with the Spanish supervisory authority  the Direccíón General de Seguros y Fondos de Pensiones  or DGSFP  to ensure a smooth transfer of group supervision. In the interim phase  the presence of a continued and constant delegated group supervisor therefore is ensured.In the past two and a half years  we have worked hard to execute the strategy as communicated to you at our capital markets day in December 2020. We have been able to deliver on many of our strategic intentions  such as sharpening our strategic focus and improving Aegon's strategic and financial profile through enhanced operational performance and strengthening of our capital position. The completion of the transaction with a.s.r. on July 4  2023  formed a leader in the Dutch insurance market and enables Aegon to increase its focus on creating advantaged businesses in chosen markets outside the Netherlands. We believe the proposed redomiciliation will help us succeed in furthering our strategic intentions going forward as presented at our capital markets day on June 22  2023. Upon completion of the redomiciliation to Bermuda  Aegon's headquarters will remain in the Netherlands  Aegon will remain a Dutch tax resident and Aegon's shares will remain listed on Euronext Amsterdam and NYSE. Aegon will continue to report under the IFRS accounting standards. Aegon is exploring the implementation of U.S. GAAP in the medium term  in addition to IFRS  so as to allow for better comparison against U.S. peers and provide long-term strategic flexibility for the Aegon Group.We ask the Aegon general meeting of shareholders for approval of the proposed redomiciliation. The purpose of this U.S. Shareholder Circular is to ensure that Aegon's U.S. shareholders are adequately informed of the facts and circumstances relevant to vote on the approval of the proposed redomiciliation. See ""About this U.S. Shareholder Circular"".As further explained in this U.S. Shareholder Circular  the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of Aegon have concluded that the proposed redomiciliation is in the interest of Aegon and its stakeholders  and unanimously recommend voting in favor of the proposed redomiciliation. We encourage you to read the information included or incorporated by reference in this U.S. Shareholder Circular carefully. We hope that you will follow the recommendation of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and vote in favor of the proposed redomiciliation.We greatly value your support as shareholder and look forward to the Extraordinary General Meeting to be held on September 29  2023.Yours sincerely  /s/ Eilard FrieseEilard Friese  CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board /s/ William L.A.

But he said it did not make sense for Adyen to engage in a price war with them.""If there is any place that you could say is most prone to price competition it would be the U.S. because you can switch more easily "" he said.He said Adyen had not lost any of its large platform customers and the competition was an ""isolated phenomenon"" for one kind of customer: merchants that process both online and in-store payments.Adyen's rivals in the US include Stripe  Braintree  Fiserv (NYSE: ) and PayPal (NASDAQ: ).The company's shares fell sharply after a delayed start on Euronext due to volatility and were down 35% at 951 euros at 1233 GMT. At current prices  the shares are down more than 20% in the year to date  surrendering gains up to Wednesday's close.""These are disappointing results  particularly the sales miss  and the key question will be whether the company can quickly revert to mid-term trend growth "" JPMorgan (NYSE: ) analysts said.Earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were 320 million euros ($348 million)  down 10% from a year earlier and below analyst forecasts of 386 million euros  Refinitiv data showed.Revenue rose 21% to 739 million euros  against Adyen's mid-term forecasts of more than 25% growth.""In some areas the business grew at a lower rate than anticipated "" the company said.Jefferies analyst Hannes Leitner said some concerns are focused on Adyen  which is still more profitable and more highly valued than peers  and some on the sector and economy.He said the economy overall is slowing and online payments growth may not be quite as fast as it was in the pre-COVID era. ""This is impacting Adyen a little more than others.""Adyen's EBITDA margin fell to 43% from 59%  which the company said was mostly because of higher wage costs as it takes on more staff. The company hired 550 full time employees as part of an accelerated hiring push  a 17% increase.A similar margin decline led to a sell-off in Adyen shares when the company reported full-year earnings in February.Adyen CFO Ethan Tandowsky told analysts hiring would remain at similar levels in the second half of 2023 before slowing.He said the company is maintaining its medium-term targets for revenue growth above 25% and an improving EBITDA margin that it expects to reach 65% in the long term. But he said it would take time for margins to expand toward that target after the current hiring push had slowed.($1 = 0.9177 euros)",neutral,0.02,0.91,0.07,negative,0.02,0.23,0.75,True,English,"['Payments company', 'Adyen', 'shares', 'earnings', 'Reuters', 'CEO Pieter van der Does', 'Jefferies analyst Hannes Leitner', 'Adyen CFO Ethan Tandowsky', 'large platform customers', 'Dutch payments processor', 'similar margin decline', 'Eva Plevier/File Photo', 'higher wage costs', '550 full time employees', 'online payments growth', 'digital payments sector', 'mid-term trend growth', 'improving EBITDA margin', 'The Adyen logo', 'current hiring push', 'analyst forecasts', 'store payments', 'mid-term forecasts', 'similar levels', 'hiring costs', 'sales growth', 'reception desk', 'Toby Sterling', 'Elizabeth Howcroft', 'market value', 'general slowdown', 'North America', 'U.S.', 'largest market', 'European base', 'price war', 'isolated phenomenon', 'one kind', 'current prices', 'disappointing results', 'sales miss', 'key question', 'Refinitiv data', 'lower rate', 'pre-COVID era', 'second half', 'medium-term targets', 'long term', 'Watchlist SPOT', 'Watchlist FI', 'Watchlist NFLX', 'Watchlist PYPL', 'Watchlist MSFT', 'revenue growth', 'first-half earnings', 'full-year earnings', 'Adyen NV', '13 billion euros', 'price competition', '386 million euros', '739 million euros', 'high-growth business', 'Adyen shares', '25% growth', '951 euros', '0.9177 euros', 'Aug', 'Reuters', 'company', 'headquarters', 'Amsterdam', 'Netherlands', 'Thursday', 'estimates', 'margins', 'Analysts', 'performance', 'concerns', 'worries', 'services', 'likes', 'Netflix', 'NASDAQ', 'Meta', 'Microsoft', 'Spotify', 'competitors', 'sense', 'place', 'merchants', 'rivals', 'Stripe', 'Braintree', 'Fiserv', 'PayPal', 'start', 'Euronext', 'volatility', '1233 GMT', 'date', 'gains', 'Wednesday', 'JPMorgan', 'interest', 'tax', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'areas', 'peers', 'economy', 'others', 'staff', 'part', '17% increase', 'sell-off', 'February', '©']",2023-08-17,2023-08-18,investing.com

This difference is largely attributable to a substantially lower revaluation result on the financial assets and liabilities and to the (one-off) gain on the sale of the Monnet building in H1 of 2022.• Strong investment portfolio: Nevertheless  rental income continues to increase with €1.9M in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022  despite the sales of several buildings in 2022. This increase is mainly due to the signing of new leases for vacant spaces in Belgium and Luxembourg  indexation in Belgium  Luxembourg and Austria  the 100% occupancy in Austria and the many events taking place at the Tour & Taxis site. These effects produced like-for-like rental growth of 13%. Only a slight devaluation by 0.43% of fair value was recorded.• Successful sale of Treesquare: The Treesquare building located on the De Meeûssquare in the European district of Brussels was sold in early Q2 to the German KGAL Investment Management for a net price of €43.7 million  representing a capital gain of €2M and a yield of 4.23%.• Rotation of investment portfolio: The portfolio was expanded with a building located at Avenue Monterey 18 in Luxembourg City  the neighbour of Nextensa’s office building Monterey 20. A sustainable redevelopment of both buildings into a wooden office building of about 3 000 m2 - inspired by the Monteco building in Brussels - is being prepared.• Innovative developments: The operating result of the development projects amounts to €9.6 M  being only €2.2 M lower compared to H1 2022  despite the difficult market conditions. Of the 346 apartments of Park Lane phase II at Tour & Taxis  half have already been reserved or sold. Some 100 deeds have already been passed. Despite a decline in the sale of apartments in Luxembourg  the developments at Cloche d’Or make a positive contribution of € 8.0M.• Active financial management: Only limited increase in financial costs (+ €1.9 M) given the active hedging strategy (hedge ratio of 71% on 30/06/2023). By reducing the debt ratio to 44.09%  the rising interest rates have less negative impact on the results. Several expired credit lines were successfully extended or will be extended.• Active internal management: Decrease in overhead costs by €0.5M or 9% compared to H1 2022  against the background of a nonetheless inflationary environment.FOR MORE INFORMATIONMichel Van Geyte | Chief Executive OfficerGare Maritime  Rue Picard 11  B505  1000 Brussels+32 2 882 10 08 | investor.relations@nextensa.euwww.nextensa.euABOUT NEXTENSANextensa is a mixed-use real estate investor and developer.The company’s investment portfolio is divided between the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (44%)  Belgium (41%) and Austria (15%); its total value as of 30/06/2023 was approximately € 1.27 billion.As a developer  Nextensa is primarily active in shaping large urban developments.

This difference is largely attributable to a substantially lower revaluation result on the financial assets and liabilities and to the (one-off) gain on the sale of the Monnet building in H1 of 2022.• Strong investment portfolio: Nevertheless  rental income continues to increase with €1.9M in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022  despite the sales of several buildings in 2022. This increase is mainly due to the signing of new leases for vacant spaces in Belgium and Luxembourg  indexation in Belgium  Luxembourg and Austria  the 100% occupancy in Austria and the many events taking place at the Tour & Taxis site. These effects produced like-for-like rental growth of 13%. Only a slight devaluation by 0.43% of fair value was recorded.• Successful sale of Treesquare: The Treesquare building located on the De Meeûssquare in the European district of Brussels was sold in early Q2 to the German KGAL Investment Management for a net price of €43.7 million  representing a capital gain of €2M and a yield of 4.23%.• Rotation of investment portfolio: The portfolio was expanded with a building located at Avenue Monterey 18 in Luxembourg City  the neighbour of Nextensa’s office building Monterey 20. A sustainable redevelopment of both buildings into a wooden office building of about 3 000 m2 - inspired by the Monteco building in Brussels - is being prepared.• Innovative developments: The operating result of the development projects amounts to €9.6 M  being only €2.2 M lower compared to H1 2022  despite the difficult market conditions. Of the 346 apartments of Park Lane phase II at Tour & Taxis  half have already been reserved or sold. Some 100 deeds have already been passed. Despite a decline in the sale of apartments in Luxembourg  the developments at Cloche d’Or make a positive contribution of € 8.0M.• Active financial management: Only limited increase in financial costs (+ €1.9 M) given the active hedging strategy (hedge ratio of 71% on 30/06/2023). By reducing the debt ratio to 44.09%  the rising interest rates have less negative impact on the results.

(CTR) today announced a major investment of over $100 million from Stellantis to advance the development of CTR’s Hell’s Kitchen project  the world’s largest geothermal lithium project with a total resource capacity to produce up to 300 000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent each year. Lithium produced at Hell’s Kitchen will support Stellantis vehicles’ BEV eligibility for consumer incentives under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).Additionally  the companies expanded the initial supply agreement  which now calls for CTR to supply up to 65 000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LHM) each year over a 10-year contract term. This new agreement incorporates the original lithium supply agreement signed by both companies in June 2022 for up to 25 000 metric tons of LHM per year.CTR’s Hell’s Kitchen project in California’s Imperial County will recover lithium from geothermal brines using renewable energy and steam to produce truly “green” battery-grade lithium products in a fully integrated process. This eliminates the need for evaporation brine ponds  open pit mines and fossil-fueled lithium processing.“The foundation of our industry-leading decarbonization drive includes low-emissions production and sustainable supply as the building blocks for our electric vehicles ” Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said. “The latest agreement with CTR is an important step in our care for our customers and our planet as we work to provide clean  safe and affordable mobility in North America.”As part of the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  Stellantis announced plans of reaching a 100% passenger car BEV sales mix in Europe and 50% passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the United States by 2030. To achieve these sales targets  the Company is securing approximately 400 GWh of battery capacity  supported by six battery manufacturing plants in North America and Europe. Stellantis is on track to become a carbon net zero corporation by 2038  all scopes included  with single-digit percentage compensation of remaining emissions.“This substantial investment in CTR by Stellantis marks an outstanding milestone for our company and further solidifies our efforts to support sustainable electric vehicle battery production ” CTR Chief Executive Officer Rod Colwell said. “With electric vehicle adoption growing rapidly in the U.S. and throughout the world  it has never been more important to ensure battery materials are sourced and produced responsibly. Through localizing the battery supply chain  we can minimize supply chain risk and create thousands of jobs in a disadvantaged community. We applaud the leadership of Stellantis and look forward to working together to set new industry benchmarks for reliability  efficiency  and sustainability.”CTR is scheduled to commence battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate supply for Stellantis in 2027. The company expects to create 480 construction jobs through comprehensive project labor agreements and upward of 940 direct project jobs when the resource is fully developed.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

Machi has bought 400 DeGods.“Two large NFT funds have reached out to Machi asking to buy 200 of his DeGods each in an attempt to bring some stability to the collection’s prices. This type of activity is very putting off for new traders who are trying to value NFTs  but can’t due to manipulation like this ” Petscher said.Asian equities mixed; U.S. futures gain while European bourses dropImage: Envato ElementsAsian markets traded mixed on Thursday.

(""AMG""  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ""AMG"") announces that AMG Brasil S.A. (“AMG Brazil”)  has signed an exclusive memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with Grupo Lagoa  which operates a pegmatite mine supplying the Portuguese ceramic and glass industry since 1984. The intention of the partnership is to concentrate the lithium minerals contained in the pegmatite to produce commercial grade Spodumene concentrate.To date  we have performed comprehensive metallurgical tests on a laboratory scale and have confirmed a viable mineral processing route to convert a representative sample of 1.1% Li2O yielding an output of 5.6% Li2O spodumene concentrate at 15.5% mass recovery and 76.2% metallurgical recovery. This partnership presents a unique opportunity for both parties  as we can significantly leverage AMG’s operating experience in Brazil due to the similarities of our mine and operations. Leveraging our experience in Brazil  the planned process will allow for the continued supply of ceramic & glass materials to local customers.Basic engineering of a sizeable Pilot Plant with a capacity to process up to 80 000 tonnes per annum of pegmatite has been initiated. Additional geological studies  including diamond drilling  are currently being conducted to confirm present estimates of the size and quality of the resources which we believe will support an industrial Spodumene operation similar in size to our existing Brazilian operations. The industrial plant will be pursued subject to permitting from the relevant Portuguese authorities and other concerned stakeholders  the successful operation of the pilot plant  and confirmation of the available resource base.Fabiano Costa  President of AMG Brazil  commented  “The intended joint venture is targeting the development of a lithium operation similar to AMG Brazil. Producing spodumene concentrate in Europe is a key part of AMG Lithium’s overall integration strategy.”About AMGAMG's mission is to provide critical materials and related process technologies to advance a less carbon-intensive world. To this end  AMG is focused on the production and development of energy storage materials such as lithium  vanadium  and tantalum. In addition  AMG's products include highly engineered systems to reduce CO 2 in aerospace engines  as well as critical materials addressing CO 2 reduction in a variety of other end use markets.AMG Clean Energy Materials segment combines AMG’s recycling and mining operations  producing materials for infrastructure and energy storage solutions while reducing the CO 2 footprint of both suppliers and customers. AMG Clean Energy Materials segment spans the vanadium  lithium  and tantalum value chains.

The price of the new shares is 25% higher than the average price of the last ten days.The transaction is part of Delta Drone’s acquisition on 5 June 2023 of 100% of the shares of TONNER DRONES from OTT HERITAGE and COURCELETTE HOLDINGS. For the latter transaction  the two companies granted seller financing covering the entire initial price and conditional price supplements.The creditor companies OTT HERITAGE and COURCELETTE HOLDINGS thus hold liquid and payable receivables on Delta Drone totalling €2 240 000 and have expressed their wish to have this receivable partially converted into Company shares. This confirms the confidence of OTT HERITAGE and COURCELETTE HOLDINGS  associated with Jean-François Ott and Brad Taylor  in the recovery prospects of Delta Drone  whose rapid transformation is now being led by a renewed management team.The Board of Directors thus implemented the delegation provided for in the Tenth Resolution approved at the Combined General Shareholders' Meeting of 27 January 2023.The transaction modifies the information communicated on 5 June 2023 whereby OTT HERITAGE and COURCELETTE HOLDINGS were to put their receivable into a trust to manage the conversion and sale of shares. Instead  the two companies have decided to manage this process themselves so as to reduce costs and demonstrate their firm commitment to the company’s new strategy. The investor group led by Diede van den Ouden has also decided not to enter a trust.“This conversion shows that OTT HERITAGE and COURCELETTE HOLDINGS are committed to the continued development and overall strategy of the company and intend to be shareholders over the long term ” said Brad Taylor  CEO of Delta DroneConvening of an Extraordinary General MeetingThe Board of Directors decided to convene an Extraordinary General Meeting on Friday 29 September 2023 at 11.00 a.m. with the following agenda:change Delta Drone’s name to Tonner Drones 1 to lend tangible form to the new direction being taken today;to lend tangible form to the new direction being taken today; relocate Delta Drone’s headquarters to Cannes; andissue 400 000 share purchase warrants to Diede van den Ouden and his affiliate Kennie Capital BV following the €1 million shareholder loan signed on 15 July 20232.Recognition of the completion of a capital increase following the exercise of 34 920 SPWs by FIDUCIE ABefore the exercise of the SPWs in July 2023 by FIDUCIE A  the share capital amounted to 559 302 ordinary shares with a par value of €1 each. The share capital was increased to 618 280 shares following these transactions and 918 280 shares after taking into account the capital increase reserved for OTT HERITAGE and COURCELETTE HOLDINGS. The amendments to the articles of association stemming from these changes in share capital were approved by the Board of Directors.In a period of less than three months  the renewal of the management team  with the arrival of Jean-François Ott  Brad Taylor and Olivier Chouraqui  supported by new and fully committed investors  has enabled the Company to take decisive steps forward in its necessary transformation  namely by restructuring debt  discontinuing bonds redeemable in cash and new shares  securing short-term operational financing  optimising costs  and strengthening its positions on military markets. These decisive advances will allow the Company to fully focus on technological and sales development with a view to returning to solid growth in line with market opportunities.Next event: Combined General Meeting on Friday 29 September 2023 at 11 a.m.About Delta Drone: Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the civil drone sector for professional use.

U.S. markets came under further pressure in the wake of the release of the latest Fed minutes  falling to one-month lows "" commented Michael Hewson  chief market analyst at CMC Markets.""The slide following the minutes and the prospect that rates may remain higher for longer translates into another weak open for Europe  with Asian markets feeling the pressure from concerns about the outlook for the Chinese economy. The minutes turned out to be reasonably hawkish  which is not entirely surprising given the recent comments of various Fed officials  however  it did come as some surprise that only two members were in favor of keeping rates unchanged.""""Despite the recent hawkish rhetoric from various Fed officials  markets had grown accustomed to the idea that the July rate hike would likely be the last.

Sales momentum in asset management and UK Retail businesses affected by challenging market conditionsStatement of Lard Friese  CEO“Aegon had a solid first half of the year. Our operating result increased by 3% compared with the same period in 2022  and reflects improved results in all insurance units while asset management was negatively impacted by a challenging market environment. Our net result was a loss of EUR 199 million  and reflects previously announced items in the US that will position us well for future growth. Our operating capital generation was strong  driven largely by our US business. The capital ratios of our main units remained above their respective operating levels in the first half of 2023. These results provide a solid basis to raise the interim dividend by 3 eurocents compared with the 2022 interim dividend to 14 eurocents per share.In the US  Transamerica performed well. New Life sales increased by 17% compared with the previous year  driven by another strong increase in the number of World Financial Group (WFG) agents  now at a record-high of 70 000. Written sales of mid-sized retirement plans increased almost 70%  driven largely by a pooled plan sale of USD 1.7 billion. Aegon’s UK Workplace solutions platform also continued to deliver strong results  with a significant increase in net deposits driven by the onboarding of new schemes and higher net deposits on existing schemes. We also saw increased sales in our partnerships in China and Brazil. At the same time  results at Aegon’s asset management and UK Retail businesses continued to be affected by adverse market conditions.We took significant steps in our transformation. We completed the sale of Aegon’s insurance  pension and asset management business in Central and Eastern Europe  and we announced the sale of our stake in our business in India. In addition  we closed the transaction with a.s.r. for which Aegon received EUR 2.2 billion and a 29.99% stake in a.s.r.  and we have started the related EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program.Now we have begun the next chapter in our transformation. At our 2023 Capital Markets Day held in June  we outlined how we will invest in our Strategic Assets. In the US  we will ensure that Transamerica captures its full potential and becomes America’s leading middle market life insurance and retirement company. At the same time  Transamerica will continue to reduce its exposure to Financial Assets and to improve the level and predictability of capital generation. In this respect  we welcome the fact that we have been able to execute an additional reinsurance transaction on 14 000 universal life policies with secondary guarantees  generating approximately USD 225 million of capital that will be used to further reduce Aegon’s exposure to Financial Assets over time. Together with the prior reinsurance transaction undertaken in 2021  a total of 25% of the statutory reserves backing these policies have now been reinsured.As part of our strategy  we are also investing in our partnerships. Aegon Asset Management and La Banque Postale have extended their partnership via their joint venture  La Banque Postale Asset Management (LBP AM)  through to 2035. Through our shareholding  Aegon has also participated in LBP AM’s acquisition of La Financière de l’Echiquier  which will accelerate LBP AM’s growth strategy. In the UK  Aegon has extended its partnership with Nationwide Building Society (NBS) under which Aegon UK will integrate NBS’ financial planning teams in order to support its strategy to be the leading digital platform provider in the workplace and retail markets. In addition  Aegon has increased its economic ownership in its Brazilian joint venture  Mongeral Aegon Group  to almost 60%.I would like to thank our colleagues for all their hard work and dedication in ensuring the success of our ongoing transformation.""ContactsMedia relations Investor relations Carolien van der Giessen Hielke Hielkema +31(0) 6 11953367 +31(0) 70 344 7697 carolien.vandergiessen@aegon.com hielke.hielkema@aegon.comAdditional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation is available on aegon.com as of 7.00 a.m. CET.SupplementsAegon’s first half 2023 Financial Supplement and other supplementary documents are available on aegon.com.Conference call including Q&AThe conference call starts at 9:00 am CET  with an audio webcast on aegon.com.

Its portfolio of businesses includes fully owned subsidiaries in the US  UK and a global asset manager. In addition  Aegon has partnerships in Spain & Portugal  Brazil  and China  which create value by combining strong local partners with Aegon’s international expertise.

As a leading global investor and employer  Aegon seeks to have a positive impact by addressing critical environmental and societal issues  with a focus on climate change and inclusion & diversity. Aegon is headquartered in The Hague  the Netherlands  and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange. More information can be found at aegon.com.Local currencies and constant currency exchange ratesThis document contains certain information about Aegon’s results  financial condition and revenue generating investments presented in USD for the Americas and in GBP for the United Kingdom  because those businesses operate and are managed primarily in those currencies. Certain comparative information presented on a constant currency basis eliminates the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. None of this information is a substitute for or superior to financial information about Aegon presented in EUR  which is the currency of Aegon’s primary financial statements.Cautionary note regarding non-EU-IFRS measuresThis document includes the following non-EU-IFRS financial measures: operating result  MCVNB  IFRS new business value  return on equity and addressable expenses. These non-EU-IFRS measures  except for addressable expenses  are calculated by consolidating on a proportionate basis Aegon’s joint ventures and associated companies. Operating result reflects Aegon’s result from underlying business operations and excludes components that relate to accounting mismatches that are dependent on market volatility or relate to events that are considered outside the normal course of business. MCVNB is the abbreviation for Market Consistent Value of New Business and is not based on EU-IFRS and should not be viewed as a substitute for EU-IFRS financial measures. Aegon may define and calculate market consistent value of new business differently than other companies. IFRS new business value is calculated as the sum of the new business contractual service margin and new onerous contracts  after reinsurance (excluding retrospective impacts) and tax. Return on equity is a ratio using a non-EU-IFRS measure and is calculated by dividing the operating result after tax less cost of leverage by the average shareholders’ equity. Operating expenses are all expenses associated with selling and administrative activities (excluding commissions). This includes certain expenses recorded in other charges for segment reporting  including restructuring charges. Addressable expenses are calculated by excluding the following items from operating expenses: direct variable acquisition expenses  restructuring expenses (including expenses related to the operational improvement plan)  expenses in joint ventures and associates and expenses related to acquisitions and disposals. Addressable expenses are reported on a constant currency basis. Aegon believes that these non-EU-IFRS measures  together with the EU-IFRS information  provide meaningful supplemental information about the operating results of Aegon’s business including insight into the financial measures that senior management uses in managing the business.Forward-looking statementsThe statements contained in this document that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The terms of this agreement included Oxurion receiving approximately 80% profit-sharing in any transaction for the asset  according to which Oxurion could receive more than $32 million in developmental  regulatory and commercial milestone payments  in addition to market conforming royalties on sales.Tom Graney  CEO of Oxurion  said  “We are delighted by the successful collaboration between VIB and its partner that will continue the development of what we view as a valuable preclinical asset addressing a key oncology target with an innovative scientific approach. The upfront payment will contribute to Oxurion’s investments in THR-149  being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial as a potential treatment for of diabetic macular edema  which is expected to readout topline results by the end of this year.”Jérôme Van Biervliet  Managing Director VIB  said  “In the partnership with Oncurious  great progress was made based on scientific breakthroughs discovered at VIB. For the next phase of development  VIB and Oxurion are convinced that these innovative therapeutics deserve the most optimal setting for translation to the patient.”Oncurious is a wholly owned subsidiary of Oxurion that has been developing oncology therapies focused on antibody immunotherapy.About VIBVIB’s core mission is to generate disruptive insights in the molecular underpinning of life and to translate these actively into impactful innovations for patients and society. VIB is an independent research institute where some 1 800 top scientists from Belgium and abroad conduct pioneering basic research. As such  they are pushing the boundaries of what we know about molecular mechanisms and how they rule living organisms such as human beings  animals  plants  and microorganisms. Based on a close partnership with five Flemish universities – Ghent University  KU Leuven  University of Antwerp  Vrije Universiteit Brussel  and Hasselt University – and supported by a solid funding program  VIB unites the expertise of all its collaborators and research groups in a single institute. VIB’s technology transfer activities translate research results into concrete benefits for society such as new diagnostics and therapies and agricultural innovations. These applications are often developed by young start-ups from VIB or through collaborations with other companies. This also leads to additional employment and bridges the gap between scientific research and entrepreneurship. VIB also engages actively in the public debate on biotechnology by developing and disseminating a wide range of science-based information.Story continuesMore info can be found on www.vib.be.About OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is a biopharmaceutical company developing next-generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies  which are designed to improve and better preserve vision in patients with retinal disorders including diabetic macular edema (DME)  the leading cause of vision loss in working-age people  as well as other conditions.
