29167,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/581455-russia-clearstream-lawsuit/,Russian investors sue EU clearing house,Asset holders in Russia have launched a class action lawsuit against Clearstream for blocking their funds Read Full Article at RT.com,Clearstream blocked billions of dollars in private assets as part of Ukraine-related sanctions last yearRussian investors have launched a class action lawsuit against Clearstream  the Luxembourg-based international settlement depository  aiming to recover funds blocked due to the West's Ukraine-related sanctions against Russia. The case was announced on Friday by the law firm NSP  which is handling the case  on its official Telegram channel.The lawsuit was filed on August 17 at the Arbitration Court in Moscow. The plaintiffs are seeking to recover roughly 200 million rubles ($2.14 million) in compensation for the value of their blocked assets  as well as accrued but not received dividends and other payments. The law firm has said that it expects the first court hearing to take place in October.Earlier this year  Russian investors also took legal action against the EU’s largest depository  Belgium-based Euroclear  which last month revealed that it had accrued nearly $2 billion in profit from frozen Russian assets in the first half of 2023. In total  at least 18 lawsuits  including two class actions  have been filed against Euroclear in Russian courts so far. According to lawsuits that have declassified their monetary demands  Russian investors are seeking to sue the depository for about 200 billion rubles ($2.1 billion).Private investors used to hold funds within the European clearing houses through Russia’s National Settlement Depository (NSD). Both Euroclear and Clearstream ceased transactions with NSD and blocked its accounts amid sanctions against the Russian depository in mid-2022. This deprived Russian investors of the opportunity to retrieve their assets. In January  the Bank of Russia estimated that Russian assets stuck at Euroclear and Clearstream amounted to about 5.7 trillion rubles ($60.9 billion).Late last year  EU regulators authorized the release of “certain” frozen Russian funds by granting temporary general licenses to NSD at both Euroclear and Clearstream. However  shortly afterwards  Russian media outlets reported that the licenses could not be enforced because the NSD could not fulfill their requirements.Experts are optimistic about the investors’ chances of recovering their funds through legal action following a precedent in February. Back then  the Arbitration Court in Moscow ruled against Euroclear in a case filed by Bank St. Petersburg  which demanded the recovery of $107 million held at the depository. In April  the Belgian Treasury issued a license for the bank to unblock its assets frozen on NSD's account with Euroclear for about $110 million.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.03,0.72,0.25,negative,0.01,0.27,0.71,True,English,"['EU clearing house', 'Russian investors', 'Luxembourg-based international settlement depository', 'official Telegram channel', 'two class actions', 'European clearing houses', 'Russian media outlets', 'temporary general licenses', 'first court hearing', 'Bank St. Petersburg', 'class action lawsuit', 'frozen Russian funds', 'first half', 'Russian depository', 'Arbitration Court', 'legal action', 'Russian investors', 'Russian courts', 'largest depository', 'law firm', '200 million rubles', 'other payments', 'monetary demands', '200 billion rubles', 'Private investors', '5.7 trillion rubles', 'investors’ chances', 'Belgian Treasury', 'business section', 'Russian assets', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'private assets', 'EU regulators', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'billions', 'dollars', 'part', 'West', 'case', 'Friday', 'NSP', 'August', 'Moscow', 'plaintiffs', 'compensation', 'value', 'dividends', 'place', 'October', 'profit', 'total', '18 lawsuits', 'NSD', 'transactions', 'accounts', 'mid-20', 'opportunity', 'January', 'release', 'certain', 'requirements', 'Experts', 'precedent', 'February', 'recovery', 'April', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-08-18,2023-08-19,rt.com

The stock edged up bri…,"(Updates story published late Thursday with Friday Adyen share price move in lead and paragraph 2)LONDON/MILAN  Aug 18 (Reuters) - Shares in Dutch payments processor Adyen NV hit their lowest level in more than three years on Friday  adding to Thursday's record loss after weak earnings raised concerns about its valuations and a price war grew.The stock edged up briefly in wobbly early trade on Euronext  before losing ground again and was down 6% by 0755 GMT to its lowest since April 2020. The shares fell nearly 40% on Thursday.The Adyen share plunge ""was because expectations were much higher. Analysts believed that Adyen would take significantly more share in this difficult market environment "" said Jefferies equity analyst Hannes Leitner.""When something like this happens  where basically the multiple is at question  ... this usually creates a couple of days of selling."" According to Refinitiv Datastream  Adyen was at an enterprise value of 43 times its 12-month core earnings based on Thursday's closing price and the latest earnings release. That compares with 12.7 times for French rival Worldline and 8.8 times for Italy's Nexi.Adyen reported earnings that missed expectations  a rare slip since it went public in 2018. Competition from North America  where rivals cut prices  slowed its revenue growth and hiring costs hit margins.While that sparked the initial fall in its stock price  the selling gathered momentum as the session wore on  wiping 17.8 billion euros ($19.3 billion) off Adyen's market capitalisation by the close.""Its valuation was frankly way above that of its competitors and that was okay as long as things were going well "" said Marco Simion  senior fund manager at Swiss asset manager ZEST SA  who does not own shares in Adyen.""Today's miss has shown cracks in its growth prospects. Was the share price reaction justified? Probably it was  given the high valuation premium relative to its competitors.""One European equities trader  who asked not to be named  noted there were orders to sell Adyen shares at any price and referred to ""apocalypse selling."" Nearly a million shares traded hands  the biggest daily trading volume since September 2020.Nexi and Worldline shares were caught in the fallout on Thursday but were more resilient  each dropping around 3.5%.Crowding data by Citigroup showed investor positioning in Adyen was light pre-results and a negative earnings surprise was expected. UBS had a similar view  saying many investors already expected a miss.Investors were already getting cold feet about Adyen's sector which has been buffeted by higher interest rates.Total fintech funding in the EMEA region was $11 billion in the first half of the year  less than half the $27 billion seen in the second half of 2022  according to KPMG.Privately held rival Stripe raised funds in March at a valuation nearly 50% lower than two years earlier.Despite stretched valuations  analysts were bullish on Adyen. According to data from Refinitiv  17 analysts rated Adyen ""buy""  12 ""hold""  and 4 ""sell"" before the earnings announcement.CEO Pieter van der Does remained confident. ""We run at the lowest cost  so we could join the price fight  but we don't think that's the right strategy "" he said in a post-earnings call with analysts.

29179,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://forkast.news/weekly-market-wrap-bitcoin-falls-below-us26000-evergrandes-bankruptcy/,Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin falls below US$26 000 following Evergrande’s bankruptcy,Bitcoin fell over 10% this week and dipped to a two-month low following Evergrande’s bankruptcy filing.,Bitcoin fell 10.44% from Aug. 11 to Aug. 18 to US$26 324 as of 9:00 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong  according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading below US$30 000 since last Wednesday. Ether fell 9.16% over the week to US$1 678.Bitcoin dipped to US$25 409 on Friday  its lowest price in two months  after Evergrande  a Chinese property developer with over US$340 billion in liabilities  filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S.  as part of its prolonged restructuring agreement with international creditors. Evergrande defaulted on its dollar-denominated debts in 2021.Adrian Fritz  a senior research associate at 21.co  the parent company of 21Shares  an issuer of crypto exchange-traded products  said that Evergrande’s bankruptcy contributed to Bitcoin’s price fall  along with the usual “summer trading lull.”“Bitcoin’s first key support level was the 200-day moving average at US$27 200  which it wasn’t able to hold. The next major support level to watch would be around US$25 000 ” said Fritz  in an email response to Forkast.Coinbase  the largest crypto exchange in the U.S.  announced on Wednesday that it obtained regulatory approval to offer crypto futures trading services to eligible clients in the country.The Shiba Inu (SHIB) token launched its layer-2 scaling solution  Shibarium  on the Ethereum blockchain on Thursday  but US$1.7 million worth of ETH was stuck on the Shibarium bridge  according to on-chain intelligence firm PeckShield  leading an over 7% drop in SHIB’s price.Adding to the negative investor sentiment  Binance announced the shutdown of its crypto payment service  Binance Connect  on Wednesday. Previously known as “Bifinity ” Binance Connect was a fiat-to-crypto payment ramp for the exchange  allowing users to buy cryptocurrencies through Mastercard and Visa.Binance’s announcement came a day after Europe’s first Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) was listed on Euronext Amsterdam  nearly two years after it was first approved.Lucas Kiely  the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App  said that the ETF listing could inspire other European countries to follow suit and pressure the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to hasten its approval process for pending ETFs.“If Europe demonstrates that such products can operate safely within existing regulatory frameworks  it may force the SEC to reevaluate its cautious approach towards cryptocurrency-related investment vehicles ” wrote Kiely  adding that the surging demand may also move Bitcoin prices higher.However  Jonas Betz  crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto  doesn’t expect the European ETF to significantly boost Bitcoin prices or accelerate the SEC’s decision-making process.“The SEC will likely maintain its independent pace and judgment  regardless of the actions of its European counterparts ” Betz told Forkast.Notable Movers: LTC & XRPSome of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies were put on the spotlight in the loss column this week.XRP  the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization  dropped 20.09% to US$0.505 after the SEC was granted the request to file an interlocutory appeal in its lawsuit against Ripple Labs.Litecoin  the world’s 15th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization  fell 21.65% to US$65.12  as part of a broader downward movement in the crypto market.

(NYSE:AEG) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript August 17  2023 Operator: Good day  and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Aegon First Half...,Aegon N.V. (NYSE:AEG) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript August 17  2023Operator: Good day  and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Aegon First Half 2023 Results Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker  Hielke Hielkema  Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.Hielke Hielkema : Thank you  operator  and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining this conference call on Aegon's first half 2023 results. My name is Hielke Hielkema from Aegon Investor Relations team. With me today are Aegon's CEO  Lard Friese; and CFO  Matt Rider  who will take you through the highlights of the first half year  our financial results and the progress that we are making in the transformation of Aegon. After that  we will continue with a Q&A session. Before we start  we would like to ask you to review our disclaimer on forward-looking statements  which you can find at the back of the presentation. And on that note  I will now give the floor to Lard.Lard Friese: Thank you  Hielke  and good morning  everyone. We appreciate that you are joining us on today's call. Today  we present our results under the new IFRS 9 and 17 accounting standard for the first time. But first  let me run you through our strategic developments and commercial momentum. We have a lot to talk about. So let's move to Slide #2 for the achievements in the first half of 2023. We have started the next chapter in Aegon's transformation delivering a successful Capital Markets Day in London in June. We closed the transaction with a.s.r. in July and have started the €1.5 billion share buyback program associated with the deal  which we expect to complete before the end of June 2024. In addition  we still intend to reduce our leverage by up to €700 million in the same time frame  and we'll update you on that when appropriate.On the strategy front  we continue to take steps to transform our business. We have increased our financial stake in our Brazilian joint venture  we expanded our partnership with Nationwide Building Society in the U.K. and extended our asset management partnership with La Banque Postale in France. The sale of our remaining Central and Eastern European businesses have been closed  and we have announced the sale of our stake in our joint venture in India. We are now fully focused on 3 core markets  3 growth markets and 1 global asset manager. We're also delivering on our commitments to continue to reduce our exposure to U.S. Financial Assets and to improve the level and predictability of capital generation. Transamerica has been able to execute an additional reinsurance transaction  encompassing 14 000 Universal Life policies with secondary guarantees.Story continuesThis will free up approximately $225 million of capital  which will be used for management actions to further reduce our exposure to Financial Assets over time. It also significantly improves our risk profile  together with the prior similar reinsurance transaction  the total of 25% of the statutory reserves backing these policies have now been reinsured. Turning to our results over the first half of 2023. The operating results now reported under the new accounting standards  IFRS 9 and 17  increased by 3% compared with the first half of 2022. This was driven by increases in the U.S.  the U.K. and the International segment  which more than offset a decreasing operating result in Asset Management. Operating capital generation before holding  funding and operating expenses increased by 13% compared with the first half of 2022  reflecting business growth in our U.S. Strategic Assets  together with improved claims experience.Turning to our commercial results. Transamerica performed well. We delivered strong sales growth in all of our U.S. Strategic Assets. The U.K. Workplace Solutions platform continued to deliver strong growth and sales increased in our partnerships in China and Brazil. The results of our Asset Manager and our U.K. Retail business continued to be negatively affected by adverse market conditions. Recently  we have announced our intention to move Aegon's legal seat to Bermuda. Subsequently  the Bermuda Monetary Authority will then assume the role of group supervisor. Today  we have convened 2 extraordinary general meetings to be held at the end of September to seek shareholder approval for the move. Finally  on our path to increase the dividend to around €0.40 per share over the year 2025  we have increased the 2023 interim dividend to €0.14 per share  up more than 25% compared to the 2022 interim dividend.This is testament to our strong financial position and prospects. Before I move on to the results  I want to recap the priorities we presented at the recent Capital Markets Day in London on Slide #3. We have defined 4 key priorities to create value for our shareholders during the second chapter of Aegon's transformation. The first of the near-term priorities we announced in June has already been achieved. We have closed the transaction with a.s.r.  and we now own a nearly 30% strategic stake in the Dutch market leader. Moving our legal seat to Bermuda is the next step ahead of us on our journey to transform the group  and we are on track to accomplish this. We presented our plans to increase Transamerica's value and to capture the opportunities in the U.S. middle market.Our ambition is to build America's leading middle market life insurance and retirement company. Over the coming 3 years  we will increase both the level and the quality of capital generation from Strategic Assets while reducing our exposure to Financial Assets. At the same time  we will continue to strengthen the U.K. and Asset Management businesses  and we will invest in growing the joint ventures we have in International and Asset Management. The final priority announced at our Capital Markets Day relates to our capital management. We will continue to be rational and disciplined allocators of capital looking to utilize our significant financial flexibility at the holding to create value for our shareholders. With the strategic priorities clearly set  let's move on to our commercial momentum in the first half of 2023  starting on Slide #4.I would like to start with the progress made by World Financial Group or WFG  our vast life insurance distribution network  one of the two focus areas in our U.S. Individual Solutions business. Our ambition is to increase the number of WFG agents to 110 000 by 2027  but at the same time  improving agent productivity. Momentum remains strong with a number of licensed agents having grown to 70 000 by the end of June  an increase of 20% compared with a year earlier. In addition to extending WFG's distribution reach  we are taking actions to improve the productivity of the agency sales force. The number of multi-ticket agents  these are agents selling more than 1 life policy over the last 12 months  has increased by 12% compared with the year earlier.Transamerica's market share of life insurance products sold by WFG in the U.S. remains high. This is due to the improvements we have made to the service experience for WFG agents  combined with the continued competitiveness of Transamerica's products in this distribution channel. Slide #5 addresses the second focus area of our U.S. Individual Solutions business. We are investing in both product manufacturing capabilities and the operating model in order to position the Individual Life insurance business for further growth through WFG and third-party users. As you can see  commercial momentum remained strong in the first half of the new year. New Life sales increased by 17% compared with the first half of last year  largely driven by higher Indexed Universal Life sales within WFG.In the first half of 2023  New Business Strain increased by 12% compared with the first half of 2022. And the Earnings On In-force increased 35%  reflecting the strong growth of this portfolio. So let's move to Slide #6  where we show the progress made in the U.S. Workplace Solutions retirement plans business. Transamerica aims to increase Earnings On In-force from its Retirement business by leveraging its capabilities as a record keeper with the ambition to materially increase the penetration of the ancillary products and services it offers. Sales momentum remained strong in the first half of 2023. Net deposits for midsized plans increased 32% over the same period last year  benefiting from both strong written sales in previous periods and lower withdrawals.We also saw good growth of our General Account Stable Value products as well as Individual Retirement Accounts  in line with our strategy to grow and diversify our revenue streams with the Workplace Solutions segment. In the first half of 2023  the Earnings on in-force of our Strategic Assets in the Retirement Plans business were USD 45 million  which was an increase of 20%  mainly from the General Account Stable Value product. Let's move to Slide #7  the United Kingdom. In the first half of 2023  net deposits in Workplace channel amounted to a record high of GBP 1.5 billion  an increase of 36% compared with the first half of last year. Sales momentum in Workplace remains strong. In the Retail channel  on the other hand  commercial results were weak.The macroeconomic environment continued to negatively impact investor sentiment across the industry. As a result  net outflows amounted to GBP 1.1 billion in the first half of 2023  more than in the same period of 2022. Annualized revenues lost on net deposits amounted to GBP 6 million for the quarter. This was predominantly due to the gradual runoff of the traditional product portfolio  which was partially offset by revenues gained on net deposits in the Workplace channel. I'm now turning to Slide #8 to comment on the challenging performance of our Asset Management business. Market conditions remain challenging  which led to third-party net outflows in both Global Platform and Strategic Partnership segments. Combined with adverse market movements and unfavorable currency movements  Assets Under Management declined by 7% compared with the end of June 2022.Encouragingly  we saw improvements in third-party net deposits towards the end of this half year. Operating capital generation declined compared with the first half of 2022. This was driven by lower net deposits and unfavorable market movements despite lower expenses. Let's move on to our growth markets on Slide #9  where we continue to see steady progress. New Life sales in our growth markets increased by 45% compared with the first half of 2022. This was largely driven by our business in China following the relaxation of the country's COVID-19 measures. We also recorded good growth in Brazil. Non-life premium production in Spain and Portugal rose 6% as weaker demand for Property and Casualty Solutions was more than offset by growth in Accident and Health insurance.Operating capital generation of the International segment  excluding TOB  increased by 27% as a result of new business growth. On Slide #10  you'll see that we maintain a high pace on the transformation of Aegon and sharpening of our strategic focus. The transaction with a.s.r. has been closed and disentanglement solutions are in place. As the new combination moves forward  we expect a significant synergy to be realized from which our shareholders will benefit. Aegon U.K. has extended their partnership with Nationwide Building Society and will onboard Nationwide's advisory business early next year. This supports Aegon's U.K. strategy to be the leading digital platform provider in the workplace and retail markets and to drive forward our pension and investment propositions.Aegon Asset Management and La Banque Postale have expanded their partnership in the asset manager La Banque Postale Asset Management through 2035. We have also participated in the capital raising to fund La Banque Postale Asset Management's acquisition of La Financière de l'Echiquier  a French asset manager. The acquisition will consolidate La Banque Postale Asset Management's strong market position. In Brazil  we have increased our economic ownership stake in the life insurance joint venture  Mongeral Aegon Group from 54% to 59%. This puts us in a stronger position to benefit from the growth in that market. We also took significant steps in our strategy to exit subscale or niche positions. We have closed the sale of our remaining Central and Eastern European businesses  first announced in 2020 and have announced the sale of our stake in the India business.The final topic I want to address on Slide #11  is the intended transfer of our legal seat to Bermuda. Bermuda Monetary Authority or the BMA is to assume the role as our group supervisor after this. Given the importance of this topic  I want to address the rationale behind this development. Following the closure of the transaction with a.s.r.  Aegon no longer has a regulated insurance business in the Netherlands. And under EU Solvency II rules  Dutch Central Bank can no longer remain a group supervisor and a new group supervisor is required. Various options were explored. Some options were  however  not feasible for various reasons. For instance  in some jurisdictions  does not have a meaningful business presence. In others  the financial reporting requirements do not align with our accounting framework or prevailing regulatory uncertainty would not provide a stable basis for the execution of our global strategy.After consulting the members of the college of supervisors  which consists of the different supervisors  which regulates our local entities  the BMA informed us that it would become Aegon's group supervisor if we were to transfer our legal seat to Bermuda. Transferring the legal seat to Bermuda and being regulated at the group level by the BMA is consistent with our strategy outlined at the recent Capital Markets Day. Bermuda has an established well-regarded regulatory regime and has experience in regulating insurance groups and companies with an international presence. The regulatory regime has been granted equivalency status by both the EU and the U.K. and has been designated as a qualified and reciprocal jurisdiction by the U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners.The transfer of the legal seat to Bermuda allows Aegon to maintain its headquarters in The Netherlands  where we have the experience and the talent to manage this international company. It also allows us to maintain our listings on Euronext Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange  bringing stability to our shareholders and to remain a Dutch tax resident. On Slide #12  this addresses the governance consequences of the intended transfer of our legal domicile. Following the transfer to Bermuda  Aegon N.V. will become Aegon Limited  a Bermudian company. This means that the basis of Aegon's bylaws will be established on Bermudian law and governance practices. At the same time  we remain committed to applying well-recognized international governance standards.Aegon will preserve its current governance principles to the extent possible and practical in view of the redomiciliation and where appropriate to the context of Aegon's international footprint. This includes Aegon's commitment to take into account the long-term interest of the company and all its stakeholders. We conducted an extensive engagement process with our shareholders and other stakeholders following the initial announcement in June. We have listened carefully to the feedback we received and made a couple of changes to the proposed bylaws on the basis of that dialogue. Aside from the other voluntary commitments through strict governance  we had already announced  we have added further binding rights for shareholders in terms of approval of major transactions and on the Board's remuneration policy.These changes and all other relevant information have been published on our corporate website today as part of the complication documents for the Extraordinary General Meetings during which investor approval for the transfer of the legal seat will be requested. I now hand over to Matt for the results of the first half of 2023. Matt  over to you.Pixabay/Public DomainMatthew Rider : Thank you  Lard  and good morning  everyone. Today  we are reporting our results under the new IFRS 17 and 9 accounting framework for the first time. It's been a huge endeavor over the past years to prepare for this shift. So I wanted to start off by thanking the many colleagues who are involved in this process. As you can see  we've provided a lot of new disclosure and it will likely take you some time to digest it and get comfortable with the new standard. Implementing the new framework also in the context of the a.s.r. transaction  has met some changes to our processes. For example  we're reporting a week later than we did last year and now half yearly. Beginning with our full year 2023 results disclosure  our financial reporting calendar will move even later to accommodate  bringing in the results of a 30% shareholding in a.s.r. on an IFRS 17 basis.We also will move our expense assumption review process to the fourth quarter for all business units in order to leverage our budgeting process. At this moment  we are not publishing IFRS 17-based sensitivities  but we will do so by the time we publish our 2023 annual accounts. So with that  I want to walk you through the overview of our financial results starting on Slide 14. The operating result increased by 3% compared with the first half of 2022. Increases in the U.S.  the U.K. and the International segments were partially offset by a decrease in Asset Management. Operating capital generation before holding  funding and operating expenses increased by 13% compared with the first half of 2022. This was driven by the U.S. and reflects business growth of Strategic Assets and improved claims experience.Free cash flow in the first half of 2023 amounted to €287 million and mainly reflects remittances from the U.S.  the U.K. and Aegon's asset management joint venture in China in the first quarter. Cash capital at the holding decreased to €1.3 billion at the end of June 2023 as planned  as remittances from the units were primarily offset by capital returns to shareholders. Our gross financial leverage was stable at €5.6 billion. The group Solvency II ratio decreased by 6 percentage points since year-end 2022 to 202% due to a number of items  including the deduction of the interim dividend  a reduction of eligible owned funds due to tiering restrictions  previously disclosed onetime items and unfavorable market movements. The latter notably includes the impact of lower real estate valuations in The Netherlands.Nevertheless  our capital position remains strong and the capital ratios of our main units remained above their respective operating levels. Let's move on to the operating result on Slide 15. The group's operating result was €818 million  which is an increase of 3% compared to the prior year period. The operating result for the U.S. increased by 4% in the first half of 2023 or 3% in local currency terms. This increase was driven by an improvement in mortality claims experience  but largely offset by a decrease in the net investment result  partly from higher interest expense on short-term variable rate borrowings. The noninsurance operating result benefited from growth in both Retirement Plan and WFG. Over the same period  the operating result from the United Kingdom increased by 24% in local currency.This was driven by an improvement of the net investment result as a result of favorable market movements  which more than offset the impact of the planned transfer of the protection business to Royal London. In our International segment  the operating result increased by 9%  predominantly due to our growing businesses in Spain and Portugal and Brazil. Finally  the operating result from Aegon Asset Management decreased by 34% in constant currency terms compared with the same period of 2022. The decrease was driven by lower management fees in both global platforms and strategic partnerships and despite a lower operating expense  which included reduced variable remuneration accruals. Slide 16 shows the net result over the first half year of 2023.Nonoperating items totaled a loss of €180 million  driven in equal parts by realized losses on investments and net impairments. Realized losses on investments were primarily recorded in the U.S. and stemmed from the sale of bonds in the context of the reinsurance  a part of this SGUL portfolio as well as to facilitate a reduction of short-term borrowings. Net impairments were driven by an increase of the expected credit loss balance in the U.S. due to an update of economic forecasts. Other charges amounted to €870 million. In the U.S.  other charges amounted to €574 million. These were driven by investments in the Life operating model and the restructuring of an earn-out agreement with the founding WFG [indiscernible]. It also included the impact of model and assumption updates in the U.S. These impacts were in line with what we had indicated at the recent Capital Markets Day.Other charges also included a €110 million charge related to the first half of 2023 results of Aegon The Netherlands  which was driven by an impairment as a result of the reclassification of these activities as held for sale. Another €110 million charge relates to a book loss on the remaining activities in Central and Eastern Europe following the completion of their disposal. I will now turn to Slide 17 to address the development of Aegon's Contractual Service Margin  or CSM  in the first half of the year 2023. New business CSM creation amounted to €0.2 billion  mainly driven by growth of the Individual Life portfolio in the U.S.  partly offset by the reinsurance of the U.K. protection book. The CSM release of €0.5 billion was mainly driven by the runoff of the Financial Assets in the U.S. and of the traditional book in the U.K. Negative claims and policyholder experience variance was driven by unfavorable experience in Individual Life and unfavorable lapse and utilization experience in variable annuities  both in the U.S. The main driver for the decrease of the CSM in the U.S. was the impact from assumption changes in the Americas  as was previously announced.This includes the removal of the morbidity improvement assumption and an increase in inflation assumptions in Long-Term Care  partly offset by the benefit of the expected premium rate increase program. In addition  the impact of investments we will make into a more customer-focused operating model for Life was reflected in the assumptions and reduced the CSM. Markets had a favorable impact on the CSM for products accounted for under the variable fee approach primarily variable annuities in the United States. At the end of the first half of the year 2023  the CSM stood at €8.3 billion. Let me now turn our view on capital on Slide 18. Operating capital generation before holding  funding and operating expenses increased by 13% compared with the first half of 2022.Earnings on In-force before holding expenses increased by 26% compared with the prior year period. Greece was driven by Transamerica and reflects improved claims experience and growth of our Strategic Assets. The increase in Earnings on In-force was partly offset by higher new business stream compared with the last year  mainly from growth in the U.S. This is in line with our ambition to drive profitable growth in our U.S. Strategic Assets. The release of required capital was broadly stable compared with the first half of 2022. In conclusion  we remain well on track to meet our guidance of at least €1 billion operating capital generation from the units in 2023. On Slide 19  I want to walk you through the development of the capital ratios of our main operating units.Compared with year-end 2022  the U.S. RBC ratio increased slightly to 427% above the operating level of 400%. Operating capital generation contributed favorably to the ratio  more than offsetting remittances to the holding. Market movements had a marginally positive impact with benefits from favorable equity markets being largely offset by fund basis risk. Onetime items had a negative impact. These were driven by the investments made in Strategic Assets and the annual model and assumption updates  which reduced the RBC ratio by 13 percentage points. We guided at the Capital Markets Day for a negative impact of in total around 20 percentage points on U.S. RBC ratio. We  therefore  expect to reflect the remaining negative impact of around 7 percentage points in the RBC ratio in the second half of this year.The impact of credit impairments and rating migrations on the RBC ratio remained negligible in the first half of the year. The solvency ratio of Scottish Equitable  our main legal entity in the U.K. decreased by 3 percentage points to 166%. This reflects the negative impact from market movements and remittance to the U.K. intermediate holding. This remittance was subsequently used in part to fund the acquisition of Nationwide's advisory business. Let me now turn the page for an update on our Financial Assets on Slide 20. Here  we summarize the continued value creation from our Financial Assets. In July  we reinsured 14 000 Universal Life policies with secondary guarantees  also known as SGUL policies  through a reinsurance transaction  reducing exposure to mortality risk.This has freed up $225 million of capital  which we will use to further reduce our exposure to Financial Assets  in line with our plan to expedite the runoff of these exposures. The benefit of the reinsurance will be recognized in 3Q 2023. Together with the prior reinsurance transaction undertaken  a total of 25% of the statutory reserves backing the SGUL portfolio has now been reinsured. In Long-Term Care  our primary management actions are rate increase programs. Since the start of the year  we have obtained regulatory approvals for additional rate increases worth USD 86 million. This represents 12% of the new target of $700 million worth of premium rate increases that we had announced at the Capital Markets Day. We will continue to work with state regulators to get pending and future actuarially justified rate increases approved.In the first half of 2023  we extended our track record of successfully hedging the targeted risks embedded in our variable annuity guarantees  achieving 98% hedge effectiveness. The capital employed in our Financial Assets was stable compared to the end of 2022 at $4.1 billion. During the first half of 2023  releases were realized on the Universal Life and fixed annuity blocks. These were offset by increases in required capital on variable annuities and the higher allocation of alternative assets to the LTC block. On Slide 21  you can see that cash capital at the Holding decreased to €1.3 billion during the period  which is still in the upper half of the operating range. Free cash flow for the period was in part offset by the impacts of the divestitures and acquisitions Lard talked about earlier.Cash outflows in the first half of 2023 were mostly related to capital returns to shareholders. We completed the €200 million share buyback program and returned a further €232 million to shareholders through the 2022 final dividend. Let me now turn the page for my concluding slide. In summary  we continue to deliver on our plans and the results over the first half of 2023 show that we continue to make good progress and that we are on track to achieve our 2025 financial targets. And with that final note  I now pass it back to you  Lars  for your concluding remarks.Lard Friese: Thank you  Matt. Let me summarize today's presentation with the final Slide #24. Aegon has entered the next chapter of its transformation from a position of strength. We have concrete ambitions and plans to move forward with our strategy as we presented at the Capital Markets Day in June. Operating capital generation growth was strong in the first half of 2023. Commercial momentum remained strong in our U.S. Strategic Assets  in our U.K. Workplace activities and in our International growth markets. More work needs to be done on Asset Management and our U.K. Retail business. We will address our ambitions here with you in 2024. The next important milestone will be the Extraordinary General Meetings in September to receive shareholder approval for the transfer of our legal seat to Bermuda.We are convinced that the proposed move is in the interest of shareholders and provide stability for the group to continue to execute upon its announced strategy. If you have any questions on this process  we have published detailed documents on our corporate website. Feel free to reach out to the IR team if any questions remain. I want to be clear that the redomiciliation process will not distract us from what is most important: accelerating the execution of our strategy  driving growth and creating value by reallocating capital from Financial Assets to Strategic Assets. Let me conclude by reiterating my confidence that we will deliver on our strategic commitments and financial targets.

29186,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.cityam.com/were-getting-there-but-theres-a-long-road-ahead-towards-full-bitcoin-acceptance/,We’re getting there  but there’s a long road ahead towards full Bitcoin acceptance,Jason Deane reflects over a spell in Bali where  despite his best efforts  the notion of Bitcoin was only tentatively welcomed.,We’re getting there  but there’s a long road ahead towards full Bitcoin acceptanceThe week in Reviewwith Jason DeaneWell  it’s been a fabulous few weeks exploring Thailand and Indonesia with my family  but I’m now 48 hours back into the grind and  like always  it feels like I’ve never been away. I’m sure you know what I mean.Being a Bitcoiner it’s impossible to resist checking out a new place to see what the view on Bitcoin is by asking locals and having a nose around. I have to report that  on the surface  there seems little more than general awareness and the only Bitcoin transaction I actually did was a lightning transaction for a taxi driver I’d managed to orange-pill on a long journey. Even then  he only wanted his tip in Bitcoin  and not the main fare which he still wanted as cash. A rather luke-warm success in my view.That said  I did pass a Bitcoin shop near Umalas and managed to grab this awkward photo from my hired motorbike (bikes rule the roads in Bali – although it’s not for the faint hearted) as I went past with my daughter hanging on for dear life on the back. I was also made aware of a Bitcoin meetup in Canggu this very Sunday  if you’re lucky enough to be in the area.However  like everywhere else  there’s more work to do and it serves as a reminder of just how young this amazing movement still is and what challenges lay ahead.But  even though it feels like the ‘crypto winter’ is never ending and we’re getting nowhere  nothing could actually be further from the truth. Many stories caught my eye this week  some of them directly positive  some of them apparently negative until you take a moment to extrapolate where they may go.A great example of the latter was this emotion fuelled video that went full-metal-viral over the last few days. There’s no direct mention of Bitcoin  but it’s clear this resonated with so many people who are all asking the right questions about the state our current fiat system and why it’s failing them. We know from our own experience that those who do the research will end up where we are now. If you can  help them. Even better  if they’re in the UK  send them here for easy-start advice  learning materials and a safe place to ask all the questions we all have when we first discover Bitcoin.At the other end of the scale  while the SEC continues to drag its feet over a spot ETF  another one was launched in Europe  this time by Jacobi and listed on Euronext Amsterdam. This is not the first  despite a lot of coverage claiming to be the case  but it adds more and more access to institutions whose interest continues to grow.At the same time  despite falling Bitcoin prices  miners continue to deploy with extreme prejudice  signalling utter confidence in the future. The next difficulty adjustment is scheduled to be at least another 6% upwards on Tuesday. And Daniel Batten’s continued work on grid balancing by Bitcoin miners continues to dispel the mainstream media narrative.And yet prices are falling. Why? Well  I think I’ll hand over to Noelle Acheson to take you through her superb analysis rather than explain it here. You’ll need your macroeconomic hat on  mind  but persevere  it’s a fascinating viewpoint. Bottom line: it’s pretty grim out there. You better believe you’ll need your Bitcoin.Finally  I’m heading off shortly for an afternoon’s testing of my new racing car at Brands Hatch where the Bitcoin Racing team will be out in force  with no less than five fully branded cars in the Nankang CityCar Cup Challenge  including yours truly. Also  our utterly crazy 600 Bhp V8 BMW will be sporting the Bitcoin logo at considerably higher speeds in two races on Sunday. It’s a great line up and if you fancy coming along (shout me if you are!) go here for the details!Whatever you do though  have a great weekend!Need a little help with Bitcoin?
