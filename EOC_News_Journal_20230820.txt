In particular  the opportunity to raise capital through a quick admissions process on the Euronext Growth and subsequently uplist to a larger exchange is attractive to many industry players.“Bermuda has long been the jurisdiction of choice for companies in the shipping and drilling sectors. In fact  its appeal has been such that Bermuda companies comprise a surprising 36 per cent of the Oslo Børs Shipping Index  second only to Norwegian companies. This speaks to the historic ties between the two seafaring nations and Bermuda’s reputation as a well-established offshore international finance centre.“Further  companies beyond the core shipping and drilling sectors have been using Bermuda vehicles for some time to access high-quality capital efficiently. Those in the technology and real estate industries are finding Bermuda to be an ideal jurisdiction for Norwegian market activities – with renewables and alternative energy looking to follow suit.“The advantages of Bermuda include a robust regulatory framework that protects investor and creditor rights as well as a tax-neutral  business-friendly environment. Additionally  Bermuda is now among the few jurisdictions where companies can be seen as compliant with recent changes to the Norwegian Central Securities Depository Act (which incorporated into Norwegian law the European Union’s Central Securities Depository Regulation  or CSDR).”,positive,0.7,0.29,0.01,positive,0.56,0.42,0.02,True,English,"['Norway exchange listing', 'Bermuda domicile', 'Norwegian Central Securities Depository Act', 'The Oslo Børs Exchange', 'Oslo Børs Shipping Index', 'Central Securities Depository Regulation', 'Central Securities Depositories Regulation', 'offshore international finance centre', 'Seacrest Petroleo Bermuda Limited', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Oslo Stock Exchange', 'international law firm', 'quick admissions process', 'many industry players', 'surprising 36 per cent', 'two seafaring nations', 'real estate industries', 'robust regulatory framework', 'tax-neutral, business-friendly environment', 'three Oslo exchanges', 'Euronext Expand Oslo', 'Norwegian stock exchanges', 'three Norwegian exchanges', 'Euronext Growth Oslo', 'Norwegian market activities', 'Bermuda corporate practice', 'Cool Company Ltd', 'Himalaya Shipping Ltd', 'Conyers’ Norway Bulletin', 'Norwegian law', 'larger exchange', 'new listings', 'market capitalisation', 'core shipping', 'Norwegian companies', 'Marcello Ausenda', 'Guy Cooper', 'growing number', 'content platform', 'JD Supra', 'strong 2022 performance', 'core sectors', 'Shelf Drilling', 'North Sea', 'European Union', 'attractive domicile', 'first instance', 'second instance', 'primary listing', 'secondary listing', 'potential path', 'drilling sectors', 'historic ties', 'alternative energy', 'creditor rights', 'recent changes', 'Conyers directors', 'Conyers.bm', 'Bermuda vehicles', 'past year', 'recent examples', '$45 million IPO', 'ideal jurisdiction', 'Bermuda-incorporated companies', 'high-quality capital', 'Bermuda companies', 'Prev', 'head', 'Photograph', 'years', 'article', 'oil', 'gas', 'presence', 'April', 'jurisdictions', 'status', 'authors', 'update', 'route', 'NYSE', 'March', 'opportunity', 'choice', 'fact', 'appeal', 'reputation', 'time', 'technology', 'renewables', 'suit', 'advantages', 'investor', 'CSDR']",2023-08-20,2023-08-20,royalgazette.com

Regular air strikes by Russia on Ukrainian grain since mid-July  when it pulled out of the UN-backed deal for Ukraine to export grain  and strikes by Kyiv on Russian targets  including along the Black Sea  have kept participants wary about disruption to exports. However  large harvest supplies and brisk shipments from Russia have kept a lid on prices. Traders were also monitoring efforts to maintain Ukrainian exports via European Union countries.

Farmers completed winter barley and durum wheat harvesting in July.For grain maize  harvested later in the year  84% of crops were rated in good or excellent condition. That was down slightly from 85% the previous week but well above a 50% score a year ago when maize was affected by severe drought.Rain and mild temperatures in the past month have helped maize plants  though hot weather that has spread across France this week could strain some crops.,neutral,0.04,0.55,0.41,mixed,0.24,0.24,0.52,True,English,"['EU wheat', 'war risks', 'focus', 'two Russian war ships', 'Russian Black Sea port', 'Russian defence ministry', 'European Union countries', 'warm, dry spell', 'war) uncertainty people', 'large harvest supplies', 'soft wheat harvesting', 'past five years', 'durum wheat harvesting', 'Regular air strikes', 'recent rain delays', 'spring barley harvest', 'one futures dealer', 'soft wheat crop', 'Russian officials', 'Russian targets', 'Ukraine-Russia war', 'November futures', 'winter barley', 'December wheat', 'Chicago wheat', 'wheat quality', 'Euronext wheat', 'active position', 'US trading', 'easing dollar', 'Ukrainian drone', 'central Moscow', 'Ukrainian attack', 'unmanned boat', 'UN-backed deal', 'brisk shipments', 'farm office', 'clearer picture', 'northern Europe', 'heavy rain', 'past month', 'two-week high', 'weather concerns', 'US soybeans', 'broader strength', 'oilseed markets', 'field work', 'milling quality', 'rapid pace', 'cereal report', 'excellent condition', 'severe drought', 'mild temperatures', 'hot weather', 'same week', 'previous week', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'Ukrainian grain', 'northern France', 'maize plants', 'short positions', 'Ukrainian exports', 'French farmers', 'grain maize', 'last year', 'Friday', 'headlines', 'participants', 'weekend', 'dealers', '242.25 euros', 'ton', '1537 GMT', 'Thursday', '237.00 euros', 'building', 'Crimea', 'chatter', 'fire', 'Novorossiysk', 'incident', 'mid-July', 'Kyiv', 'disruption', 'lid', 'prices', 'Traders', 'efforts', 'Aug.', 'data', 'FranceAgriMer', '476.25 euros', 'onset', 'completion', 'crops', 'good', '50% score', '89', '96']",2023-08-20,2023-08-20,brecorder.com
