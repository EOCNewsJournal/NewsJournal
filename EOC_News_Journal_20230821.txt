The main benefit is having a freely tradeable security with a US ticker symbol and a USD share quote that will enable the Akobo share to become available to all US investors through their broker of choice. Over 12 000 US and global securities are already trading on the OTC Markets platform  including mining companies like Lundin Mining and Endeavour Mining (in addition to some of the largest and most well-known brands such as Adidas  Heineken  Roche  BNP Paribas and Hugo Boss).A second benefit  as Akobo Minerals is already listed on the Euronext exchange in Oslo and qualifies to trade on the OTC QX Best Market  is that the listing process of securing an OTC cross-trade in the US is simplified without having to do any additional US regulatory or legal work.Jørgen Evjen  CEO of Akobo Minerals  said: “As the company moves towards gold production from our boutique mine in Ethiopia  we want to ensure that new investors have greater access to trading of our shares. An OTC cross-trade in the US  to supplement our European listing on the Oslo and Frankfurt exchanges  will achieve this.”Evjen added: “We have seen that there is high interest from investors in mining shares in the US  and I am sure that Akobo Minerals can capitalise on this as we expand our operations in Ethiopia.- Ends -For more information  contact:Jørgen Evjen  CEO  Akobo MineralsMob: (+47) 92 80 40 14Mail: jorgen@akobominerals.comLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/akobomineralsWeb: www.akobominerals.comAbout Akobo MineralsAkobo Minerals is a Scandinavian-based gold exploration and boutique mining company  currently holding an exploration license covering 182 km2 and with an ongoing mine development in the Gambela region and Dima Woreda  Ethiopia.
