(the “Heights Financing” and together with the Kreos / Claret Financing  the “Transaction”).Marc de Garidel  Chief Executive Officer of Abivax  said: “We believe that the strength of the data we have generated in our Phase 2 clinical trials uniquely position obefazimod as a potential leader for treating moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (“UC”). The entire Abivax team is committed to bringing obefazimod to the market for the benefit of the many UC patients in need of safe and long-term efficient treatment options. We believe this additional capital will allow us to pursue that mission with an even more intense focus.”Didier Blondel  Chief Financial Officer of Abivax  added: “We welcome the support of Kreos  Claret and Heights who are committed to helping us deliver meaningful therapies to as many people as possible suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases. Access to this additional capital strengthens our financial position and further supports our strategic priority to complete our global Phase 3 clinical trials of obefazimod for the treatment of moderately to severely active UC. It provides us with increased flexibility for our future funding strategy  which remains centered on potentially accessing the broader capital markets. Based on our current assumptions and the EUR 27M to be received at drawdown of the first tranches  we expect our cash runway to extend until the end of Q2 2024.”Overall Structure of the TransactionThe first tranches of the Kreos / Claret Financing and the Heights Financing  for EUR 25 000 000 and EUR 35 000 000  respectively  are expected to be drawn on or around August 22  2023  and August 24  2023  respectively  subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. In addition  the Company expects to concurrently grant to Kreos Capital and Claret European Growth Capital  for no additional consideration  warrants exercisable to receive to EUR 4 000 000 worth of Ordinary Shares. The subsequent tranches of the Kreos / Claret Financing and the Heights Financing are subject to certain conditions  as further set forth below.As part of the Transaction  Abivax is also repaying in full a total outstanding amount of EUR 32 762 852 under (i) the pre-existing debt agreements with Kreos for a total amount of EUR 7 660 993  and (ii) the pre-existing OCEANE bonds for a total amount of EUR 25 101 859 by way of set-off with the Heights Financing  thereby fully repaying such pre-existing indebtedness.After giving effect to the repayment of EUR 32 762 852 of existing indebtedness  the net proceeds to Abivax from the first tranches of the Kreos / Claret Financing and the Heights Financing (once drawn on) are expected to be EUR 27 237 148 in total  consisting of EUR 17 339 007 from the Kreos / Claret Financing and EUR 9 898 141 from the Heights Financing.The maximum proceeds from the Transaction (if all the tranches described below were drawn on)  net of the refinancing of the existing indebtedness  are expected to be EUR 117 237 148 in total  consisting of EUR 67 339 007 for the Kreos / Claret Financing and EUR 49 898 141 for the Heights Financing.Overall Structure of the Kreos / Claret FinancingThe Kreos / Claret Financing consists of three tranches of EUR 25 000 000 each in aggregate principal amount. The first tranche in aggregate principal amount of EUR 25 000 000 takes the form of senior secured convertible bonds with warrants attached (the “Kreos / Claret OCABSA”) and is expected to be drawn on or around August 22  2023  subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.The second tranche in aggregate principal amount of EUR 25 000 000 takes the form of senior secured non-convertible bonds and may be drawn before March 31  2024  subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The drawdown of the second tranche is subject to a maximum 10% Debt-To-Market Capitalization Ratio at the time of drawdown. The “Debt-To-Market Capitalization Ratio” is calculated  on any relevant date  by dividing (i) the indebtedness of Abivax (including amounts due under the Kreos / Claret Financing but excluding amounts due under the Heights Financing)  by (ii) the market capitalization of Abivax calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares by the closing price of the Ordinary Shares on such relevant date (“Market Capitalization”).The third tranche in aggregate principal amount of EUR 25 000 000 takes the form of senior secured non-convertible bonds and may be drawn before July 31  2024  subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The drawdown of the third tranche is subject to a maximum 10% Debt-To-Market Capitalization Ratio at the time of drawdown (excluding the Heights Financing) and is conditional on Abivax raising a minimum of USD 125 000 000 in gross proceeds through a listing on Nasdaq before June 30  2024.The Kreos / Claret Financing provides for certain restrictive covenants (subject to customary exceptions) which include  among other things  restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness  cross-default  the distribution of dividends and the grant of security interests. As security for the Kreos / Claret Financing  the lenders benefit from the grant of first-ranking collateral on Abivax’s principal tangible and intangible assets  including pledges over Abivax’s business (fonds de commerce) as a going concern and intellectual property rights in Abivax's lead drug candidate  as well as pledges over Abivax’s bank accounts and receivables. Such securities apply to all tranches of the Kreos / Claret Financing.As part of the Kreos / Claret Financing  both Kreos Capital and Claret European Growth Capital may receive  in addition to the Kreos / Claret OCABSA  warrants exercisable to receive Ordinary Shares valued at up to EUR 8 000 000 (in two tranches  the first – representing EUR 4 000 000 worth of Ordinary Shares – to be fully issued upon execution of the legal documentation and exercisable immediately  and the second – representing EUR 4 000 000 worth of Ordinary Shares – may be issued within 14 days of the date on which the conditions to draw the third tranche of non-convertible bonds of the Kreos / Claret Financing have been met  as described below).The convertible bonds  the non-convertible bonds and the warrants of the Kreos / Claret Financing will not be listed on any market. The agreements relating to the Kreos / Claret Financing are governed by French law.On the date hereof  funds managed by Claret European Growth Capital do not hold any Ordinary Shares in Abivax and funds managed by Kreos Capital hold 99 583 Ordinary Shares in Abivax (representing approximately 0.23% of the share capital of the Company on the basis of 42 547 568 Ordinary Shares composing the share capital of the Company on July 31  2023).Overall Structure of the Heights FinancingThe EUR 75 000 000 Heights Financing consists of two tranches – aggregate principal amount of EUR 35 000 000 amortizing senior convertible notes and aggregate principal amount of EUR 40 000 000 amortizing senior convertible notes (collectively  the “Heights Convertible Notes”).The first tranche in aggregate principal amount of EUR 35 000 000 is expected to be drawn on or around August 24  2023  subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.The second tranche in aggregate principal amount of up to EUR 40 000 000 may be drawn during the period from the date immediately following the three (3) month anniversary of the issuance of the first tranche to the first-year anniversary of the issuance of the first tranche. It may be drawn in up to two separate closings to provide Abivax with additional flexibility to request a partial drawdown. The amount available for drawdown under the second tranche will be determined based on Abivax’s Market Capitalization (based on seven (7) of the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding such drawdown) and the average daily valued traded of Ordinary Shares (“ADVT”) over the three (3) month period preceding the drawdown  as further detailed below.The Heights Financing is a senior  unsecured financing. The convertible bonds of the Heights Financing will not be listed on any market. The agreements relating to the Heights Financing are governed by French law.On the date hereof  funds managed by Heights Capital Management  Inc. do not hold any Ordinary Shares.Use of Proceeds and Cash RunwayThe proceeds of the drawdown of the first tranche of the Kreos / Claret Financing and of the Heights Financing which  net of the refinancing of the existing indebtedness  amount to EUR 27 237 148 in the aggregate  are expected to be allocated mainly to the development of obefazimod for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active UC and other potential chronic inflammatory indications  as well for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company.Following the arrival of its new CEO  Mr. Marc de Garidel  in May 2023  the Company is preparing for a more ambitious strategy  notably in order to further develop obefazimod  which is likely to require additional investment in comparison to the Company’s former plans. Based on the Company’s current assumptions and the net proceeds expected to be received from the drawdown of the first tranches of the Transaction  the Company expects its cash runway to extend until the end of Q2 2024.Detailed Characteristics of the Kreos / Claret FinancingMain characteristics of the Kreos / Claret OCABSA (First Tranche)The first tranche of the Kreos / Claret Financing consists of 25 000 000 convertible bonds with a par value of EUR 1.00 each and a fixed conversion price of EUR 21.2209. A warrant to subscribe or acquire new Ordinary Shares under certain conditions is attached to each Kreos / Claret convertible bond.Interest on the Kreos / Claret OCABSA accrues at a 9.00% annual fixed interest rate  payable in quarterly installments. The Kreos / Claret OCBSA’s maturity date is March 31  2027  it being specified that the scheduled date of final repayment is January 1  2027.The Kreos / Claret OCABSA are convertible into Ordinary Shares at any time from their issuance at the request of the holders at a fixed conversion price of EUR 21.2209 (corresponding to a 25% premium over the 15-day volume weighted average share price of Abivax (the “15-day VWAP”) prior to the date on which their issuance is decided)  subject to standard adjustments  including anti-dilution and dividend protections.The warrants included in the Kreos / Claret OCABSA will only become exercisable in case of prepayment in cash of the Kreos / Claret convertible bonds by Abivax. Upon exercise of the warrants  their holders will be able to subscribe to the same number of Ordinary Shares (and at the same price conditions) as they would have been able to subscribe had they converted the Kreos / Claret OCABSA which have been prepaid in cash. Any warrants not exercised on or prior to January 1  2027  will become automatically null and void. For the avoidance of doubt  if Abivax does not prepay any Kreos / Claret OCABSA in cash prior to their scheduled repayment dates  none of the warrants will be exercisable.A shareholder holding 1% of the share capital of the Company before the issuance of the Kreos / Claret OCABSA would hold 0.97% of the share capital in case of conversion of all of the Kreos / Claret OCABSA into Ordinary Shares (on the basis of 42 547 568 Ordinary Shares composing the share capital of the Company on July 31  2023 and an assumed conversion price of EUR 21.2209).Abivax is allowed to pre-pay the amounts due under the Kreos / Claret OCABSA at any time. In such case  Abivax will be required to pay a sum equal to (i) the principal outstanding at the time of the pre-payment (plus accrued interests)  plus (ii) an aggregate of all remaining interest payments that would have been paid throughout the remainder of the term of the tranche  discounted to present value by applying a discount rate of 4%  plus (iii) an end-of-loan exit fee equal to 8.0% of the amounts drawn thereunder. In case of prepayment  the holders of the Kreos / Claret OCABSA will have the option to request a conversion of their Kreos / Claret OCABSA instead of a cash repayment  in which case  the end-of-loan exit fee is not payable by Abivax.Main characteristics of the Kreos / Claret Non-Convertible Bonds (Second and Third Tranches)The second and third tranches of the Kreos / Claret Financing are composed of a total of 50 000 000 amortized non-convertible bonds with a par value of EUR 1.00 each  divided into two tranches of EUR 25 000 000 each.The second tranche in aggregate principal amount of EUR 25 000 000 may be drawn before the end of March 2024. The drawdown of the second tranche is subject to a maximum 10% Debt-To-Market Capitalization Ratio at the time of drawdown (excluding the Heights Financing).The third tranche in aggregate principal amount of EUR 25 000 000 may be drawn before the end of July 2024. The drawdown of the third tranche is subject to a maximum 10% Debt-To-Market Capitalization Ratio at the time of drawdown (excluding the Heights Financing) and is conditional on Abivax raising a minimum of USD 125 000 000 in gross proceeds through a listing on Nasdaq before June 30  2024.A variable interest rate of 7.5% + European Central Bank Base Rate (MRO) (with a floor at 2.5% and a cap at 4%) applies to each tranche. These two tranches will be repaid monthly through March 31  2027  after a deferred repayment of the principal (i) until October 1  2024  for the second tranche  or February 1  2025  if the conditions to draw the third tranche are met  and (ii) until February 1  2025  for the third tranche.Abivax is allowed to pre-pay the amounts due under the second and third tranches of the Kreos / Claret Financing any time. In such case  Abivax will be required to pay a sum equal to (i) the principal outstanding at the time of the pre-payment (plus accrued interests)  plus (ii) an aggregate of all remaining interest payments that would have been paid throughout the remainder of the term of the applicable tranche  discounted to present value by applying a discount rate of 4%  plus (iii) an end-of-loan exit fee equal to 6.0% of the amounts drawn under the applicable tranche.Main characteristics of the Kreos / Claret WarrantsAs part of the Kreos / Claret Financing  Abivax has issued warrants to both Kreos Capital and Claret European Growth Capital for a global subscription price of EUR 1.00  giving them the right to subscribe to up to 214 198 new Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of EUR 18.6744 (corresponding to a 10% premium over the 15-day VWAP prior to the date on which their issuance is decided).If the conditions for the drawdown of the third tranche of the Kreos / Claret Financing are met  Abivax will issue additional warrants to Kreos Capital and Claret European Growth Capital for a global subscription price of EUR 1.00 unless the third tranche is expressly declined by Abivax within 14 days. The exercise price of the additional warrants to be issued will be equal to 110% of the 15-day VWAP prior to the date on which their issuance is decided. The number of warrants to be issued will be calculated by dividing EUR 4 000 000 by the aforementioned exercise price. Of these additional warrants  50% will be exercisable upon issuance and the remaining 50% shall only be exercisable if the third tranche of the Kreos / Claret Financing is drawn by Abivax.The Kreos / Claret warrants can be exercised over a period of 7 years from their issuance date or up until the date of the successful closing of a tender offer for the Ordinary Shares  whichever is earlier. At the time of exercise of the Kreos / Claret warrants  the holders of the warrants are eligible to sell part of their warrants to Abivax in accordance with a put option agreement to allow for a cashless exercise.A shareholder holding 1% of the share capital of Abivax before the issuance of the Kreos / Claret warrants would hold 0.995% of the share capital after exercise of the warrants (on the basis of 42 547 568 Ordinary Shares composing the share capital of the Company on July 31  2023  and an assumed exercise price of EUR 18.6744 for all warrants).Detailed Characteristics of the Heights FinancingMain characteristics of the Heights Convertible Notes (First Tranche)The first tranche of the Heights Financing is composed of 350 amortizing senior convertible notes with a nominal value of EUR 100 000 each and a fixed conversion price of EUR 23.7674 (corresponding to a 40% premium over the 15-day VWAP prior to the date on which their issuance is decided).The Heights Convertible Notes are convertible into Ordinary Shares at any time from their issuance at the request of the holder at a fixed conversion price set at EUR 23.7674  subject to standard adjustments  including anti-dilution and dividend protections.Interest on the Heights Convertible Notes accrues at a 6.00% annual fixed interest rate payable in quarterly installments in cash or  at the option of Abivax  in Ordinary Shares.The Heights Convertible Notes will be repaid through sixteen quarterly installment payments  beginning three months after their issuance date (corresponding  for the first tranche  to a final repayment date on August 24  2027). Installments are payable in cash or  at the option of Abivax  in Ordinary Shares.Any interest or installment payments in shares will be made on the basis of a share price equal to 90% of the Market Price of the Ordinary Shares at the time of payment  where “Market Price” refers to the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) for the Ordinary Shares on the two (2) days with the lowest daily VWAPs out of the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the applicable date  but in no event greater than the VWAP of the Ordinary Shares on the applicable date. The Market Price may not be higher than the applicable conversion price. Issuances of Ordinary Shares may not be made at a price lower than a 15% discount to the 15-day VWAP at the time of the decision to issue the Heights Convertible Notes (i.e.  EUR 14.4303 per Ordinary Share  the “Price Limit”).Upon the occurrence of certain events (including a change of control of the Company  a free float event or a delisting of the Ordinary Shares on Euronext Paris)  any noteholder will have the option to require Abivax to redeem all  but not in part  of its Heights Convertible Notes at par plus accrued but unpaid interests. In the event that the Ordinary Shares are targeted by a public offer (in cash or in securities  in cash and securities  etc.) which may result in a change of control or filed following a change of control  upon conversion of the Heights Convertible Notes  Abivax shall (i) deliver new Ordinary Shares at the conversion price and (ii) pay a cash amount equal to the sum of the remaining coupons scheduled until the maturity date  and any accrued interest.The terms and conditions of the Heights Convertible Notes include a standard negative pledge providing that any security granted in favor of other borrowed debt or debt instruments should also be granted in favor of the Heights Convertible Notes on an equal basis (with the exception of the securities issued pursuant to the Kreos / Claret Financing  as detailed herein).A shareholder holding 1% of the share capital of Abivax before the issuance of the first tranche of Heights Convertible Notes would hold 0.96% of the share capital after conversion of such Heights Convertible Notes at the request of the holders (on the basis of 42 547 568 Ordinary Shares composing the share capital of the Company on July 31  2023 and an assumed conversion price of EUR 23.7674).To the extent Abivax exercises its option for the repayment in shares of all or part of the principal or interests due under the Heights Convertible Notes  up to 2 830 201 new Ordinary Shares could be issued  representing 6.65% of Abivax’s current share capital (on the basis of 42 547 568 Ordinary Shares composing the share capital of the Company on July 31  2023 and an assumed conversion price equal to the Price Limit of EUR 14.4303 per Ordinary Share).Main characteristics of the Heights Convertible Notes (Second Tranche)The second tranche of the Heights Financing is composed of up to 400 amortizing senior convertible notes with a nominal value of EUR 100 000 each  to be fully drawn after the three (3) month anniversary of the issuance of the first tranche and before the first-year anniversary of the issuance of the first tranche  i.e.  by August 24  2024 at the latest  in up to two separate closings to provide Abivax with additional flexibility to request a partial drawdown.The amount available for drawdown under the second tranche will be determined based on Abivax’s Market Capitalization (based on seven (7) of the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding such drawdown) (“Average Market Capitalization”) and the ADVT of Ordinary Shares over the three (3) month period preceding the drawdown  as follows:If the Average Market Capitalization is… … and the ADVT is… … then the Maximum Cumulated Amount Outstanding under both First and Second Tranches of the Heights Financing is equal to: At least €700 000 000 At least €900 000 €45 000 000 At least €850 000 000 At least €1 250 000 €55 000 000 At least €1 000 000 000 At least €1 500 000 €65 000 000The conversion price of the second tranche of the Heights Convertible Notes (if any) will be equal to 130% of the 15-day VWAP immediately preceding the date on which their issuance will be decided.Except as set forth above  the second tranche of the Heights Convertible Notes will have similar characteristics to the first tranche of the Heights Convertible Notes.Legal Framework of the IssuanceThe Transaction has been approved by the Abivax Board of Directors  which met on August 16  2023 and delegated its powers to the CEO to set the definitive terms of the Transaction and decide the issuance of the securities described above  in accordance with (i) the delegation of competence conferred by the 16th resolution of the combined annual and extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of June 5  2023  relating to a share capital increase or a securities issue with cancellation of preferred subscription rights to a certain category of beneficiaries pursuant to Article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code  and (ii) the provisions of Articles L. 22-10-49 and L. 228-40 of the French Commercial code.

(Nasdaq: EXEL) and Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) today announced that the global phase 3 CONTACT-02 pivotal trial met one of two primary endpoints  demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) at the primary analysis. CONTACT-02 is evaluating cabozantinib (CABOMETYX®) in combination with atezolizumab compared with a second novel hormonal therapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and measurable soft tissue disease who have been previously treated with one novel hormonal therapy. At a prespecified interim analysis for the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) that occurred at the same time as the primary analysis of PFS  a trend toward improvement of OS was observed; however  the data were immature and did not meet the threshold for statistical significance. Therefore  the trial will continue to the next analysis of OS as planned.The safety profile of the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab was consistent with the known safety profiles for each single medicine  and no new safety signals were identified with the combination.“These positive findings from CONTACT-02 are highly encouraging given the need for additional  non-cytotoxic or non-chemotherapeutic treatment options for this patient population ” said Neeraj Agarwal  M.D.  FASCO  Professor and Presidential Endowed Chair of Cancer Research at Huntsman Cancer Institute  University of Utah and the global lead investigator of the trial. “Cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab represents a potential new treatment modality for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer  and we look forward to sharing the full data at a future medical meeting.”“Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer face a poor prognosis of less than two years  and many who progress on a novel hormonal therapy are seeking alternative treatment options to chemotherapy ” said Vicki L. Goodman  M.D.  Executive Vice President  Product Development & Medical Affairs  and Chief Medical Officer  Exelixis. “We are pleased to report positive findings from the CONTACT-02 trial  in which cabozantinib in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor has demonstrated an efficacy benefit in another tumor type with significant unmet need. We look forward to discussing these findings with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and to presenting further details at an upcoming medical meeting.”“With prostate cancer confirmed as the second most commonly occurring cancer in men globally  the need for innovative new therapies is extensive  especially for those whose cancer has progressed to the metastatic castration-resistant form ” said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development at Ipsen. “These results represent the first positive phase 3 data of its kind for a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and immunotherapy combination in this indication. We will engage with regulatory authorities on these data and look forward to further exploring the potential treatment benefit for a patient population at such a challenging stage of disease.”About CONTACT-02CONTACT-02 is a global  multicenter  randomized  phase 3  open-label study that enrolled 575 patients who were randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab and the control arm of a second novel hormonal therapy (either abiraterone and prednisone or enzalutamide). The study included patients with mCRPC who have measurable visceral disease or measurable extrapelvic adenopathy who have been previously treated with one novel hormonal therapy. The two primary endpoints of the trial are PFS and OS. The secondary endpoint is objective response rate. The trial is sponsored by Exelixis and co-funded by Ipsen  Roche and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda). Takeda is conducting the trial in Japan. More information about CONTACT-02 is available at ClinicalTrials.gov .About CRPCProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men and the fourth most common cancer overall globally.1 In 2020  there were more than 1.4 million new cases of prostate cancer and about 375 300 deaths worldwide.1 Prostate cancer is considered mCRPC when it has spread beyond the prostate and does not respond to androgen-suppression therapies  a common treatment for prostate cancer.2 Men diagnosed with mCRPC often have a poor prognosis  with an estimated survival of 1-2 years.3About CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib)In the U.S.  CABOMETYX tablets are approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC); for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib; for patients with advanced RCC as a first-line treatment in combination with nivolumab; and for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) that has progressed following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible. CABOMETYX tablets have also received regulatory approvals in over 60 countries outside the U.S. and Japan  including the European Union. In 2016  Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib outside of the U.S. and Japan. In 2017  Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize cabozantinib in the U.S.CABOMETYX in combination with atezolizumab is not indicated as a treatment for mCRPC.U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSHemorrhage: Severe and fatal hemorrhages occurred with CABOMETYX. The incidence of Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhagic events was 5% in CABOMETYX patients in RCC  HCC  and DTC studies. Discontinue CABOMETYX for Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage and prior to surgery as recommended. Do not administer CABOMETYX to patients who have a recent history of hemorrhage  including hemoptysis  hematemesis  or melena.Perforations and Fistulas: Fistulas  including fatal cases  occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX patients. Gastrointestinal (GI) perforations  including fatal cases  occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of fistulas and perforations  including abscess and sepsis. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who experience a Grade 4 fistula or a GI perforation.Thrombotic Events: CABOMETYX increased the risk of thrombotic events. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 7% (including 4% pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolism in 2% of CABOMETYX patients. Fatal thrombotic events occurred in CABOMETYX patients. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or serious arterial or venous thromboembolic events that require medical intervention.Hypertension and Hypertensive Crisis: CABOMETYX can cause hypertension  including hypertensive crisis. Hypertension was reported in 37% (16% Grade 3 and <1% Grade 4) of CABOMETYX patients. Do not initiate CABOMETYX in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Monitor blood pressure regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. Withhold CABOMETYX for hypertension that is not adequately controlled with medical management; when controlled  resume at a reduced dose. Permanently discontinue CABOMETYX for severe hypertension that cannot be controlled with anti-hypertensive therapy or for hypertensive crisis.Diarrhea: Diarrhea occurred in 62% of CABOMETYX patients. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 10% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor and manage patients using antidiarrheals as indicated. Withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to ≤ Grade 1  resume at a reduced dose.Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (PPE): PPE occurred in 45% of CABOMETYX patients. Grade 3 PPE occurred in 13% of CABOMETYX patients. Withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to Grade 1 and resume at a reduced dose for intolerable Grade 2 PPE or Grade 3 PPE.Hepatotoxicity: CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to CABOMETYX alone. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes than when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes  interrupt CABOMETYX and nivolumab and consider administering corticosteroids.With the combination of CABOMETYX and nivolumab  Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients. ALT or AST >3 times ULN (Grade ≥2) was reported in 83 patients  of whom 23 (28%) received systemic corticosteroids; ALT or AST resolved to Grades 0-1 in 74 (89%). Among the 44 patients with Grade ≥2 increased ALT or AST who were rechallenged with either CABOMETYX (n=9) or nivolumab (n=11) as a single agent or with both (n=24)  recurrence of Grade ≥2 increased ALT or AST was observed in 2 patients receiving CABOMETYX  2 patients receiving nivolumab  and 7 patients receiving both CABOMETYX and nivolumab. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose based on severity.Adrenal Insufficiency: CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency  initiate symptomatic treatment  including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold CABOMETYX and/or nivolumab and resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose depending on severity.Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 4.7% (15/320) of patients with RCC who received CABOMETYX with nivolumab  including Grade 3 (2.2%)  and Grade 2 (1.9%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of CABOMETYX and nivolumab in 0.9% and withholding of CABOMETYX and nivolumab in 2.8% of patients with RCC.Approximately 80% (12/15) of patients with adrenal insufficiency received hormone replacement therapy  including systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 27% (n=4) of the 15 patients. Of the 9 patients in whom CABOMETYX with nivolumab was withheld for adrenal insufficiency  6 reinstated treatment after symptom improvement; of these  all (n=6) received hormone replacement therapy and 2 had recurrence of adrenal insufficiency.Proteinuria: Proteinuria was observed in 8% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor urine protein regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. For Grade 2 or 3 proteinuria  withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to ≤ Grade 1 proteinuria  resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome.Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ): ONJ occurred in <1% of CABOMETYX patients. ONJ can manifest as jaw pain  osteomyelitis  osteitis  bone erosion  tooth or periodontal infection  toothache  gingival ulceration or erosion  persistent jaw pain  or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery. Perform an oral examination prior to CABOMETYX initiation and periodically during treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices. Withhold CABOMETYX for at least 3 weeks prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures  if possible. Withhold CABOMETYX for development of ONJ until complete resolution  resume at a reduced dose.Impaired Wound Healing: Wound complications occurred with CABOMETYX. Withhold CABOMETYX for at least 3 weeks prior to elective surgery. Do not administer CABOMETYX for at least 2 weeks after major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of CABOMETYX after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): RPLS  a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by characteristic findings on MRI  can occur with CABOMETYX. Evaluate for RPLS in patients presenting with seizures  headache  visual disturbances  confusion  or altered mental function. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop RPLS.Thyroid Dysfunction: Thyroid dysfunction  primarily hypothyroidism  has been observed with CABOMETYX. Based on the safety population  thyroid dysfunction occurred in 19% of patients treated with CABOMETYX  including Grade 3 in 0.4% of patients.Patients should be assessed for signs of thyroid dysfunction prior to the initiation of CABOMETYX and monitored for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction during CABOMETYX treatment. Thyroid function testing and management of dysfunction should be performed as clinically indicated.Hypocalcemia: CABOMETYX can cause hypocalcemia. Based on the safety population  hypocalcemia occurred in 13% of patients treated with CABOMETYX  including Grade 3 in 2% and Grade 4 in 1% of patients. Laboratory abnormality data were not collected in CABOSUN.In COSMIC-311  hypocalcemia occurred in 36% of patients treated with CABOMETYX  including Grade 3 in 6% and Grade 4 in 3% of patients.Monitor blood calcium levels and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue CABOMETYX depending on severity.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: CABOMETYX can cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating CABOMETYX and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions are:CABOMETYX as a single agent: diarrhea  fatigue  PPE  decreased appetite  hypertension  nausea  vomiting  weight decreased  constipation.CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab: diarrhea  fatigue  hepatotoxicity  PPE  stomatitis  rash  hypertension  hypothyroidism  musculoskeletal pain  decreased appetite  nausea  dysgeusia  abdominal pain  cough  and upper respiratory tract infection.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: If coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot be avoided  reduce the CABOMETYX dosage.

Any statements that refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements and are based upon Exelixis’ current plans  assumptions  beliefs  expectations  estimates and projections. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties  which include  without limitation: complexities and the unpredictability of the regulatory review and approval processes in the U.S. and elsewhere; Exelixis’ continuing compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements; the potential failure of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical testing; uncertainties inherent in the product development process; Exelixis’ dependence on its relationships with its cabozantinib commercial collaboration partners  including the level of investment in the resources necessary to successfully commercialize the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in the territories where approved; the costs of conducting clinical trials  including the ability or willingness of Exelixis’ clinical collaboration partners to invest in the resources necessary to complete the trials; Exelixis’ dependence on third-party vendors for the development  manufacture and supply of cabozantinib; Exelixis’ ability to protect its intellectual property rights; market competition  including the potential for competitors to obtain approval for generic versions of CABOMETYX; changes in economic and business conditions; and other factors affecting Exelixis and its development programs discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in Exelixis’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 1  2023 and Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 7  2023  and in Exelixis’ future filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to Exelixis as of the date of this press release  and Exelixis undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein  except as required by law.Ipsen Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

The trial is sponsored by Exelixis and co-funded by Ipsen  Roche and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda). Takeda is conducting the trial in Japan. More information about CONTACT-02 is available at ClinicalTrials.gov.About CRPCProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men and the fourth most common cancer overall globally.1 In 2020  there were more than 1.4 million new cases of prostate cancer and about 375 300 deaths worldwide.1 Prostate cancer is considered mCRPC when it has spread beyond the prostate and does not respond to androgen-suppression therapies  a common treatment for prostate cancer.2 Men diagnosed with mCRPC often have a poor prognosis  with an estimated survival of 1-2 years.3About CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib)In the U.S.  CABOMETYX tablets are approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC); for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib; for patients with advanced RCC as a first-line treatment in combination with nivolumab; and for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) that has progressed following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible. CABOMETYX tablets have also received regulatory approvals in over 60 countries outside the U.S. and Japan  including the European Union. In 2016  Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib outside of the U.S. and Japan. In 2017  Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize cabozantinib in the U.S.CABOMETYX in combination with atezolizumab is not indicated as a treatment for mCRPC.U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSHemorrhage: Severe and fatal hemorrhages occurred with CABOMETYX. The incidence of Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhagic events was 5% in CABOMETYX patients in RCC  HCC  and DTC studies. Discontinue CABOMETYX for Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage and prior to surgery as recommended. Do not administer CABOMETYX to patients who have a recent history of hemorrhage  including hemoptysis  hematemesis  or melena.Perforations and Fistulas: Fistulas  including fatal cases  occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX patients. Gastrointestinal (GI) perforations  including fatal cases  occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of fistulas and perforations  including abscess and sepsis. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who experience a Grade 4 fistula or a GI perforation.Thrombotic Events: CABOMETYX increased the risk of thrombotic events. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 7% (including 4% pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolism in 2% of CABOMETYX patients. Fatal thrombotic events occurred in CABOMETYX patients. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or serious arterial or venous thromboembolic events that require medical intervention.Hypertension and Hypertensive Crisis: CABOMETYX can cause hypertension  including hypertensive crisis. Hypertension was reported in 37% (16% Grade 3 and <1% Grade 4) of CABOMETYX patients. Do not initiate CABOMETYX in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Monitor blood pressure regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. Withhold CABOMETYX for hypertension that is not adequately controlled with medical management; when controlled  resume at a reduced dose. Permanently discontinue CABOMETYX for severe hypertension that cannot be controlled with anti-hypertensive therapy or for hypertensive crisis.Diarrhea: Diarrhea occurred in 62% of CABOMETYX patients. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 10% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor and manage patients using antidiarrheals as indicated. Withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to ≤ Grade 1  resume at a reduced dose.Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (PPE): PPE occurred in 45% of CABOMETYX patients. Grade 3 PPE occurred in 13% of CABOMETYX patients. Withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to Grade 1 and resume at a reduced dose for intolerable Grade 2 PPE or Grade 3 PPE.Hepatotoxicity: CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to CABOMETYX alone. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes than when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes  interrupt CABOMETYX and nivolumab and consider administering corticosteroids.With the combination of CABOMETYX and nivolumab  Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients. ALT or AST >3 times ULN (Grade ≥2) was reported in 83 patients  of whom 23 (28%) received systemic corticosteroids; ALT or AST resolved to Grades 0-1 in 74 (89%). Among the 44 patients with Grade ≥2 increased ALT or AST who were rechallenged with either CABOMETYX (n=9) or nivolumab (n=11) as a single agent or with both (n=24)  recurrence of Grade ≥2 increased ALT or AST was observed in 2 patients receiving CABOMETYX  2 patients receiving nivolumab  and 7 patients receiving both CABOMETYX and nivolumab. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose based on severity.Adrenal Insufficiency: CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency  initiate symptomatic treatment  including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold CABOMETYX and/or nivolumab and resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose depending on severity.Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 4.7% (15/320) of patients with RCC who received CABOMETYX with nivolumab  including Grade 3 (2.2%)  and Grade 2 (1.9%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of CABOMETYX and nivolumab in 0.9% and withholding of CABOMETYX and nivolumab in 2.8% of patients with RCC.Approximately 80% (12/15) of patients with adrenal insufficiency received hormone replacement therapy  including systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 27% (n=4) of the 15 patients. Of the 9 patients in whom CABOMETYX with nivolumab was withheld for adrenal insufficiency  6 reinstated treatment after symptom improvement; of these  all (n=6) received hormone replacement therapy and 2 had recurrence of adrenal insufficiency.Proteinuria: Proteinuria was observed in 8% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor urine protein regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. For Grade 2 or 3 proteinuria  withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to ≤ Grade 1 proteinuria  resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome.Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ): ONJ occurred in <1% of CABOMETYX patients. ONJ can manifest as jaw pain  osteomyelitis  osteitis  bone erosion  tooth or periodontal infection  toothache  gingival ulceration or erosion  persistent jaw pain  or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery. Perform an oral examination prior to CABOMETYX initiation and periodically during treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices. Withhold CABOMETYX for at least 3 weeks prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures  if possible.

Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties  which include  without limitation: complexities and the unpredictability of the regulatory review and approval processes in the U.S. and elsewhere; Exelixis’ continuing compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements; the potential failure of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical testing; uncertainties inherent in the product development process; Exelixis’ dependence on its relationships with its cabozantinib commercial collaboration partners  including the level of investment in the resources necessary to successfully commercialize the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in the territories where approved; the costs of conducting clinical trials  including the ability or willingness of Exelixis’ clinical collaboration partners to invest in the resources necessary to complete the trials; Exelixis’ dependence on third-party vendors for the development  manufacture and supply of cabozantinib; Exelixis’ ability to protect its intellectual property rights; market competition  including the potential for competitors to obtain approval for generic versions of CABOMETYX; changes in economic and business conditions; and other factors affecting Exelixis and its development programs discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in Exelixis’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 1  2023 and Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 7  2023  and in Exelixis’ future filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to Exelixis as of the date of this press release  and Exelixis undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein  except as required by law.Ipsen Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

(Nasdaq: EXEL) and Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) today announced that the global phase 3 CONTACT-02 pivotal trial met one of two primary endpoints  demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) at the primary analysis. CONTACT-02 is evaluating cabozantinib (CABOMETYX®) in combination with atezolizumab compared with a second novel hormonal therapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and measurable soft tissue disease who have been previously treated with one novel hormonal therapy. At a prespecified interim analysis for the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) that occurred at the same time as the primary analysis of PFS  a trend toward improvement of OS was observed; however  the data were immature and did not meet the threshold for statistical significance. Therefore  the trial will continue to the next analysis of OS as planned.The safety profile of the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab was consistent with the known safety profiles for each single medicine  and no new safety signals were identified with the combination.“These positive findings from CONTACT-02 are highly encouraging given the need for additional  non-cytotoxic or non-chemotherapeutic treatment options for this patient population ” said Neeraj Agarwal  M.D.  FASCO  Professor and Presidential Endowed Chair of Cancer Research at Huntsman Cancer Institute  University of Utah and the global lead investigator of the trial. “Cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab represents a potential new treatment modality for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer  and we look forward to sharing the full data at a future medical meeting.”“Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer face a poor prognosis of less than two years  and many who progress on a novel hormonal therapy are seeking alternative treatment options to chemotherapy ” said Vicki L. Goodman  M.D.  Executive Vice President  Product Development & Medical Affairs  and Chief Medical Officer  Exelixis. “We are pleased to report positive findings from the CONTACT-02 trial  in which cabozantinib in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor has demonstrated an efficacy benefit in another tumor type with significant unmet need. We look forward to discussing these findings with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and to presenting further details at an upcoming medical meeting.”“With prostate cancer confirmed as the second most commonly occurring cancer in men globally  the need for innovative new therapies is extensive  especially for those whose cancer has progressed to the metastatic castration-resistant form ” said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development at Ipsen. “These results represent the first positive phase 3 data of its kind for a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and immunotherapy combination in this indication. We will engage with regulatory authorities on these data and look forward to further exploring the potential treatment benefit for a patient population at such a challenging stage of disease.”About CONTACT-02CONTACT-02 is a global  multicenter  randomized  phase 3  open-label study that enrolled 575 patients who were randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab and the control arm of a second novel hormonal therapy (either abiraterone and prednisone or enzalutamide). The study included patients with mCRPC who have measurable visceral disease or measurable extrapelvic adenopathy who have been previously treated with one novel hormonal therapy. The two primary endpoints of the trial are PFS and OS. The secondary endpoint is objective response rate. The trial is sponsored by Exelixis and co-funded by Ipsen  Roche and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda). Takeda is conducting the trial in Japan. More information about CONTACT-02 is available at ClinicalTrials.gov .About CRPCProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men and the fourth most common cancer overall globally.1 In 2020  there were more than 1.4 million new cases of prostate cancer and about 375 300 deaths worldwide.1 Prostate cancer is considered mCRPC when it has spread beyond the prostate and does not respond to androgen-suppression therapies  a common treatment for prostate cancer.2 Men diagnosed with mCRPC often have a poor prognosis  with an estimated survival of 1-2 years.3About CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib)In the U.S.  CABOMETYX tablets are approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC); for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib; for patients with advanced RCC as a first-line treatment in combination with nivolumab; and for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) that has progressed following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible.

Any statements that refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements and are based upon Exelixis’ current plans  assumptions  beliefs  expectations  estimates and projections. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties  which include  without limitation: complexities and the unpredictability of the regulatory review and approval processes in the U.S. and elsewhere; Exelixis’ continuing compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements; the potential failure of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical testing; uncertainties inherent in the product development process; Exelixis’ dependence on its relationships with its cabozantinib commercial collaboration partners  including the level of investment in the resources necessary to successfully commercialize the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in the territories where approved; the costs of conducting clinical trials  including the ability or willingness of Exelixis’ clinical collaboration partners to invest in the resources necessary to complete the trials; Exelixis’ dependence on third-party vendors for the development  manufacture and supply of cabozantinib; Exelixis’ ability to protect its intellectual property rights; market competition  including the potential for competitors to obtain approval for generic versions of CABOMETYX; changes in economic and business conditions; and other factors affecting Exelixis and its development programs discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in Exelixis’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 1  2023 and Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 7  2023  and in Exelixis’ future filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to Exelixis as of the date of this press release  and Exelixis undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein  except as required by law.Ipsen Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s latest Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com .Exelixis  the Exelixis logo and CABOMETYX are registered U.S. trademarks of Exelixis.# # #1 Prostate cancer statistics.

We believe this is the ideal new owner of this business for the next phase in the lifecycle of these assets. AMSC's ownership tenure has surpassed 18 years since the ships were ordered  during which significant financial profits have been created and provided to AMSC and its shareholders. We believe that the long remaining commercial life of the fleet in combination with strong bareboat charter contract cover in a strong market represents a good opportunity and point in time for us to reconsider capital allocation for AMSC and strategy going forward  and this transaction is a natural step in this process.""Key terms of the TransactionATHC  directly or indirectly  owns all shares in each of American Shipping Corporation  American Tanker  Inc.
