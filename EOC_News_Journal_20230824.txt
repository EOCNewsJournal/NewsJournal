MPC Capital was able to launch several projects in connection with the strategic focus on the decarbonisation of real assets. For example  MPC Capital has acquired a fifth property for the ESG Core Wohnimmobilien Deutschland fund and is in the process of acquiring a further project. In the Renewables area three additional projects in South and Central America were commissioned. The launch of a 65 MWp photovoltaic project also paved the way for a market entry in Guatemala. In the Shipping segment  MPC Capital initiated the acquisition of a modern  efficient fleet of container vessels in cooperation with various investors for a total investment volume of USD 150 million  with the transaction expected to be completed in the second half of 2023.Increased transaction fees expected for the second half of the yearRevenue for the MPC Capital Group came in at EUR 17.2 million in the first half of 2023 (H1 2022: EUR 18.7 million). Management services resulted in recurring revenues totalling EUR 13.9 million (H1 2022: EUR 13.6 million). The loss of revenues from the Dutch real estate business  which was sold in the previous year  was more than compensated by the increase in revenues from the other segments.As expected and in line with the macroeconomic conditions  transaction fees decreased to at EUR 3.1 million compared to the previous year (H1 2022: EUR 5.0 million). However  based on several projects initiated by MPC Capital in all three asset classes  an increase in transaction fees is visible for the second half of the year.Other operating income for the first half of 2023 amounted to EUR 2.5 million (H1 2022: EUR 22.0 million). The elevated income in the previous year was substantially due to the book profit from the sale of the Dutch real estate activities and performance-based income from the Shipping segment.Profitability of business operations improves furtherConsolidated earnings before taxes (EBT) for the first six months of 2023 amounted to EUR 9.2 million. In the previous year  MPC Capital reported an EBT of EUR 24.3 million. EBT (adjusted) for the previous year  excluding the non-recurring proceeds from the sale of the Dutch real estate business  was EUR 7.9 million. The operating EBT margin (adjusted) thus improved from 42 % in the previous year to 54 % in the first half of 2023.Overall  MPC Capital reported a consolidated profit after taxes of EUR 7.9 million for the first half of 2023 (H1 2022: EUR 22.8 million).EUR 4.0 billion in assets under management  strong liquidity positionThe assets under management (AUM) of the MPC Capital Group totalled EUR 4.0 billion as of 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 4.2 billion).New business resulted in asset additions of EUR 0.2 billion. asset disposals amounted to EUR 0.2 billion. The transaction volume for the first half of 2023 was thus EUR 0.4 billion. Valuation and currency effects were EUR 0.2 billion.Financial assets  which mainly comprise the co-investments of MPC Capital  amounted to EUR 45.7 million as at 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 54.9 million). The change is mainly due to disposal of projects in the Shipping segment.Despite the distribution of the dividend of MPC Capital AG  the consolidated profit led to a slightly higher cash position of EUR 70.9 million (cash in hand and bank balances) (31 December 2022: EUR 69.1 million). Equity was EUR 122.1 million as at 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 123.2 million). The Equity ratio increased from 81.7 % to 86.0 %.Full-year forecast for 2023 confirmedThe Management Board of MPC Capital AG confirms the forecast for the MPC Capital Group published on 20 February 2023. For the 2023 financial year  the Management Board expects consolidated revenues to be at the level of the previous year.After adjustment for the non-recurring effect from the sale of the Dutch real estate activities in the previous year  a further improvement in profitability is expected in the 2023 financial year. Consolidated earnings before taxes (EBT) should be in the range of EUR 15.0 million to EUR 20.0 million due to a lower cost base and sustained high income from co-investments.Ulf Holländer  CEO of MPC Capital AG  said: “We look back on an economically very successful first half of 2023  which again underlined the resilience of our business model. Although the geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions remained challenging  we maintained our operating performance at a high level and further improved profitability. Yet again  our business model has served us well as an anchor of stability during highly volatile market phases. As a diversified real asset specialist  we are thus able to capitalise on opportunities arising in various markets and to compensate for temporary weaknesses in other segments.”Key Group figures for H1 202301/01 – 30/06/2023 01/01 – 30/06/2022 Revenue 17 151 18 733 of which from management services 13 870 13 633 of which from transaction services 3 108 4 952 of which miscellaneous 174 148 Other operating income 2 494 21 979 Operating result (EBIT) 864 16 305 Earnings before tax (EBT) 9 213 24 342 Earnings before tax (adjusted) (EBT adj.) 9 213 7.8811 EBT margin (adj.) 54% 42% Consolidated net profit 7 914 22 847 Employees (average total for period)2 157 169 30/06/2023 31/12/2022 Assets under management (EUR billion) 4.0 4.2 Total assets 141 922 150 792 Financial assets 45 735 54 923 Liquid funds3 70 872 69 068 122 075 123 189 Equity ratio (%) 86.0% 81.7%All figures in EUR ’000 unless otherwise indicated1) Adjusted for the one-off proceeds from the sale of the Dutch real estate activities.2) Of which 47 at joint ventures (previous year: 47)3) Cash in hand and bank balancesAbout MPC Capital AG (www.mpc-capital.com)MPC Capital is a global asset and investment manager for real assets focusing on Real Estate  Renewables and Shipping.

29301,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://fortune.com/2023/08/23/cathie-wood-ark-invest-stake-dutch-payments-adyen/,Cathie Wood swoops in for Dutch payments company shares right after its $20B market wipe-out,The investment firm has held a stake in Adyen since 2019  and following the additions  ARK's stake in the payments processor is now worth $14.5 million.,Cathie Wood and her ARK Invest firm are back at it with another daring investment  this time focusing on Adyen  a Dutch payments platform that’s been plumbing three-year trading lows.In a bold maneuver  two of ARK’s SEC-registered exchange-traded funds (ETFs) swooped in on Monday  snapping up $9 million worth of Adyen stock  as reported by Bloomberg.One ETF snagged 2 900 Adyen shares  while the other gobbled up 733 000 U.S.-traded depository receipts.This strategic investment marks ARK’s most significant daily foray into Adyen for 2023  pushing their stake in the company to a current value of $14.5 million.The investment firm has held stakes in Adyen since 2019  based on regulatory disclosures by ARK’s Fintech Innovation ETF. That fund has rallied 40% this year  racing past the tech-focused Nasdaq 100’s gains.Representatives at ARK didn’t immediately return Fortune’s request for comment.Why is Wood interested in Adyen?The Amsterdam-listed company rivals services like PayPal and Stripe  and boasts big clients like Meta and Spotify.It was founded in 2006 and floated in Amsterdam’s Euronext exchange in 2018. Over the years  Adyen has rapidly expanded in the U.S.  where it makes roughly a quarter of its revenue now.Adyen’s remarkable journey hit a major setback last week  with a whopping $20 billion market value wipeout following the company’s announcement of its slowest-ever revenue growth.For the first half of 2023  the company reported a 21% increase in revenue compared to the previous year. However  this growth rate paled in comparison to its earlier performance  where it consistently achieved a 26% increase for each half-year period since going public.Adyen attributed this slowdown to factors such as high inflation and interest rates  which prompted customers  particularly in North America  to cut back on spending  impacting the company’s profit margins.In the wake of this disappointing earnings report  investors hurriedly offloaded their shares  causing the payment company’s stock to plummet by nearly 40% on Thursday.Despite the lackluster sales  Adyen said it had big plans for the months to come and had already boosted hiring around the world to scale up its operations.ARK’s bold betsWood has not been one to shy away from risky bets like buying up stocks right when they’re tanking. If anything  it’s a familiar scene for the ARK CEO  who is a devout Elon Musk fan and crypto bull.In June  she bought $20 million worth of Coinbase’s stock when it was heading downward amid SEC charges that accused the crypto exchange of not being properly registered.Wood also held big stakes in Nvidia well before it became a crown jewel in the artificial intelligence world (although she said recently that its stock was overvalued).She has an eye for novel and disruptive technologies—including one of her top holdings  Tesla.Even when others were skeptical  she predicted Tesla’s bull run which  in 2021  hit a $1 trillion valuation.In an interview with Fortune in May  she said the Musk-owned electric vehicle company was the “biggest A.I. play out there.”,neutral,0.03,0.71,0.25,mixed,0.19,0.26,0.55,True,English,"['Dutch payments company shares', 'Cathie Wood', '$20B market', '733,000 U.S.-traded depository receipts', 'devout Elon Musk fan', '$20 billion market value wipeout', 'Musk-owned electric vehicle company', 'Dutch payments platform', 'three-year trading lows', 'SEC-registered exchange-traded funds', 'significant daily foray', 'disappointing earnings report', 'biggest A.I.', 'Fintech Innovation ETF', 'artificial intelligence world', 'slowest-ever revenue growth', 'ARK Invest firm', 'current value', 'One ETF', 'investment firm', 'growth rate', 'daring investment', 'bold maneuver', '$9 million worth', 'strategic investment', 'regulatory disclosures', 'big clients', 'Euronext exchange', 'remarkable journey', 'major setback', 'first half', 'previous year', 'earlier performance', 'half-year period', 'high inflation', 'interest rates', 'North America', 'profit margins', 'lackluster sales', 'big plans', 'bold bets', 'risky bets', 'familiar scene', 'crypto bull', '$20 million worth', 'SEC charges', 'crypto exchange', 'crown jewel', 'disruptive technologies', 'top holdings', 'bull run', '$1 trillion valuation', 'Amsterdam-listed company', 'payment company', 'big stakes', 'ARK CEO', 'Cathie Wood', '2,900 Adyen shares', 'Adyen stock', 'ETFs', 'Monday', 'Bloomberg', 'gains', 'Representatives', 'Fortune', 'request', 'comment', 'The', 'services', 'PayPal', 'Stripe', 'Meta', 'Spotify', 'years', 'quarter', 'announcement', '21% increase', 'comparison', '26% increase', 'slowdown', 'factors', 'customers', 'spending', 'wake', 'investors', 'Thursday', 'months', 'hiring', 'operations', 'stocks', 'June', 'Coinbase', 'Nvidia', 'eye', 'novel', 'Tesla', 'interview', 'May']",2023-08-23,2023-08-24,fortune.com

The quarter marked the successful completion of the planned capital raise to accelerate market-adoption of its disruptive UV-C LED products. CrayoNano is working closely with leading manufacturers to offer integrated  high-quality optic solutions  and continues to support customers in the design-in phase towards design-win  volume orders and material revenue generation. Post period-end  the company reached another key milestone by signing its first commercial frame contract with AquiSense Technologies ('AquiSense')  a global leader in UVC-LED systems for water  air  and surface disinfection.Jo Uthus  CEO said:""The second quarter of 2023 has seen the implementation of our growth plans and strategy post capital raise. We are pleased to be working with leading manufacturer LEDiL  and to improve our reach in the Indian market by partnering with Vallalar Energy Solutions. With the signing of a commercial frame contract with AquiSense  one of the world's largest system integrators in the water disinfection market  we are proving ourselves as a high-quality supplier for a range of their leading disinfection products. We look forward to bringing even more customers through to design-wins and volume production during the remaining two quarters of the year.""Market & Customer UpdateDuring the quarter  the Company continued to invest in strengthening its sales and marketing abilities  reaching a larger share of the market and is seeing a strong interest for the powerful CrayoLED™ UV-C LED  particularly in the water segment.In the second quarter  we experienced an increase in number of customer leads by almost 30%  to 585 and saw an increase in design-ins to 29 in total. In the months ahead we will work with our customers as we support the design process towards volume orders and material revenue generation.In June  we announced a new partnership with leading optics supplier LEDiL  a renowned manufacturer of optical solutions. This new partnership is a testament to the quality of CrayoNano's products and is expected to reduce customer design-in time and offer integrated high-quality optics solutions. Customers are expected to benefit from access to even more disinfection applications (link).In July  the Company announced a new distributor partnership with Vallalar Energy Solutions (VES)  a consulting firm specialising in UV-C water and air purification based in India  expanding CrayoNano's reach in this market. VES will distribute and market the CrayoLED™ UV-C LED product throughout India  contributing to India's clean energy transition by creating opportunities for customers across industries in India to adopt new UV-C LED disinfection product solutions through established Indian equipment manufacturers.Finally  the Company has signed its first commercial frame contract with AquiSense  a global leader in UVC-LED systems for water  air  and surface disinfection. AquiSense works with leading LED manufacturers to evaluate their devices and then design efficient disinfection products. AquiSense has tested and validated the CrayoLED™ UV-C LEDs to its high-quality standards for use in water disinfection systems for point of entry and point of use products. We were able to successfully transition the lead to signed agreement in 10 months  with an initial contract value estimated to be NOK 4m  over the next 12 months  with opportunity to increase the value.Operational UpdateIn line with our business plan and strategy  and in preparation for the scaling of the business to support our growth ambitions  we strengthened our Taiwan operations through the hiring of a new Taiwan based Chief Technology Officer  Ryan Chuo  bringing 25 years of industry experience from optoelectronics and UV-C LED design and manufacturing companies.In preparation for scaling the business  we have transitioned part of our operations to Taiwan and transitioned people into customer-facing roles to support our growing global design-in activity. This change was effective from August 1st and is in line with our ongoing focus on efficient operations  the second quarter has also seen a prudent management of our cost base as we prepare for increased volumes and scale.Financial UpdateRevenue and operating costRevenue from product sales in the second quarter amounted to NOK 32k from smaller test unit shipments to prospective customers. Total operating costs were NOK 15.0m  a reduction of NOK 8.3m (36%) compared with the previous quarter  and NOK 3.2m (18%) below the same quarter last year. The decrease is mainly driven by lower R&D cost and a temporary reduction in Fab related costs in Taiwan. EBITDA for the quarter was at NOK -14.2m  an improvement of NOK 7.3m compared with the previous quarter  and NOK 2.0m compared with the same period last year.Private placementsDuring April  and as announced in our Q1 update  we completed a private placement of approx. NOK 125m in gross proceeds. CrayoNano is well capitalized and has begun utilising the new growth capital which will go towards key strategic goals including sales acceleration  investments in manufacturing capacity and flexibility  product development and for general corporate purposes. The company also completed a subsequent offering towards existing shareholders during the period as announced on June 6 (link).Cash flowCash flow from operations was NOK -25.8m in the quarter  a slightly higher cash burn than previous quarter and broadly in line year-on-year. As part of the ongoing ramp-up  CrayoNano continued to build strategic inventory which increased by NOK 2.8m in the second quarter to NOK 8m. As the availability of products has been a key constraint in the market  we believe having a strategic inventory is an important asset for our revenue generation abilities.At the end of the quarter cash and cash equivalents was NOK 67m  up NOK 57m quarter-on-quarter with positive cash flow from proceeds from the private placement  offset by negative cash flow from operations and capex. Post quarter-end  the Company secured a credit facility of NOK 12m from Sparebank 1 SMN  partly guaranteed by Eksfin. The facility is established for the purpose of financing parts of CrayoNano's working capital.Euronext GrowthThe Company's Board of directors intends to pursue a listing on Euronext Growth Oslo within the next 12 months.Q2 2023 Results Presentation and Q&ACrayoNano will present its Q2 2023 Financial Update to analysts and investors via webcast at 10:00 CET today.

These conspiracy-laden words are more than enough to discredit the author.The “press release” - shared along with deceptive and misleading comments by BewellConnect managers and consultants – affected significantly Visiomed Group's share price: in less than 5 hours  the share price dropped by nearly 30%  with more than 14 million shares traded and €38 million of value lost for shareholders .Visiomed Group could not allow false information to impact and mislead the market and was therefore obliged to request a trading suspension to be able to respond and refute in the strongest possible terms the “press release” allegations and other disparaging and defamatory comments .A slanderous communication campaign amounting to blackmail  solely aimed at harming Visiomed GroupBewellConnect is 100% owned by Bewellthy  a holding company controlled by Medsco Invest and managed by Medsco Invest's directors and shareholders . Visiomed Group holds a minority stake in Bewellthy.Recently  Visiomed Group had to respond to pressure from Bewellthy and Medsco Invest executives who were seeking funding. As Visiomed Group's excellent results are not synonymous with unconditional financial support  especially from a company in which Visiomed Group is only a minority shareholder  the request from Bewellthy and Medsco Invest executives was rejected. It is following this refusal by Visiomed Group to provide a ""blank check"" to BewellConnect that the ""press release"" was published. Therefore  it is clearly a blackmail attempt .In this respect  the timing of the “press release” - on a Friday during the week of August 15th (public holiday in France) and heavily promoted and communicated on social networks - in itself reveals the intent of the scheme elaborated by BewellConnect  its executives and its advisors: maximizing the impact on Visiomed Group's stock price and Visiomed Group's shareholders .Formal and tangible evidence of the wrongful nature of these accusationsVisiomed Group strongly refutes the entire ""press release"" and highlights the following factual points:Visiomed Group's 2022 accounts were approved and validated by auditors without any reservations . Accounts were subsequently reviewed and approved at Visiomed Group General Meeting (all documents are available on Visiomed Group's website).The approval of BewellConnect's 2022 financial statements is the sole responsibility of Bewellthy and therefore the responsibility of the authors of the “press release” . It is important to note that Visiomed Group is able and allowed to prepare consolidated financial statements certified by its statutory auditors even though one of the Group's subsidiaries has not yet definitively approved its own financial statements  if the accounting information used for consolidation is deemed conclusive and reliable by the statutory auditors and especially when the subsidiary is controlled and under the umbrella of the consolidating entity (like BewellConnect was during the 2022 financial year).The so-called “waiver of a current account amounting to several tens of millions of euros” is in fact a waiver of approximately €235k by Visiomed Group to BewellConnect  along with a waiver of “better fortune” clauses linked to previously waived current accounts. These transactions were carried out as part of the overall merger of the BewellConnect and WCS entities that led to the creation of Bewellthy  in accordance with the agreements negotiated with Medsco Invest and for the benefit of BewellConnect. They are duly mentioned in Visiomed Group's 2022 annual financial report.All agreements relating to Bewellthy have been consistently honoured by Visiomed Group since January 2023 . Information on human resources and suppliers along with the value of BewellConnect's stock were extensively audited by Medsco Invest and were subject to detailed reports from its advisors. These items were addressed at length during contractual negotiations  which demonstrates that the authors of the “press release” and subsequent communications have not discovered anything post transaction and confirms how fallacious their communication - in the middle of August - is.Visiomed Group has no knowledge of the actions that BewellConnect claims to have initiated and totally disputes the implausible amounts mentioned in the “press release” . As Visiomed Group has not received any legal summons to date  it is astounding - and unlawful - to “communicate” via a social network about a commercial dispute  especially when no proceedings have been initiated. We also point out that the valuations  asset and equity contributions and equity funding carried out in January 2023 and publicly disclosed  were subject to an independent valuation and an audit report (available from the registry). These tangible values are inconsistent with the disproportionate and baseless amounts quoted in the “press release”  which have no credibility whatsoever and whose only goal is to create the false impression of a major dispute in order to negatively impact the share price.Visiomed Group has always transparent in its communication . Publications concerning the restructuring of BewellConnect in 2022 have been regular and the details of the minority stake acquisition in Bewellthy were clearly explained. Due to Bewellthy's backlog and revenue delays  Visiomed Group clearly mentioned in its 2022 annual report the recording of a provision of €173k for risks and its commitments within the JV (€268k of shareholder loan and €30k of guarantees given as part of the transaction agreements).An immediate legal responseGiven the misleading and deceptive nature of the “press release” and other defamatory comments  Visiomed Group has instructed its advisors to alert the Autorité des Marchés Financiers and to file a complaint for defamation and dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information.These are criminal offences punishable by law through fines and imprisonment: the maximum penalties for disseminating inaccurate or misleading information are a five years' imprisonment and a €100 million fine  in addition to compensation for the damage caused.The necessary actions will also be taken to defend the interests of Visiomed Group  taking into account in particular (i) the significant damage suffered by Visiomed Group and its shareholders (ii) the dissemination of false and misleading information with the sole aim of affecting Visiomed Group share price and its shareholders and (iii) the denigrating and defamatory nature of the comments made in the “press release”. These actions will target not only the authors of the “press release” but also anyone who shares it while adding false and defamatory statements.Visiomed Group will also respond firmly  through the right legal channels  to any actions announced in the “press release” (if such action is ever taken).A smear campaign with no impact whatsoever on Visiomed Group's operationsAs an indirect and minority investment managed under the responsibility of Medsco Invest  its majority shareholder  BewellConnect has no impact on Visiomed Group's operating performance and financial health.BewellConnect is not consolidated and does not contribute to Visiomed Group's revenue. It has no bearing whatsoever on all the actions implemented by the Management since April 2022 and the major achievements and prospects that have resulted from them:+99% growth in 2022+41% growth in the first half of 2023[1]Launch of 2 new Smart Salem medical screening centres in DubaiDiversification of the services offered by the centres from the first half of 2023The incorporation of a new company in Saudi Arabia  the largest market in the Middle EastImplementation of a top-tier governance and financial communicationWe would also add that the recent valuation of Visiomed Group conducted by EuroLand Corporate puts the value of Visiomed Group's minority stake in Bewellthy at zero.Out of respect for the law and not wishing to fuel this slanderous campaign launched by BewellConnect and other commentators  Visiomed Group does not intend to comment further on these wrongful allegations  other than in the context of the law.Visiomed Group will not be intimidated nor strong-armed and will defend its interests  and the interests of its shareholders  with the utmost force.Visiomed Group applied to Euronext to resume stock trading  which is expected to take place at financial markets opening on Monday 21 August 2023.About VISIOMED GROUPFounded in 2007  VISIOMED GROUP relies on a long experience in the health sector to invest in innovative health technologies and services in France and abroad.The Group now has focused its activities on the Middle East since 2021 and the acquisition of Smart Salem  the first digital medical analysis centre accredited by the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) in the United Arab Emirates  100% owned by Visiomed Group.Smart Salem offer is based on know-how in medical analysis  radiology and data analysis and processing to detect nearly 35 diseases in 7 minutes (in particular HIV  hepatitis and tuberculosis) and by offering reliable results  readability and exceptional patient experience enabled by advanced artificial intelligence and virtual reality technologies.Smart Salem's “Medical Fitness Assessment” offer makes possible the receipt of a residence or work visa in 30 minutes compared to 5 to 10 working days historically.Smart Salem is a technological platform offering many growth opportunities  as demonstrated by the opening of two new centres in Dubai in September 2022 and March 2023  followed by the expansion of the range of tests on offer from mid-2023.Based in Paris  VISIOMED GROUP is listed on Euronext Growth (ALVMG).

The terminal plays a crucial role in the supply and availability of gas in the Netherlands and its neighboring countries. Once all envisaged projects at Gate terminal have been completed  the terminal will have a total regas capacity of 20 billion cubic meters per year.Hans Coenen  on behalf of the Board of Directors of Gasunie: “The investment in this new tank is part of a broader package of proposed and already realized measures to increase LNG import capacity in the Netherlands. This is necessary to compensate for the loss of Russian natural gas and to reducethe scarcity of natural gas on the European gas market. In addition to expanding LNG import capacity  Gasunie is continuing to accelerate the energy transition. For example  through the construction of a national hydrogen network and the conversion of import terminals. We will also continue to focus on green gas  transport of heat and CO2 capture and storage.”Dick Richelle  CEO at Vopak: “We are excited to build upon our successful partnership with Gasunie. This investment fits well with Vopak’s strategy to grow in LNG infrastructure. We are proud to develop and operate reliable and open access infrastructure as this plays an important role in the security of supply of energy.”Jarmo Stoopman  Managing Director at Gate terminal: “Now that all elements are in place  we are happy that today we can start with the construction of this important expansion. We look forward to working with our contractors and ensuring a safe and timely construction of this 4th tank.”Financial paragraphThe total investment is approximately EUR 350 million. The envisaged financing structure of this expansion is approximately 15% of the costs to be funded with equity and approximately 85% to be funded via a non-recourse project financing for which commitments are in place. The project financing is expected to be finalized by the end of 2023. The equity contribution of each of the shareholders will be approximately EUR 26 million with cash outs expected in the coming years.About GasunieGasunie is a European energy high-- infrastructure company.

These updated results will be featured in two poster presentations at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (ASCO GU) from February 17 to 19  2022.Dr. Cristina Suárez  M.D. PhD  Medical Oncologist at the Vall d´Hebron University Hospital  Barcelona  Spain and a lead investigator on the Phase III CheckMate -9ER trial said  ""I am delighted to see the extent of the efficacy benefits demonstrated with the combination of Cabometyx and Opdivo in the CheckMate 9ER trial. These new data showcase the possibilities we can offer patients for their advanced disease  presenting the opportunity to significantly reduce their risk of death  and for some patients  achieve a complete response  whilst maintaining quality of life. There has been a dramatic evolution in the treatment landscape across lines of therapy for people living with renal cell carcinoma over recent years; this is an exciting time to be a treating physician in this area.""With a median follow-up of 32.9 months (25.4 months minimum)  Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo continued to show superiority across efficacy endpoints of overall survival (OS)  progression-free survival (PFS)  objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR)  including increased complete response (CR) rates compared to sunitinib.1 For the secondary endpoint of median OS  the combination demonstrated a maintained clinically meaningful improvement (37.7 months vs. 34.3 months)  with a 30% reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55 to 0.90) compared to sunitinib.1 PFS benefits  the primary endpoint of the study  were also maintained  with the combination continuing to double median PFS vs. sunitinib (16.6 months vs. 8.3 months  respectively; HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.68).1 Additionally  both superior ORR and DCR benefits were shown to be sustained with increased follow-up for the combination versus sunitinib; ORR 55.7% vs 28.4% and DCR 88.2% vs 69.3%. Moreover  among patients treated with the combination  12.4% had a complete response vs 5.2% for sunitinib.1 In a further exploratory analysis of depth of response in target lesions by organ site  a higher percentage of patients experienced tumor shrinkage benefits with Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo vs. sunitinib across all organ sites assessed (kidney  liver  lung  lymph node and bone).1The safety profile identified in the CheckMate -9ER trial was consistent with that previously observed for Cabometyx and Opdivo. 97.2% of patients treated with the combination experienced a treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) of any grade  compared to 93.1% of patients treated with sunitinib.1 Overall  10.6% discontinued Opdivo only  9.1% discontinued Cabometyx only  and 7.5% discontinued both Cabometyx and Opdivo (simultaneously or sequentially).1In a separate analysis  with 32.9 months median follow-up  patients continued to report clinically meaningful HRQoL benefits with Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo compared to sunitinib.2 These exploratory outcomes were measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Kidney Symptom Index-19 (FKSI-19) which assessed quality of life (QoL) associated specifically to kidney cancer as well as EQ-5D-3L instruments which assessed QoL more generally. HRQoL scores from these instruments were found to be improved or maintained over time amongst patients treated with the combination  while reductions in scores were observed with sunitinib. Additionally  those who received the combination were 48% less likely to be notably bothered by treatment side effects than patients in the sunitinib arm.2 These updated data follow the publication of 23.5 month median follow-up HRQoL data in The Lancet Oncology  published on 12 January 2022.3Steven Hildemann  M.D. PhD  Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Head of Global Medical Affairs and GlobalPatient Safety  Ipsen said ""These new data from the CheckMate -9ER trial build on the previously demonstrated sustained efficacy benefits of the combination of Cabometyx and Opdivo  across patient risk groups. We are delighted to see that these extended survival benefits are further supported by a continued maintenance of health-related quality of life. Evaluating the patient perspective has been an integral element of the CheckMate -9ER trial analyses  ensuring that data are representative of the patient population and their priorities. With this growing body of evidence for the combination of Cabometyx and Opdivo  we are confident of the potential for these data to be realized in real world settings worldwide.""Ipsen thanks the patients and investigators involved in the CheckMate -9ER clinical trial.About renal cell carcinoma (RCC)There were over 400 000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed worldwide in 2020.4 Of these  RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer  accounting for approximately 90% of cases.5 6 It is almost twice as common in men  and male patients account for over two thirds of deaths.4 If detected in the early stages  the five-year survival rate is high  but for people living with advanced or late-stage metastatic RCC  the survival rate is much lower  around 12%  with no identified cure for this disease.7 8About the CheckMate -9ER trialCheckMate -9ER was an open-label  randomized  multi-national Phase III trial evaluating people living with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC. A total of 651 patients (23% favorable risk  58% intermediate risk  20% poor risk; 25% PD-L1 ≥1%) were randomized to Cabometyx plus Opdivo (n= 323) versus sunitinib (n= 328). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). The primary efficacy analysis compared the doublet combination versus sunitinib in all randomized patients. The trial was sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical Co and co-funded by Exelixis  Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.About Cabometyx (cabozantinib)In the U.S.  Cabometyx tablets are approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC); for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have been previously treated with sorafenib; for patients with advanced RCC as a first-line treatment in combination with nivolumab; and for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic DTC that has progressed following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible. Outside the U.S.  Cabometyx is currently approved in 60 countries  including in the European Union  Great Britain  Norway  Iceland  Australia  New Zealand  Switzerland  South Korea  Canada  Brazil  Taiwan  Hong Kong  Singapore  Macau  Jordan  Lebanon  the Russian Federation  Ukraine  Turkey  the United Arabic Emirates (U.A.E.)  Saudi Arabia  Serbia  Israel  Mexico  Chile  Peru  Panama  Guatemala  the Dominican Republic  Ecuador  Thailand  Malaysia  Colombia and Egypt for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults who have received prior VEGF-targeted therapy; in the European Union  Great Britain  Norway  Iceland  Canada  Australia  New Zealand  Brazil  Taiwan  Hong Kong  Singapore  Lebanon  Jordan  the Russian Federation  Ukraine  Turkey  the U.A.E.  Saudi Arabia  Israel  Serbia  Mexico  Chile  Peru  Panama  Guatemala  the Dominican Republic  Ecuador  Thailand  Egypt and Malaysia for previously untreated intermediate- or poor-risk advanced RCC; and in the European Union  Great Britain  Norway  Iceland  Canada  Australia  Switzerland  Saudi Arabia  Serbia  Israel  Taiwan  Hong Kong  South Korea  Singapore  Jordan  the Russian Federation  Ukraine  Turkey  Lebanon  theU.A.E.  Peru  Panama  Guatemala  Chile  the Dominican Republic  Ecuador  Thailand  Brazil  New Zealand  Egypt and Malaysia for HCC in adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib. Cabometyx is also approved in combination with nivolumab as first-line treatment for people living with advanced RCC  in the European Union  Great Britain  Norway  Iceland  Switzerland  Taiwan  Singapore  the U.A.E.  Australia  Chile  Israel and the Russian Federation.The detailed recommendations for the use of Cabometyx are described in the Summary of ProductCharacteristics (EU SmPC) and in the U.S. Prescribing Information (USPI).Ipsen has exclusive rights for the commercialization of Cabometyx outside the U.S. and Japan.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen's future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ""believes""  ""anticipates"" and ""expects"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen's expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons and also taking into consideration assessment delays of certain clinical trials in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances  new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen's patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen's activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen's partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen's business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

At the same time  we are focused on being a sustainable business  one that again proved its resilience in the face of global uncertainties and geopolitical tensions.Discount to net asset valueIn the past year  the group made real progress on the challenge of the discount to net asset value at which Prosus and Naspers shares trade. Since mid-2022  the repurchase programme has reduced this discount by 19% at a Prosus level and 21% at a Naspers level. By June 2023  this had unlocked around US$31bn. As a next step  removal of the cross-holding structure between the companies has been put to shareholders for removal. If approved by Naspers shareholders  this will greatly simplify the group structure  and enable Naspers to continue its repurchase programme. The goal for both companies is to create sustainable value for shareholders. The repurchase programme is being funded by the orderly  on-market sale of a portion of our Tencent shares. Prosus still holds around 26% of Tencent  reflecting a high degree of confidence in the future of Tencent  one of the truly great tech businesses globally.Delivering our strategyEssentially  the group's strategy is to build valuable businesses that solve everyday problems for customers. It does this globally by backing innovative local entrepreneurs  but deploying a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We typically grow our capital commitments progressively as we learn and scale  intrinsically linked to future returns.In the past year  the group made good progress on this strategy. The Ecommerce portfolio maintained its top-line momentum. The exit of OLX Autos is significantly improving the profitability profile of the Classifieds businesses  and the group reduced the cost base materially at the corporate level and in the segments. These actions keep the group on track for the stated ambition of consolidated profitability for the Ecommerce businesses during the first half of FY25.Today  Prosus has a significant positive impact on the daily lives of billions of customers in over 100 countries. Our entrepreneurs and their teams enable people to buy and sell online securely  easily order food and groceries that are delivered quickly to their homes. Our platforms enable participation in the digital economy and access to important and previously unavailable financial services. We help people educate themselves without visiting a classroom. We help to satisfy a basic human need  the ability to connect and interact with others. And our Ventures team continually looks for the next generation of entrepreneurs and business models that will shape the way the world lives in future.A year of progressFY23 was another difficult period  with ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Amid that uncertainty  we leveraged the group’s strong financial footing and stayed focused on building long-term sustainable value in local marketplaces across our main segments. After years of investment and growth  these segments have scaled meaningfully  creating clear paths to profitability for each.Group revenues were US$32bn  driven by 23% growth in the consolidated Ecommerce segment. Importantly  Core Classifieds and Food Delivery are profitable  and core Payments and Fintech is almost at breakeven. Core headline earnings  the group’s measure of after-tax operating performance  were down 32% to US$2.5bn  primarily due to lower contributions from associates  notably Tencent.The group ended the year with a strong and liquid balance sheet reflecting over US$16bn in gross cash.We remain disciplined in our capital allocation  as investments now face a higher bar. We will continue to drive profitability  build scale and take action to manage expenses and free cash flow  even as we invest for growth. The businesses are focused on accelerating their paths to aggregate profitability while continuing to invest in highconviction growth areas. We drove efficiencies and cut back aggressively on costs  including at a corporate level.Our role in societyOne of our three strategic priorities is to be a force for good for our stakeholders. Around the world  sustainability underpins our growth and strategy.At the same time  there is growing interest from shareholders  regulators and other stakeholders in how seriously we honour our responsibilities as a global technology group. While we have a strong heritage of acting responsibly  much of this good work has been implicit. In such an uncertain  changing world  we now need to be more explicit about how we are achieving our goal of being a positive force for the lives we touch.Technology is creating solutions pressing issues like climate action and social inclusion. Through our portfolio of mainly digital platforms  we are supporting the transition to a lower-carbon and more inclusive economy by providing alternatives to traditional brick-and-mortar businesses  alternative that reach more users in broader segments. In addition  our Ventures arm is increasing its focus on sustainable investment themes  such as agriculture and health technology. We are already invested in several agtech companies applying sustainable digital solutions by using soil biology analytics and artificial intelligence tools to determine the most sustainable solutions for crops  while addressing specific climate and social-inclusion challenges. These priorities align with our support for circular-economy innovations to mitigate and reduce environmental footprints.Although global standards guiding the private sector on environmental  social and governance or ESG disclosure are still evolving  we are committed to climate action and transparency on our sustainability agenda. At corporate level  we set an ambitious target to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions to net zero within this financial year. More importantly  we developed science-based targets that shape our absolute reduction pathway for corporate emissions (scope 1  2 and 3) as well as multiyear engagement with our portfolio companies to put their businesses on a net-zero pathway.Aligning remuneration to performance and value creationOur group operates in highly competitive  fast-changing markets  many characterised by the shortage of key skills. Our remuneration structures therefore focus on attracting  motivating and retaining the best people to create sustainable shareholder value.As a global tech leader  our people are critical to our success. The need to cut costs during the year to remain competitive included reducing our workforce – a decision not taken lightly. But we were guided by our strategic approach to human resources and remuneration that better enables us to compete for the digital talent at the heart of our businesses. Across the group  we focus on fair and equitable pay  encourage ownership and entrepreneurship in all our teams  and strive to align management compensation with creating shareholder value over time. Our remuneration principles are simple: pay for performance; align with desired shareholder outcomes  achieve the business plan  remain consistent  and attract and retain talent.Importantly  we continue to engage with shareholders on remunerations topics. This feedback is constructive in continually improving the transparency of both our reward structures and disclosure.As approved by shareholders at the FY22 AGM  in the current year we introduced a short-term incentive for the CEO and CFO focused on reducing the discount to NAV. Although there was a material improvement in the discount by year end  as noted  an important criteria was that the reduction be sustainable. So  while the objective was achieved  the special incentive will be held in reserve until 31 March 2024. The committee has not awarded a similar incentive for FY24.We continue to focus on improving our disclosure on executive remuneration  in line with shareholder feedback and our bid for greater transparency. In addition to disclosing STI goals and achievements for FY23  we now disclose related targets retrospectively.Distributions to shareholdersShareholders approved the distribution to holders of ordinary shares N of:7 euro cents per share should the proposed transaction be implemented. Shareholders holding their ordinary shares N in South Africa via Strate will then receive a gross distribution of 141.428 Rand cents per ordinary share N; alternatively 15 euro cents per share should the proposed transaction not be implemented. Shareholders holding their ordinary shares N in South Africa via Strate will then receive a gross distribution of 303.06 Rand cents per ordinary share N.Dividends and capital repayments are declared and paid in euros. The above amounts are based on an EUR/ZAR exchange rate of R20.204 as at 23 August 2023. Further details regarding the distribution will be published once the Proposed Transaction is implemented.Looking forward with confidenceOur purpose is unchanged – we aim to improve everyday life for people around the world by building leading companies that use technology to meet societal needs in better ways. At the heart of our purpose is our commitment to being a responsible business that has a sustainable  positive impact on the world and operates under high standards of corporate governance.JSE sponsor to Prosus:Investec Bank LimitedEuronext listing agentING Bank N.V.Euronext paying agentABN AMRO Bank N.V.About ProsusProsus is a global consumer internet group and one of the largest technology investors in the world.

The data include a first-of-its kind study titled  ""A Natural History Study of Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP): 12-Month Outcomes "" highlighting one-year data on the natural progression of FOP and the impact of heterotopic ossification (HO) on patients' physical functioning over time.1 Ipsen and its partners also shared several studies detailing findings from health economics and outcomes research on the management of acromegaly.FOP is an ultra-rare  severely disabling genetic bone disease that affects approximately 1.36 per million individuals worldwide.2 3 FOP is characterized by formation of bone in soft and connective tissues  known as heterotopic ossification (HO).4 Sporadic episodes of painful soft tissue swelling called 'flare-ups' can precede HO.4 HO is permanent  cumulative and severely impacts physical function over time with most patients' movement becoming extremely limited  often confining them to a wheelchair by their twenties.4The prospective Natural History Study (NHS) of FOP is the first global  multicenter  longitudinal study designed to measure disease progression over three years.1 Participant selection was representative of the FOP community worldwide and includes 114 patients with FOP who harbor a documented ACVR1 mutation  of those 99 (55 male / 44 female; mean age of group: 17.4 years) had both baseline and 12-month assessments and were included in the analysis. Ninety-three of the 99 participants had evaluable whole-body computed tomography and were included in the HO analysis.1The analysis showed that over the course of 12 months  40% (37/93) of participants had new HO.1 Of the NHS participants with new HO  65% (24/37) reported at least one flare-up (mean rate of 2.3 flare-ups/year).1 60% (56/93) of NHS participants did not experience new HO over 12 months.1 Of those participants  43% (24/56) reported at least one flare-up (mean rate of 1.8 flare-ups/year).1 CAJIS and FOP-PFQ were not sufficiently sensitive to assess FOP disease progression over 12 months.""The results show that evaluating HO may be a viable way to measure disease progression and potential treatment effect "" said study co-investigator and co-author  Mona Al Mukaddam  M.D.  MS of the Center for Research in FOP and Related Disorders  Perelman School of Medicine  University of Pennsylvania. ""By examining the natural course of FOP  we hope to better understand the physical burden of HO as well as the link between flare-ups and disease progression.""Additional abstracts published in the Journal of the Endocrine Society included data on the management of patients living with FOP or acromegaly.5-11""Our research reinforces Ipsen's commitment to actively listen to and work with patients  physicians  nurses  patient association groups  and other key stakeholders to best address the complexity and challenges of living with rare diseases such as FOP or acromegaly "" said Jim Roach  M.D.  Senior Vice President and Global Head  Rare Diseases Therapeutic Area at Ipsen. ""These diseases impact the quality of life both for patients and their caregivers and often place economic and societal burdens due to absences from work and high healthcare costs. Enhancing our understanding of these diseases will hopefully allow us to develop solutions that meaningfully impact patients.""Overview of Ipsen data accepted by ENDO 2020:Medicine/Disease Abstract Number/Title Study Authors FOP OR29-05 - A Natural History Study of Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP): 12-Month Outcomes 1 Mona Al Mukaddam  Robert J.

Biotalys continues to work with the EPA as it reviews the submitted regulatory dossier. Pending regulatory approval  Biotalys is preparing for the start of the market calibration with Evoca in 2024 and for the launch of the commercial version of the product in 2026. In Europe  the rapporteur Member State is The Netherlands where the CTGB(Collegevoorde ToelatingGewasbeschermingsmiddelenenBiociden) is currently reviewing the regulatory dossier. Importantly  the authority has recently approved the sale of cucumbers treated with Evoca in greenhouse trials. While normally crops used in such trials have to be destroyed  as they are treated with products that are not yet authorized  the Dutch authority granted an exemption allowing sale of cucumbers treated with Evoca in greenhouse trials.

The full half year report including the interim financial results is available here on the Biotalys website.Patrice Sellès  Chief Executive Officer of Biotalys  noted: “Throughout the first half of 2023  Biotalys made significant progress in the buildup of its pipeline  technology and platform validation with industry leaders. We are continuing to work with the EPA to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. for Evoca  the company’s first biocontrol solution  to help address the needs of growers seeking safer tools to make their crop protection strategies more sustainable. At the same time  we are working with partners on the future market positioning of Evoca  as well as on continuing to improve cost of goods for this important first product.”H1 2023 operational highlightsIn the first half of this year  Biotalys continued to seal partnerships  prepare for the launch of Evoca  and strengthen its patent portfolio.Regulatory update for EvocaThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently changed its review process and no longer sets dates for expected decisions to applicants.

Biotalys continues to work with the EPA as it reviews the submitted regulatory dossier. Pending regulatory approval  Biotalys is preparing for the start of the market calibration with Evoca in 2024 and for the launch of the commercial version of the product in 2026. In Europe  the rapporteur Member State is The Netherlands where the CTGB (College voor de Toelating Gewasbeschermingsmiddelen en Biociden) is currently reviewing the regulatory dossier. Importantly  the authority has recently approved the sale of cucumbers treated with Evoca in greenhouse trials. While normally crops used in such trials have to be destroyed  as they are treated with products that are not yet authorized  the Dutch authority granted an exemption allowing sale of cucumbers treated with Evoca in greenhouse trials. This decision reinforces Biotalys’ confidence that the product is safe to use.Private placementIn June 2023  Biotalys successfully closed a private placement for €7 million.

Racism  sexism and income inequality.,"Back in the day  when VH1 primarily showed music videos  it had a segment dedicated to music from the 1960s where they would show iconic images of the decade set to songs like Smokey Robinson’s “The Tears of a Clown” or The Who’s “My Generation.” Even though I was a Gen Xer  I loved the music of those who had come before me  as the sounds of the 60s spoke to all the anxieties of that time — war  assassinations  rampant violence and discrimination  and civil unrest — mixed with the new anxieties of the late 80s into the 1990s. That time brought us the AIDS crisis  the crack epidemic  the last terrifying gasps of the Cold War until the Berlin Wall fell  the looming recession and fears around war in the Middle East.It was a turbulent time  just as it had been for those who had come before. But for some reasons  instead of seeing the similarities between what led to the Civil Rights  anti-war and anti-poverty movements of the 1960s and 70s  many publications and people were focused on shaming Gen X for being unmotivated “slackers” who only wanted their MTV and not much else.AdvertisementBut why the obsession with Gen X’s perceived “failures” when we were still just kids? Why were we being compared to boomers anyway? Did people even write elaborate treatises on how the the Greatest Generation’s stiff upper lip had been oh-so-much stiffer than their more sexually liberal  idol-smashing scions  or was this all more recent  tied to the advent of television and other game-changing technology that had rapidly developed post the Industrial Revolution? How did we even get started talking about generations when  in the end  they’re mostly meaningless concoctions that divide us and explain almost nothing?If Gen X was the first generation  fueled by cynicism  to stare into the abyss  unblinking and unimpressed  then we wouldn’t (and couldn’t) be the last. Because it was never about us being the generation of disappointment compared to our successful Boomer parents. Literally most “generations” in American society had known mostly disappointment with slow  stymied progress. Boomers were the outliers  but not for the reasons they or the media told us — but because they got to benefit from something no generation before them and no generation after ever got.A break.The Civil War left the U.S. in shambles. WWI and isolationism took its toll. The Great Depression did no one any favors  but it did do one solid for boomers — it was so bad that a plurality of the public  government  and industry were aligned on how it couldn’t happen again  so labor unions were strengthened  laws were passed and protections were put in place after the collapse of the stock market  and those changes were in favor of…regular people with jobs. The creation of those protections continued well into Lyndon B. Johnson’s “Great Society” plan.""If Gen X was the first generation  fueled by cynicism  to stare into the abyss  unblinking and unimpressed  then we wouldn’t (and couldn’t) be the last."" Getty ImagesAdvertisementSo if boomers were the first generation to actually benefit from any kind of social safety net  Gen X was the first generation to come out after the winners of our new  protected society and started chipping away at their own protections under the guise of “enough of all that!”Gen X was told it was a failure to launch kind of generation. Many of us had to move back home after college as there wasn’t much viable work to be found in the recession of 1990-91  which was marked by a “jobless recovery.” We were told we’d be the first generation to do “worse” than our Boomer parents  and it was all our fault. We picked “frivolous” majors in college and were saddled with crazy student loan debt. We just didn’t have whatever “it” was that the previous generation purported to have.Of course  that all turned out to be garbage. Gen X would go on to innovate in tech  culture and business to incredible gains once the economy started to turn around. Also  Gen X wasn’t initially struggling because they were cynical or lazy — they were struggling because our economy had only gotten more favorable to the wealthy in the 1980s under Reaganomics. Jobs were rapidly moving overseas. The “trickle down” method wasn’t even a trickle  as the wealth gap was increasing and protections for bank consumers were loosening. Prices for everything went up but wages remained stagnant  and many conservative politicians believed the only way to alleviate the pain was to lessen taxes for social programs  and get rid of any semblance of a social safety net under the guise of punishing “welfare queens” and rewarding the wealthy.Somehow  that didn’t actually alleviate anything  leading to the rise of Democrat Bill Clinton after a fractured  three-way election for president in 1992 thanks to then-Republican President George H.W. Bush being pegged as “out of touch” on the economy. This was due to the realization that  as a wealthy man who had spent most of his adult life in either public service or the oil industry  the former president didn’t even know how to work a barcode scanner at the grocery store.AdvertisementTraders watch the morning board as Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson visits the New York Stock Exchange trading floor with NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan L. Niederauer on Jan. 8  2008. TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty ImagesBut something strange happened after Gen X ascended to the middle of the generational food chain (still behind boomers  who control half of the nation’s $140 trillion in wealth)  millennials showed up  yet history seemed to be in reruns. As Gen X had proven to actually be “hard workers” who helped create our tech-savvy world  millennials were the new kids to knock for having to move back home after college  unable to find work in … you guessed it … the 2001 recession and the 2007 economic collapse  aka “The Great Recession” that lasted until 2009 and was marked by even more income inequality  the 2008 subprime loan crisis and rising costs.Somehow  everyone was making the exact same mistake. Countless stories came out in the press railing these “whiny” and “entitled” kids who were “ruined” because they’d grown up receiving “participation trophies” and were “helicopter parented” to the point of uselessness. It was everyone else’s fault BUT the economy  which had only become more volatile as  again  the social safety net was further stripped away under Clinton and banks were allowed to run rampant with little recourse or protections for consumers under the mistaken belief that if you roll back protections  the savings will “trickle down” to the poors.It didn’t trickle down  as wealth continued to become more concentrated at the top. Millennials  like Gen X before  watched their dreams of paying off student loans or buying homes become more and more fraught. Marriage and children also seemed off the table. Births and weddings declined because who could afford a family now?Fast forward to today  and the generation on the media chopping block are Gen Zers. A lot is talked about how diverse Gen Zers are  and how upset they happened to be  as they are inheriting a complete and total mess. A mess of an economy (where they too cannot afford rent)  a mess of the environment as storms and wildfires ravage communities in the U.S. and extreme drought plagues other parts of our planet  and social stratification that seems insurmountable as even amassing any kind of wealth seems impossible  again  Boomers holding on to all of it and only dying to pass it on to their children — meaning none of this wealth is likely to “trickle down” on anyone but those who’ve always been wealthy.AdvertisementWhile some have decried Gen Zers as  again  lazy  whiny  entitled babies who are “triggered” by everything and are ruining all with their “wokeness” and gender fluidity  for the first time  most in the media aren’t screaming about how dysfunctional Gen Z is  but of how unobtainable success is for most young Americans due to rising inflation and stagnant wages. Americans are spending more than 30% of their household income on rent  meaning less money for savings  less money to buy homes  less money to invest in the future  less money for everything. And student loan debt is a monster  as our youth are trapped in a bind that’s been going on at least since the advent of Gen X — go into debt to get a fancy degree in hopes of landing a lucrative job and STILL be unable to pay off your loans  or don’t go into debt and face being left out of the economy altogether  as most high-wage blue-collar jobs are either nonexistent and out of reach or not realistic for a generation weaned on flat screens  cellular phones and remote work.People celebrate on World War II Victory Day with a newspaper headline reading  ""Nazis Quit!"" Bettmann via Getty ImagesOf course someone  somewhere will bring up the boomers — the apparent standard all modern generations must be compared to  due to all the accomplishments  gains and wealth they amassed thanks to the GI Bill and actual social safety net meant to lift people out of poverty after WWII and the Great Depression. Everything from Social Security to welfare to Medicaid and Medicare to low tuition costs and benefits for returning soldiers  as well as public works programs and other numerous blue-collar union jobs  led to a boom unseen before in American history. For some dumb reason  we all get compared to this — as if this were the standard instead of a magical blip in time  a fluke from people actually giving a shit about the poor and putting standards and protections in place after banks had run amok and ruined everything during the economic collapse of the late 1920s.It seems that if you actually protect people — even if it’s just some of the people  as welfare programs and Social Security originally only benefited white people until the laws of the 1960s forced companies and individuals to actually pay Black people their fair share and respect their full citizenship — it helps everyone. The economy rallies. People buy homes. People have families. People get married. People live fruitful  prosperous lives and can change the world for the better.But our society didn’t learn that lesson. It fell for the division created by former President Ronald Reagan and other Republicans who sought to galvanize the aggrieved white voter  angry over the progress the Civil Rights and women’s rights movements of the 1960s and 70s had made. This has just been one long  expensive backlash to  essentially  birth control and integration. But rather than see this farce for what it is  some would rather blame the victims of an economy meant to keep them trapped in debt. It’s everyone’s fault — the “invisible” Gen Xers  the “greedy” boomers  the “spoiled” millennials  and the “triggered” Gen Zers — BUT our elected officials  leaders  corporations and their cheerleaders of all ages and generations who created this byzantine system meant to steal wealth from the bottom and reward it to those up top.A wise man once said about young people: “What is happening to our young people? They disrespect their elders  they disobey their parents. They ignore the law. They riot in the streets  inflamed with wild notions. Their morals are decaying. What is to become of them?”That wise man was Plato. He died around 347 BC.""This con is as old as antiquity  this need to blame young people for their lot in life when they did not create the world they’re presently living in and contending with."" FPG via Getty ImagesAdvertisementMeaning  this con is as old as antiquity  this need to blame young people for their lot in life when they did not create the world they’re presently living in and contending with. Generations of people before them created this mess  together  over time — and they  like the generations before  were simply responding to it. Any differences that appear across generations are largely superficial. Even Pew Research has changed how it reports on generations upon realization of how reactionary and muddled this work has become.Gen Xers  millennials  Gen Zers and Gen Alpha aren’t any more lazy than boomers are competent. Boomers merely benefited from the laws enacted by their parents and predecessors out of the incredible horror that was the Great Depression. Once all those laws started to get rolled back because politicians and their supporters incorrectly attributed their gains to “rugged individualism” instead of “a functioning social safety net ” we were all told to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps despite having no strap or boot to our names.It’s all a con. All a game to keep history in reruns so those who have always benefited will benefit and those who have been shut out will stay that way.This is a fight for (and against) the status quo.In order for progress to remain and for us to not continue to slide backwards we have to get beyond manufactured generational warfare  fomented by those who seek to keep us so busy fighting amongst ourselves we lose site of the true enemy — inequality  racism  sexism  homophobia  transphobia  ignorance and discrimination all coming together to form the system brought to you by the likes of where “crass capitalism” and “white supremacy” meet. We don’t have to fall for the same “snowflake” gag over and over again.The problem is rooted in all of us — all of us who don’t participate in our system out of cynicism. All of us who vote against our interests because the only real interest is “racism.” All of us who’d rather throw jabs at generations as if the same jabs weren’t thrown at us before when we were the rude  lazy  hot young thing on the block.AdvertisementIt’s time to learn our history  y’all  because I don’t know how much more we can take repeating it before we repeat our way into oldies but baddies like “widespread civil unrest ” “war ” and “economic collapse.” As someone who does study history  I can name a few things you probably wouldn’t want to relive.",neutral,0.09,0.51,0.4,mixed,0.09,0.22,0.68,True,English,"['Generation', 'Scapegoat', 'America', 'Failures', 'Republican President George H.W.

Revenue growth on a like-for-like basis of 7.0%.Group EBITDA decreased by 5.6% to €621.4m  impacted by lower subsidies  high salary and procurement inflation and staff shortage challenges.Group share of net result after tax of €49.4m or 1.1% of revenue more than halved compared to the prior year of €118.4m from lower operating result and increased cost of debt.Cost control measures reinforced to address current economic headwinds impacting the sector  to pursue our “Yes We Care 2025” strategy implementing global patient pathways  and to maintain our leadership as a European integrated care provider.Slight reduction of the net debt to €3 670m including IFRS16 liabilities  from working capital improvement linked to collection of past subsidies.The company became a mission-driven company at the Annual General Meeting of December 8  2022  and the appointments of the members of its mission committee were approved by the Board of Directors on June 20  2023.Ramsay Santé has maintained its actions to participate in the support of the French and Nordic countries healthcare systems and to complement public hospital capacity to cope with demand pressures.Continued commitment to enhancing care accessibility through out-of-hospital services (primary care  imaging  specialised care consultations  home care) supported a return to activity growth overall with a 4.4% increase in patient admissions in our hospital facilities and 1.6 million additional patient consultations in our Nordic primary care centres over the previous year.Activity levels in France and the Nordics have been solid. Annual revenue amounted to €4 701.5m  up 9.3% on a reported basis  and +7.0% on a like-for-like basis. France revenue has grown by 6.8% supported by a 4.0% increase in admissions volumes  higher tariffs applicable since 1 st March 2023 and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue. This is despite 3 fewer business days this financial year compared to the previous one. Nordic countries revenue grew by 15.2% (+7.8% on a like-for-like basis) supported by an additional €202m contribution from recent acquisitions including GHP and was mainly realised in the proximity care and specialist care activities in both Sweden and Denmark.March 2023 and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue. This is despite 3 fewer business days this financial year compared to the previous one. Nordic countries revenue grew by 15.2% (+7.8% on a like-for-like basis) supported by an additional €202m contribution from recent acquisitions including GHP and was mainly realised in the proximity care and specialist care activities in both Sweden and Denmark. The group consolidated EBITDA decreased by 5.6% or €37m to €621.4m (last year €658.4m) with a margin of 13.2% (last year 15.3%)  mainly due to the €89m decrease of Covid-related government subsidies and of the French revenue guarantee  partly offset by further cost control actions.Cost of net financial debt increased by €23.6m or 19.1% reflecting higher funding costs and including a €3.0m increase in IFRS16 lease debt interest expense.Net profit for the Group share dropped to €49.4m or 1.1% of revenue (last year €118.4m or 2.8% of revenue)  impacted by lower operational margins and reflecting increased funding costs. It includes a non-recurring €31.0m (€24.2m net of tax) capital gain for the sale of land adjacent to one of our facilities in Norway as part of transactions restructuring the real estate of this site.Ramsay Santé has continued to invest in initiatives enabling its “Yes We Care 2025” strategy in addition to recurring investment on maintenance  optimisation and facilities portfolio improvement  resulting in total capital expenditure for the year of €165.1m net of proceeds from disposals and of lease financing  slightly below last year.Net cash flow from operating activities of €598.9m versus €262.5m last year reflects the effort on working capital management and the collection during the period of Covid-related subsidies recognised in the prior year.Net financial debt as at 30 June 2023 amounted to €3 670.0m  including €2 141.5m of IFRS16 lease liabilities. During the first semester of this fiscal year  Ramsay Santé successfully issued a new Fiducie tranche for €150m.Ramsay Santé has become a mission-driven company  making access to care for all patients a central part of its business model. This decision reflects its firm resolve to place the public interest at the heart of all its day-to-day actions.The Group aims to make this mission a lever for action in the face of the accelerating pace of all the challenges currently affecting healthcare. Alongside its purpose added to the Group's by-laws (""Improve health through constant innovation"")  four social and environmental objectives will guide the implementation of its policies and innovation  objectives whose implementation will be followed by the Mission Committee that has been set up.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:“As a mission-driven company since December 2022  Ramsay Santé demonstrates and reaffirms the core identity of the organisation to cater for the healthcare needs of the general population as a whole. This mission seals the company’s commitment to orchestrate safer and simpler care pathways  from prevention to follow-up. The group has continued its development in accordance with this goal by caring for nearly 12 million patients in 2022-23 in our various countries and activities. We are now more than ever caring for all patients with any pathology  offering physical and digital solutions  and operating in full complementarity with all the other care professionals. The transfer of best practices and innovation in healthcare between countries enables the continuous implementation of our differentiating strategy as a global healthcare operator and healthcare pathways coordinator  which is positive for our patients  our payors  and the organisation.With respect to financial results  revenue growth of 9.3% was primarily driven organically  the operating margin - EBITDA - was down to 13.2% vs 15.3% last year  in a context of high inflation  lower subsidies  and despite the initiation of cost control measures.”These provisional accounts were presented to the Board of Directors at its meeting on23rd August 2023. The audit process is in progress. The final consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30  2023 will be approved by the Board of Directors at a meeting scheduled for October 2023.Summary of resultsP&L – in € millions From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 Variation Revenue 4 701.5 4 301.0 +9.3% EBITDA 621.4 658.4 -5.6% As a % of revenue +13.2% +15.3% -2.1 pts Current Operating Result 218.2 281.1 -22.4% As a % of revenue +4.6% +6.5% -1.9 pts Operating Profit 240.4 291.3 -17.5% As a % of revenue +5.1% +6.8% -1.7 pts Net income  Group Share 49.4 118.4 -58.3% Earnings per share (in €) 0.45 1.07 -57.9%Net Financial Debt – in € millions From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 Non-current financial liabilities 1 893.8 1 763.6 Non-current lease liability 1 928.0 1 922.3 Current lease liability 213.5 196.0 Current financial liabilities 58.8 35.4 (Cash and cash equivalents) (352.2) (132.5) Other financial (assets) & liabilities (71.9) (74.9) Net financial debt 3 670.0 3 709.9Cash Flow Statement – in € millions From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 EBITDA 621.4 658.4 Change in working capital requirements 53.5 (337.9) Net cash flow from operating activities 598.9 262.5 Net cash flow from/(used in) investing activities (175.4) (471.1) Net cash flow from/(used in) financing activities (197.1) (264.2) Change in net cash position 226.4 (472.8) Closing cash and cash equivalents 352.2 132.5Breakdown of revenue by operating segmentIn € million From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 Variation Île-de-France 1 127.7 1 057.9 +6.6% Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes 633.1 579.6 +9.2% Hauts de France 413.2 393.4 +5.0% Occitanie 287.3 271.6 +5.8% Other regions 746.2 701.0 +6.4% Nordic countries 1 494.0 1 297.4 +15.2% Reported Revenue 4 701.5 4 301.0 +9.3%Note : The table above details the contributions of the various operating segments to the Group's consolidated revenue.Changes in reported revenue from the financial year ended 30 June 202 2 to the financial yearended 30 June 202 3 .Reported revenue30 June 2022 Changes in FX rates Acquisitions and disposals Organic growth Reported revenue30 June 2023 Variation In € millions 4.301.0 (106.7) 205.8 301.4 4.701.5 400.5 (2.5)% 4.8% 7.0% +9.3%Significant events of the financial year:FranceRamsay Santé's hospitals in France continued to operate under the French Government's revenue guarantee arrangements  which supported the business for the use of its facilities and services during the Covid pandemic and helped compensate its negative effects on activity. The structure of the arrangements up until 31 December 2022 were similar to prior periods  however the decree covering the calendar year 2022 excluded mental health services now reimbursed under a bundled payment structure. The French Government prolonged its support to the industry through a modified revenue guarantee scheme for the calendar year up to 31 December 2023. This new guarantee amounts to 70% of the 2022 guarantee (tariff adjusted) plus 30% of the period billings.The amount of the revenue guarantee recognised by the Group for the year ending 30 June 2023 amounts to €89 million (€99 million for the previous year) and was reported as “Other operating income”.Furthermore  compensation grants for additional costs related to COVID were recognised for €24.6 million (€89.8 million for the previous financial year) as “Other operating income”. Given the time lag between when costs are incurred by facilities and the notification by the Regional Health Authorities of the corresponding subsidies  all of those compensation subsidies reported during the period (€27.5 million in the previous year) correspond to financing for additional costs incurred during the previous financial year  a situation similar to that of last year.In addition to those Covid-related subsidies  specific grants totalling of €45m were extended to the French facilities to fund inflation that had not been sized in the applicable 2022 tariffs  as well as national healthcare staff salary increases applicable from 1st July 2022.The group continued its expansion in its core strategic development areas:On 1st March 2023  the Ange Gardien mental health clinic re-opened its doors following an extensive redevelopment of the facility and merger with the neighbouring Perreuse clinic into a single expanded modern site. The 232 beds and 15 day places will significantly enhance the mental health services proposed to the greater eastern Ile-de-France region.Two primary care centres opened their doors in late 2022 in France and the Haussmann medical centre in central Paris joined the Ramsay Santé network in January 2023.Nordics countriesThe positive development trend in adding listed patients into our Proximity care business has continued in both Sweden and Denmark through a dedicated work to improve both availability and attractivity in our facilities  whereas Norway is concentrating on the integration of the bolt-on acquisitions completed during the prior year. Patient demand in our Specialist care facilities in all countries has been increasing. The integration the GHP business acquired in May 2022 is progressing according to plan and synergies have been realised as expected to date. Finally  Capio has started operating two new geriatrics care contracts in Stockholm on 1st May 2023 representing an annual turnover of approximately €50m  and St Göran has opened its new maternity ward in Stockholm on 1st April 2023.Scope of consolidationRamsay Santé completed 2 small bolt-on acquisitions in Scandinavia during the year  complementing and expanding the scope of the Group's services. Together with the Haussmann medical centre which joined the primary care network in France  these acquisitions represented a total net investment of €7 million.Comments on the annual accountsActivity and revenue :Activity and revenue in France and the Nordic countries have grown across the board reflecting sustained patient demand and the capacity of the group’s facilities to provide more care services despite staffing challenges from competition for nursing staff in Europe. Ramsay Santé Group reported a consolidated revenue of €4 701.5m for the financial year ended 30 June 2023  up 9.3% on a reported basis. Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  revenue for the year ended 30 June 2023 was up with a solid 7.0% organic sales growth.France revenue has grown by 6.8% supported by an increase in volumes and in revenue medical purchases rechargeable revenue  despite 3 fewer business days this year compared to FY22 and the continuing shift towards a greater ambulatory care mix.France total admissions in our hospitals rose by 4.0% with volumes growth on all business lines  extending and confirming the post-Covid positive dynamics from late FY22  after a slow start in FY23:+3.0% in MSO (medicine  surgery and obstetrics)+11.4% in FCR (follow-up care and rehabilitation)+5.3% in mental healthOur French facilities managed approximately 720 000 emergency presentations this year  confirming their important role in delivering on public service missions.Nordic countries revenue grew by 15.2% supported by acquisitions made in FY22 which contributed €202m of additional revenue  including GHP. Organic revenue growth in the Nordic countries for the year ending 30 June 2023 was +7.8% on a like-for-like basis from continued positive revenue growth in the proximity care and specialist care activities in both Sweden and Denmark  together with the contribution of new contracts. Foreign exchange fluctuation has negatively impacted revenue by €106.7m.Patient admissions in our Nordic countries hospital facilities increased by 9.7% and the organic growth of patients listed in our proximity care centres was 3.5%.Results:EBITDA reached €621.4m for the financial year ending 30 June 2023  down €37m or 5.6% on prior year on a reported basis.The Group's EBITDA as at 30 June 2023 includes €88.9m (last year €99.1m) related to the revenue guarantee described in the paragraph “Significant events of the financial year” above  as well as cost compensations for Covid surcharges in France and Sweden of €33.2m (last year €111.7m). Those Covid-related grants tapered off from levels received in prior years as the Covid pandemic intensity greatly abated over the course of the financial year.EBITDA and margins were also driven down by inflationary pressures sustained from the impact of the effort made on the compensations and benefits made to our medical staff as well as overall operating expenditure price increases  in particular on energy and outsourced services. Ramsay Santé received funding from the French government which only partially covered procurement and wages inflation through €45m dedicated grants then followed by tariff increases from 1 March 2023. A similar pattern occurred in the Nordic countries where cost inflation outstripped the price revisions obtained from the different payors.EBITDA has a benefited from organic growth contribution on margins and from more stability in volumes growth over the year allowing for a greater focus on operational efficiency.Cost control measures were initiated to adapt activities to the current inflation environment and resources allocation are also revisited as a consequence.Underlying current operating profit amounted to €218.2m for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 (or 4.6% of revenue)  down 22.4% on the previous year.Other non-current income and expenses represent a net income of €22.2m for the year ending 30 June 2023 (last year €10.2m)  consisting mainly of a €31.0m profit on the sale of a property adjacent to a hospital in Norway that is to be redeveloped.The cost of net financial debt amounted to €147.1m for the year ending 30 June 2023  compared with €123.5 million the previous year  driven by higher funding costs. The impact of financial instruments recorded in P&L was a €5.5m income (€22.5m income last year)  contributing to a further €17.0m increase in the net interest expense on the prior year. In accordance with IFRS 16  the Group recorded a financial interest expense of €75.3m related to lease debt (€72.3m the previous year).The Group’s share of net income for the year ended 30 June 2023 amounted to €49.4m  or 1.1% of revenue  compared with €118.4m last year.Impact from IFRS16 Lease :Reported EBITDA of €621.4m in accordance with IFRS16 excludes contracted lease expenses for €239.8m which are instead recorded as amortisation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease debt as outlined in the table below. The increase in the lease accounting impact on the prior year primarily came from the full-year contribution of FY22 acquisitions  as well as the effect of contractual price revisions.EUR millions30 June 202330 June 2022Δ IFRS16 Impact Pre-IFRS16 IFRS16 Impact Pre-IFRS16 Impact EBITDA621.4 239.8 381.6658.4 219.1 439.320.7 Depreciation & amortisation (403.2) (192.3) (210.9) (377.3) (175.4) (201.9) (16.9) EBIT before non-current items 218.2 47.5 170.7 281.1 43.7 237.4 3.8 Net interest expense (152.7) (72.7) (80.0) (106.1) (69.4) (36.7) (3.3) Net profit after tax 63.9 (18.9) 82.8 127.8 (19.1) 146.9 0.2Cash-flow and fi nancing :Net financial debt on 30 June 2023 was €3 670.0m compared with €3 709.9m on 30 June 2022. Net debt includes €1 893.8m in non-current borrowings and €58.8m in current borrowings  offset by €352.2m in cash and cash equivalents.The application of IFRS 16 to leases contributed €2 141.5m to net financial debt at 30 June 2023  of which €1 928.0m was non-current lease debt and €213.5m was current lease debt.Net cash increased by €219.7m over the period with a €186m contribution from increased borrowings. The cash flow from operating activities benefited from a favourable working capital variation encompassing the collection of subsidies recognised in the prior year.Total net capital expenditure for the year of €165.1m was slightly below last year’s €175.4m and included maintenance and optimisation  as well as improvement on our portfolio of clinics. This covers the maternity expansion of St Göran as well as significant effort to roll out our strategy to increase Ramsay Santé’s imaging assets portfolio  to invest on digital tools  amongst which the new version of the Ramsay Services portal  and to acquire new equipment such as surgical robots for our French clinics.During the first half of this fiscal year  Ramsay Santé carried out a new tranche of Fiducie debt for a total financing amount of €150m  diversifying its funding sources and maturity profiles  as well as aligning it with the sustainable development strategy of the group through an indexation to ESG criteria.About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.

Revenue growth on a like-for-like basis of 7.0%.Group EBITDA decreasedby 5.6% to €621.4m  impacted by lower subsidies  high salary and procurement inflation and staff shortage challenges.Group share of net result after tax of €49.4m or 1.1% of revenue more than halved compared to the prior year of €118.4m from lower operating result and increased cost of debt.Cost control measures reinforced to address current economic headwinds impacting the sector  to pursue our “Yes We Care 2025”strategy implementing global patient pathways and to maintain our leadership as a European integrated care provider.Slight reduction of the net debt to €3 670m including IFRS16 liabilities  from working capital improvement linked to collection of past subsidies.The company became a mission-driven company at the Annual General Meeting of December 8  2022  and the appointments of the members of its mission committee were approved by the Board of Directors on June 20  2023.Ramsay Santé has maintained its actions to participate in the support of the French and Nordic countries healthcare systems and to complement public hospital capacity to cope with demand pressures.Continued commitment to enhancing care accessibility through out-of-hospital services (primary care  imaging  specialised care consultations  home care) supported a return to activity growth overall with a 4.4% increase in patient admissions in our hospital facilities and 1.6 million additional patient consultations in our Nordic primary care centres over the previous year.Activity levels in France and the Nordics have been solid. Annual revenue amounted to €4 701.5m  up 9.3% on a reported basis  and +7.0% on a like-for-like basis. France revenue has grown by 6.8% supported by a 4.0% increase in admissions volumes  higher tariffs applicable since 1 st March 2023 and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue. This is despite 3 fewer business days this financial year compared to the previous one. Nordic countries revenue grew by 15.2% (+7.8% on a like-for-like basis) supported by an additional €202m contribution from recent acquisitions including GHP and was mainly realised in the proximity care and specialist care activities in both Sweden and Denmark.March 2023 and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue. This is despite 3 fewer business days this financial year compared to the previous one. Nordic countries revenue grew by 15.2% (+7.8% on a like-for-like basis) supported by an additional €202m contribution from recent acquisitions including GHP and was mainly realised in the proximity care and specialist care activities in both Sweden and Denmark. The group consolidated EBITDA decreased by 5.6% or €37m to €621.4m (last year €658.4m) with a margin of 13.2% (last year 15.3%)  mainly due to the €89m decrease of Covid-related government subsidies and of the French revenue guarantee  partly offset by further cost control actions.Cost of net financial debt increased by €23.6m or 19.1% reflecting higher funding costs and including a €3.0m increase in IFRS16 lease debt interest expense.Net profit for the Group share dropped to €49.4m or 1.1% of revenue (last year €118.4m or 2.8% of revenue)  impacted by lower operational margins and reflecting increased funding costs. It includes a non-recurring €31.0m (€24.2m net of tax) capital gain for the sale of land adjacent to one of our facilities in Norway as part of transactions restructuring the real estate of this site.Ramsay Santé has continued to invest in initiatives enabling its “Yes We Care 2025” strategy in addition to recurring investment on maintenance  optimisation and facilities portfolio improvement  resulting in total capital expenditure for the year of €165.1m net of proceeds from disposals and of lease financing  slightly below last year.Net cash flow from operating activities of €598.9m versus €262.5m last year reflects the effort on working capital management and the collection during the period of Covid-related subsidies recognised in the prior year.Net financial debt as at 30 June 2023 amounted to €3 670.0m  including €2 141.5m of IFRS16 lease liabilities. During the first semester of this fiscal year  Ramsay Santé successfully issued a new Fiducie tranche for €150m.Ramsay Santé has become a mission-driven company  making access to care for all patients a central part of its business model. This decision reflects its firm resolve to place the public interest at the heart of all its day-to-day actions.The Group aims to make this mission a lever for action in the face of the accelerating pace of all the challenges currently affecting healthcare. Alongside its purpose added to the Group's by-laws (""Improve health through constant innovation"")  four social and environmental objectives will guide the implementation of its policies and innovation  objectives whose implementation will be followed by the Mission Committee that has been set up.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:“As a mission-driven company since December 2022  Ramsay Santé demonstrates and reaffirms the core identity of the organisation to cater for the healthcare needs of the general population as a whole. This mission seals the company’s commitment to orchestratesafer and simpler care pathways  from prevention to follow-up. The group has continued its development in accordance with this goal by caring for nearly 12 million patients in 2022-23 in our various countries and activities. We are now more than ever caring for all patients with any pathology  offering physical and digital solutions  and operating in full complementarity with all the other care professionals. The transfer of best practices and innovation in healthcare between countries enables the continuous implementation of our differentiating strategy as a global healthcare operator and healthcare pathways coordinator  which is positive for our patients  our payors  and the organisation.With respect to financial results  revenue growth of 9.3% was primarily driven organically  the operating margin - EBITDA - was down to 13.2% vs 15.3% last year  in a context of high inflation  lower subsidies  and despite the initiation of cost control measures.”These provisional accounts were presented to the Board of Directors at its meeting on23rd August 2023. The audit process is in progress. The final consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30  2023 will be approved by the Board of Directors at a meeting scheduled for October 2023.Summary of resultsP&L – in € millions From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 Variation Revenue 4 701.5 4 301.0 +9.3% EBITDA 621.4 658.4 -5.6% As a % of revenue +13.2% +15.3% -2.1 pts Current Operating Result 218.2 281.1 -22.4% As a % of revenue +4.6% +6.5% -1.9 pts Operating Profit 240.4 291.3 -17.5% As a % of revenue +5.1% +6.8% -1.7 pts Net income  Group Share 49.4 118.4 -58.3% Earnings per share (in €) 0.45 1.07 -57.9%Net Financial Debt–in € millions From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 Non-current financial liabilities 1 893.8 1 763.6 Non-current lease liability 1 928.0 1 922.3 Current lease liability 213.5 196.0 Current financial liabilities 58.8 35.4 (Cash and cash equivalents) (352.2) (132.5) Other financial (assets) & liabilities (71.9) (74.9) Net financial debt 3 670.0 3 709.9Cash Flow Statement –in € millions From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 EBITDA 621.4 658.4 Change in working capital requirements 53.5 (337.9) Net cash flow from operating activities 598.9 262.5 Net cash flow from/(used in) investing activities (175.4) (471.1) Net cash flow from/(used in) financing activities (197.1) (264.2) Change in net cash position 226.4 (472.8) Closing cash and cash equivalents 352.2 132.5Breakdown of revenue by operatingsegmentIn € million From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 Variation Île-de-France 1 127.7 1 057.9 +6.6% Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes 633.1 579.6 +9.2% Hauts de France 413.2 393.4 +5.0% Occitanie 287.3 271.6 +5.8% Other regions 746.2 701.0 +6.4% Nordic countries 1 494.0 1 297.4 +15.2% ReportedRevenue 4 701.5 4 301.0 +9.3%Note : The table above details the contributions of the various operating segmentsto the Group's consolidatedrevenue.Changes in reported revenue from the financial year ended 30 June 202 2 to the financial yearended 30 June 202 3 .Reported revenue30 June 2022 Changes in FX rates Acquisitions and disposals Organic growth Reported revenue30 June 2023 Variation In € millions 4.301.0 (106.7) 205.8 301.4 4.701.5 400.5 (2.5)% 4.8% 7.0% +9.3%Significant events of the financial year:FranceRamsay Santé's hospitals in France continued to operate under the French Government's revenue guarantee arrangements  which supported the business for the use of its facilities and services during the Covid pandemic and helped compensate its negative effects on activity. The structure of the arrangements up until 31 December 2022 were similar to prior periods  however the decree covering the calendar year 2022 excluded mental health services now reimbursed under a bundled payment structure. The French Government prolonged its support to the industry through a modified revenue guarantee scheme for the calendar year up to 31 December 2023. This new guarantee amounts to 70% of the 2022 guarantee (tariff adjusted) plus 30% of the period billings.The amount of the revenue guarantee recognised by the Group for the year ending 30 June 2023 amounts to €89 million (€99 million for the previous year) and was reported as “Other operating income”.Furthermore  compensation grants for additional costs related to COVID were recognised for €24.6 million (€89.8 million for the previous financial year) as “Other operating income”. Given the time lag between when costs are incurred by facilities and the notification by the Regional Health Authorities of the corresponding subsidies  all of those compensation subsidies reported during the period (€27.5 million in the previous year) correspond to financing for additional costs incurred during the previous financial year  a situation similar to that of last year.In addition to those Covid-related subsidies  specific grants totalling of €45m were extended to the French facilities to fund inflation that had not been sized in the applicable 2022 tariffs  as well as national healthcare staff salary increases applicable from 1st July 2022.The group continued its expansion in its core strategic development areas:On 1st March 2023  the Ange Gardien mental health clinic re-opened its doors following an extensive redevelopment of the facility and merger with the neighbouring Perreuse clinic into a single expanded modern site. The 232 beds and 15 day places will significantly enhance the mental health services proposed to the greater eastern Ile-de-France region.Two primary care centres opened their doors in late 2022 in France and the Haussmann medical centre in central Paris joined the Ramsay Santé network in January 2023.Nordics countriesThe positive development trend in adding listed patients into our Proximity care business has continued in both Sweden and Denmark through a dedicated work to improve both availability and attractivity in our facilities  whereas Norway is concentrating on the integration of the bolt-on acquisitions completed during the prior year. Patient demand in our Specialist care facilities in all countries has been increasing. The integration the GHP business acquired in May 2022 is progressing according to plan and synergies have been realised as expected to date. Finally  Capio has started operating two new geriatrics care contracts in Stockholm on 1st May 2023 representing an annual turnover of approximately €50m  and St Göran has opened its new maternity ward in Stockholm on 1st April 2023.Scope of consolidationRamsay Santé completed 2 small bolt-on acquisitions in Scandinavia during the year  complementing and expanding the scope of the Group's services. Together with the Haussmann medical centre which joined the primary care network in France  these acquisitions represented a total net investment of €7 million.Comments on the annual accountsActivity and revenue :Activity and revenue in France and the Nordic countries have grown across the board reflecting sustained patient demand and the capacity of the group’s facilities to provide more care services despite staffing challenges from competition for nursing staff in Europe. Ramsay Santé Group reported a consolidated revenue of €4 701.5m for the financial year ended 30 June 2023  up 9.3% on a reported basis. Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  revenue for the year ended 30 June 2023 was up with a solid 7.0% organic sales growth.France revenue has grown by 6.8% supported by an increase in volumes and in revenue medical purchases rechargeable revenue  despite 3 fewer business days this year compared to FY22 and the continuing shift towards a greater ambulatory care mix.France total admissions in our hospitals rose by 4.0% with volumes growth on all business lines  extending and confirming the post-Covid positive dynamics from late FY22  after a slow start in FY23:+3.0% in MSO (medicine  surgery and obstetrics)+11.4% in FCR (follow-up care and rehabilitation)+5.3% in mental healthOur French facilities managed approximately 720 000 emergency presentations this year  confirming their important role in delivering on public service missions.Nordic countries revenue grew by 15.2% supported by acquisitions made in FY22 which contributed €202m of additional revenue  including GHP. Organic revenue growth in the Nordic countries for the year ending 30 June 2023 was +7.8% on a like-for-like basis from continued positive revenue growth in the proximity care and specialist care activities in both Sweden and Denmark  together with the contribution of new contracts. Foreign exchange fluctuation has negatively impacted revenue by €106.7m.Patient admissions in our Nordic countries hospital facilities increased by 9.7% and the organic growth of patients listed in our proximity care centres was 3.5%.Results:EBITDA reached €621.4m for the financial year ending 30 June 2023  down €37m or 5.6% on prior year on a reported basis.The Group's EBITDA as at 30 June 2023 includes €88.9m (last year €99.1m) related to the revenue guarantee described in the paragraph “Significant events of the financial year” above  as well as cost compensations for Covid surcharges in France and Sweden of €33.2m (last year €111.7m). Those Covid-related grants tapered off from levels received in prior years as the Covid pandemic intensity greatly abated over the course of the financial year.EBITDA and margins were also driven down by inflationary pressures sustained from the impact of the effort made on the compensations and benefits made to our medical staff as well as overall operating expenditure price increases  in particular on energy and outsourced services. Ramsay Santé received funding from the French government which only partially covered procurement and wages inflation through €45m dedicated grants then followed by tariff increases from 1 March 2023. A similar pattern occurred in the Nordic countries where cost inflation outstripped the price revisions obtained from the different payors.EBITDA has a benefited from organic growth contribution on margins and from more stability in volumes growth over the year allowing for a greater focus on operational efficiency.Cost control measures were initiated to adapt activities to the current inflation environment and resources allocation are also revisited as a consequence.Underlying current operating profit amounted to €218.2m for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 (or 4.6% of revenue)  down 22.4% on the previous year.Other non-current income and expenses represent a net income of €22.2m for the year ending 30 June 2023 (last year €10.2m)  consisting mainly of a €31.0m profit on the sale of a property adjacent to a hospital in Norway that is to be redeveloped.The cost of net financial debt amounted to €147.1m for the year ending 30 June 2023  compared with €123.5 million the previous year  driven by higher funding costs. The impact of financial instruments recorded in P&L was a €5.5m income (€22.5m income last year)  contributing to a further €17.0m increase in the net interest expense on the prior year. In accordance with IFRS 16  the Group recorded a financial interest expense of €75.3m related to lease debt (€72.3m the previous year).The Group’s share of net income for the year ended 30 June 2023 amounted to €49.4m  or 1.1% of revenue  compared with €118.4m last year.Impact from IFRS16 Lease :Reported EBITDA of €621.4m in accordance with IFRS16 excludes contracted lease expenses for €239.8m which are instead recorded as amortisation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease debt as outlined in the table below. The increase in the lease accounting impact on the prior year primarily came from the full-year contribution of FY22 acquisitions  as well as the effect of contractual price revisions.EUR millions30 June 202330 June 2022Δ IFRS16 Impact Pre-IFRS16 IFRS16 Impact Pre-IFRS16 Impact EBITDA621.4 239.8 381.6658.4 219.1 439.320.7 Depreciation & amortisation (403.2) (192.3) (210.9) (377.3) (175.4) (201.9) (16.9) EBIT before non-current items 218.2 47.5 170.7 281.1 43.7 237.4 3.8 Net interest expense (152.7) (72.7) (80.0) (106.1) (69.4) (36.7) (3.3) Net profit after tax 63.9 (18.9) 82.8 127.8 (19.1) 146.9 0.2Cash-flow and fi nancing :Net financial debt on 30 June 2023 was €3 670.0m compared with €3 709.9m on 30 June 2022. Net debt includes €1 893.8m in non-current borrowings and €58.8m in current borrowings  offset by €352.2m in cash and cash equivalents.The application of IFRS 16 to leases contributed €2 141.5m to net financial debt at 30 June 2023  of which €1 928.0m was non-current lease debt and €213.5m was current lease debt.Net cash increased by €219.7m over the period with a €186m contribution from increased borrowings. The cash flow from operating activities benefited from a favourable working capital variation encompassing the collection of subsidies recognised in the prior year.Total net capital expenditure for the year of €165.1m was slightly below last year’s €175.4m and included maintenance and optimisation  as well as improvement on our portfolio of clinics. This covers the maternity expansion of St Göran as well as significant effort to roll out our strategy to increase Ramsay Santé’s imaging assets portfolio  to invest on digital tools  amongst which the new version of the Ramsay Services portal  and to acquire new equipment such as surgical robots for our French clinics.During the first half of this fiscal year  Ramsay Santé carried out a new tranche of Fiducie debt for a total financing amount of €150m  diversifying its funding sources and maturity profiles  as well as aligning it with the sustainable development strategy of the group through an indexation to ESG criteria.About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.
