DGB generates revenue through large-scale projects and …,"DGB Group N.V. (""DGB"" or ""the Group"") (Euronext: DGB: NL0009169515)  a leading carbon project developer and ecosystem restoration company  addresses questions on its stock market listing and Euronext's delisting considerations.DGB generates revenue through large-scale projects and carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market. As a publicly-traded entity  our ethos  'By the public  for the public'  reflects our commitment to benefitting diverse sectors and stakeholders  from governments to local communities. Our transparent communication and promotion of economic growth exemplify why many  including carbon market leaders such as Base Carbonand Carbon Streaming  opt for public listing.What steps are Euronext considering due to companies' inability to secure Public Interest Entity (PIE) audit firms?Euronext Amsterdam introduced a stringent rule in April 2021  suggesting companies without a PIE audit firm risk delisting. Alarmingly  if unresolved by 6 November 2023  Euronext may delist multiple small-cap funds  including DGB  due to their inability to secure specific PIE auditors.What's the issue with Dutch PIE auditors?The Netherlands is facing a structural shortage of PIE auditors. The number of PIE-auditing firms has decreased over the years  with only six remaining: the Big Four (Deloitte  EY  KPMG  and PwC) and two mid-sized firms  BDO and Mazars.Over the years  stricter regulations and standards have been imposed on accounting firms  especially those auditing publicly traded companies. These regulations have increased the operational costs and liabilities for these firms  making it challenging for smaller players to sustain their services.Newer regulations mandate more companies to undergo audits by PIE auditors  expanding the pool of businesses seeking these specialised services and causing a surge in demand for specialised PIE auditors. This has put pressure on the existing firms to cater to a larger clientele  often leading to capacity constraints.The structural shortage of PIE auditors in the Netherlands stems from a significant reduction in the number of these firms over the past decade  rather than company-specific performance issues. We would like to emphasise that the issue of audit firm shortage is not exclusive to DGB. In fact  six Euronext-listed companies face potential delisting in six months due to the lack of an approved PIE auditor. Furthermore  additional companies are expected to face similar challenges in the coming months.The Dutch Ministry of Finance even acknowledges the PIE-auditor shortage  prompting the Minister of Finance to propose a mandatory appointment law. This legislation is expected to be presented before the summer break.Do other Euronext countries face similar auditor shortages?As a pan-European stock exchange operating in multiple countries  Euronext maintains generally consistent requirements for listed companies across its jurisdictions. While the Netherlands uniquely faces a PIE-auditor shortage  other Euronext-operating countries don't. DGB has questioned Euronext's seemingly inconsistent approach. Here's an overview of the Euronext-operating countries that don't experience this issue:FranceNorwayItalyPortugalIrelandBelgiumSpainSwitzerlandWhile the Netherlands uniquely grapples with a PIE-auditor shortage  all other countries Euronext operates in do not experience this problem. Given this disparity  DGB has inquired why Euronext has not adopted a consistent approach to addressing this issue.What are the potential consequences if Euronext decides on this course of action?Given the prevailing conditions and the forthcoming legislation  DGB has urged Euronext Amsterdam to reassess initiating the delisting process of companies without a PIE auditor. Failure to do so could lead to small and medium-sized Dutch companies migrating to alternative exchanges  adversely affecting the Dutch economy and tarnishing its business-friendly reputation. It could lead to shareholder losses and have broader implications for the financial market  affecting investor confidence and the overall business ecosystem.There's no evidence to suggest that the current problems stem from the performance of these companies. Similar issues did not arise between 1980 and 2016  a period when there were both small and large listed companies with varying performance levels.What are the potential consequences of DGB's delisting on 6 November?Delisting refers to the removal of a company's stock from a stock exchange  which means the public can no longer buy or sell the stock through that exchange.We have not been informed by Euronext of the exact steps that will take place. But  if unresolved by 6 November 2023  Euronext plans to initiate DGB's delisting process  which means all DGB shares will become non-listed shares.Delisted stocks can still be traded  but it becomes more challenging as they move to over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This can reduce the liquidity of the stock  making it harder for shareholders to sell their shares quickly. The announcement of a delisting can also lead to a decline in stock price due to reduced investor confidence.What is the consequence of delisting for the fundamental business of DGB?It's essential to note that delisting doesn't necessarily reflect the company's operational health. As mentioned  the company's operations are separate from its listing status. DGB's business is performing well  as indicated in the market updateand outlook published on 6 July 2023. This suggests that while the stock's trading dynamics might change post-delisting  DGB's operational and financial health remains robustWhy isn't the previous appointment of KPMG as an auditor sufficient for the Amsterdam listing?On 27 March 2023  the board of directors announced the engagement of KPMGto audit DGB Green Earth Limited  the Dublin-based entity overseeing all projects and activities for DGB. While KPMG agreed to audit DGB's operations  they don't audit the Dutch holding entity  DGB Group NV. This is why DGB currently doesn't meet Euronext's requirements.Has DGB formulated a contingency plan in light of these challenges?Despite engaging with all major PIE audit firms  a solution is yet to be reached in the Netherlands. Consequently  DGB has formulated a contingency plan  including a potential restructuring and migration to Euronext Growth in Dublin. As a part of this strategy  DGB has already engaged KPMG as the independent audit firm for DGB's wholly-owned subsidiary  DGB Green Earth Limited. This step signifies DGB's dedication to overcoming the challenges faced by listed entities in the Netherlands while preserving a listing on a prestigious exchange and adhering to applicable regulations.Please refer to the press release on 14 April 2023 accompanied by an overview of our migration plan titled 'DGB Group plans to migrate listing to Euronext Growth market'. We wish to emphasise that we view this plan as a contingency measure  as we expect Euronext to address the larger issue at hand.Despite disagreeing with Euronext Amsterdam's new measure  we're optimistic about a potential migration to Euronext Growth Dublin  especially since the Amsterdam listing hasn't added significant value for our company. DGB believes an alternative exchange can enhance shareholder value.How can shareholders obtain further information and stay updated on any changes or updates?We will communicate significant changes and updates through our press releases. However  if shareholders require more information  please feel free to reach out to us via email at press@green.earth. We are here to assist and keep you informed; we're committed to transparent communication and collaboration to navigate these challenges.

Wainwright & Co. is acting as the exclusive placement agent for the Private Placement.Under the terms of the Private Placement  the Investor committed to subscribe for 10 million new shares of the Company  of which 7.8 million shares will be admitted to trading and listing on Euronext Brussels immediately upon their issuance  and the remaining 2.2 million shares will be admitted to trading and listing following the approval of a listing prospectus. In addition  the Investor will receive options  with an 18-month term  to subscribe for an additional 10 million new shares at an exercise price of EUR 2.25 per share. If the options are exercised in full  Mithra would receive additional gross proceeds of EUR 22.5 million  increasing the total gross amount raised from the Private Placement to EUR 42.5 million. Also  as part of the terms of the Private Placement  the Investor will receive additional options  with a five-year term  to subscribe for 10 million new shares  at an exercise price of EUR 2.25 per share. If the additional options are exercised in full  Mithra would receive another EUR 22.5 million  bringing the total cash gross proceeds from the Private Placement to EUR 65 million.David Horn Solomon  Chief Executive Officer of Mithra  commented: “This successful Private Placement in public equity  provides EUR 20 million immediately -- and  potentially  an additional total of up to EUR 22.5 million during the next 18 months  or EUR 45 million over the longer term  subject to the exercise of the options. We believe this addresses the current concerns regarding our ability to secure financing for our operations in the short- to medium-term; it demonstrates Mithra’s strength and ability to raise financing  even during turbulent market conditions. We are grateful for the continuing support of both our existing and new investors. The proceeds will be used to advance development of our promising portfolio of medicines as we execute on our strategy to become a global leader in women’s health. In particular  the funds will support the filing for approval of Donesta®  our next generation Estetrol®-based hormone therapy product candidate in the U.S.  as well as other development and corporate expenses.”Support for the Private PlacementFunds managed by Highbridge Capital Management  LLC (“Highbridge“) and funds managed by Whitebox Advisors  LLC (“Whitebox“  and together with Highbridge  each a “Lender“)  which provided a convertible loan facility to Mithra  also supported the deal by agreeing to a 45 day restriction on conversions. In consideration of the Lenders’ support  the terms of the loan facility will be amended  such that the conversion price for the conversion of outstanding principal amounts for Mithra shares will be EUR 2.25 (subject to certain customary anti-dilution and takeover protections)  and the interest rate on the outstanding principal will be adjusted to 13%.Use of proceedsThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Private Placement primarily to finance expenses related to: (i) Donesta® (in particular  the support of the New Drug Application (NDA) filing with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the organisation of additional Phase 2 clinical studies to support differentiation for treatment of menopause symptoms related to hair  skin and sexual desire); (ii) Estetrol® (in particular  to explore new indications in women's health  such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) implantation and exploratory clinical studies on endometrial thickening  as well as the organisation of new pharmacoeconomic Phase 2 and Phase 4 clinical studies to establish safety of E4 (Estelle®/Donesta®) in breast cancer and blood clotting); (iii) Zoreline® (in particular  the organisation of 1-month and 3-month formulation studies); and (iv) general corporate purposes.The Private Placement comes as part of management’s overarching strategy (communicated in its Letter to Shareholders on 25 May 2023) and in addition to other measures to improve the Company’s financial health and balance sheet that were announced earlier by the Company. These include: the amendments to the loan facility concluded with the Lenders and the subsequent the access to a new tranche of EUR 12.5 million under the facility that was announced on 21 June 2023; the EUR 2.5 million equity raising by the Company through the issuance of 1 136 364 new shares to the Lenders that was completed on 25 May 2023; the sale of 4 221 815 shares of Mayne Pharma Group Limited that was announced on 16 June 2023; the exploring of potential options to maximize the value of the Company’s CDMO facility; and a licensing deal for U.S. marketing rights for Donesta®. The Company could also consider selling additional assets  as and when an opportunity would arise.Further informationThe settlement of the Private Placement and issuance of the 10 million new shares are subject to a number of customary conditions  including the application of customary corporate procedures  which are expected to be completed on or about 28 August 2023.

According to Euromonitor  baby pants are expected to continue to drive the category growth over the next five years. The growing acceptance of pants among parents is a key factor behind this trend. Baby pants have traditionally been designed to assist parents in the early stages of potty training  making it easier for children to transition from diapers to regular underwear. Besides the design of baby pants has evolved  and they now offer a true alternative to traditional open diapers. To fuel that trend  Ontex is introducing DreamshieldTM back pocket to upgrade leakage protection  which is a key driver for parents to shift more to pants to more extended usage including at night.The market for adult disposable pants is also growing. “When it comes to absorbent pants for adults  many people were taken by surprise - but not us "" says Annick De Poorter  Chief Innovation and Sustainability Officer at Ontex. ""We have been at the forefront of the development thanks to our experience in the healthcare sector. We know that many people have moderate incontinence and lead active lives  so we make sure our pants are affordable  discreet and easy to wear. We estimate that one in four women over the age of forty and one in nine men over sixty have some form of incontinence  so adult incontinence pants can enable many people to live a normal life.” To further improve its offering  Ontex has launched an innovative core that improves performance thanks to its channeled X-CORE technology  of which the design squarely meets the top 3 needs of consumers in this category  protection  comfort and discretion.Learn moreTo read more about DreamshieldTM and X-CORE  visit https://ontex.com/products/innovative-products/***Contact informationInvestors Geoffroy Raskin +32 53 33 37 30 investor.relations@ontexglobal.comMedia Maarten Verbanck +32 53 33 36 20 corporate.communications@ontexglobal.comAbout OntexOntex is a leading international developer and producer of hygienic products and solutions for retailers and healthcare  with expertise in baby care  feminine care and adult care.

Pursuant to the arrangement  Clementia shareholders will receive US$25.00 per share in cash upfront and one contingent value right (CVR) per share entitling them to receive US$6.00 per CVR upon the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) acceptance of the regulatory filing for palovarotene for the treatment of multiple osteochondromas (MO).Clementia's key late-stage clinical asset palovarotene is an investigational retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) selective agonist  for the treatment of two rare bone disorders  fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) and multiple osteochondromas (MO)  and other diseases.The palovarotene regulatory submission for the prevention of heterotopic ossification (HO) in patients with FOP in the U.S. is expected for the second half of 2019. The submission will be based on Phase 2 clinical data from greater than 100 imaged flare-ups and indicated that treatment with palovarotene resulted in a greater than 70% reduction of new heterotopic ossification (HO)  or bone formation  across all three dosing levels.Dr. Alexandre Lebeaut  Chief Scientific Officer of Ipsen  commented  ""We are encouraged by compelling and consistent clinical data from the extensive Phase 2 program as well as fast-track  breakthrough therapy  orphan drug and rare pediatric diseases designations from the FDA. We are focused on the successful regulatory submission of palovarotene as a first-in-class therapeutic solution for patients with episodic flare-up treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva in the second half of 2019.""Dr. Clarissa Desjardins  Chief Executive Officer of Clementia  added  ""I am extremely grateful for the hard-working and dedicated team at Clementia  the patient community and the clinical trial investigators who have helped advance the palovarotene program. Going forward  we are confident that Ipsen  with its shared patient-centric culture  proven development capabilities and global commercial footprint  will fulfill our ambition of delivering palovarotene to patients worldwide as quickly as possible.""About Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP)FOP is an ultra-rare  severely disabling disorder characterized by heterotopic ossification (HO)  or bone that forms outside the normal skeleton  in muscles  tendons or soft tissue. In FOP  HO progressively restricts movement by locking joints  leading to a cumulative loss of function  progressive disability  and increased risk of early death. FOP is caused by a mutation in the ACVR1 gene  resulting in excess signaling in the bone morphogenetic pathway  a key pathway controlling bone growth and development  by way of both ligand-dependent and independent mechanisms. The prevalence of FOP is approximately 1.3 individuals per million lives  or approximately 9 000 patients globally. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.About Multiple Osteochondromas (MO)MO  also called multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE) is a rare  severely disabling  progressive  chronic disease in which multiple benign bone tumors  also known as osteochondromas (OCs) or osteocartilaginous exostoses  develop on bones. MO is typically diagnosed in early childhood when OCs become visible with a median age at diagnosis of four years. Because of their development around joints  children develop limb deformity and restricted movement as they grow. Today  the only available treatments for MO are surgery and palliative care  and many patients will undergo surgery  some as many as 30 surgeries  before adulthood. MO is estimated to affect 20 individuals per million lives  or approximately 150 000 globally. MO is among the most common inherited bone disorders with multiple family members in multiple generations affected.About PalovarotenePalovarotene is an RARγ agonist being developed as a treatment for patients with ultra-rare/rare and debilitating bone diseases  including fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) and multiple osteochondromas (MO)  as well as other diseases. Palovarotene was in-licensed from Roche Pharmaceuticals  where it was previously evaluated in more than 800 subjects  including 450 patients treated for up to two years. Palovarotene has received Orphan Drug status for FOP and MO from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In addition  palovarotene has been granted Fast Track  Breakthrough Therapy and Rare Pediatric Disease designations for FOP from the FDA.About IpsenIpsen is a global specialty-driven biopharmaceutical group focused on innovation and specialty care.

Using data from the Phase III CELESTIAL and RESORCE trials  the MAIC showed that cabozantinib offers greater efficacy versus regorafenib.Using data from the Phase III CELESTIAL and RESORCE trials  the MAIC showed that in the 2L CELESTIAL sub-population who had received sorafenib as the only prior systemic therapy  cabozantinib significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS)  with an additional 2.4 months provided vs. regorafenib (5.6 months vs. 3.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.90-7.26]  p<0.05). Median overall survival (OS) was also favorable with cabozantinib (11.4 months vs. 10.8 months)  though statistical significance was not met.1Results from MAIC will be presented by Dr. Katie Kelley  oncologist at the University of California  San Francisco and lead investigator  at the 13th Annual Conference of the International Liver Cancer Association (ILCA 2019) taking place on 20-22 September 2019 in Chicago  USA (poster/abstract #P-021).In the previously presented randomized  double-blind  Phase III CELESTIAL trial evaluating cabozantinib compared with placebo in previously treated patients with aHCC  in the overall CELESTIAL intent-to-treat population  cabozantinib significantly improved median PFS  with an additional 3.3 months provided vs placebo (5.2 months vs. 1.9 months [95% CI  4.0 to 5.5]  p<0.001) and median OS  with an additional 2.2 months vs placebo (10.2 months vs. 8.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 9.1 to 12.0)  p=0.005).1""Hepatocellular carcinoma is a devastating disease with only a few treatment options demonstrating survival benefits and many investigational drugs have failed to meet overall survival endpoints in clinical trials "" said Dr. Kelley. ""The MAIC analysis brings further insight into the comparative effectiveness of the key second-line treatments for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma  particularly in relation to important endpoints like progression-free survival. These results may support clinicians in making informed treatment decisions in order to deliver optimal care for their patients.""Grade 3/4 adverse events affecting more than 5% of patients were comparable for the two studies  except for diarrhea which was lower with regorafenib.1MAICs are a way of providing a timely comparison of the effectiveness of different medical interventions in the absence of head-to-head randomized trials.2 While indirect comparisons of treatments across separate studies can be performed  these analyses may be biased by cross-trial differences in patient populations  sensitivity to modeling assumptions  and differences in the definitions of outcome measures. MAICs use individual patient data (IPD)  also referred to as individual-level data  from trials of one treatment to match baseline summary statistics reported from trials of another treatment and reduce observed cross-trial differences.2 After matching  treatment outcomes are compared across balanced trial populations. It should be noted that  even after matching  bias may still occur in MAIC due to imbalance in unobserved factors  and it cannot completely replace a head-to-head randomized and controlled trial.1""At Ipsen  our mission is to prolong and improve patients' lives and health outcomes  and we acknowledge the importance of providing healthcare professionals with the best available evidence to achieve these goals for patients "" said Dr. Yan Moore  Ipsen's Senior Vice President  Head of Oncology Therapeutic Area. ""The recent rapid development of new second-line treatments for patients with advanced HCC has led to the generation of information mainly based on placebo-controlled trials. While alternative methodological approaches such as MAIC are not substitutes to evidence-based prospective clinical trials  it is important to recognize the need for further insights into the comparative effectiveness of current treatment approaches.""1 Abou-Alfa  G.K.  et al.

The execution of our R&D strategy over the last two years through accelerating key internal programs and externally sourcing innovation has significantly strengthened the focus and value of our pipeline.""Ipsen currently has five new chemical entities in clinical development  nine significant regulatory submissions planned from 2019 to 2022 and several mid-to-late-stage program readouts in the coming months. We remain committed to executing on our top-line  bottom-line and pipeline growth strategy to create and deliver long-term value to patients and shareholders.""In Rare Diseases  palovarotene is a late-stage and largely de-risked drug candidate for the treatment of rare and extremely disabling bone disorders with no current treatment options. Palovarotene has Orphan Drug  Fast Track  Breakthrough Therapy and Rare Pediatric Disease designations and is supported by robust clinical data. The company expects to submit an NDA to the FDA in the second half of 2019 for the first indication of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP).In Neuroscience  Ipsen is pursuing two new therapeutic indications to maximize the potential of Dysport®. The Company is also leveraging its research and development expertise building upon its neurotoxin franchise to advance its proprietary next-generation neurotoxin program with a fast-acting neurotoxin to enter Phase 2 clinical development in the second half of 2019 and a long-acting neurotoxin in preclinical development.In Oncology  there are numerous ongoing mid-to-late-stage programs to broaden the scope of Cabometyx® (cabozantinib) and Onivyde® (irinotecan liposomal). The Phase 3 CheckMate 9ER trial in combination with nivolumab has the potential to strengthen Cabometyx®'s presence in the first-line renal cell cancer market  with top-line results expected in the first half of 2020. In addition  the Phase 3 trial in combination with atezolizumab for first-line hepatocellular carcinoma has the potential to expand the use of Cabometyx® earlier in the treatment paradigm and to serve as the registrational trial to enter China.Regarding Onivyde®  the interim analysis of the Phase 2 combination trial for the treatment of first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer indicates encouraging results on the disease control rate and has been accepted as an oral presentation by the ESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer in July 2019. There is also an ongoing Phase 2 trial for second-line small cell lung cancer with top-line results expected in the second half of 2019.In earlier-stage Oncology development  Ipsen is advancing its innovative Systemic Radiation Therapy program with satoreotide (IPN 1070 and IPN 1072) which is expected to move into a Phase 2/3 trial in neuroendocrine tumors by the first quarter of 2020 and IPN 1087 which is currently in Phase 1 development for pancreatic cancer. Both are platform technologies with the possibility to expand to additional solid tumors and to provide precision targeted treatment to patients.Ipsen will also execute on its external innovation and business development model in its key therapeutic areas  building on its strong balance sheet and cash flow generation to acquire assets and invest in R&D pipeline for long term shareholders' value.Along with an R&D pipeline update  Ipsen will also provide updates on its corporate strategy  commercial highlights of its key Specialty Care products  and new objectives on its capital allocation strategy and mid-term financial outlook.2022 Financial outlookIpsen provides its 2022 financial outlook to reflect the strong momentum of its Specialty Care business and the impact from the acquisition of Clementia closed in April 2019:Group Net Sales around €3.2 billion 1Core Operating margin greater than 32.0% of net salesThis outlook includes only the existing commercial portfolio of products under current approved indications and assumes the approval and launch of palovarotene in FOP indications2 only. It assumes the earliest possible entry of somatostatin analog (SSA) generics based on market intelligence. It does not include the potential short-term  low single-digit Core Operating margin dilution of business development transactions to further accelerate building an innovative and sustainable pipeline.Webcast and Conference callIpsen will host an audio and video webcast and conference call of the Investor Day on Tuesday 14 May 2019 at 1:00 p.m. (CET  GMT+1) available at www.ipsen.com.

This demonstrates the trust existing and new private and institutional clients have in Van Lanschot Kempen. We remain committed to growth by continuously improving our services  with a focus on personal attention and digital service. We also made good progress integrating Mercier Vanderlinden in Belgium and preparing the integration of Robeco’s online investment platform in the Netherlands. Meanwhile  we remain disciplined in preserving our robust capital and liquidity positions. The commitment of our people and the confidence of our clients and shareholders allow us to look back on a solid first half.“Private Clients reported robust results. We expanded our service offering by launching a proposition that enables private banking clients to put their own personal stamp on their discretionary management portfolios. Also  we added a further 15 private bankers to our team and launched a ‘Young Private Banking Programme’ training our private bankers of the future. Profitable growth is our focus at Wholesale & Institutional Clients. Following up on initiatives announced last year  we’re taking additional cost-saving measures while at the same time bolstering our commercial strength. Investment Banking Clients faced a persistently challenging environment for transactions. To achieve an efficiency ratio of 70% – our target – we maintain a strict focus on costs in all our activities.“Our annual research report into the views of high net-worth individuals in the Netherlands revealed that a majority want their wealth managers to lead by example on sustainability. We’ve made great strides in this respect since 2019  having cut our own carbon emissions by 41%. Our ambition also remains to reduce the climate impact of investments and mortgages year after year  in dialogue with our clients and the companies in which we invest.“Our capital and liquidity positions remained robust  with an increase in our CET 1 ratio to 21.6%  well ahead of our target  and a liquidity ratio of 172%. This enables us to propose a capital return of €2.00 per share in the second half of 2023.”Client assets and AuMSolid net AuM inflows of €3.2 billion combined with a positive market performance of €4.1 billion resulted in an increase in total AuM to €115.2 billion (2022: €107.8 billion).

We are pleased to have welcomed numerous new tenants to our portfolio whilst successfully executing multiple transactions with our existing Joint Venture partners. Moreover  we are witnessing a decline in construction prices which allows us to initiate new constructions at favourable margins.”Jan Van Geet  continued: “I believe many have been waiting for an update on the broadening of our Joint Venture model and I am convinced that with Deka we have found comparable DNA to sustain a long term 50:50 partnership. By the end of Q3 a first closing comprising over € 700 million of gross asset value will materialize and by Q3 ’24 the entire portfolio  totalling over € 1.1 billion  will have transferred into the joint venture allowing VGP to recycle over € 700 million of cash. The joint venture will be managed by VGP in a similar way to our existing Joint Ventures and as I have been told  the transaction forms the largest of Europe in its class year to date. In these times  I believe I can proudly state that this is a testament to the resilient quality of our portfolio.”Jan Van Geet  concluded: “As expected  the real estate industry’s recent shake-up on the back of rising interest rates has revealed a multitude of opportunities  and we are ready to capitalize on them. As such  VGP has signed exclusivity on a number of iconic industrial sites on absolute top locations. In this respect  our solid balance sheet and transactions with existing and new Joint Ventures facilitates us to recycle cash to sustain continuous growth.

The Group must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that the Group may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  the Group cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during pre-clinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances  new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development  including obtaining regulatory approval; the Group's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of the Group's patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. The Group also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to the Group's activities and financial results. The Group cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of the Group's partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on the Group's business  financial position or performance. The Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. The Group's business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

The dose of PXT3003 tested in the PREMIER trial corresponds to the high dose (HD) tested in the prior Phase III clinical study  the PLEO-CMT trial  and its ongoing open-label extension Phase III study  the PLEOCMT-FU trial.As agreed with regulatory agencies  the primary efficacy endpoint is the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale ('ONLS') which measures functional motor disability. A total of 387 patients with mild-to-moderate CMT1A  were enrolled in the PREMIER trial (exceeding the initial enrolment target of 350 subjects as defined in the study protocol):- 153 in the United States - 183 in Europe - 39 in Canada - 12 in Israel.After completion of the 15-month long double-blind period of the PREMIER trial  patients were offered continued treatment by rolling over into an open-label extension period named PREMIER-OLE (Open-Label Extension). Thus  CMT1A patients randomized in the PREMIER trial have the opportunity to receive PXT3003 HD until the treatment is commercially available  should PXT3003 be approved in the US and Europe  respectively by the FDA and the EMA. The first patient entered the PREMIER-OLE period in September 2022.As of August 18th  2023  out of the 387 patients randomized in the PREMIER trial:- 42 early-terminated the double-blind period of the PREMIER trial - 315 are in the open-label extension period  PREMIER-OLE  and are all treated with PXT3003 HD - 25 did not enroll in the PREMIER-OLE period after completing the double-blind period of the PREMIER trial - 5 early-terminated the PREMIER-OLE period.The PREMIER trial is progressing as initially planned and Pharnext is making a diligent effort to carry out this ambitious program. The topline results announcement of this study is planned in Q4 2023.Gilbert Wagener  CMO of Pharnext  said: ""We are pleased to inform patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A  all our investigators and the scientific community that we have completed the double-blind treatment period of our global Phase III PXT3003-06 study in patients with moderate CMT1A. This is an important milestone to prepare the NDA and MAA of PXT3003 for the treatment of CMT1A patients. The successful completion of this program will enable us to offer treatment to patients who are left without treatment options now.""Melissa Israel  VP of Clinical Operations of Pharnext  said: ""Timely completion of recruitment and treatment is particularly challenging in orphan disease clinical trials. We would like to thank all patients  patient advocacy organizations  investigators  and all clinical research staff for their contribution to the successful conduct of the study.""Hugo Brugière  CEO of Pharnext  said: ""We are now looking forward to the analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints by Q4 2023 that will build the basis for the NDA and the MAA and unlock the potential of value creation of the company.""About Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A ('CMT1A')Charcot-Marie-Tooth ('CMT') disease encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited  severe  debilitating  progressive and chronic peripheral neuropathies. CMT1A  the most common type of CMT  is an orphan disease with a prevalence of 1/5000 people affecting about 150 000 people in Europe and the U.S. and about 1 500 000 people worldwide. The genetic mutation responsible for CMT1A is a duplication of the PMP22 gene coding for a peripheral myelin protein. The duplication of this gene results in overexpression of the PMP22 protein and failure of Schwann cells to produce normal myelin (neuronal sheath). The lack of a normal myelin structure and function leads to abnormal peripheral nerve conduction and axonal loss. As a result of peripheral nerve degradation  patients suffer from progressive muscle atrophy in both the legs and arms causing problems with walking  running and balance as well as abnormal hand functioning. They might also suffer from mild to moderate sensory disorders. First symptoms usually appear during adolescence and will progressively evolve throughout life. Patients with the most severe form of CMT1A end up in wheelchairs  representing at least 5% of cases. To date  no curative or symptomatic medications have been approved and treatment consists of supportive care such as orthotics  leg braces  physical and occupational therapy or surgery. More information can be found at https://pharnext.com/en/disease/charcot-marie-tooth.About PXT3003PXT3003 is a novel fixed-dose synergistic combination of baclofen  naltrexone and sorbitol formulated as an oral solution given twice a day. The three individual components of PXT3003 were selected to downregulate the overexpression of PMP22 protein  leading to improvement of neuronal signaling in dysfunctional peripheral nerves that are an essential part of the pathophysiology of this disease. PXT3003 could also have a positive effect on other cellular types of the motor unit such as the axon (direct protection)  neuromuscular junctions or muscle cells. PXT3003 has shown promising and consistent results across preclinical and clinical studies in Phase II and Phase III (PLEO-CMT and PLEO-CMT-FU). More information can be found at https://pharnext.com/en/pipeline/pxt3003.About the PREMIER TrialThe PREMIER trial is an international  randomized  double-blind  two-arm placebo-controlled  pivotal Phase III study  evaluating the efficacy and safety of PXT3003 versus placebo in mild-to-moderate CMT1A patients  over a 15-month period. The dose of PXT3003 tested in the PREMIER trial corresponds to the high dose ('HD') tested in the prior Phase III trial ('PLEO-CMT'). As agreed with regulatory agencies  the primary efficacy endpoint will be the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale ('ONLS') which measures functional motor disability. The secondary endpoints include the following outcome measures: 1) 10-Meter Walk Test ('10mWT')  2) Quantified Muscular Testing (bilateral foot dorsiflexion dynamometry)  3) Patient Global Impression of Severity ('PGI-S')  4) Patient Global Impression of Change ('PGI-C')  5) Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score  version 2 ('CMTNS-v2')  and 6) Quantified Muscular Testing (hand grip). Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. Further information on the PREMIER trial can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website (study identification number: NCT04762758) here.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions. Pharnext has a first-in-class drug candidate  PXT3003  in development for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)  a rare  debilitating  inherited peripheral neuropathy. PXT3003 benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. In 2018  PXT3003 completed a Phase III clinical trial  the PLEO-CMT trial  with encouraging topline results. This trial was followed by an open-label extension study  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial  with 120 patients continuing treatment with PXT3003. Long-term data suggest a sustained benefit  safety  and efficacy  after 5 years of total trial time. An international pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003  the PREMIER trial  is currently ongoing with 387 CMT1A patients enrolled. PREMIER topline results are expected in Q4 2023. PXT3003 originated from the Pleotherapy™ R&D approach. Pharnext draws the attention of investors to the financial and other risk factors detailed in its financial reports.

To achieve an efficiency ratio of 70% – our target – we maintain a strict focus on costs in all our activities.“Our annual research report into the views of high net-worth individuals in the Netherlands revealed that a majority want their wealth managers to lead by example on sustainability. We’ve made great strides in this respect since 2019  having cut our own carbon emissions by 41%. Our ambition also remains to reduce the climate impact of investments and mortgages year after year  in dialogue with our clients and the companies in which we invest.“Our capital and liquidity positions remained robust  with an increase in our CET 1 ratio to 21.6%  well ahead of our target  and a liquidity ratio of 172%. This enables us to propose a capital return of €2.00 per share in the second half of 2023.”Client assets and AuMSolid net AuM inflows of €3.2 billion combined with a positive market performance of €4.1 billion resulted in an increase in total AuM to €115.2 billion (2022: €107.8 billion). Encouraged by a positive stock market climate and rising capital market rates  clients shifted a proportion of their savings to investments  taking client savings down to €11.2 billion (2022: €12.7 billion). Total client assets stood at €130.8 billion (2022: €124.2 billion).PERFORMANCE REPORT/PRESENTATION/WEBCASTFor a detailed discussion of Van Lanschot Kempen’s results and balance sheet  please refer to its performance report and presentation on the 2023 half-year results at vanlanschotkempen.com/results.

29370,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/08/24/crh-increases-dividend-on-strong-first-half-earnings-ahead-of-us-listing/,CRH increases dividend on ‘strong’ first-half earnings ahead of US listing,Building materials giant is set to move its primary listing from Dublin to New York on September 25th,CRH believes it is only beginning to see the benefit of the Biden administration’s $550 billion infrastructure plan and expects robust US government support for large-scale investment to stimulate demand for its products and services for the better part of a decade. The building materials giant  which will abandon the Dublin Euronext in favour of a New York Stock Exchange listing on September 25th  has also seen an uptick in interest from US investors ahead of its Wall Street debut.After-tax profits at the group climbed 20 per cent to $1.1 billion in the six months to the end of June compared with a record-setting first half of last year  according to interim results published on Thursday. Ebitda (earnings before interest  taxes  deductibles and amortisation) was up 14 per cent year-on-year to $2.52 billion  well ahead of analyst expectations.CRH said “strong pricing” had offset the impact of higher costs across the group  widening its earnings margin by 90 basis points compared with last year.The group also said it is raising the interim dividend paid to shareholders in November by 4 per cent after a “strong first half performance” in which group sales surged 8 per cent to $16.1 billion (€14.8 billion). The group is set to distribute a record $3.5 billion (€3.27 billion) to investors this year in dividends and share buybacks.READ MORE[ CRH boss third best paid CEO on FTSE 100  Central Bank’s data breach  and low interest rates on State savings ]Sales in its European building solutions division  however  slipped 4 per cent behind the same period last year due to “softer residential demand” and extended winter weather conditions in parts of the continent in the early months of 2023.The group  which had until now been the largest counter on the Dublin bourse said business in the US  where it generated more than half of its revenues and three quarters of income before operating expenses last year  was strong across both its materials and building solutions divisions amid heightened demand from US government infrastructure initiatives.Looking ahead  it said that operations in North America are expected to be “supported by robust infrastructure demand” and underpinned by “significant increases in US federal and state funding” under the Biden administration’s infrastructure investment plan.Its European business  meanwhile  is expected to improve  benefiting “from solid infrastructure demand  good non-residential activity and positive pricing momentum”  but the residential market is likely to remain challenging.Speaking to reporters following the release  CRH chief executive Albert Manifold said 2023 is the first year that it has seen a significant uptick in construction demand arising from the $550 billion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  which US president Joe Biden signed into law in 2021.“When it was announced  we said we might [start seeing an impact] in the back-end of last year but this is the first year where it is really hitting the road ” he said. “It is likely to continue over the next five to seven years under the current federal funding programme.”Irrespective of which party wins next year’s US general election  Mr Manifold said the bill had bipartisan support in the US congress and accordingly  CRH does not expect to see any change in that.Meanwhile  CRH chief financial officer Jim Mintan said the group had interest from US investors has increased since CRH’s shareholders voted to accept the move from Dublin to Wall Street. “We have seen an uptick in our US shareholder base  which is what you would expect. I suppose also  lots of inbound queries from prospective new US shareholders in anticipation of the listing on September 25th and the indexation that will follow.”In a note  analysts from Davy Stockbrokers said CRH’s “stellar ebitda growth” coupled with strong cash generation “highlights the strength of its differentiated strategy and ability to capitalise on a robust environment. With infrastructure funding now flowing  non-residential markets showing improved momentum and significant capital yet to deploy  we see opportunities aplenty at the group – this will only accelerate with the primary US listing.”,neutral,0.14,0.85,0.02,mixed,0.42,0.39,0.19,True,English,"['strong’ first-half earnings', 'US listing', 'CRH', 'CRH chief financial officer Jim Mintan', 'next five to seven years', 'New York Stock Exchange listing', 'CRH chief executive Albert Manifold', 'extended winter weather conditions', 'European building solutions division', 'US government infrastructure initiatives', 'current federal funding programme', 'US president Joe Biden', 'prospective new US shareholders', 'robust US government support', 'strong first half performance', 'building solutions divisions', '$550 billion infrastructure plan', 'strong cash generation', 'US general election', 'US shareholder base', 'primary US listing', 'infrastructure investment plan', '$550 billion Infrastructure Investment', 'good non-residential activity', 'record-setting first half', 'building materials giant', 'robust infrastructure demand', 'solid infrastructure demand', 'Wall Street debut', 'positive pricing momentum', 'stellar ebitda growth', 'softer residential demand', 'low interest rates', 'US federal', 'infrastructure funding', 'strong pricing', 'Mr Manifold', 'bipartisan support', 'robust environment', 'US congress', 'Biden administration', 'large-scale investment', 'state funding', 'first year', 'US investors', 'European business', 'residential market', 'improved momentum', 'CRH boss', 'construction demand', 'tax profits', 'six months', 'interim results', 'analyst expectations', 'higher costs', '90 basis points', 'interim dividend', '4 per cent', 'share buybacks', 'Central Bank', 'data breach', 'State savings', 'same period', 'early months', 'largest counter', 'three quarters', 'operating expenses', 'North America', 'significant increases', 'Jobs Act', 'inbound queries', 'Davy Stockbrokers', 'differentiated strategy', 'significant capital', 'last year', 'Dublin Euronext', 'Dublin bourse', 'earnings margin', 'significant uptick', 'group sales', 'benefit', 'products', 'services', 'decade', 'favour', 'September', 'June', 'Thursday', 'taxes', 'deductibles', 'amortisation', 'impact', 'November', 'dividends', 'READ', 'CEO', 'FTSE 100', 'parts', 'continent', 'revenues', 'income', 'operations', 'reporters', 'release', 'law', 'back-end', 'road', 'party', 'move', 'lots', 'anticipation', 'indexation', 'note', 'analysts', 'strength', 'ability', 'opportunities']",2023-08-24,2023-08-25,irishtimes.com

We are pleased to have welcomed numerous new tenants to our portfolio whilst successfully executing multiple transactions with our existing Joint Venture partners. Moreover  we are witnessing a decline in construction prices which allows us to initiate new constructions at favourable margins.”Jan Van Geet  continued: “I believe many have been waiting for an update on the broadening of our Joint Venture model and I am convinced that with Deka we have found comparable DNA to sustain a long term 50:50 partnership. By the end of Q3 a first closing comprising over € 700 million of gross asset value will materialize and by Q3 ’24 the entire portfolio  totalling over € 1.1 billion  will have transferred into the joint venture allowing VGP to recycle over € 700 million of cash. The joint venture will be managed by VGP in a similar way to our existing Joint Ventures and as I have been told  the transaction forms the largest of Europe in its class year to date. In these times  I believe I can proudly state that this is a testament to the resilient quality of our portfolio.”Jan Van Geet  concluded: “As expected  the real estate industry’s recent shake-up on the back of rising interest rates has revealed a multitude of opportunities  and we are ready to capitalize on them. As such  VGP has signed exclusivity on a number of iconic industrial sites on absolute top locations. In this respect  our solid balance sheet and transactions with existing and new Joint Ventures facilitates us to recycle cash to sustain continuous growth.

This patent (ZL202080040613.1) covers the use of its ATO platform in combination with metal ions like copper  which has the potential to improve the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The European Patent Office (EPO) granted similar protection (EP3972613) in April 2023.BioSenic is exploring the therapeutic use of ATO for a number of disease areas  and has recently published peer-reviewed data from several preclinical studies elucidating its mechanisms for modulating immune responses  and the ability of certain metal ions to enhance this therapeutic potential. The intellectual property rights recently secured in EU and China pave the way for clinical and commercial developments by BioSenic and interested partners  particularly in the fields of cancer and autoimmunity.The patent involves two main immediate areas of application. The first is in immune and autoimmune related diseases such as chronic Graft-versus-Host Diseases (cGvHD)  systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. The second is in oncology  where ATO has already demonstrated exceptional results for patients  including complete remission of acute promyelocytic leukaemia. This patent issued by CNIPA is in line with the company’s general strategy of setting a dense and meaningful intellectual property portfolio. Indeed  these patents will support the BioSenic’s plans for international clinical trials in pathologies with unmet medical needs  and toward the company’s long-term goal of seeking market access approvals for its various formulations including the original properties of arsenic salts.""It is remarkable that China  the home of medicinal arsenic  is validating BioSenic's discoveries and paving the way for industrial development for the treatment of diseases with clinical unmet medical needs  such as cancer  autoimmunity and infectious diseases  in Asia and elsewhere ” said François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic. “We are thrilled to open up new chapters in the continuous worldwide effort in trying to control lethal diseases with no real cure.”The expected availability of an oral formulation that combines arsenic and copper puts BioSenic in a unique position to build on clinical successes in its fields of applications. As a result  BioSenic will be able to continue clinical development with proprietary formulations containing arsenic and active new ingredients such as metal ions  minimizing secondary side effects.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc)) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in orthopedics.Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined a strategic positionings and strengths to use  separately and combined  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com .About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:The ATO platform  which has been successfully developed  has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T and other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). cGvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. BioSenic has been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early Phase IIa study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol.The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform developed by BioSenic  with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. ALLOB has recently been evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late-delayed union. However  in June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in this exploratory Phase IIb clinical trial  interpreted as a failure of a too early cell injection  just after fracture. BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (choice between early or late treatment).Note: Biosenic has reevaluated a previous important and years-long clinical development program. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient subpopulation. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. This leads to a next-generation of JTA  off-the-shelf enhanced viscosupplement to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component.

The dose of PXT3003 tested in the PREMIER trial corresponds to the high dose (HD) tested in the prior Phase III clinical study  the PLEO-CMT trial  and its ongoing open-label extension Phase III study  the PLEOCMT-FU trial.As agreed with regulatory agencies  the primary efficacy endpoint is the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‘ONLS') which measures functional motor disability. A total of 387 patients with mild-to-moderate CMT1A  were enrolled in the PREMIER trial (exceeding the initial enrolment target of 350 subjects as defined in the study protocol):153 in the United States in the United States  183 in Europe in Europe  39 in Canada in Canada  12 in Israel.After completion of the 15-month long double-blind period of the PREMIER trial  patients were offered continued treatment by rolling over into an open-label extension period named PREMIER-OLE (Open-Label Extension). Thus  CMT1A patients randomized in the PREMIER trial have the opportunity to receive PXT3003 HD until the treatment is commercially available  should PXT3003 be approved in the US and Europe  respectively by the FDA and the EMA. The first patient entered the PREMIER-OLE period in September 2022.As of August 18th  2023  out of the 387 patients randomized in the PREMIER trial:42 early-terminated the double-blind period of the PREMIER trial early-terminated the double-blind period of the trial  315 are in the open-label extension period  PREMIER-OLE   and are all treated with PXT3003 HD are in the open-label extension period    and are all treated with PXT3003 HD  25 did not enroll in the PREMIER-OLE period after completing the double-blind period of the PREMIER trial did not enroll in the period after completing the double-blind period of the trial  5 early-terminated the PREMIER-OLE period.The PREMIER trial is progressing as initially planned and Pharnext is making a diligent effort to carry out this ambitious program. The topline results announcement of this study is planned in Q4 2023.Gilbert Wagener  CMO of Pharnext  said: “We are pleased to inform patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A  all our investigators and the scientific community that we have completed the double-blind treatment period of our global Phase III PXT3003-06 study in patients with moderate CMT1A. This is an important milestone to prepare the NDA and MAA of PXT3003 for the treatment of CMT1A patients. The successful completion of this program will enable us to offer treatment to patients who are left without treatment options now.”Melissa Israel  VP of Clinical Operations of Pharnext  said: “Timely completion of recruitment and treatment is particularly challenging in orphan disease clinical trials. We would like to thank all patients  patient advocacy organizations  investigators  and all clinical research staff for their contribution to the successful conduct of the study.”Hugo Brugière  CEO of Pharnext  said: “We are now looking forward to the analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints by Q4 2023 that will build the basis for the NDA and the MAA and unlock the potential of value creation of the company.”About Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A (‘CMT1A')Charcot-Marie-Tooth (‘CMT') disease encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited  severe  debilitating  progressive and chronic peripheral neuropathies. CMT1A  the most common type of CMT  is an orphan disease with a prevalence of 1/5000 people affecting about 150 000 people in Europe and the U.S. and about 1 500 000 people worldwide. The genetic mutation responsible for CMT1A is a duplication of the PMP22 gene coding for a peripheral myelin protein. The duplication of this gene results in overexpression of the PMP22 protein and failure of Schwann cells to produce normal myelin (neuronal sheath). The lack of a normal myelin structure and function leads to abnormal peripheral nerve conduction and axonal loss. As a result of peripheral nerve degradation  patients suffer from progressive muscle atrophy in both the legs and arms causing problems with walking  running and balance as well as abnormal hand functioning. They might also suffer from mild to moderate sensory disorders. First symptoms usually appear during adolescence and will progressively evolve throughout life. Patients with the most severe form of CMT1A end up in wheelchairs  representing at least 5% of cases. To date  no curative or symptomatic medications have been approved and treatment consists of supportive care such as orthotics  leg braces  physical and occupational therapy or surgery. More information can be found at https://pharnext.com/en/disease/charcot-marie-tooth.About PXT3003PXT3003 is a novel fixed-dose synergistic combination of baclofen  naltrexone and sorbitol formulated as an oral solution given twice a day. The three individual components of PXT3003 were selected to downregulate the overexpression of PMP22 protein  leading to improvement of neuronal signaling in dysfunctional peripheral nerves that are an essential part of the pathophysiology of this disease. PXT3003 could also have a positive effect on other cellular types of the motor unit such as the axon (direct protection)  neuromuscular junctions or muscle cells. PXT3003 has shown promising and consistent results across preclinical and clinical studies in Phase II and Phase III (PLEO-CMT and PLEO-CMT-FU). More information can be found at https://pharnext.com/en/pipeline/pxt3003.About the PREMIER TrialThe PREMIER trial is an international  randomized  double-blind  two-arm placebo-controlled  pivotal Phase III study  evaluating the efficacy and safety of PXT3003 versus placebo in mild-to-moderate CMT1A patients  over a 15-month period. The dose of PXT3003 tested in the PREMIER trial corresponds to the high dose (‘HD') tested in the prior Phase III trial (‘PLEO-CMT'). As agreed with regulatory agencies  the primary efficacy endpoint will be the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‘ONLS') which measures functional motor disability. The secondary endpoints include the following outcome measures: 1) 10-Meter Walk Test (‘10mWT')  2) Quantified Muscular Testing (bilateral foot dorsiflexion dynamometry)  3) Patient Global Impression of Severity (‘PGI-S')  4) Patient Global Impression of Change (‘PGI-C')  5) Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score  version 2 (‘CMTNS-v2')  and 6) Quantified Muscular Testing (hand grip). Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. Further information on the PREMIER trial can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website (study identification number: NCT04762758) here.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions. Pharnext has a first-in-class drug candidate  PXT3003  in development for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)  a rare  debilitating  inherited peripheral neuropathy. PXT3003 benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. In 2018  PXT3003 completed a Phase III clinical trial  the PLEO-CMT trial  with encouraging topline results. This trial was followed by an open-label extension study  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial  with 120 patients continuing treatment with PXT3003. Long-term data suggest a sustained benefit  safety  and efficacy  after 5 years of total trial time. An international pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003  the PREMIER trial  is currently ongoing with 387 CMT1A patients enrolled. PREMIER topline results are expected in Q4 2023.

Products and activities Our diverse product portfolio includes discrete and general purpose components  application-specific integrated circuits (""ASICs"")  full-custom devices and semi-custom devices and application-specific standard products (""ASSPs"") for analog  digital and mixed-signal applications. It benefits from a unique  strong foundation of proprietary and differentiated leading-edge technologies. We use all of the prevalent function-oriented process technologies  including complementary metal-on silicon oxide semiconductors (""CMOS"")  bipolar and non-volatile memory technologies. In addition  by combining basic processes  we have developed advanced systems-oriented technologies that enable us to produce differentiated and application- specific products  including fully depleted silicon-on-insulator(""FD-SOI"") technology offering superior performance and power efficiency compared to bulk CMOS  bipolar CMOS (""Bi-CMOS"") and radio frequency silicon-on-insulator(""RF-SOI"") for mixed-signal and high-frequency applications  as well as a combination of Bipolar  CMOS and DMOS  vertically integrated power (""VIPower"")  and intelligent integrated gallium nitride (STi2GaN) technologies for smart power applications  Power MOSFET  silicon carbide (""SiC"") and gallium nitride (""GaN"") for high-efficiency systems  Micro- Electro-Mechanical Systems (""MEMS"") technologies for sensors and actuators  embedded memory technologies for our microcontrollers and differentiated optical sensing technologies for our optical sensing solutions. Our operating segments are as follows: Automotive and Discrete Group (ADG)  comprised of dedicated automotive integrated circuits (""ICs"")  and discrete and power transistor products.Analog  MEMS and Sensors Group (AMS)  comprised of analog  smart power  MEMS sensors and actuators  and optical sensing solutions.Microcontrollers and Digital ICs Group (MDG)  comprised of general-purpose microcontrollers and microprocessors  connected security products (e.g. embedded secured elements and NFC readers)  memories (e.g. serial and page EEPROM) and RF and Communications products. For the computation of the segments' internal financial measurements  we use certain internal rules of allocation for the costs not directly chargeable to the segments  including cost of sales  selling  general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses and a part of research and development (""R&D"") expenses. In compliance with our internal policies  certain costs are not allocated to the segments  but reported in ""Others"". Net revenues of ""Others"" include revenues from sales assembly services and other revenues. Operating income (loss) of Others includes items such as unused capacity charges  including reduced manufacturing activity due to COVID-19 and incidents leading to power outage  impairment  restructuring charges and other related closure costs  management reorganization expenses  start-up and phase-out costs of certain manufacturing facilities  and other unallocated expenses such as: strategic or special R&D programs  certain corporate-level operating expenses  patent claims and litigations  and other costs that are not allocated to product groups  as well as operating earnings of other products. In addition  depreciation and amortization expense is part of the manufacturing costs allocated to the segments and is neither identified as part of the inventory variation nor as part of the unused capacity charges; therefore  it cannot be isolated in cost of sales. Finally  public grants are allocated to our segments proportionally to the incurred expenses on the sponsored projects. Wafer costs are allocated to the segments based on actual cost. From time to time  with respect to specific technologies  wafer costs are allocated to segments based on market price.

At the same time  we are focused on being a sustainable business  one that again proved its resilience in the face of global uncertainties and geopolitical tensions.Discount to net asset valueIn the past year  the group made real progress on the challenge of the discount to net asset value at which Prosus and Naspers shares trade. Since mid-2022  the repurchase programme has reduced this discount by 19% at a Prosus level and 21% at a Naspers level. By June 2023  this had unlocked around US$31bn. As a next step  removal of the cross-holding structure between the companies has been put to shareholders for removal. If approved by Naspers shareholders  this will greatly simplify the group structure  and enable Naspers to continue its repurchase programme. The goal for both companies is to create sustainable value for shareholders. The repurchase programme is being funded by the orderly  on-market sale of a portion of our Tencent shares. The group holds around 26% of Tencent  reflecting a high degree of confidence in the future of Tencent  one of the truly great tech businesses globally.Delivering our strategyEssentially  the group’s strategy is to build valuable businesses that solve everyday problems for customers. It does this globally by backing innovative local entrepreneurs  but deploying a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We typically grow our capital commitments progressively as we learn and scale  intrinsically linked to future returns.In the past year  the group made good progress on this strategy. The Ecommerce portfolio maintained its top-line momentum. The exit of OLX Autos is significantly improving the profitability profile of the Classifieds businesses  and the group reduced the cost base materially at the corporate level and in the segments. These actions keep the group on track for the stated ambition of consolidated profitability for the Ecommerce businesses during the first half of FY25.Today  Naspers has a significant positive impact on the daily lives of billions of customers in over 100 countries. Our entrepreneurs and their teams enable people to buy and sell online securely  easily order food and groceries that are delivered quickly to their homes. Our platforms enable participation in the digital economy and access to important and previously unavailable financial services. We help people educate themselves without visiting a classroom. We help to satisfy a basic human need  the ability to connect and interact with others. And our Ventures team continually looks for the next generation of entrepreneurs and business models that will shape the way the world lives in future.A year of progressFY23 was another difficult period  with ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Amid that uncertainty  we leveraged the group’s strong financial footing and stayed focused on building long-term sustainable value in local marketplaces across our main segments. After years of investment and growth  these segments have scaled meaningfully  creating clear paths to profitability for each.Group revenues were US$33bn  driven by 20% growth in the consolidated Ecommerce segment. Importantly  Core Classifieds and Food Delivery are profitable  and core Payments and Fintech is almost at breakeven. Core headline earnings  the group’s measure of after-tax operating performance  were down 48%to US$1.1bn  primarily due to lower contributions from associates  notably Tencent.The group ended the year with a strong and liquid balance sheet reflecting over US$16bn in gross cash.We remain disciplined in our capital allocation  as investments now face a higher bar. We will continue to drive profitability  build scale and take action to manage expenses and free cash flow  even as we invest for growth. The businesses are focused on accelerating their paths to aggregate profitability while continuing to invest in highconviction growth areas. We drove efficiencies and cut back aggressively on costs  including at a corporate level.Our role in societyOne of our three strategic priorities is to be a force for good for our stakeholders. Around the world  sustainability underpins our growth and strategy.At the same time  there is growing interest from shareholders  regulators and other stakeholders in how seriously we honour our responsibilities as a global technology group. While we have a strong heritage of acting responsibly  much of this good work has been implicit. In such an uncertain  changing world  we now need to be more explicit about how we are achieving our goal of being a positive force for the lives we touch.Technology is creating solutions pressing issues like climate action and social inclusion. Through our portfolio of mainly digital platforms  we are supporting the transition to a lower-carbon and more inclusive economy by providing alternatives to traditional brick-and-mortar businesses  alternative that reach more users in broader segments. In addition  our Ventures arm is increasing its focus on sustainable investment themes  such as agriculture and health technology. We are already invested in several agtech companies applying sustainable digital solutions by using soil biology analytics and artificial intelligence tools to determine the most sustainable solutions for crops  while addressing specific climate and social-inclusion challenges. These priorities align with our support for circular-economy innovations to mitigate and reduce environmental footprints.Although global standards guiding the private sector on environmental  social and governance or ESG disclosure are still evolving  we are committed to climate action and transparency on our sustainability agenda. At corporate level  we set an ambitious target to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions to net zero within this financial year. More importantly  we developed science-based targets that shape our absolute reduction pathway for corporate emissions (scope 1  2 and 3) as well as multiyear engagement with our portfolio companies to put their businesses on a net-zero pathway.Aligning remuneration to performance and value creationOur group operates in highly competitive  fast-changing markets  many characterised by the shortage of key skills. Our remuneration structures therefore focus on attracting  motivating and retaining the best people to create sustainable shareholder value.As a global tech leader  our people are critical to our success. The need to cut costs during the year to remain competitive included reducing our workforce – a decision not taken lightly. But we were guided by our strategic approach to human resources and remuneration that better enables us to compete for the digital talent at the heart of our businesses. Across the group  we focus on fair and equitable pay  encourage ownership and entrepreneurship in all our teams  and strive to align management compensation with creating shareholder value over time. Our remuneration principles are simple: pay for performance; align with desired shareholder outcomes  achieve the business plan  remain consistent  and attract and retain talent.Importantly  we continue to engage with shareholders on remunerations topics. This feedback is constructive in continually improving the transparency of both our reward structures and disclosure.As approved by shareholders at the FY22 AGM  in the current year we introduced a short-term incentive for the CEO and CFO focused on reducing the discount to NAV. Although there was a material improvement in the discount by year end  as noted  an important criteria was that the reduction be sustainable. So  while the objective was achieved  the special incentive will be held in reserve until 31 March 2024. The committee has not awarded a similar incentive for FY24.We continue to focus on improving our disclosure on executive remuneration  in line with shareholder feedback and our bid for greater transparency. In addition to disclosing STI goals and achievements for FY23  we now disclose related targets retrospectively.Distributions to shareholders(All figures in South African cents unless stated otherwise)Following shareholder approval at the meeting  after giving effect to the removal of the cross-holding structure  the full dividend that Naspers will be receiving from Prosus will be paid through to free float N ordinary shareholders and A ordinary shareholders as the cross-holding agreement will no longer apply. Due to the repurchase of Naspers N ordinary shares  the exact dividend per share can only be determined closer to the dividend payment date and will accordingly be announced on the dividend finalisation date on 29 November 2023.It is anticipated that dividends will be payable to shareholders recorded in the register on Friday  8 December 2023 and paid on Monday  11 December 2023.The last date to trade cum dividend will be on Tuesday  5 December 2023 (shares trade ex- dividend from Wednesday 6 December 2023). Shares may not be dematerialised or rematerialied between Wednesday  6 December 2023  and Friday  8 December 2023  both dates inclusive.Looking forward with confidenceOur purpose is unchanged – we aim to improve everyday life for people around the world by building leading companies that use technology to meet societal needs in better ways. At the heart of our purpose is our commitment to being a responsible business that has a sustainable  positive impact on the world and operates under high standards of corporate governance.CAPE TOWN24 August 2023Sponsor: Investec Bank LimitedAbout NaspersEstablished in 1915  Naspers has transformed itself to become a global consumer internet company and one of the largest technology investors in the world.

[2] Net revenue for the Group corresponds to revenues as reported in our management reporting less certain direct  order-related external costs which are part of external expenses and costs of materials and consist mainly of cost of services purchased (subcontracted or outsourced services). Net revenue for each Segment corresponds to the according Segment revenues less certain direct  order-related inter-Segment and external costs. Management reporting data excludes revenues from minor activities (primarily the Sonopress Business) outside Majorel Group’s core business which are reported in the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (the “Sonopress Business” is defined as certain non-core business activities historically carried out by Arvato de Mexico  S.A. de C.V.  which was wound down in 2021). Management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to Revenue applied in presenting net revenue are appropriate to provide additional information. Management believes that net revenue is a non-IFRS measure representing a core business growth indicator. For more information on the definitions we refer to the Annual Report FY 2022  Chapter 4  Alternative Performance Measures (APMs). [3] Like-for-like net revenue growth corresponds to net revenue growth year-over-year  adjusted for certain specific non-recurring items. For H1 2023 the reduction in COVID-19-related business and the contribution from last year’s acquisitions of Alembo  Findasense  and IST were adjusted (excluding the Mayen acquisition already completed in January 2022). Management believes that like-for-like net revenue growth is a non-IFRS measure representing a business growth indicator. For more information on the definitions  we refer to the Annual Report FY 2022  Chapter 4  Alternative Performance Measures (APMs). [4] The COVID-19 related business and the acquisitions of Alembo  Findasense  and IST are fully reported within the EASA Segment. [5] Change in revenue at constant currency exchange rates is calculated as current year revenue less prior year revenue at current year exchange rates  divided by prior year revenue at current year exchange rates. [6] Operating EBITDA is defined as EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) adjusted for amortization and depreciation  impairment and reversal on intangible assets  property  plant and equipment and right-of-use assets  adjusted for (i) impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful life as well as gains from business combinations  (ii) impairment on carrying amounts on assets held for sale  (iii) impairment/reversals on other financial assets at amortized cost  (iv) impairment/reversals on investments accounted for using the equity method  (v) results from disposals of investments  (vi) fair value measurement of investments  (vii) results from disposals of intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  (viii) operating realized and unrealized forex gains and losses including on derivatives  (ix) expenses on long-term incentive programs and (x) further adjustments such as restructuring  acquisition-related and integration expenses  and other special items. For details see APM section of the Annual Report 2022. [7] Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year  excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Group and held as treasury shares and the shares held under the liquidity program  if any. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. There is currently no category of dilutive potential ordinary shares. [8] Net revenue retention H1 2023 is defined as net revenue generated by clients in H1 2023 divided by net revenue generated by the same cohort of clients in H1 2022 (excluding net revenue contributed by Alembo  Findasense  and IST that were acquired during 2022 and the COVID-19-related business that ended at the end of 2022). Net revenue retention H1 2022 is defined as net revenue generated by clients in H1 2022 divided by net revenue generated by the same cohort of clients in H1 2021 (excluding M&A in 2022  including the decline of the COVID-19-related business). [9] Free cash flow is defined as Operating EBITDA less adjustments minus increase/plus decrease in net working capital after net cash out from pensions  payments from leases and net investments in property  plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding net payments from acquisitions and disposals of financial assets.
