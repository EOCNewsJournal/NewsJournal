Compared to the same period in 2022  Digitalist Group’s turnover decreased by 14.3%  but at the same time both EBIT and EBITDA improved in both relative and absolute numbers. This is a result of reduced fixed costs in the parent company as well as in the Group's operating companies. At the same time we are putting even more effort into increasing our abilities to attract new clients. In addition to the turbulent market situation the weak Swedish currency has also had an impact on the Group’s figures since a major part of the business is generated in Sweden.We are constantly looking for opportunities to acquire businesses that can add value to our offerings. During the first quarter we completed the acquisition of Walker & Handson Oy to strengthen the management of tech and design business in Digitalist Finland Oy  thus improving future growth opportunities in Finland. During the second quarter we also signed a letter of intent to acquire the shares in Open Communications International AB. This acquisition was completed in July  and will strengthen our offerings within brand  strategy and communications.Sales of our Open Source Technology offering is growing in both Sweden and Finland and we see a strong demand for these services in both the private and public sectors. The agreement signed with Digg  Agency for Digital Government in Sweden in April is an example of these opportunities.Our LeanLab SaaS service experienced a steady growth of recurring software revenue and we are continuing to invest in mainly software and business development. As a part of our aim to strengthen the subsidiaries’ management we targeted a directed share issue receiving 0 25 million growth funding resulting in 15% management minority shareholding in LeanLab and 85 % majority ownership remaining in Digitalist Group Plc. post transaction. This will support LeanLab’s growth plans in Finland and Sweden.We continue our work to strengthen the topline as well as streamlining our operations. Keeping strict cost control will continue to be a priority  but the focus going forward is to reach profitability by growing the topline./ CEO  Magnus LeijonborgSEGMENT REPORTINGDigitalist Group reports its business in a single segment.TURNOVERIn the second quarter  the Group’s turnover was EUR 4.3 million (EUR 5.3 million)  which is 17.9% less than in the previous year.

The new shares were admitted to trading together with the old shares on the official list of Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd on July 25th  2023.The stock exchange releases since the review period are on the company’s website at https://digitalist.global/investors/releasesRISK MANAGEMENT AND SHORT-TERM UNCERTAINTIESThe objectives of Digitalist Group Plc’s risk management are to ensure the undisrupted continuity and development of the company’s operations  support the achievement of the company’s business objectives and increase the company’s value. For more details about the organisation of risk management  processes and identified risks  see the company’s website at https://digitalist.global.The company has been making loss despite the efficiency measures taken. The negative result has a direct impact on the adequacy of the company's working capital and financing. Risk is managed by maintaining readiness for various financing solutions. The company aims to constantly evaluate and monitor the amount of funding required by the business  so that the company has enough liquid assets to finance operations and repay the loans that are due. Any disruptions in financial arrangements would weaken Digitalist Group's financial position.The company is currently dependent on external financing  most of which has been obtained from related-party companies and financial institutions. Digitalist Group’s ability to finance its operations and reduce the amount of its debt depends on several factors  such as the cash flow from operations and the availability of debt and equity financing  and there is no certainty that such financing will be available in the future. Similarly  there can be no certainty that Digitalist Group will be able to obtain additional debt or refinance its current debt on acceptable terms  if at all. In 2022 the company rearranged its short-term loans with the main owners and a financial institution. Negotiations on the arrangements for related party convertible bonds maturing in 2024 will begin in the fall of 2023.Changes in key customer accounts could adversely affect Digitalist Group’s operations  earning capacity and financial position. If one of Digitalist Group’s largest customers decided to switch to a competing company or drastically altered its operating model  the chances of finding customer volumes to replace the shortfall in the near term would be limited.The group's business mainly consists of individual customer contracts  which are often relatively short-term. Forecasting the start times and scope of new projects is challenging from time to time  while the cost structure is largely fixed in nature. The above-mentioned factors can cause unforeseeable fluctuations in turnover and  through that  in profitability. Part of the group's business consists of fixed-price deliveries. There is a time and content risk associated with fixed-price customer deliveries. This risk is managed with contract and project management tools.Irrespective of the market situation  there is a shortage of certain experts in the Group’s sector. Furthermore  the aggressive recruitment policies that are prevalent in Group’s sector may increase the risk of personnel moving to competitors. There is no guarantee that the company will be able to retain its current personnel and recruit new employees to maintain growth. If Digitalist Group loses a significant part of its current personnel  it would be more difficult to complete existing projects and acquire new ones. This could have an adverse impact on Digitalist Group’s business  earnings and financial position.Cost inflation causes salary increase pressure  which makes the importance of cost monitoring even more important. The rise in interest rates does not have a large immediate impact on financing costs  because the majority of the Company's debts are fixed interest. A 1 percent increase in the interest rate of the company's financial institution loans would increase interest costs by approximately EUR 0.1 million annually.Part of the Group’s turnover is invoiced in currencies other than the euro. The risk associated with changes in exchange rates can be managed in various ways  including net positioning and currency hedging contracts. No hedging contracts were used in 2023 or 2022.The Group’s balance sheet contains goodwill that is subject to impairment risk in the event that the Group’s future yield expectations decrease due to internal or external factors. The goodwill is tested for impairment every six months and whenever the need arises.The Group has no business in Russia or Ukraine. The political and military situation in Russia and Ukraine may affect the business operations of some of the Group's customers and thus indirectly also the Group's business operations. The increase in general economic uncertainty in the review period has affected the Group's business  but the future short-term impact is difficult to estimate.LONG-TERM GOALS AND STRATEGYDigitalist Group aims to achieve a profit margin of at least 10 per cent over the long term. In order to achieve its long-term goals  Digitalist Group strives for profitable  international growth by shaping new forms of thinking  services and technological solutions for digitalising sectors.

The interim report release complies with the same accounting principles and calculation methods as the annual financial statements. New and revised standards have been implemented from the beginning of year 2023. They have no material impact on the Half-Year review.The preparation of a financial statement release in accordance with IFRS requires the management to use certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recognised in assets and liabilities when the balance sheet was prepared  as well as the amounts of income and expenses in the period. In addition  discretion must be used in applying the accounting policies. As the estimates and assumptions are based on outlooks on the balance sheet date  they contain risks and uncertainties. The realised values may deviate from the original assessments and assumptions.The original release is in Finnish. The English release is a translation of the original.The figures in the release have been rounded  so the sums of individual figures may deviate from the presented totals. This interim report is unaudited.Going concernThe Half-Year review was prepared in accordance with the principle of the business as a going concern. The assumption of continuity is based management assumptions on several factors  including the following:The cost-saving programs started in 2022 have improved the Group’s profitability from the year start 2023 onwards. The fixed expenses have decreased by EUR 1.6 million in comparison with the review period.The Group has invested in its key customers in line with its strategy  and this is expected to have a positive impact on sales trends.During the review period the Group has agreed with the financing bank to increase the cash pool overdraft by EUR 0.7 million.The Company divested fully-owned subsidiary FutureLab & Partners AB with EUR 1.2 million. The transaction supports the equity by a capital gain of about EUR 1.0 million.Negotiations on the arrangements for related party convertible bonds (EUR 5.8 million) maturing in 2024 will begin in the fall of 2023.When the financial statements were published  the company expected its working capital to be sufficient to cover its requirements over the next 12 months based on the financing support provided by the main owner if needed.Goodwill impairment testing and recognised impairmentDigitalist Group tested its goodwill for impairment on 30 June 2023. The goodwill is allocated to one cash-generating unit.The value in use of the tested property exceeded the tested amount by EUR 7.3 million. The present value of the cash flows given by the calculation  EUR 12.8 million  is lower than the sum of the company's financial liabilities of EUR 33.9 million and the market price of the shares of EUR 13.0 million on June 30  2023. The amount of goodwill in the balance sheet at the end of the review period is EUR 5.0 million.The company tests its goodwill based on the utility value of the assets. In the testing conducted on 30 June 2023 in conjunction with the financial statements  the cash flow forecasting period was from 2023 to 2027.During the 2023–2027 forecasting period  average growth in revenue of 10 per cent is expected to be achieved as digitalisation spreads to an increasing share of business life. The EBITDA margin is expected to rise to about 10 per cent by Q1/2025.The method involves comparing the tested assets with their cash flow over the selected period  taking into account the discount rate and the growth factor of the cash flows after the forecast period. The discount rate is 11 per cent per cent. The growth factor used to calculate the cash flows after the forecast period is 2 35 per cent. The weighted average operating profit margin for the forecast period was used to calculate the value of the terminal period. A significant negative change in individual assumptions used in the calculations can necessitate a goodwill impairment charge.KEY INDICATORS1 Jan - 30 Jun 2023 1 Jan - 30 Jun 2022 1 Jan - 31 Dec 2022 Earnings per share (EUR) diluted -0.00 -0.00 -0.01 Earnings per share (EUR) -0 00 -0.00 -0.01 Shareholders’ equity per share (EUR) -0.05 -0.04 -0.05 Cash flow from operations per share (EUR) diluted -0.00 -0.00 0.00 Cash flow from operations per share (EUR) -0.00 -0.00 0.00 Return on capital employed (%) -19.4 -31.3 -75.6 Return on equity (%) neg neg neg.

Anytime  anywhere.""Brunnthal/Munich  Germany  August 25  2023 - SFC Energy AG (F3C:DE  ISIN: DE0007568578)  a leading supplier of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions  celebrates 20 years of fuel cells in the leisure market at this year's Caravan Salon Düsseldorf (August 25 to September 3  2023)  starting with today's Preview Day for retailers and media representatives. At the world's leading trade fair for mobile travel  SFC Energy will present its energy package EFOY Hybrid Power (fuel cell + lithium battery) as well as the world's first fuel cell for private use (A25)  which was first presented at the Caravan Salon 2003.Back in 2003  SFC Energy presented the world's first fuel cell system for the leisure market and launched the concept of hybridising solar  fuel cell and energy management. Only eleven months later  the company from Brunnthal near Munich presented the next generation of methanol fuel cells for emission-free power supply in motor homes and caravans at the Caravan Salon Düsseldorf. The space-saving and lightweight power generators by SFC Energy quickly convinced sailors and boaters as well  as they are ideally suited to supply on-board electronics with environmentally friendly power without interruption and quietly.For 20 years now  SFC Energy has been providing its customers with emission-free and self-sufficient energy solutions in the leisure market. With SFC Energy's compact EFOY fuel cells  users rely on sustainable  off-grid  weather-independent and quiet power generators in maritime applications  camping  glamping  events or in off-grid cabins and tiny houses.Regardless of where they are used  the EFOY fuel cells permanently monitor the charge level of an on-board battery through their integrated charge controllers and recharge it fully automatically when needed. Thanks to the continuous charging  users always have full energy reserves. The powerful EFOY fuel cells are not only used for reliable off-grid power supply of motor homes  caravans  mountain cabins  houseboats and yachts  but also for stationary applications on camping and parking sites. In this way  access barriers  ticket machines  information terminals or video surveillance systems can be operated without access to the conventional power grid.Dr. Peter Podesser  CEO of SFC Energy: ""We are proud to look back on 20 years of fuel cells in the leisure market. This is where our roots lie and in these two decades  SFC Energy has grown from a small start-up to a global leader in hydrogen and methanol fuel cells  which has sold more than 65 000 fuel cells  saving about 5 000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). In addition to products for the leisure sector  SFC Energy now offers a wide range of stationary and mobile energy solutions for industrial and government customers worldwide. We want to continue this success story  which originated in the RV sector  in the caravanning market as well as in all others in order to further advance hydrogen and fuel cell technology for environmentally friendly power generation and to make the future greener.""SFC Energy is looking forward to welcoming visitors to the Caravan Salon Düsseldorf from 25 August to 3 September 2023 in Hall 13 / Stand A36  who would like to see the powerful fuel cell and battery range. In addition  the world's first fuel cell for private use  the A25  presented in 2003  will be exhibited as an anniversary  illustrating the technological progress of the past two decades.

Final authorization depends on a positive opinion from the Ethics Committee in Belgium. A similar application has been filed with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to start this study in the United States  with a response expected in the coming weeks. Further authorizations may be requested in other countries  depending on the needs of the study.Stanislas Veillet  Chief Executive Officer of Biophytis  commented: ""This opinion is a major step forward in our efforts to treat sarcopenia  an age-related neuromuscular disease characterized by the progressive loss of muscle strength and walking in the elderly  leading to loss of autonomy and reduced life expectancy. Despite the enormous medical need posed by this disease  no drug is currently approved anywhere in the world. Today  we are putting our pioneering position in this field into practice by obtaining  for the first time  a positive opinion from a regulatory agency to conduct a phase 3 clinical trial in this debilitating geriatric disease  which affects more than 30 million patients worldwide"".About SARA-31The aim of phase 3 is to evaluate the efficiency and safety of Sarconeos (BIO101) in the treatment of sarcopenic patients at risk of motor disability. Around 900 patients aged over 65 with severe sarcopenia (3 ≤ SPPB ≤ 7) with low walking speed (4-meter walking speed ≤ 0.8 m/s) and low grip strength (HGS < 20kg for women and < 35.5 kg for men) will be included. They will be treated for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 36 months  receiving either placebo or 350mg of Sarconeos (BIO101) twice daily. The main criterion will be an assessment of the risk of Major Mobility Disability (MMD)  measured by the ability to walk 400m in less than 15 minutes. This main criterion will be supplemented by the following secondary criteria: walking speed (4-m walking speed from the SPPB - Short Physical Performance Battery - test)  grip strength (HGS) and patient-reported quality of life (Patient Reported Outcome SarQol  a questionnaire specifically developed for sarcopenia).Roger A. Fielding  PhD  sarcopenia expert and laboratory director at Tufts University  Boston  will be the principal investigator of the SARA-31 study. He is continuing his contribution to the Sarconeos (BIO101) clinical development program in this indication.1About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of drug candidates for age-related diseases. Sarconeos (BIO101)  our lead drug candidate  is a small molecule in development for age-related neuromuscular (sarcopenia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy) and cardiorespiratory (Covid-19) diseases. Promising clinical results were obtained in the treatment of sarcopenia in an international phase 2 study  enabling the launch of a phase 3 study in this indication (SARA project). The safety and efficacy of Sarconeos (BIO101) in the treatment of severe COVID-19 were studied in a positive international phase 2-3 clinical trial (COVA project)  enabling the preparation of conditional marketing authorization (CMA) applications in Europe and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) applications in the United States. A pediatric formulation of Sarconeos (BIO101) is currently being developed for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD  MYODA project).

The topics formed the basis of a recent HousingWire News podcast with Simon Moir  Vice President  Banking Compliance Solutions.Commenting on the essential advantages that digital lending brings to the industry and why Wolters Kluwer has invested considerable resources in this technology—including its major acquisitions of eOriginal and IDS in the past several years—Moir pointed to a key  overriding benefit for lenders: “Our focus was about the most important document in the closing package  which is the promissory note  and that was the focus of the digital ecosystem that we created.”“E-signature is a vital front-end component of a digital lending process ” he continued. “However  the greatest value is provided by a robust eVault  one that can manage all asset classes through funding  whole loan sale  and collateralization. It is critical to do it right to ensure the electronic promissory note (eNote) is both legal and enforceable.”Moir also spoke on the growing role of artificial intelligence and where it’s being utilized in the lending industry right now: “Underwriting  and any process that is being highly repeated  and that handles large amounts of data in our traditional systems  is where AI would be best applied in the industry.”HousingWire is an influential source of news and information for the U.S. mortgage and housing markets  boasting a readership that spans lending  servicing  investments and real estate market participants as well as financial market professionals.Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions is a market leader and trusted provider of risk management and regulatory compliance solutions and services to U.S. banks  credit unions  insurers and securities firms.

Amsterdam   Interim Report   &   Unaudited interim condensed   consolidated financial statements   first six months   of 2023   Cabka N.V. | 2023HY Interim...https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/st…,Company StatementIntroduction to the first six months of Cabka N.V. in 2023This is the second half-year report published by Cabka N.V. since listing at Euronext Amsterdam on March 1  2022.Based on new insights on market practice Cabka recognized listing fees related to its 2022 listing differently in its full year reporting than reported for half-year. For comparison purposes  Cabka uses the same assumptions on listing fees as reported at half-year 2022 and does not include a listing fee in its 2022HY comparable figures. For the impact of listing fees and all other items not covered in this half-year report we refer to the Cabka N.V. Annual Report 2022 published April 25  2023.GovernanceOn February 1  2023  Mr. Necip Küpcü stepped down as CFO and Mr. Frank Roerink took over as interim-CFO. Mr. Roerink was appointed as member of the Management Board and CFO at the June 8  2023  AGM of Cabka.Financial and operational performance first six months of 2023Following a dynamic 2022  Cabka successfully resumed its regular operations during the first half of 2023. All in all  we have seen our operations become more resilient. We addressed energy and material cost volatility by indexing customer contracts. In addition  we have started mitigating energy cost fluctuations by transitioning to long-term renewable energy contracts. Our in-house recycling and material blending expertise further minimized the impact of fluctuating (recycled) material markets.Profitability showed a strong recovery  especially compared to the second half of 2022. Gross profit from regular operations for 2023HY increased to € 50.8 million (2022HY: € 47.3 million)  a 3 percent point higher margin of 49% over sales compared to last year (2022HY: 46%) and EBITDA from regular operations at the indicated level of 13% (2022HY: 13%). Net Income from operations more than quadrupled to € 3.0 million (2022HY: € 0.7million) and the net result including all non-operational of € 0.8 million profit  an improvement of € 2.7 million compared to last year (2022HY: € -1.9 million).Our sales in the first half of 2023 amounted to € 104.3 million  reflecting a modest 2% growth versus last year. The impact of higher inflation and interest rates led to economic deceleration  resulting in destocking and reduced demand. Especially in our core Northern European market we saw demand weakening  while Southern Europe remained strong. In the US destocking effects were offset by robust sales to Target. Excluding the impact of our strategic decision to divest our PVC business and reduced sales of non-RTP legacy products  underlying overall growth was 6%.Following the flooding of our US facility in July 2022  the clean-up and restoration process was concluded early 2023. During the first half of 2023  production lines were gradually reinstated or upgraded  culminating in full operational capacity by the end of the second quarter. Simultaneously we continued to invest in prevention for any future flooding risks. In late June we celebrated together with our customers the re-opening of the US-facilities. Now that we have restored full production capacity in-house  our competitive position has been significantly enhanced. The average age of our machine park has been reduced from 13 to 3 years and our capacity has been expanded  enabling us to further grow our US business. We have stopped using external tollers as of the second half of the year  improving recycling capacity and profitability.Cabka N.V. | 2023HY Interim Report | Page 2 of 21,neutral,0.04,0.94,0.02,mixed,0.37,0.38,0.25,True,English,"['Halfjaarlijkse financiële verslaggeving', 'Cabka N', '04:04', 'Cabka N.V.

CRH  an Irish-based building supply company  has decided to pursue potentially higher profits by portraying itself as an American company. The company recently released its results for the first half of the year  showing a 14% increase in earnings and an 8% rise in sales. CRH currently accounts for nearly half of all trading turnover on the Euronext Dublin exchange and has a market value of €37.5bn. Its departure will leave a significant gap on the exchange.CRH is not the only company to leave Euronext Dublin. Diageo  the owner of Guinness  and Engage XR  a virtual reality software company  have also delisted. Flutter Entertainment  which owns Paddy Power  Betfair  and FanDuel  may also potentially leave the exchange as it seeks a US listing to expand further across the Atlantic. The decision to delist from Euronext Dublin while remaining headquartered in Dublin allows companies like CRH to better compete for contracts under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act  which will invest trillions in infrastructure over the coming years.While Euronext Dublin is experiencing challenges with companies delisting  other exchanges around the world  particularly in the UK and other EU countries  are also facing similar issues. Euronext Dublin  which operates in several European countries  including Ireland  is dwarfed by other exchanges in the group  such as Paris and Amsterdam  which offer access to some of the world’s largest companies. Additionally  the concentration of trading around a handful of companies on the Euronext Dublin platform poses a challenge. Apart from CRH  Flutter Entertainment is also one of the highest traded shares on the exchange  and its departure could have implications.The decline in trading volumes on Euronext Dublin is primarily due to a shift towards larger average trade sizes. While the market saw €42.5bn worth of turnover between January and July this year  compared to €38bn during the same period last year  the number of trades has been declining since March 2020. To offset this reduction  Euronext Dublin needs to focus on generating initial public offerings (IPOs)  which have been relatively low in recent years. The Dublin market has not had an IPO since December 2021.In conclusion  the delisting of CRH and other companies from Euronext Dublin presents challenges for the exchange. The departure of these companies  particularly CRH  which accounts for a significant portion of trading turnover  leaves a gap that is unlikely to be filled soon. The concentration of trading around a few companies and the decline in trading volumes highlight the need for Euronext Dublin to focus on generating IPOs and nurturing the domestic equity markets.,neutral,0.32,0.55,0.13,negative,0.01,0.28,0.71,True,English,"['Emerald Isle', 'Stock Market', 'Key Companies', 'Turmoil', 'Farewell', 'larger average trade sizes', 'Irish-based building supply company', 'virtual reality software company', 'several European countries', 'initial public offerings', 'domestic equity markets', 'other EU countries', 'Inflation Reduction Act', 'Euronext Dublin platform', 'The Dublin market', 'Euronext Dublin exchange', 'American company', 'other exchanges', 'New York', 'higher profits', 'market value', 'Engage XR', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Paddy Power', 'Biden administration', 'coming years', 'similar issues', '42.5bn worth', 'same period', 'recent years', 'significant portion', 'trading volumes', 'other companies', 'stock exchange', 'first half', 'significant gap', 'US listing', 'trading turnover', 'largest companies', 'challenges', 'CRH', 'delists', 'results', '14% increase', 'earnings', '8% rise', 'sales', 'departure', 'Diageo', 'owner', 'Guinness', 'Betfair', 'FanDuel', 'Atlantic', 'decision', 'contracts', 'trillions', 'infrastructure', 'world', 'UK', 'Ireland', 'group', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'access', 'concentration', 'handful', 'shares', 'implications', 'decline', 'shift', 'January', 'July', 'number', 'trades', 'March', 'IPOs', 'December', 'conclusion', 'delisting', 'need']",2023-08-26,2023-08-26,toprated.ie
29398,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/economy/arid-41212489.html,Irish stock market challenged by departure of key companies,Come this time next month  the Euronext stock exchange in Dublin will be facing difficult prospects on its equities market as one of its biggest companies CRH delists and switches to New York as it pursues potentially greener pastures and higher profits ...,"Come this time next month  the Euronext stock exchange in Dublin will be facing difficult prospects on its equities market as one of its biggest companies CRH delists and switches to New York as it pursues potentially greener pastures and higher profits which come with portraying itself as an American company.The Irish-based building supply company — formed in 1970 — has ample reason to move its listing to the US  but as one of the most traded companies on the Euronext Dublin platform  it is leaving behind a gaping hole which is unlikely to be filled anytime soon.On Thursday  CRH released its results for the first half of the year  which showed earnings climbed 14% to $2.5bn (€2.3bn) as sales rose 8% to €16.1bn  reflecting growth in most operations in the Americas and Europe  despite a sharp decline at its European building division which took hits from a slowdown in housebuilding activity and bad weather.On the day CRH released its latest results  it accounted for nearly half of all trading turnover on the Euronext Dublin exchange. While data from one day is not representative  CRH is still one of the biggest and most actively traded shares on the platform.It currently has a market value of €37.5bn  with shares up 41% on this time last year.CRH group chief executive Albert Manifold. The construction firm is delisting form Euronext Dublin. Picture: Naoise CulhaneCRH is not alone in deciding to leave the exchange — which is due to come into effect on September 25. At the end of May  Guinness-owner Diageo delisted from Euronext Dublin  while virtual reality software company Engage XR decided to leave in April.Gambling giant Flutter Entertainment — which owns Paddy Power  Betfair  and FanDuel in the US — could also potentially leave the Euronext Dublin platform  with its chief executive Peter Jackson saying earlier this month it was working towards a US listing for the company as it seeks to further expand across the Atlantic.James Buckley  senior equity research analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald  said the reason CRH was departing Euronext Dublin — but remaining headquartered in Dublin — is because portraying itself as a US company would enable it to better fight for contracts being doled out under the Biden administrations Inflation Reduction Act  which will spend trillions over the coming years on infrastructure.“Anything you can do to highlight that you are really a US company is going to be beneficial in terms of winning contracts ” he said.""With Flutter  it is the fact that FanDuel is driving the business in US side sports betting. So that is going to dominate the group's profile in a few years' time if it keeps going at this rate.”David Kearney  head of corporate broking with Goodbody  said CRH and Flutter are big constituents of the Irish market but their reasons for leaving the exchange are very specific to them.Three-quarters of CRH’s business is done in the US alone  while Flutter Entertainment sees a number of US states de-regulating the gambling sector and it may want a piece of it.“The reasons for the two exits are quite specific to them and don’t necessarily apply to other companies. But there is undoubtedly a need to nurture the domestic equity markets ” Mr Kearney said.Other exchanges facing issuesWhile Euronext Dublin might be experiencing challenges with companies delisting  other exchanges around the world are also facing issues  particularly in the UK as well as in other EU countries.Euronext is a pan-European stock exchange which operates in Dublin  Amsterdam  Brussels  Lisbon  Milan  Oslo  and Paris. It took over the Irish Stock Exchange in 2018.The Dublin exchange is dwarfed by the other bourses in the group  particularly Paris and Amsterdam — both of which can offer access to some of the world’s largest companies such as luxury goods company LVMH in Paris and Heineken in Amsterdam.While Ireland may have numerous multinationals located here  they will never be listed on the Euronext exchange  which means a very large segment of the Irish economy is not represented on the platform.One of the other issues the Euronext Dublin platform is facing is just how concentrated it is around just a handful of companies.In addition to CRH  Flutter Entertainment is also one of the highest traded shares on the exchange and has a market value now standing at €29.2bn. A decision by Flutter to leave the exchange could also have implications.Other big companies listed in Euronext Dublin include Ryanair  Kerry Group  Glanbia  AIB  Bank of Ireland  as well as Kingspan. Most of the companies are also listed on the London Stock Exchange  with the exception of Kingspan  which announced in July that it would be leaving in a move that was backed by a majority of shareholders.During July  the number of trades on the Euronext Dublin platform dropped to just over 424 000 from over 500 000 during June. The number of trades per month has been on the decline since it peaked in March last year at over 1.15 million.Decline in trading volumesEuronext said the decline in trading volumes was primarily due to a shift towards larger average trade sizes similar to those before the covid pandemic. It pointed out that between January and July this year  the market saw €42.5bn worth of turnover versus €38bn during the same period in 2022.Mr Buckley said Euronext Dublin could see trading volumes come back from the banks as the Irish Government sells down its shares in AIB and Permanent TSB.However  he said this was just going to offset the reduction in trading volumes and what Euronext Dublin really needs to do is focus on generating initial public offerings (IPOs) which have “not been particularly buoyant in recent years”.According to Euronext data  the Dublin market has not had an IPO since December 2021  when Health Beacon decided to list on the Euronext Growth market. It currently has a market value of just over €30m.Before that  it was energy storage company Corre Energy in September of that year  which now has a market value of €243.8m.Mr Buckley said the increasing costs of borrowing  due to repeated interest rate hikes from the European Central Bank  should “theoretically” encourage more companies to list on the market but the question is whether there will be the volumes there to support it in investor interests.""If you look at recent IPOs in the UK over the past couple of years  they haven't been particularly successful in a lot of cases. So  theoretically yes it should improve the landscape for Euronext  vis-à-vis debt financing ” Mr Buckley said.Dublin platform viableMr Kearney said the Euronext Dublin platform is viable and had added a huge amount of value over the years  pointing to a number of success stories such as Ryanair.“There’s about €10bn plus activity every month on the Irish equity market  so it is not insignificant. A very significant majority of that is very large institutional investors buying and selling the Irish companies listed.”Mr Kearney added he did not have any concerns about the exchange and that its track record speaks for itself.There isn’t a structural issue with the exchange. If anything there is a structural issue with equity markets globally. That is a whole different ball game.“A functioning domestic capital market supports a more vibrant funding environment which supports entrepreneurship  company formation which supports employment  tax generation. All of those kinds of good things that you really want for a really healthy functioning domestic economy ” he said.“Every global investor of note  we’re talking in the thousands  participates in the Irish markets.”Mr Buckley pointed out that the London Stock Exchange is facing some of the same issues Euronext Dublin is.“It is basically along the lines of typically US-listed companies trade on higher multiples certainly than companies listed in Europe or in the UK ” he said.“There is also  in the US  shareholders are more relaxed about executive remunerations. In the US  pay packages for the top executives — and I'm talking about the C-suite here — would typically be significantly higher and attract less attention than they would do in Dublin or London ” he said.In the last week  Cambridge-based chip designer Arm Ltd  which is controlled by Softbank Group  opted to file its initial public offering in the US rather than in the UK.It is the latest blow to the London Stock Exchange  which has seen a number of companies quit and whose indices have fallen behind others in the US and Europe.In a statement  Euronext said while it was disappointed CRH had decided to leave the exchange  it was continuing to work with the equity capital markets ecosystem to promote equity capital markets in Ireland and IPO as a viable funding option for Irish growth companies.According to recent data from accounting firm EY  the London Stock Exchange saw a subdued first half of 2023  with 18 IPOs issued raising £593m following similar trends to 2022.During the first six months of 2022  there were 26 IPOs  issued which raised £594m.While these figures are in line year to year  they are down massively from the 47 IPOs issued during the first half of 2021 which raised £9.4bn.EY said IPO performance continued to be adversely impacted by high inflation  rising interest rates  and geopolitical pressures.In a statement  Euronext said while it was disappointed CRH had decided to leave the exchange  it was continuing to work with the equity capital markets ecosystem to promote equity capital markets in Ireland and IPO as a viable funding option for Irish growth companies.“It’s worth noting that the challenges facing Irish equity capital markets are not unique to Ireland and are being experienced by the UK and a number of EU markets ” it said.“We see initiatives under way by individual EU countries to incentivise more IPOs on their markets and by the European Commission to make EU capital markets more accessible and attractive for small and medium-sized enterprises.”",neutral,0.07,0.7,0.23,negative,0.05,0.34,0.62,True,English,"['Irish stock market', 'key companies', 'departure', 'Biden administrations Inflation Reduction Act', 'CRH group chief executive Albert Manifold', 'The Irish-based building supply company', 'senior equity research analyst', 'virtual reality software company', 'US side sports betting', 'Gambling giant Flutter Entertainment', 'European building division', 'domestic equity markets', 'luxury goods company', 'The Dublin exchange', 'other EU countries', 'pan-European stock exchange', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'Euronext stock exchange', 'Euronext Dublin platform', 'Euronext Dublin exchange', 'Other big companies', 'American company', 'US company', 'big constituents', 'Kerry Group', 'Euronext exchange', 'Irish market', 'Irish economy', 'Other exchanges', 'other bourses', 'difficult prospects', 'equities market', 'New York', 'greener pastures', 'higher profits', 'gaping hole', 'most operations', 'housebuilding activity', 'bad weather', 'trading turnover', 'market value', 'construction firm', 'Naoise Culhane', 'Guinness-owner Diageo', 'Engage XR', 'Paddy Power', 'Peter Jackson', 'James Buckley', 'Cantor Fitzgerald', 'coming years', 'David Kearney', 'corporate broking', 'two exits', 'Mr Kearney', 'numerous multinationals', 'large segment', 'trading volumes', 'other companies', 'US states', 'largest companies', 'other issues', 'CRH delists', 'first half', 'latest results', 'one day', ""years' time"", 'US listing', 'sharp decline', 'biggest companies', 'reason', 'Thursday', 'earnings', 'sales', 'growth', 'Americas', 'hits', 'slowdown', 'data', 'shares', 'Picture', 'effect', 'September', 'end', 'May', 'April', 'Betfair', 'FanDuel', 'Atlantic', 'contracts', 'trillions', 'infrastructure', 'Anything', 'terms', 'fact', 'business', 'profile', 'head', 'Goodbody', 'Three-quarters', 'number', 'sector', 'piece', 'need', 'challenges', 'world', 'UK', 'Amsterdam', 'Brussels', 'Lisbon', 'Milan', 'Oslo', 'Paris', 'access', 'LVMH', 'Heineken', 'Ireland', 'handful', 'addition', 'decision', 'implications', 'Ryanair', 'Glanbia', 'AIB', 'Bank', 'Kingspan', 'exception', 'July', 'move', 'majority', 'shareholders', 'trades', 'June', 'month', 'March']",2023-08-26,2023-08-26,irishexaminer.com
