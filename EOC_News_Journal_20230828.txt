Will They Take Off?,(Bloomberg) -- The zero-day options trade that has taken Wall Street by storm will finally arrive in Europe next week  in a fresh test for the region’s long-...,Wall Street’s Hot Options Come to Europe. Will They Take Off?(Bloomberg) -- The zero-day options trade that has taken Wall Street by storm will finally arrive in Europe next week  in a fresh test for the region’s long-struggling capital markets.Most Read from BloombergStarting Monday  Deutsche Boerse AG’s Eurex will list Euro Stoxx 50 (SX5E) derivatives that expire every weekday  following US peers who introduced the now-booming contracts tied to the S&P 500 last year. Every trading session  investors in Europe will be able to buy and sell derivatives expiring the same day  known as zero-days-to-expiration contracts  or 0DTE.Their introduction unleashed a torrent of trading activity on the other side of the Atlantic  as retail and institutional investors used them as a tool for speculation and hedging.At one point this month 0DTE accounted for a record 55% of the trading volume for options tied to the S&P 500  according to data compiled by Nomura Securities International. The derivatives have grown so popular that some now fear they’re swaying America’s benchmark equity gauge itself.In Europe  the level of demand for the contracts will be closely watched by participants looking for signs of life in the moribund market. But amid the chronic underperformance of equity benchmarks  dwindling stock listings and stagnant volumes  the options face an uphill battle to have an impact.“You don’t have that same kind of pent-up demand ” said Kieran Diamond  a London-based derivatives strategist at UBS Group AG. “And the S&P just has a very strong track record as the main global liquidity pool for equity volatility.”As of Tuesday  the daily notional amount of Euro Stoxx 50 options traded averaged $45 billion over the past month  data compiled by UBS show. For the US benchmark  the equivalent figure was nearly $1.3 trillion.Story continuesEven before the addition of Tuesday and Thursday expirations last year — which made it possible to trade S&P 500 products expiring every weekday — weekly options had been growing in popularity in the US  Diamond noted. In contrast  activity in options tied to the SX5E is mainly focused on monthly contracts.While the new expirations are unlikely to generate a frenzy to match the US  they may still lift volumes  with trading pros as the main users  according to Patrick Bonouvrie  head of European index derivatives trading at Optiver BV.“There’s been a clear trend globally in investors showing greater preference for shorter-dated options ” Bonouvrie said by email. “Daily options allow for the hedging of very specific risks – such as ECB events – that couldn’t be hedged with the same granularity before.”Eurex has previously said the new contracts are a response to increasingly strong demand from institutions for more options with short-term expiries. Alongside the introduction of daily expirations  the derivatives will also now settle at the stock-market close of 5:30 p.m. Central European Time  instead of the current midday settlement. That will allow greater scope to trade events during the market day.The new derivatives are unlikely to find much retail investor interest  however. Day traders have turned out to be a notable driver of the 0DTE boom in the US  the exchange at the center of the frenzy said this week. But retail participation overall in the equity market in Europe is substantially lower than across the Atlantic  suggesting a key source of demand simply isn’t present.To some  that may be no bad thing. Strategists in the US have speculated that 0DTE activity is now so large it can move the S&P 500  as option dealers rush to hedge their own positions while traders furiously buy and sell contracts in response to intraday swings.It’s all the subject of a heated debate with no end in sight — one that Europe is unlikely to be part of any time soon.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2023 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.12,0.86,0.02,negative,0.03,0.25,0.73,True,English,"['Wall Street', 'Hot Options', 'Europe', 'main global liquidity pool', 'Euro Stoxx 50 (SX5E) derivatives', 'struggling capital markets', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'Nomura Securities International', 'dwindling stock listings', 'current midday settlement', 'Euro Stoxx 50 options', 'UBS Group AG', 'strong track record', 'daily notional amount', 'London-based derivatives strategist', 'European index derivatives', 'Central European Time', 'retail investor interest', 'benchmark equity gauge', 'zero-day options trade', 'S&P 500 products', 'Bloomberg L.P.', 'main users', 'UBS show', 'daily expirations', 'equity benchmarks', 'equity volatility', 'equity market', 'new derivatives', 'Wall Street', 'fresh test', 'trading session', 'same day', 'other side', 'one point', 'trading volume', 'moribund market', 'chronic underperformance', 'uphill battle', 'same kind', 'past month', 'equivalent figure', 'Thursday expirations', 'new expirations', 'trading pros', 'Optiver BV', 'clear trend', 'greater preference', 'specific risks', 'same granularity', 'strong demand', 'short-term expiries', 'greater scope', 'market day', 'notable driver', 'retail participation', 'key source', 'bad thing', 'option dealers', 'intraday swings', 'heated debate', 'US benchmark', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Hot Options', 'weekly options', 'shorter-dated options', 'booming contracts', 'expiration contracts', 'trading activity', 'monthly contracts', 'new contracts', 'stagnant volumes', 'pent-up demand', 'Kieran Diamond', 'Patrick Bonouvrie', 'ECB events', 'Day traders', '0DTE boom', 'US peers', 'institutional investors', '0DTE activity', 'storm', 'region', 'Monday', 'Eurex', 'introduction', 'torrent', 'Atlantic', 'tool', 'speculation', 'hedging', 'data', 'America', 'level', 'participants', 'signs', 'life', 'impact', 'Tuesday', 'Story', 'addition', 'popularity', 'contrast', 'frenzy', 'head', 'email', 'response', 'institutions', 'stock-market', 'exchange', 'center', 'Strategists', 'positions', 'subject', 'sight', '5:30']",2023-08-27,2023-08-28,finance.yahoo.com
29402,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zero-day-options-have-arrived-for-europes-most-popular-stock-market-index-148f6052,Zero-day options have arrived for Europe’s most popular stock market index,Monday marks the start of zero-day options for the Euro Stoxx 50 index. Options traders and analysts say they will struggle to match the might of their,Credited for exacerbating a down day for Wall Street earlier this month  an increasingly popular stock option is now available for one of Europe’s most popular stock indexes.Deutsche Boerse’s DB1  +0.74% Eurex  an international futures and options exchange  is now offering investors the ability to trade in zero-day options for the Euro Stoxx 50 index XX:SX5P.“Institutional demand for options with short-term expiries has strongly increased as investors seek to react quickly and precisely to specific market events ” said the exchange organization in a press release last week.There’s been a phenomenal rise of so-called 0DTEs (zero days to expiration) ptions across the Atlantic.Launched by two major U.S. derivatives exchanges last year  trading volume on options linked to the S&P 500 SPX or an S&P 500-tracking exchange-traded fund  such as the SPDR S&P 500 Trust SPY  soared in August to record highs. That’s as feverish activity those options was also blamed for driving a sudden U.S. stock selloff earlier this month.Also read: ‘This is a no-rules market’. Goldman strategist explains why recent stock moves have confounded traders.The CBOE said in an email that total volumes for S&P 500 Index options in July was more than 2.6 million contracts  with roughly 46% of that volume (1.2 million contracts) in 0DTE contracts. For August  the total volume for SPX options was 2.9 million contracts and 0DTE options comprised approximately 50% of that.“It is too early to tell what the appetite is. In the U.S.  these instruments have become the most traded in equity options and especially by individual investors  so it would be fair to assume that 0DTEs will be popular in Europe ” said Saxo Bank’s head of equity  Peter Garnry  in emailed comments.According to Deutsche Boerse  futures and options on the Euro Stoxx 50 are the most traded  with nearly 19 million index options and more than 15 million futures contracts traded at Eurex in July.But the concept of zero-day options in Europe is not exactly new  according to Koen Hoefgeest  a professional options trader based in the Netherlands. Daily Amsterdam Exchange Index options  also known as 0DTE options  were introduced on Euronext Liffe Options Exchange on March 31  2008 after the success of AEX Index weekly options  he told MarketWatch in emailed comments.Now housed at what’s known as ICE Futures Europe  after a series of takeovers  the AEX NL:AEX options expire at the end of the day providing there is no other weekly or monthly index option expiration that day.Citing Euronext data  Hoefgeest said overnight options trading made up 23.4% of total AEX options trading in the first few months of this year  versus 21.2% in 2022 as a whole.“So there is no real frenzy going on in daily options in Amsterdam ” he said.“From my point of view  interest from private investors will not be overwhelming. How professional parties will use the new daily Euro Stoxx 50 options for leveraged products or hedging activities is uncertain  but I don’t think they will take off as quickly as in the U.S. ” said Hoefgeest.Saxo Bank’s Garnry said “judging from our client behavior [0DTEs are] something traders like a lot  so again I think the evidence is staked in favor of high interest on the 0DTEs from Deutsche Börse.”Also read: Here are 5 ways that trading in 0DTE stock options is changing how the market works,neutral,0.08,0.91,0.01,negative,0.02,0.15,0.83,True,English,"['popular stock market index', 'Zero-day options', 'Europe', 'two major U.S. derivatives exchanges', 'S&P 500-tracking exchange-traded fund', 'SPDR S&P 500 Trust SPY', 'sudden U.S. stock selloff', 'new daily Euro Stoxx 50 options', 'Daily Amsterdam Exchange Index options', 'Euro Stoxx 50 index XX', 'S&P 500 Index options', 'AEX NL:AEX options', 'monthly index option expiration', 'AEX Index weekly options', 'Euronext Liffe Options Exchange', 'S&P 500 SPX', 'popular stock option', 'popular stock indexes', 'recent stock moves', '19 million index options', 'total AEX options', 'overnight options trading', 'Deutsche Börse', '0DTE stock options', 'professional options trader', 'specific market events', '15 million futures contracts', 'ICE Futures Europe', 'daily options', 'exchange organization', 'SPX options', 'other weekly', 'Euronext data', '0DTE options', 'zero-day options', '2.6 million contracts', '1.2 million contracts', '2.9 million contracts', 'professional parties', '0DTE contracts', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'total volumes', 'international futures', 'equity options', 'Wall Street', 'Institutional demand', 'short-term expiries', 'press release', 'zero days', 'feverish activity', 'rules market', 'Goldman strategist', 'The CBOE', 'Saxo Bank', 'real frenzy', 'hedging activities', 'client behavior', 'down day', 'individual investors', 'Peter Garnry', 'private investors', 'high interest', 'Koen Hoefgeest', '0.74% Eurex', 'ability', 'rise', '0DTEs', 'Atlantic', 'August', 'highs', 'traders', 'email', 'July', 'appetite', 'instruments', 'head', 'comments', 'concept', 'Netherlands', 'March', 'success', 'MarketWatch', 'series', 'takeovers', 'end', 'first', 'months', 'year', 'point', 'view', 'products', 'something', 'lot', 'evidence', 'favor', '5 ways']",2023-08-28,2023-08-28,marketwatch.com
