A once-daily oral administration of GLPG3667 or placebo will be investigated in approximately 140 adult patients with SLE for 32 weeks. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who achieve the SLE responder index (SRI)-4 response at Week 32. The secondary efficacy endpoints are the proportion of patients who achieve the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) response at Week 32  proportion of patients with >=50% reduction in Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index Activity (CLASI-A) score at Week 16  proportion of patients who achieve Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) at Week 32 and change from baseline in the 28-joint count for tender  swollen  and tender and swollen (active) joints at Week 32.“We are proud to have reached this important milestone in our journey to improve the lives of patients living with autoimmune diseases. Although significant progress has been made in the management of SLE over the past decade  flares  morbidity  and mortality continue to remain a significant concern and quality of life is poor among patients living with SLE ” said Daniele D’Ambrosio  MD  PhD  Therapeutic Area Head Immunology  at Galapagos. “We are excited about GLPG3667’s potential to make a meaningful difference for people living with SLE and look forward to advancing this candidate medicine in clinical development.”GLPG3667 is an investigational drug and is not approved by any regulatory authority. Its efficacy and safety have not been established or fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)SLE is a chronic  inflammatory  autoimmune disease affecting nearly every organ system and thereby one of the most heterogeneous illnesses treated by physicians1. The pathogenesis of SLE is characterized by a global loss of self-tolerance with activation of autoreactive T and B cells. This leads to the production of pathogenic autoantibodies that primarily target a variety of nuclear antigens  deposit in tissues and activate complement  resulting in organ damage. SLE affects women more frequently than men and is more prevalent and severe (with higher disease activity and more damage accrual) in non-Caucasian populations (Hispanics  African descendants  and Asians)2. SLE has periods of relatively stable disease followed by flares that may induce irreversible organ damage. Despite best practice  most patients accrue irreversible organ damage within 7 years of diagnosis. SLE has no cure and current treatment options are associated with partial efficacy and/or substantial toxicities. New treatments may help to fulfill the current unmet medical needs among patients.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company united around a single purpose: to transform patient outcomes through life-changing science and innovation for more years of life and quality of life.

Immunogenicity data for the trial are expected in November 2023.Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and conducted in collaboration with Instituto Butantan  the VLA1553-321 adolescent trial is intended to support label extension in this age group following a potential initial regulatory approval in adults from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States (U.S). The trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations. The present safety analysis is also expected to enable regulatory submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) later this year.Initial safety data generated in the ongoing trial VLA1553-321  Valneva’s first clinical trial in an endemic area and with individuals previously infected with CHIKV  showed that VLA1553 was generally safe and well tolerated in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years  regardless of previous CHIKV infection.754 individuals were vaccinated in trial VLA1553-321  and the present analysis includes safety data up to Day 29. An independent DSMB has continuously evaluated safety data during the trial and has not identified any safety concerns. Overall  the adverse event profile is consistent with the profile observed in Valneva’s pivotal Phase 3 trial in adults. The majority of solicited adverse events observed following VLA1553 administration were mild or moderate and resolved within three days. Importantly  the initial data suggest a favorable safety profile in seropositive participants  confirming the observations following re-vaccination of individuals in Phase 1 trial VLA1553-1011.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “These new safety data in a younger population and in individuals previously infected with the chikungunya virus confirm the safety profile we previously observed in adults and the elderly. Chikungunya represents a major threat for people traveling to or living in areas where chikungunya virus is endemic  it is therefore our objective to make this vaccine available to all age groups  especially as no vaccine or specific treatments are currently available for this debilitating disease.”Valneva reported final pivotal Phase 3 data in 4 115 adults aged 18 years and above in March 20222 and the Lancet subsequently published these results in June 20233. Final lot-to-lot consistency results were published in May 20224 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 20225.A Biologic License Application (BLA) for VLA1553 is currently under priority review by the U.S. FDA with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date planned for end of November 20236.Additionally  a regulatory application has also been filed with Health Canada7. If approved  VLA1553 could become the first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need.About Phase 3 study VLA1553-321VLA1553-321 is a prospective  double-blinded  multicenter  randomized  placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 trial conducted in 754 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old in Brazil. The VLA1553-321 clinical trial was initiated in January 2022 and Valneva reported enrollment and vaccination completion in February 2023. VLA1553 or placebo was administered as a single intramuscular immunization to participants who were randomized into two study groups at a 2:1 ratio. The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the adult dose of VLA1553 28 days following a single vaccination. Secondary objectives of the trial include assessment of safety and immunogenicity up to twelve months following a single vaccination with VLA1553. The study will also provide safety and immunogenicity data in participants previously exposed to chikungunya.Additional information  including a detailed description of the study design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04650399).About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20328. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries9. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas10 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 110 countries11. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 202212  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202213 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202214.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA155315. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201916  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.VLA1553 received FDA Fast Track  Breakthrough Therapy designations and Priority Review in 2018  2021 and 2023  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases.

Wolters Kluwer experts Hans Howk  Manager  Content Management  and Christie Montgomery  Senior Field Sales Executive  will share insights on these new rules as well as other important  end-of-year compliance information  providing attendees an actionable check-list to help prepare for BOI and other notable business requirements. The insights will be shared in a panel presentation at 1 p.m. EDT Tuesday  September 12th  2023.“This year has come with plenty of regulatory changes for businesses of all sizes  so it’s more important than ever that leaders are as up to date with what they need to do to meet those requirements—including the all-important new beneficial ownership  or BOI  rules ” said Howk.FinCEN issued the BOI final rule  which is part of the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA)  in September 2022. It requires companies to collect  document and monitor previously unreported data. The rule will impact an estimated 32.6 million reporting companies next year and 5.5 million new reporting companies that are formed and registered every year going forward.In addition to discussing BOI obligations  the panelists will address compliance issues relating to business licenses and temporary or permanent remote employees  provide a review of key corporate actions and corresponding requirements  highlight best practices for accomplishing planned corporate actions prior to this year’s end  and offer compliance guidance to optimize one’s entity management processes.“Session participants will gain a deeper understanding of best practices to keep their businesses compliant  not only before the end of the year  but also learn how to make it a year-round habit ” Howk added.For more than 130 years  Wolters Kluwer CT Corporation has been the leading provider of registered agent services  incorporation services  and legal entity compliance.

A once-daily oral administration of GLPG3667 or placebo will be investigated in approximately 140 adult patients with SLE for 32 weeks. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who achieve the SLE responder index (SRI)-4 response at Week 32. The secondary efficacy endpoints are the proportion of patients who achieve the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) response at Week 32  proportion of patients with >=50% reduction in Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index Activity (CLASI-A) score at Week 16  proportion of patients who achieve Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) at Week 32 and change from baseline in the 28-joint count for tender  swollen  and tender and swollen (active) joints at Week 32.“We are proud to have reached this important milestone in our journey to improve the lives of patients living with autoimmune diseases.

Its efficacy and safety have not been established or fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)SLE is a chronic  inflammatory  autoimmune disease affecting nearly every organ system and thereby one of the most heterogeneous illnesses treated by physicians1. The pathogenesis of SLE is characterized by a global loss of self-tolerance with activation of autoreactive T and B cells. This leads to the production of pathogenic autoantibodies that primarily target a variety of nuclear antigens  deposit in tissues and activate complement  resulting in organ damage. SLE affects women more frequently than men and is more prevalent and severe (with higher disease activity and more damage accrual) in non-Caucasian populations (Hispanics  African descendants  and Asians)2. SLE has periods of relatively stable disease followed by flares that may induce irreversible organ damage. Despite best practice  most patients accrue irreversible organ damage within 7 years of diagnosis. SLE has no cure and current treatment options are associated with partial efficacy and/or substantial toxicities. New treatments may help to fulfill the current unmet medical needs among patients.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company united around a single purpose: to transform patient outcomes through life-changing science and innovation for more years of life and quality of life.

Immunogenicity data for the t…,Saint-Herblain (France)  August28  2023 – ValnevaSE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported positive initial Phase 3 safety data in adolescents for its single-dose chikungunya virus (CHIKV) vaccine candidate VLA1553. Immunogenicity data for the trial are expected in November 2023.Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and conducted in collaboration with Instituto Butantan  the VLA1553-321 adolescent trial is intended to support label extension in this age group following a potential initial regulatory approval in adults from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States (U.S). The trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations. The present safety analysis is also expected to enable regulatory submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) later this year.Initial safety data generated in the ongoing trial VLA1553-321  Valneva’s first clinical trial in an endemic area and with individuals previously infected with CHIKV  showed that VLA1553 was generally safe and well tolerated in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years  regardless of previous CHIKV infection.754 individuals were vaccinated in trial VLA1553-321  and the present analysis includes safety data up to Day 29. An independent DSMB has continuously evaluated safety data during the trial and has not identified any safety concerns. Overall  the adverse event profile is consistent with the profile observed in Valneva’s pivotal Phase 3 trial in adults. The majority of solicited adverse events observed following VLA1553 administration were mild or moderate and resolved within three days. Importantly  the initial data suggest a favorable safety profile in seropositive participants  confirming the observations following re-vaccination of individuals in Phase 1 trial VLA1553-1011.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “These new safety data in a younger population and in individuals previously infected with the chikungunya virus confirm the safety profile we previously observed in adults and the elderly. Chikungunya represents a major threat for people traveling to or living in areas where chikungunya virus is endemic  it is therefore our objective to make this vaccine available to all age groups  especially as no vaccine or specific treatments are currently available for this debilitating disease.”Valneva reported final pivotal Phase 3 data in 4 115 adults aged 18 years and above in March 20222 and the Lancet subsequently published these results in June 20233. Final lot-to-lot consistency results were published in May 20224 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 20225.A Biologic License Application (BLA) for VLA1553 is currently under priority review by the U.S. FDA with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date planned for end of November 20236.Additionally  a regulatory application has also been filed with Health Canada7. If approved  VLA1553 could become the first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need.About Phase 3 study VLA1553-321VLA1553-321 is a prospective  double-blinded  multicenter  randomized  placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 trial conducted in 754 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old in Brazil. The VLA1553-321 clinical trial was initiated in January 2022 and Valneva reported enrollment and vaccination completion in February 2023. VLA1553 or placebo was administered as a single intramuscular immunization to participants who were randomized into two study groups at a 2:1 ratio. The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the adult dose of VLA1553 28 days following a single vaccination. Secondary objectives of the trial include assessment of safety and immunogenicity up to twelve months following a single vaccination with VLA1553. The study will also provide safety and immunogenicity data in participants previously exposed to chikungunya.Additional information  including a detailed description of the study design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04650399).About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20328. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries9. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas10 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 110 countries11. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 202212  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202213 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202214.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA155315. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201916  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.VLA1553 received FDA Fast Track  Breakthrough Therapy designations and Priority Review in 2018  2021 and 2023  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases.

For acquisition and management commissions linked to sales of insurance policies  net sales comprise current and future commissions issued  acquired by the accounting reporting date  net of cancellations.2 For the digital marketing business  the gross margin represents the total amount of net sales (total invoices issued: fees  commissions and purchases charged back to customers) less the total amount of costs for external purchases made on behalf of customers. It is equal to net sales for the magazine and insurance business lines.3 The scope effect is calculated (i) by eliminating the net sales of companies acquired during the period or the comparable period and (ii) by eliminating the net sales of companies sold during the period or the comparable period. As a result  the business on a like-for-like basis does not take into account this scope effect for the period concerned.4 Gross sales volume represents the value of subscriptions and other products sold.

29452,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zero-day-options-have-arrived-for-europes-most-popular-stock-market-index-148f6052,Zero-day options have arrived for Europe’s most popular stock market index,Monday marks the start of zero-day options for the Euro Stoxx 50 index. Options traders and analysts say they will struggle to match the might of their U.S. counterparts.,Credited for exacerbating a down day for Wall Street earlier this month  an increasingly popular stock option is now available for one of Europe’s most popular stock indexes.Deutsche Boerse’s DB1  +0.09% Eurex  an international futures and options exchange  is now offering investors the ability to trade in zero-day options for the Euro Stoxx 50 index XX:SX5P.“Institutional demand for options with short-term expiries has strongly increased as investors seek to react quickly and precisely to specific market events ” said the exchange organization in a press release last week.There’s been a phenomenal rise of so-called 0DTEs (zero days to expiration) ptions across the Atlantic.Launched by two major U.S. derivatives exchanges last year  trading volume on options linked to the S&P 500 SPX or an S&P 500-tracking exchange-traded fund  such as the SPDR S&P 500 Trust SPY  soared in August to record highs. That’s as feverish activity those options was also blamed for driving a sudden U.S. stock selloff earlier this month.Also read: ‘This is a no-rules market’. Goldman strategist explains why recent stock moves have confounded traders.The CBOE said in an email that total volumes for S&P 500 Index options in July was more than 2.6 million contracts  with roughly 46% of that volume (1.2 million contracts) in 0DTE contracts. For August  the total volume for SPX options was 2.9 million contracts and 0DTE options comprised approximately 50% of that.“It is too early to tell what the appetite is. In the U.S.  these instruments have become the most traded in equity options and especially by individual investors  so it would be fair to assume that 0DTEs will be popular in Europe ” said Saxo Bank’s head of equity  Peter Garnry  in emailed comments.According to Deutsche Boerse  futures and options on the Euro Stoxx 50 are the most traded  with nearly 19 million index options and more than 15 million futures contracts traded at Eurex in July.But the concept of zero-day options in Europe is not exactly new  according to Koen Hoefgeest  a professional options trader based in the Netherlands. Daily Amsterdam Exchange Index options  also known as 0DTE options  were introduced on Euronext Liffe Options Exchange on March 31  2008 after the success of AEX Index weekly options  he told MarketWatch in emailed comments.Now housed at what’s known as ICE Futures Europe  after a series of takeovers  the AEX NL:AEX options expire at the end of the day providing there is no other weekly or monthly index option expiration that day.Citing Euronext data  Hoefgeest said overnight options trading made up 23.4% of total AEX options trading in the first few months of this year  versus 21.2% in 2022 as a whole.“So there is no real frenzy going on in daily options in Amsterdam ” he said.“From my point of view  interest from private investors will not be overwhelming. How professional parties will use the new daily Euro Stoxx 50 options for leveraged products or hedging activities is uncertain  but I don’t think they will take off as quickly as in the U.S. ” said Hoefgeest.Saxo Bank’s Garnry said “judging from our client behavior [0DTEs are] something traders like a lot  so again I think the evidence is staked in favor of high interest on the 0DTEs from Deutsche Börse.”Also read: Here are 5 ways that trading in 0DTE stock options is changing how the market works,neutral,0.08,0.91,0.01,negative,0.02,0.15,0.83,True,English,"['popular stock market index', 'Zero-day options', 'Europe', 'two major U.S. derivatives exchanges', 'S&P 500-tracking exchange-traded fund', 'SPDR S&P 500 Trust SPY', 'sudden U.S. stock selloff', 'new daily Euro Stoxx 50 options', 'Daily Amsterdam Exchange Index options', 'Euro Stoxx 50 index XX', 'S&P 500 Index options', 'AEX NL:AEX options', 'monthly index option expiration', 'AEX Index weekly options', 'Euronext Liffe Options Exchange', 'S&P 500 SPX', 'popular stock option', 'popular stock indexes', 'recent stock moves', '19 million index options', 'total AEX options', 'overnight options trading', 'Deutsche Börse', '0DTE stock options', 'professional options trader', 'specific market events', '15 million futures contracts', 'ICE Futures Europe', 'daily options', 'exchange organization', 'SPX options', 'other weekly', 'Euronext data', '0DTE options', 'zero-day options', '2.6 million contracts', '1.2 million contracts', '2.9 million contracts', 'professional parties', '0DTE contracts', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'total volumes', 'international futures', 'equity options', 'Wall Street', 'Institutional demand', 'short-term expiries', 'press release', 'zero days', 'feverish activity', 'rules market', 'Goldman strategist', 'The CBOE', 'Saxo Bank', 'real frenzy', 'hedging activities', 'client behavior', 'down day', 'individual investors', 'Peter Garnry', 'private investors', 'high interest', 'Koen Hoefgeest', '0.09% Eurex', 'ability', 'rise', '0DTEs', 'Atlantic', 'August', 'highs', 'traders', 'email', 'July', 'appetite', 'instruments', 'head', 'comments', 'concept', 'Netherlands', 'March', 'success', 'MarketWatch', 'series', 'takeovers', 'end', 'first', 'months', 'year', 'point', 'view', 'products', 'something', 'lot', 'evidence', 'favor', '5 ways']",2023-08-28,2023-08-29,marketwatch.com
