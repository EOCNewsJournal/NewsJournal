(formerly NEPI Rockcastle S.A.) Incorporated and registered in the Netherlands Registration number 87488329 Share code: NRP ISIN: NL0015000RT3 (""NEPI Rockcastle"" or ""the Company"") CIRCULAR TO NEPI ROCKCASTLE SHAREHOLDERS IN RESPECT OF AN ELECTION TO RECEIVE A CAPITAL REPAYMENT  ORDINARY CASH DIVIDEND OR SCRIP ISSUE Shareholders are referred to NEPI Rockcastle's interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2023  published on Tuesday  22 August 2023  wherein shareholders were advised that the board of directors had declared an interim dividend of 25.67 euro cents per share for the six months ended 30 June 2023 (""interim dividend"")  corresponding to a 90% dividend pay-out ratio. The board of directors of the Company has resolved to offer to NEPI Rockcastle shareholders the election to receive the interim dividend: via a reduction and repayment in cash of the nominal value per share ("" capital repayment "")  by way of amendments to articles of association of the Company ("" the Articles "")  as approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting held on14 June 2023 ("" the June 2023 AGM ""); or as an ordinary cash dividend out of distributable profits ("" cash dividend ""). As an alternative  shareholders may elect to receive a distribution of 27.10 euro cents per share  corresponding to a 95% dividend pay-out ratio and representing a 5.6% premium to the interim dividend  by way of an issue of new shares with a nominal value of €0.01 each credited as fully paid up (""scrip issue""). A circular in this regard was posted today and is available on the Company's website at: https://nepirockcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NEPI-Rockcastle-Shareholders-in-Respect-of-the-Interim-Dividend-for-the-Six-Months-Ended-30-June-2023.pdf The election is available in respect of all or part of a shareholder's shareholdings as at Friday  15 September 2023. The capital repayment will be paid to shareholders unless they elect to receive either the cash dividend or the scrip issue. Therefore  NEPI Rockcastle shareholders who wish to receive either the cash dividend or the scrip issue must ensure that their elections are lodged in accordance with the ""Salient Dates and Times"" set out below. The election by a shareholder of one option implies an opt-out of the other option(s). The rationale for offering two alternatives as to how cash is received  namely as a capital repayment or a cash dividend  is to reduce the compliance costs of claiming tax refunds in respect of the cash dividend. The rationale for the scrip issue is to offer shareholders the opportunity to increase their shareholding in NEPI Rockcastle and to retain flexibility regarding the Company's cash resources. Capital repayment Shareholders receiving the capital repayment (the default) will receive an amount of 25.67 euro cents per share in cash  as a repayment of the nominal value of their shares. The aggregate amount by which the nominal value of ordinary shares is reduced will be partly paid to shareholders opting (or opting by default) to receive the capital repayment  such part representing the total of all distributions opted (or opted by default) to be received as a capital repayment by shareholders. The remaining balance will be added back to the share premium reserve.Shareholders who hold shares traded on the JSE and/or A2X will receive the capital repayment in South African Rand (""ZAR"")  converted from Euro at a ZAR:EUR conversion rate to be announced on Tuesday  5 September 2023 (""the announced exchange rate""). Shareholders who hold NEPI Rockcastle shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam will receive the capital repayment in Euro. Cash dividend Shareholders who elect to receive the cash dividend will receive an amount of 25.67 euro cents per share in cash. The cash dividend will be paid out of the Company's distributable profits. Shareholders who hold shares traded on the JSE and/or A2X will receive the cash dividend in ZAR  converted from Euro at the announced exchange rate. Shareholders who hold NEPI Rockcastle shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam will receive the cash dividend in Euro. Scrip issue New NEPI Rockcastle shares to be issued pursuant to the scrip issue are to be funded by way of a reduction of the Company's share premium account. The number of shares to which a shareholder electing to receive the scrip issue is entitled will be determined with reference to the ratio that 27.10 euro cents per share bears to a scrip reference price. The scrip reference price will be calculated based on a 3% discount to the five-day volume weighted average price (less the interim dividend of 25.67 euro cents per share) of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE  to be announced on Tuesday  5 September 2023 (""scrip reference price""). For NEPI Rockcastle shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam  the scrip reference price will be converted to Euro at the announced exchange rate. The Company reserves the right to reduce the number of new NEPI Rockcastle shares issued to electing shareholders in terms of the scrip issue  on a pro rata basis  with any such reduction to be announced on or before Tuesday  5 September 2023. In such circumstance  shareholders will receive the balance of their interim dividend in cash as a capital repayment of 25.67 euro cents per share. NEPI Rockcastle reserves the right to reduce the number of new NEPI Rockcastle shares issued to an electing shareholder in respect of the scrip issue if the issue of such shareholder's full allocation of new NEPI Rockcastle shares would result in that shareholder (individually or together with any shareholders deemed to be acting in concert with such shareholder) having an interest in NEPI Rockcastle shares that would ordinarily require the shareholder (or group of shareholders) to make a mandatory takeover offer pursuant to any applicable takeover  capital market or equivalent legislation. In such circumstances  the shareholder will receive the balance of their entitlement in cash as a capital repayment of 25.67 euro cents per share. The allocation of new NEPI Rockcastle shares will be such that shareholders who elect to receive the scrip issue will not be allocated a fraction of a new NEPI Rockcastle share. Any entitlement to receive a fraction of a NEPI Rockcastle share will be rounded down to the nearest whole number  with a cash payment (""cash payment"") made to the relevant shareholder in respect of the fraction. The cash payment due to shareholders will be determined with reference to the weighted average price of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE on Wednesday  13 September 2023  less 10% (converted to Euro at the announced exchange rate in respect of those shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam) which amount will be announced on Thursday  14 September 2023 before 11:00am South African time. As at the date of this announcement  the Company has 635 830 268 ordinary shares of €0.01 each in issue.

TAX IMPLICATIONS The commentary below does not constitute tax advice and is intended only as a high-level guide. Shareholders should consult their own professional advisers to confirm their tax position vis-à-vis any distribution declared by the Company. The Company takes no responsibility for the submission of claims to any tax authority for or on behalf of any shareholder  for liaising with any tax authority for or on behalf of any shareholder in respect of any such claims  or for the outcome of any such claims. Claims to any tax authority are the sole responsibility of the shareholder concerned. For shareholders residing outside of South Africa  the distribution (of the interim dividend or scrip issue) may have other legal or tax implications and such shareholders are advised to obtain appropriate advice from their professional advisers in this regard. For United States (""U.S."") shareholders  the tax implications of receiving the capital repayment  cash dividend and scrip issue are presented in the paragraph titled ""U.S. tax implications"" below. Capital repayment Shareholders receiving the capital repayment (the default) will receive an amount of 25.67 euro cents per share as a repayment of the nominal value of their shares  paid from share capital for Dutch tax purposes. No Dutch dividend tax will be withheld on these capital repayments paid to shareholders. For South African shareholders  the capital repayment should be treated as a return of capital (because from a Dutch standpoint it is treated as repayment of capital)  therefore no South African dividend tax should apply. The capital repayment will reduce the shares' tax base  resulting in a potentially higher capital gain in the future when the shares are sold. Insofar as the repayment exceeds the shares' tax base  it may immediately result in capital gains tax. Cash dividend Dutch tax implications Main rule The Company must withhold 15% Dutch dividend tax on the cash dividend  leaving a distribution amount per share net of",neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,True,English,"['NEPI Rockcastle N', 'NEPI Rockcastle shareholders', 'interim dividend', 'six months', 'Notice', 'respect', '10:14', 'NEPI Rockcastle N.V.', 'NEPI Rockcastle S.A.', 'New NEPI Rockcastle shares', 'annual general meeting', 'South African Rand', 'pro rata basis', 'EUR conversion rate', 'NEPI ROCKCASTLE SHAREHOLDERS', 'Netherlands Registration number', 'scrip reference price', '90% dividend pay-out ratio', '95% dividend pay-out ratio', 'share premium reserve', 'share premium account', 'ordinary cash dividend', 'new shares', 'Cash dividend Shareholders', 'Capital repayment Shareholders', 'ordinary shares', 'average price', 'exchange rate', 'interim dividend', 'scrip issue', 'NRP ISIN', 'interim results', 'six months', 'nominal value', 'distributable profits', 'Salient Dates', 'one option', 'other option', 'two alternatives', 'compliance costs', 'tax refunds', 'remaining balance', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'five-day volume', 'cash resources', '25.67 euro cents', '27.10 euro cents', 'Share code', 'aggregate amount', 'June 2023 AGM', 'The Company', '5.6% premium', '30 June', '14 June', 'CIRCULAR', 'RESPECT', 'ELECTION', 'Tuesday', 'August', 'board', 'directors', 'reduction', 'way', 'amendments', 'articles', 'association', 'distribution', 'regard', 'website', 'NEPI-Rockcastle-Shareholders', 'Interim-Dividend', 'Six-Months', 'part', 'shareholdings', 'Friday', 'accordance', 'Times', 'rationale', 'opportunity', 'flexibility', 'default', 'total', 'JSE', 'A2X', 'ZAR', 'September', '3% discount', 'right', 'terms']",2023-08-29,2023-08-30,marketscreener.com

At the Nibirii electronic music festival in Düren  Germany  Deutsche Telekom AG tested the H2Genset by SFC Energy (F3C:DE   ISIN: DE0007568578 )  a leading supplier of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions  as an environmentally friendly power supply for its mobile transmission tower. At the Nibirii Festival  Deutsche Telekom powered a mobile base station 100 percent with green hydrogen in live operation for the first time. These transmitter masts can be used independently of a stationary power supply  for example at festivals  outdoor events and trade fairs as well as in disaster areas. The mobile trailer solution H2Genset by SFC Energy ensured the reliable power supply of the transmission tower. The H2Genset by SFC Energy is an emission-free and self-sufficient power generator that is ideally suited for areas without access to the conventional power grid and can call up a peak power of up to 20 kW. This ensured stable  mobile communication in the 5G and LTE standards for the approximately 30 000 visitors to the festival. With the environmentally friendly energy solution  Deutsche Telekom replaced a diesel generator that consumes 35 to 40 liters of fuel per day. ""We are pleased that together with Deutsche Telekom AG we were able to provide the fans of the Nibirii Festival with a stable mobile phone connection with sustainable energy supply. The H2Genset has already proven its performance in a wide range of industries and has now also been able to convince in the supply of temporarily installed mobile phone masts. The fuel cell  which runs on green hydrogen  generates electricity in a reliable and environmentally friendly way – unlike the diesel generator  it does not pollute people or the environment "" says Dr. Peter Podesser  CEO of SFC Energy AG.

In addition  this approach smoothes the generation fluctuations typical of Renewable Energies and reduces the associated balancing energy costs. Regardless of location  the battery can store amounts of electricity from all Encavis Group parks in Germany and discharge them at another time. The elimination of network charges for charging the battery in Germany makes this economically attractive.“The new plant in Hettstedt will allow us to use our Renewable Energy generation much more flexibly. This will enable us to serve a part of our portfolio in Germany with innovative battery technology and thus generate additional revenue”  welcomes Mario Schirru  CIO/COO of Encavis AG  this innovative milestone achievement.About ENCAVIS:The Encavis AG (Prime Standard; ISIN: DE0006095003; ticker symbol: ECV) is a producer of electricity from Renewable Energies listed on the MDAX of Deutsche Börse AG. As one of the leading independent power producers (IPP)  ENCAVIS acquires and operates (onshore) wind farms and solar parks in twelve European countries. The plants for sustainable energy production generate stable yields through guaranteed feed-in tariffs (FIT) or long-term power purchase agreements (PPA). The Encavis Group's total generation capacity currently adds up to more than 3.5 gigawatts (GW)  of which more than 2.1 GW belongs to the Encavis AG  which corresponds to a total saving of around 0.8 million tonnes of CO2 per year stand-alone for the Encavis AG.Within the Encavis Group  Encavis Asset Management AG offers fund services to institutional investors. Another Group member company is Stern Energy S.p.A.  based in Parma  Italy  a specialised provider of technical services for the installation  operation  maintenance  revamping and repowering of photovoltaic systems across Europe.ENCAVIS is a signatory of the UN Global Compact as well as of the UN PRI network.

At the Nibirii electronic music festival in Düren  Germany  Deutsche Telekom AG tested the H 2 Genset by SFC Energy (F3C:DE  ISIN: DE0007568578)  a leading supplier of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions  as an environmentally friendly power supply for its mobile transmission tower.At the Nibirii Festival  Deutsche Telekom powered a mobile base station 100 percent with green hydrogen in live operation for the first time. These transmitter masts can be used independently of a stationary power supply  for example at festivals  outdoor events and trade fairs as well as in disaster areas.The mobile trailer solution H 2 Genset by SFC Energy ensured the reliable power supply of the transmission tower. The H 2 Genset by SFC Energy is an emission-free and self-sufficient power generator that is ideally suited for areas without access to the conventional power grid and can call up a peak power of up to 20 kW. This ensured stable  mobile communication in the 5G and LTE standards for the approximately 30 000 visitors to the festival. With the environmentally friendly energy solution  Deutsche Telekom replaced a diesel generator that consumes 35 to 40 liters of fuel per day.""We are pleased that together with Deutsche Telekom AG we were able to provide the fans of the Nibirii Festival with a stable mobile phone connection with sustainable energy supply. The H 2 Genset has already proven its performance in a wide range of industries and has now also been able to convince in the supply of temporarily installed mobile phone masts. The fuel cell  which runs on green hydrogen  generates electricity in a reliable and environmentally friendly way – unlike the diesel generator  it does not pollute people or the environment "" says Dr. Peter Podesser  CEO of SFC Energy AG.For more information on SFC Energy's Clean Energy and Clean Power Management solutions  visit sfc.com.About SFC Energy AGSFC Energy AG is a leading provider of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions.

Funds included under Article 8 of the European Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SDFR) are those that “promote environmental and/or social characteristics.”On Aug. 29  Bloomberg reported that Jacobi Asset Management had classified its Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF as an Article 8 fund. The fund  launched on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange on Aug. 15  becomes the first Bitcoin ETF traded in Europe  and the first to have the European Union’s environmental  social and governance investing rules applied.Related: Hashdex joins race for spot Bitcoin ETF with unique strategyThe report cites Martin Bednall  Jacobi’s CEO  who calls the ETF “fully decarbonized” for its partial investments in renewable energy certificates (RECs). However  academic experts questioned by journalists posed a contradiction: With Bitcoin’s mining energy intensity  the ETF should purchase such a high amount of RECs that it would not only match but exceed the volume of energy consumed by its Bitcoin assets.Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF went live more than a year later than its planned launch in 2022. The introduction was promoted as the primary spot  or physically-backed  Bitcoin (BTC) fund  providing investors with an opportunity to access a financial product supported by actual BTC.From the outset  Jacobi Asset Management emphasized the eco-friendly nature of the ETF. The fund uses outside information to calculate how much energy the Bitcoin network uses. It then purchases and “retires” RECs. These certificates are tracked on a blockchain service  which is designed to let investors confirm the fund’s environmentally friendly statements.Magazine: Bitcoin ‘supercomputer’ and BTC DeFi coming soon,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.01,0.49,0.5,True,English,"['Jacobi spot Bitcoin ETF', 'environmental investing', 'issuer', 'European Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation', 'Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF', 'first-ever spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', 'London-based Jacobi Asset Management', 'governance investing rules', 'environmentally friendly statements', 'first Bitcoin ETF', 'mining energy intensity', 'renewable energy certificates', 'European market', 'European Union', 'Bitcoin assets', 'Bitcoin network', 'Bitcoin ‘supercomputer', 'primary spot', 'issuer firm', 'social characteristics', 'unique strategy', 'Martin Bednall', 'partial investments', 'academic experts', 'high amount', 'BTC) fund', 'financial product', 'actual BTC', 'eco-friendly nature', 'outside information', 'blockchain service', 'BTC DeFi', 'Article 8 fund', 'environmental, social', 'Funds', 'SDFR', 'Aug.', 'Bloomberg', 'Hashdex', 'race', 'report', 'CEO', 'RECs', 'journalists', 'contradiction', 'volume', 'launch', 'introduction', 'investors', 'opportunity', 'outset', 'retires', 'Magazine']",2023-08-29,2023-08-30,cointelegraph.com

29482,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/29/2733039/0/en/Health-Canada-Accepts-Valneva-s-Chikungunya-Vaccine-License-Application-for-Review.html,Health Canada Accepts Valneva’s Chikungunya Vaccine License Application for Review,Saint-Herblain (France)  August 29  2023 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today announced that Health Canada has completed screening validation of the Company’s regulatory application for marketing approval of its…,Saint-Herblain (France)  August 29  2023 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today announced that Health Canada has completed screening validation of the Company’s regulatory application for marketing approval of its single-shot chikungunya vaccine candidate VLA1553 in persons aged 18 years and above  and has determined that the New Drug Submission (NDS) application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Based on Health Canada’s performance standard to process an NDS application  the Company believes the regulatory review could be completed by mid-2024.This is the second regulatory application for VLA1553 filed by Valneva  and the Company intends to make additional regulatory submissions in 2023. A Biologic License Application (BLA) is currently under priority review1 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)2.VLA1553 is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate worldwide for which regulatory review processes are underway and  if approved  it could become the first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need. It would also represent the third vaccine Valneva3 has brought from early R&D to approval.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “Chikungunya represents a major threat for people traveling to or living in areas where chikungunya virus and the mosquitos that transmit it are present  including popular destinations for U.S. and Canadian travelers. This threat continues to grow as shown by the recent epidemiological alert issued by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)4. No vaccine or specific treatments are currently available for this debilitating disease  and we will continue to work diligently to make VLA1553 available in different territories as quickly as possible.”The regulatory submissions with Health Canada and the FDA follow final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 20225  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20226 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 20227. The Company’s pivotal Phase 3 results were published in the Lancet in June 2023.A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years is ongoing in Brazil8  for which Valneva reported initial Phase 3 safety data in adolescents yesterday9. This study  conducted by Valneva’s partner Instituto Butantan and funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  is intended to support label extension in this age group following a potential initial regulatory approval in adults from the FDA. The study is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations  as well as regulatory submission in Europe.The vaccine was granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020 and also received FDA Fast Track  Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review designations in 2018  2021 and 2023 respectively.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 203210. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries11. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas12 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 110 countries13. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 202214  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202215 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202216.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA155317. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201918  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.VLA1553 received FDA Fast Track  Breakthrough Therapy designations and Priority Review in 2018  2021 and 2023  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

Incorporated and registered in the Netherlands Registration number 87488329   Share code: NRP   ISIN: NL0015000RT3      CIRCULAR TO NEPI ROCKCASTLE SHAREHOLDERS IN RESPECT OF AN ELECTION TO RECEIVE A C…,"NEPI Rockcastle N.V. (formerly NEPI Rockcastle S.A.) Incorporated and registered in the Netherlands Registration number 87488329 Share code: NRP ISIN: NL0015000RT3 (""NEPI Rockcastle"" or ""the Company"") CIRCULAR TO NEPI ROCKCASTLE SHAREHOLDERS IN RESPECT OF AN ELECTION TO RECEIVE A CAPITAL REPAYMENT  ORDINARY CASH DIVIDEND OR SCRIP ISSUE Shareholders are referred to NEPI Rockcastle's interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2023  published on Tuesday  22 August 2023  wherein shareholders were advised that the board of directors had declared an interim dividend of 25.67 euro cents per share for the six months ended 30 June 2023 (""interim dividend"")  corresponding to a 90% dividend pay-out ratio. The board of directors of the Company has resolved to offer to NEPI Rockcastle shareholders the election to receive the interim dividend: via a reduction and repayment in cash of the nominal value per share ("" capital repayment "")  by way of amendments to articles of association of the Company ("" the Articles "")  as approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting held on14 June 2023 ("" the June 2023 AGM ""); or as an ordinary cash dividend out of distributable profits ("" cash dividend ""). As an alternative  shareholders may elect to receive a distribution of 27.10 euro cents per share  corresponding to a 95% dividend pay-out ratio and representing a 5.6% premium to the interim dividend  by way of an issue of new shares with a nominal value of €0.01 each credited as fully paid up (""scrip issue""). A circular in this regard was posted today and is available on the Company's website at: https://nepirockcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NEPI-Rockcastle-Shareholders-in-Respect-of-the-Interim-Dividend-for-the-Six-Months-Ended-30-June-2023.pdf The election is available in respect of all or part of a shareholder's shareholdings as at Friday  15 September 2023. The capital repayment will be paid to shareholders unless they elect to receive either the cash dividend or the scrip issue. Therefore  NEPI Rockcastle shareholders who wish to receive either the cash dividend or the scrip issue must ensure that their elections are lodged in accordance with the ""Salient Dates and Times"" set out below. The election by a shareholder of one option implies an opt-out of the other option(s). The rationale for offering two alternatives as to how cash is received  namely as a capital repayment or a cash dividend  is to reduce the compliance costs of claiming tax refunds in respect of the cash dividend. The rationale for the scrip issue is to offer shareholders the opportunity to increase their shareholding in NEPI Rockcastle and to retain flexibility regarding the Company's cash resources. Capital repayment Shareholders receiving the capital repayment (the default) will receive an amount of 25.67 euro cents per share in cash  as a repayment of the nominal value of their shares. The aggregate amount by which the nominal value of ordinary shares is reduced will be partly paid to shareholders opting (or opting by default) to receive the capital repayment  such part representing the total of all distributions opted (or opted by default) to be received as a capital repayment by shareholders. The remaining balance will be added back to the share premium reserve.Shareholders who hold shares traded on the JSE and/or A2X will receive the capital repayment in South African Rand (""ZAR"")  converted from Euro at a ZAR:EUR conversion rate to be announced on Tuesday  5 September 2023 (""the announced exchange rate""). Shareholders who hold NEPI Rockcastle shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam will receive the capital repayment in Euro. Cash dividend Shareholders who elect to receive the cash dividend will receive an amount of 25.67 euro cents per share in cash. The cash dividend will be paid out of the Company's distributable profits. Shareholders who hold shares traded on the JSE and/or A2X will receive the cash dividend in ZAR  converted from Euro at the announced exchange rate. Shareholders who hold NEPI Rockcastle shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam will receive the cash dividend in Euro. Scrip issue New NEPI Rockcastle shares to be issued pursuant to the scrip issue are to be funded by way of a reduction of the Company's share premium account. The number of shares to which a shareholder electing to receive the scrip issue is entitled will be determined with reference to the ratio that 27.10 euro cents per share bears to a scrip reference price. The scrip reference price will be calculated based on a 3% discount to the five-day volume weighted average price (less the interim dividend of 25.67 euro cents per share) of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE  to be announced on Tuesday  5 September 2023 (""scrip reference price""). For NEPI Rockcastle shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam  the scrip reference price will be converted to Euro at the announced exchange rate. The Company reserves the right to reduce the number of new NEPI Rockcastle shares issued to electing shareholders in terms of the scrip issue  on a pro rata basis  with any such reduction to be announced on or before Tuesday  5 September 2023. In such circumstance  shareholders will receive the balance of their interim dividend in cash as a capital repayment of 25.67 euro cents per share. NEPI Rockcastle reserves the right to reduce the number of new NEPI Rockcastle shares issued to an electing shareholder in respect of the scrip issue if the issue of such shareholder's full allocation of new NEPI Rockcastle shares would result in that shareholder (individually or together with any shareholders deemed to be acting in concert with such shareholder) having an interest in NEPI Rockcastle shares that would ordinarily require the shareholder (or group of shareholders) to make a mandatory takeover offer pursuant to any applicable takeover  capital market or equivalent legislation. In such circumstances  the shareholder will receive the balance of their entitlement in cash as a capital repayment of 25.67 euro cents per share. The allocation of new NEPI Rockcastle shares will be such that shareholders who elect to receive the scrip issue will not be allocated a fraction of a new NEPI Rockcastle share. Any entitlement to receive a fraction of a NEPI Rockcastle share will be rounded down to the nearest whole number  with a cash payment (""cash payment"") made to the relevant shareholder in respect of the fraction. The cash payment due to shareholders will be determined with reference to the weighted average price of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE on Wednesday  13 September 2023  less 10% (converted to Euro at the announced exchange rate in respect of those shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam) which amount will be announced on Thursday  14 September 2023 before 11:00am South African time. As at the date of this announcement  the Company has 635 830 268 ordinary shares of €0.01 each in issue.

TAX IMPLICATIONS The commentary below does not constitute tax advice and is intended only as a high-level guide. Shareholders should consult their own professional advisers to confirm their tax position vis-à-vis any distribution declared by the Company. The Company takes no responsibility for the submission of claims to any tax authority for or on behalf of any shareholder  for liaising with any tax authority for or on behalf of any shareholder in respect of any such claims  or for the outcome of any such claims. Claims to any tax authority are the sole responsibility of the shareholder concerned. For shareholders residing outside of South Africa  the distribution (of the interim dividend or scrip issue) may have other legal or tax implications and such shareholders are advised to obtain appropriate advice from their professional advisers in this regard. For United States (""U.S."") shareholders  the tax implications of receiving the capital repayment  cash dividend and scrip issue are presented in the paragraph titled ""U.S. tax implications"" below. Capital repayment Shareholders receiving the capital repayment (the default) will receive an amount of 25.67 euro cents per share as a repayment of the nominal value of their shares  paid from share capital for Dutch tax purposes. No Dutch dividend tax will be withheld on these capital repayments paid to shareholders. For South African shareholders  the capital repayment should be treated as a return of capital (because from a Dutch standpoint it is treated as repayment of capital)  therefore no South African dividend tax should apply. The capital repayment will reduce the shares' tax base  resulting in a potentially higher capital gain in the future when the shares are sold. Insofar as the repayment exceeds the shares' tax base  it may immediately result in capital gains tax. Cash dividend Dutch tax implications Main rule The Company must withhold 15% Dutch dividend tax on the cash dividend  leaving a distribution amount per share net of",neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,True,English,"['NEPI Rockcastle N', 'NEPI Rockcastle shareholders', 'interim dividend', 'six months', 'Notice', 'respect', '10:14', 'NEPI Rockcastle N.V.', 'NEPI Rockcastle S.A.', 'New NEPI Rockcastle shares', 'annual general meeting', 'South African Rand', 'pro rata basis', 'EUR conversion rate', 'NEPI ROCKCASTLE SHAREHOLDERS', 'Netherlands Registration number', 'scrip reference price', '90% dividend pay-out ratio', '95% dividend pay-out ratio', 'share premium reserve', 'share premium account', 'ordinary cash dividend', 'new shares', 'Cash dividend Shareholders', 'Capital repayment Shareholders', 'ordinary shares', 'average price', 'exchange rate', 'interim dividend', 'scrip issue', 'NRP ISIN', 'interim results', 'six months', 'nominal value', 'distributable profits', 'Salient Dates', 'one option', 'other option', 'two alternatives', 'compliance costs', 'tax refunds', 'remaining balance', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'five-day volume', 'cash resources', '25.67 euro cents', '27.10 euro cents', 'Share code', 'aggregate amount', 'June 2023 AGM', 'The Company', '5.6% premium', '30 June', '14 June', 'CIRCULAR', 'RESPECT', 'ELECTION', 'Tuesday', 'August', 'board', 'directors', 'reduction', 'way', 'amendments', 'articles', 'association', 'distribution', 'regard', 'website', 'NEPI-Rockcastle-Shareholders', 'Interim-Dividend', 'Six-Months', 'part', 'shareholdings', 'Friday', 'accordance', 'Times', 'rationale', 'opportunity', 'flexibility', 'default', 'total', 'JSE', 'A2X', 'ZAR', 'September', '3% discount', 'right', 'terms']",2023-08-29,2023-08-30,marketscreener.com

These include a Discharge Station  Charging Station and up to fifteen Docking Stations. Consequently  Ebusco contributes to a turnkey solution for the electrification of the inland shipping industry.Zero Emission Services B.V. (ZES) supplies interchangeable energy containers for new and existing inland vessels. These energy containers  so-called 'ZESpacks'  are used to power ships and can easily be replaced at one of the exchange and charging stations once empty.Although ZES had previously purchased energy containers  the company still needed a charging solution. Following a tender process  ZES therefore awarded a contract to Ebusco to supply ten Docking Solutions  with an option for five more. The Docking Solutions will be deployed to charge ZESpacks  allowing them to power vessels during transit.Peter Bijvelds  CEO of Ebusco  commented  ""After an extensive tender process  we are delighted to be working for ZES once again. We already have significant experience with heavy-duty batteries in the bus industry and are proud to now apply this knowledge to the electrification of inland shipping. By combining our knowledge  we will ensure that the sustainability of shipping gains momentum.""Plug-and-play solution: all-electric mobile shore power installationBesides a charging solution  ZES was also looking for a way to provide shore power to ships during loading/unloading. For this  the choice fell on an Ebusco Discharge Station in combination with a Charging Station. The shore power facility consists of a 20-foot container containing electrical equipment  which can be used to supply ships with power during loading/unloading.Remarkable is the fact that it is a plug-and-play solution. The Discharge Station is not connected to the public electricity grid  but used in combination with energy containers  allowing the station to be moved easily. The six ZESpacks required for this purpose can in turn be charged by the Charging System  which can charge several energy containers at once via a 20-foot container.When the complete solution from ZESpack to charging station is not used for inland navigation  it can be used to balance the power grid. Balancing electricity supply and demand is essential to increase the resilience of the power grid as the share of renewables  with more variable output  increases.Bart Hoevenaars  CEO of Zero Emission Services  adds: ""We already know Ebusco as a reliable partner with a deep understanding of batteries and are therefore looking forward to collaborate once again.

Based on Health Canada’s performance standard to process an NDS application  the Company believes the regulatory review could be completed by mid-2024.This is the second regulatory application for VLA1553 filed by Valneva  and the Company intends to make additional regulatory submissions in 2023. A Biologic License Application (BLA) is currently under priority review1 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)2.VLA1553 is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate worldwide for which regulatory review processes are underway and  if approved  it could become the first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need. It would also represent the third vaccine Valneva3 has brought from early R&D to approval.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “Chikungunya represents a major threat for people traveling to or living in areas where chikungunya virus and the mosquitos that transmit it are present  including popular destinations for U.S. and Canadian travelers. This threat continues to grow as shown by the recent epidemiological alert issued by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)4. No vaccine or specific treatments are currently available for this debilitating disease  and we will continue to work diligently to make VLA1553 available in different territories as quickly as possible.”The regulatory submissions with Health Canada and the FDA follow final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 20225  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20226 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 20227. The Company’s pivotal Phase 3 results were published in the Lancet in June 2023.A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years is ongoing in Brazil8  for which Valneva reported initial Phase 3 safety data in adolescents yesterday9. This study  conducted by Valneva’s partner Instituto Butantan and funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  is intended to support label extension in this age group following a potential initial regulatory approval in adults from the FDA. The study is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations  as well as regulatory submission in Europe.The vaccine was granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020 and also received FDA Fast Track  Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review designations in 2018  2021 and 2023 respectively.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 203210. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries11. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas12 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 110 countries13. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 202214  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202215 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202216.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA155317. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201918  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.VLA1553 received FDA Fast Track  Breakthrough Therapy designations and Priority Review in 2018  2021 and 2023  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against the chikungunya virus and Lyme disease.Valneva Investor and Media ContactsLaetitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the progress  timing  results and completion of research  development and clinical trials for product candidates  to regulatory approval of product candidates and review of existing products.

The Circular is also available on the Company's website: https://www.bgholdingltd.com/shareholder.php.This announcement provides a summary of the information set out in the Circular and Shareholders should refer to the Circular for full details of the Proposals.Details of the proposed Managed Wind-downShould the Managed Wind-down be approved by Shareholders  it will not result in the immediate liquidation of the Company. Instead  the Board intends to work with the Investment Manager to implement an orderly realisation of the Company's underlying assets in a manner consistent with the liquidity of the Company's portfolio. The Board expects the orderly realisation to be completed by the end of 2024  following which the net realisation proceeds will be returned to Shareholders (whether pursuant to the Rollover Option or the Cash Exit  as described below).Pursuant to the Managed Wind-down  the Board intends to offer to eligible Shareholders the option to elect to rollover all or part of their investment in the Company into new shares in a sub-fund of BG Eire ICAV  managed by the Investment Manager  or such other vehicle as may be considered suitable by the Board and the Investment Manager (the ""BG Rollover Fund"") (the ""Rollover Option""). The Board understands that  irrespective of the Proposals for the Company  the Investment Manager (and the wider Boussard & Gavaudan Group) remains committed to its investment management business and will continue to manage a range of investment products including alternative  private and mutual funds focussed on multi-strategy  convertible bonds and private credit/direct lending. The Rollover Option is therefore intended to provide eligible Shareholders the flexibility to remain invested in a vehicle managed by the Investment Manager's group.Shareholders who do not or are not eligible to elect for the Rollover Option shall instead receive cash pursuant to a full cash exit prior to the Company formally entering into liquidation (the ""Cash Exit"").A Shareholder circular containing details of the proposed Rollover Option (including the full eligibility requirements for investment in the BG Rollover Fund  which will include a minimum subscription amount of €500 000 or its currency equivalent) and the Cash Exit  together with election forms for eligible Shareholders wishing to participate in the Rollover Option  is expected to be published in the second half of 2024.Extraordinary General Meeting and Class MeetingsThe purpose of the Extraordinary General Meeting and the Class Meetings (the ""Meetings"") is to allow the Shareholders to consider and  if thought fit  pass resolutions (the ""Resolutions"") which seek Shareholders' approval to:(i) amend the Company's Investment Objective and Policy in order for the Company to follow the Managed Wind-down process set out in the Circular;(ii) convert the Shares into ordinary shares that are redeemable at the option of the Company  to allow for the net realisation proceeds of the assets realised in accordance with the Managed Wind-down (less expenses and the costs of subsequently de-listing and liquidating the Company) to be returned to Shareholders pursuant to the Rollover Option or the Cash Exit by way of a pro rata redemption of their Shares  as described in more detail in the Circular; and(iii) amend the articles of incorporation of the Company to allow the Directors to carry out compulsory redemptions of Shares  as described in more detail in the Circular.The EGM will be held at Ground Floor  Dorey Court  Admiral Park  St Peter Port  Guernsey GY1 2HT at 11.30 a.m. on 28 September 2023. The Euro Class Meeting and Sterling Class Meeting will be held at the same venue on the same date at 11.45 a.m. and 12.00 p.m. respectively.The notices of the Meetings  which include the full text of the Resolutions  are set out in Part II  Part III and Part IV of the Circular.Action to be taken by ShareholdersWhether or not you intend to be present at the Meetings  you are requested to complete  sign and return the relevant forms of proxy enclosed with the Circular  in accordance with the instructions printed thereon  so as to be received: (i) in respect of Euro Shares held via Euroclear Nederland  electronically by Van Lanschot Kempen N.V.

The Circular is also available on the Company's website: https://www.bgholdingltd.com/shareholder.php.This announcement provides a summary of the information set out in the Circular and Shareholders should refer to the Circular for full details of the Proposals.Details of the proposed Managed Wind-downShould the Managed Wind-down be approved by Shareholders  it will not result in the immediate liquidation of the Company. Instead  the Board intends to work with the Investment Manager to implement an orderly realisation of the Company's underlying assets in a manner consistent with the liquidity of the Company's portfolio. The Board expects the orderly realisation to be completed by the end of 2024  following which the net realisation proceeds will be returned to Shareholders (whether pursuant to the Rollover Option or the Cash Exit  as described below).Pursuant to the Managed Wind-down  the Board intends to offer to eligible Shareholders the option to elect to rollover all or part of their investment in the Company into new shares in a sub-fund of BG Eire ICAV  managed by the Investment Manager  or such other vehicle as may be considered suitable by the Board and the Investment Manager (the ""BG Rollover Fund"") (the ""Rollover Option""). The Board understands that  irrespective of the Proposals for the Company  the Investment Manager (and the wider Boussard & Gavaudan Group) remains committed to its investment management business and will continue to manage a range of investment products including alternative  private and mutual funds focussed on multi-strategy  convertible bonds and private credit/direct lending. The Rollover Option is therefore intended to provide eligible Shareholders the flexibility to remain invested in a vehicle managed by the Investment Manager's group.Shareholders who do not or are not eligible to elect for the Rollover Option shall instead receive cash pursuant to a full cash exit prior to the Company formally entering into liquidation (the ""Cash Exit"").A Shareholder circular containing details of the proposed Rollover Option (including the full eligibility requirements for investment in the BG Rollover Fund  which will include a minimum subscription amount of €500 000 or its currency equivalent) and the Cash Exit  together with election forms for eligible Shareholders wishing to participate in the Rollover Option  is expected to be published in the second half of 2024.Extraordinary General Meeting and Class MeetingsThe purpose of the Extraordinary General Meeting and the Class Meetings (the ""Meetings"") is to allow the Shareholders to consider and  if thought fit  pass resolutions (the ""Resolutions"") which seek Shareholders' approval to:(i) amend the Company's Investment Objective and Policy in order for the Company to follow the Managed Wind-down process set out in the Circular;(ii) convert the Shares into ordinary shares that are redeemable at the option of the Company  to allow for the net realisation proceeds of the assets realised in accordance with the Managed Wind-down (less expenses and the costs of subsequently de-listing and liquidating the Company) to be returned to Shareholders pursuant to the Rollover Option or the Cash Exit by way of a pro rata redemption of their Shares  as described in more detail in the Circular; and(iii) amend the articles of incorporation of the Company to allow the Directors to carry out compulsory redemptions of Shares  as described in more detail in the Circular.The EGM will be held at Ground Floor  Dorey Court  Admiral Park  St Peter Port  Guernsey GY1 2HT at 11.30 a.m. on 28 September 2023. The Euro Class Meeting and Sterling Class Meeting will be held at the same venue on the same date at 11.45 a.m. and 12.00 p.m. respectively.The notices of the Meetings  which include the full text of the Resolutions  are set out in Part II  Part III and Part IV of the Circular.Action to be taken by ShareholdersWhether or not you intend to be present at the Meetings  you are requested to complete  sign and return the relevant forms of proxy enclosed with the Circular  in accordance with the instructions printed thereon  so as to be received: (i) in respect of Euro Shares held via Euroclear Nederland  electronically by Van Lanschot Kempen N.V.

Despite headline risks related to inflation and interest rates  dry bulk demand remains fundamentally strong  driven by shifting trade routes  the need to secure the energy supply chain  and the increased significance of emerging trades  including the West African Bauxite trade. The forecast for fleet supply growth also remains favorable with the orderbook near historical lows. Combined  these factors support our optimistic near and long-term outlook  while closely monitoring the developments in the Chinese economy. Golden Ocean has one of the world’s youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets and very low cash breakeven levels. This allows the Company to remain profitable when markets are weaker and produce outsized cash flows when markets are strong. It is also a key enabler of our capital allocation policy  which has allowed the company to consistently distribute dividends to its shareholders and also repurchase shares under its repurchase program.”The Board of DirectorsGolden Ocean Group LimitedHamilton  BermudaAugust 29  2023Questions should be directed to:Lars-Christian Svensen: Interim Chief Executive Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40Peder Simonsen: Chief Financial Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40The full report is available in the link below.Forward Looking StatementsMatters discussed in this earnings report may constitute forward-looking statements.

This announcement provides a summary of the information set out in the Circular and Shareholders should refer to the Circular for full details of the Proposals. Details of the proposed Managed Wind-down Should the Managed Wind-down be approved by Shareholders  it will not result in the immediate liquidation of the Company. Instead  the Board intends to work with the Investment Manager to implement an orderly realisation of the Company's underlying assets in a manner consistent with the liquidity of the Company's portfolio. The Board expects the orderly realisation to be completed by the end of 2024  following which the net realisation proceeds will be returned to Shareholders (whether pursuant to the Rollover Option or the Cash Exit  as described below). Pursuant to the Managed Wind-down  the Board intends to offer to eligible Shareholders the option to elect to rollover all or part of their investment in the Company into new shares in a sub-fund of BG Eire ICAV  managed by the Investment Manager  or such other vehicle as may be considered suitable by the Board and the Investment Manager (the ""BG Rollover Fund"") (the ""Rollover Option""). The Board understands that  irrespective of the Proposals for the Company  the Investment Manager (and the wider Boussard & Gavaudan Group) remains committed to its investment management business and will continue to manage a range of investment products including alternative  private and mutual funds focussed on multi-strategy  convertible bonds and private credit/direct lending. The Rollover Option is therefore intended to provide eligible Shareholders the flexibility to remain invested in a vehicle managed by the Investment Manager's group. Shareholders who do not or are not eligible to elect for the Rollover Option shall instead receive cash pursuant to a full cash exit prior to the Company formally entering into liquidation (the ""Cash Exit""). A Shareholder circular containing details of the proposed Rollover Option (including the full eligibility requirements for investment in the BG Rollover Fund  which will include a minimum subscription amount of €500 000 or its currency equivalent) and the Cash Exit  together with election forms for eligible Shareholders wishing to participate in the Rollover Option  is expected to be published in the second half of 2024. 11/82454553_1 1Extraordinary General Meeting and Class Meetings The purpose of the Extraordinary General Meeting and the Class Meetings (the ""Meetings"") is to allow the Shareholders to consider and  if thought fit  pass resolutions (the ""Resolutions"") which seek Shareholders' approval to: amend the Company's Investment Objective and Policy in order for the Company to follow the Managed Wind-down process set out in the Circular; convert the Shares into ordinary shares that are redeemable at the option of the Company  to allow for the net realisation proceeds of the assets realised in accordance with the Managed Wind-down (less expenses and the costs of subsequently de-listing and liquidating the Company) to be returned to Shareholders pursuant to the Rollover Option or the Cash Exit by way of a pro rata redemption of their Shares  as described in more detail in the Circular; and amend the articles of incorporation of the Company to allow the Directors to carry out compulsory redemptions of Shares  as described in more detail in the Circular.

The Circular is also available on the Company's website: https://www.bgholdingltd.com/shareholder.php.This announcement provides a summary of the information set out in the Circular and Shareholders should refer to the Circular for full details of the Proposals.Details of the proposed Managed Wind-downShould the Managed Wind-down be approved by Shareholders  it will not result in the immediate liquidation of the Company. Instead  the Board intends to work with the Investment Manager to implement an orderly realisation of the Company's underlying assets in a manner consistent with the liquidity of the Company's portfolio. The Board expects the orderly realisation to be completed by the end of 2024  following which the net realisation proceeds will be returned to Shareholders (whether pursuant to the Rollover Option or the Cash Exit  as described below).Pursuant to the Managed Wind-down  the Board intends to offer to eligible Shareholders the option to elect to rollover all or part of their investment in the Company into new shares in a sub-fund of BG Eire ICAV  managed by the Investment Manager  or such other vehicle as may be considered suitable by the Board and the Investment Manager (the ""BG Rollover Fund"") (the ""Rollover Option"").

The Rollover Option is therefore intended to provide eligible Shareholders the flexibility to remain invested in a vehicle managed by the Investment Manager's group.Shareholders who do not or are not eligible to elect for the Rollover Option shall instead receive cash pursuant to a full cash exit prior to the Company formally entering into liquidation (the ""Cash Exit"").A Shareholder circular containing details of the proposed Rollover Option (including the full eligibility requirements for investment in the BG Rollover Fund  which will include a minimum subscription amount of €500 000 or its currency equivalent) and the Cash Exit  together with election forms for eligible Shareholders wishing to participate in the Rollover Option  is expected to be published in the second half of 2024.Extraordinary General Meeting and Class MeetingsThe purpose of the Extraordinary General Meeting and the Class Meetings (the ""Meetings"") is to allow the Shareholders to consider and  if thought fit  pass resolutions (the ""Resolutions"") which seek Shareholders' approval to:(i) amend the Company's Investment Objective and Policy in order for the Company to follow the Managed Wind-down process set out in the Circular;(ii) convert the Shares into ordinary shares that are redeemable at the option of the Company  to allow for the net realisation proceeds of the assets realised in accordance with the Managed Wind-down (less expenses and the costs of subsequently de-listing and liquidating the Company) to be returned to Shareholders pursuant to the Rollover Option or the Cash Exit by way of a pro rata redemption of their Shares  as described in more detail in the Circular; and(iii) amend the articles of incorporation of the Company to allow the Directors to carry out compulsory redemptions of Shares  as described in more detail in the Circular.The EGM will be held at Ground Floor  Dorey Court  Admiral Park  St Peter Port  Guernsey GY1 2HT at 11.30 a.m. on 28 September 2023.

We combine three main strategies  which we have diligently pursued in the past and continue to uphold:Consistent growth of digital processing gross profit  preferable recurring in nature Balanced approach to postage & parcel optimisation services Focus on synergy realisation and streamlining organisationThese markers not only highlight our H1 2023 endeavours but also provide a glimpse into our strategic roadmap for the coming periods.Consistent growth of digital processing gross profitUnifiedpost’s digital processing services are the cloud-based platforms that serve small  medium  and large businesses in areas of document flows  payments  and additional value-added services.The first half of 2023 clearly demonstrated Unifiedpost's strong dedication to its digital path. Digital processing revenue saw an increase of 9 9% y/y to € 65 2 million. Driving this was the growth of our recurring digital processing revenue  which registered a 12 3% increase y/y  reaching € 62 8 million.Non-recurring digital revenue experienced a decline  down by 29 4% y/y to a total of € 2 4 million for H1 2023. This fluctuation is indicative of the inherent cyclical nature associated with non-recurring revenue sources.Our goal to continually augment the gross profit of the digital processing service remains unwavering. The growth in gross profit of digital processing services y/y amounting to € 3 3 million is partially driven (i) by revenue growth amounting to € 2 3 million additional gross profit and partially driven (ii) by increasing margin-% amounting to € 1 0 million additional gross profit.Steady gross profit of postage and parcel optimisation servicesUnifiedpost has services in the Nordics to optimise postage to its clients. Depending on client preferences  Unifiedpost's service can be solely for 'optimisation'  or extended to printing and overseeing all associated postage expenses. Unifiedpost can extend these services to (small) parcel distribution.In H1 2023  Unifiedpost's postage & parcel revenue declined 13 9% y/y  settling at € 27 9 million  down from € 32 4 million in H1 2022. This can be largely attributed to the impact of the SEK-EUR exchange rate change (-9 7% from 30 June 2022 to 30 June 2023). Another influential factor has been the evident shift from paper to digital among our clientele.Our improved gross margin in this segment shows our resilience. The margin climbed from 10 3% in H1 2022 to 11 3% in H1 2023. This improvement in gross margin compensated the missing gross profit from reduced volumes.Focus on synergy realisation and streamlining organisation drives Unifiedpost towards a sustainable futureIn the domain of strategic cash management  it's essential to manage both operational and investment costs. Following our acquisitions and integrations  Unifiedpost has shifted its focus towards operational efficiency  capitalizing on the synergies. Activating these synergies results in the reallocation of teams  a heightened emphasis on efficiencies  and bolstering our cost-saving program. The reallocation of teams affects how our expenses by nature are presented. It's vital to recognize that a direct year-on-year comparison of expenses (2022-2023) by category may not yield a comprehensive picture.The implementation of our strategic initiatives is evident. As of 30 June 2023  we have reduced the employee count from 1.479 (recorded on 30 June 2022) to 1.322. Although H1 2023 still bears significant one-off costs  the cumulative impact of a 10 6% workforce reduction will manifest in subsequent quarters. This will be observable in the operational costs associated with S&M  R&D G&A  and in CAPEX. Notably  the Group's total personnel costs for H1 2023 decreased to € 40 9 million from € 41 2 million in H1 2022  despite an approximate 5% wage surge across the Group due to inflation. By June 2023  our monthly personnel expense had further reduced to € 6 1 million. The total expenses declined year over year from € 109 5 million to € 108 9 million for the first semester.It's noteworthy that the company has recorded a larger portion of R&D in its results (€ 1 4 million) as it stopped development on some local products but continued maintain services for these products.By diligently managing personnel expenses without sacrificing service quality or growth trajectories  and with a keen commitment to R&D investments for emerging markets  Unifiedpost Group is resolutely navigating towards a cash flow-positive business.Liquidity position pave the way for future growthBy the end of H1 2023  Unifiedpost Group reported a financial position with cash and cash equivalents totalling € 24 7 million. Additionally  the Group has € 15 9 million in undrawn invoice financing and € 2 0 million in undrawn financing facilities. Our working capital continues to align with the figures observed at the end of 2022.As 2023 unfolds  Unifiedpost Group's outlook remains positive. The projected growth in revenue and gross profit is being realised. With a growing customer base that adds to our recurring digital processing revenue  combined with effective cost management  the Group is progressing to reach the cash flow break-even point. With the data from the first half of the year now available  we are further committed to generate over H2 a positive operating cash flow that exceeds the capital expenditure of the Group over the same period.Growing the network: robust customer growthUnifiedpost's emphasis on customer onboarding has proven fruitful. By Q2 2023  our customer count rose to 1.172.197  a 10 2% growth from the end figure of 2022. In detail  Q1 2023 saw 69.930 new customers  and Q2 added 38.491. Our paid customer segment reached 490.936  while third-party financed customers grew to 681.261.Our business network  i.e. own customers and other companies that we can reach in a digital way  now serves over 2 25 million companies  up from 2 11 million at the end of 2022. This growth cements our position in the e-invoice and e-payment segment  particularly among Europe's SMEs.Our core SME platforms  including Banqup  Billtobox  and JeFacture  gained momentum. Their combined customer base reached 151.931 by Q2 2023. Impressively  H1 2023 added 27.598 new subscriptions. Belgium and France  key markets for us  also reported growth. Banqup's Belgian customers (Billtobox) increased to 48.651. In France  early adopters of JeFacture reached 14.291 by Q2's end.Proactively navigating the evolving e-invoicing and e-payment landscapeOn 28 July 2023  the French Ministry of Finance announced a postponement in the e-invoicing and e-reporting mandates originally starting July 2024. These mandates  planned in phases  now face revision due to challenges integrating daily B2C sales data  international B2B sales invoices  and more. This digital transition is compounded by technological  operational  and regulatory challenges.Unifiedpost Group has consistently been at the forefront  actively preparing for these complexities. The recent developments underscore the importance of flexible and diverse solutions  an area where Unifiedpost has consistently excelled. Our strategy revolves around offering an extensive integrated range of services suitable for businesses of all sizes. Ready to adopt the new systems swiftly  we have always anticipated potential market complexities and possible delays. Nevertheless  our commitment to our mission remains strong.With Europe transitioning to a new framework for e-invoicing and e-payment  Unifiedpost Group consistently evaluates its services  ensuring we maintain a comprehensive offering that addresses all requirements. Services that are not integrated or not fully digital are scrutinised for potential divestment. The divestment of FitekIN and Onea as standalone products  expected to close in Q4 2023  marked a strategic move in this direction. Announced on 1 August 2023  this decision emphasizes our commitment to streamlining core business operations. On the other hand  Unifiedpost Group successfully incorporated the software product Valitax  a mandatory feature for the future e-invoicing market  further enhancing its suite of solutions. This functionality will be embedded in the Banqup product offering and delivers important added value on validating indirect taxes applied on e-invoices.This constantly evolving landscape presents numerous opportunities for Unifiedpost Group. The escalating demand for e-invoicing and e-reporting highlights the vast potential for growth across the EU. While challenges persist  they also signal the start of new partnerships and collaborations  helping Unifiedpost Group to strengthen its market position.Investors & Media webcastManagement will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 10:00 a.m. CET.A recording will be available shortly after the event.

We combine three main strategies  which we have diligently pursued in the past and continue to uphold:Consistent growth of digital processing gross profit  preferable recurring in nature Balanced approach to postage & parcel optimisation services Focus on synergy realisation and streamlining organisationThese markers not only highlight our H1 2023 endeavours but also provide a glimpse into our strategic roadmap for the coming periods.Consistent growth of digital processing gross profitUnifiedpost’s digital processing services are the cloud-based platforms that serve small  medium  and large businesses in areas of document flows  payments  and additional value-added services.The first half of 2023 clearly demonstrated Unifiedpost's strong dedication to its digital path. Digital processing revenue saw an increase of 9 9% y/y to € 65 2 million. Driving this was the growth of our recurring digital processing revenue  which registered a 12 3% increase y/y  reaching € 62 8 million.Non-recurring digital revenue experienced a decline  down by 29 4% y/y to a total of € 2 4 million for H1 2023. This fluctuation is indicative of the inherent cyclical nature associated with non-recurring revenue sources.Our goal to continually augment the gross profit of the digital processing service remains unwavering. The growth in gross profit of digital processing services y/y amounting to € 3 3 million is partially driven (i) by revenue growth amounting to € 2 3 million additional gross profit and partially driven (ii) by increasing margin-% amounting to € 1 0 million additional gross profit.Steady gross profit of postage and parcel optimisation servicesUnifiedpost has services in the Nordics to optimise postage to its clients. Depending on client preferences  Unifiedpost's service can be solely for 'optimisation'  or extended to printing and overseeing all associated postage expenses. Unifiedpost can extend these services to (small) parcel distribution.In H1 2023  Unifiedpost's postage & parcel revenue declined 13 9% y/y  settling at € 27 9 million  down from € 32 4 million in H1 2022. This can be largely attributed to the impact of the SEK-EUR exchange rate change (-9 7% from 30 June 2022 to 30 June 2023). Another influential factor has been the evident shift from paper to digital among our clientele.Our improved gross margin in this segment shows our resilience. The margin climbed from 10 3% in H1 2022 to 11 3% in H1 2023. This improvement in gross margin compensated the missing gross profit from reduced volumes.Focus on synergy realisation and streamlining organisation drives Unifiedpost towards a sustainable futureIn the domain of strategic cash management  it's essential to manage both operational and investment costs. Following our acquisitions and integrations  Unifiedpost has shifted its focus towards operational efficiency  capitalizing on the synergies. Activating these synergies results in the reallocation of teams  a heightened emphasis on efficiencies  and bolstering our cost-saving program. The reallocation of teams affects how our expenses by nature are presented. It's vital to recognize that a direct year-on-year comparison of expenses (2022-2023) by category may not yield a comprehensive picture.The implementation of our strategic initiatives is evident. As of 30 June 2023  we have reduced the employee count from 1.479 (recorded on 30 June 2022) to 1.322. Although H1 2023 still bears significant one-off costs  the cumulative impact of a 10 6% workforce reduction will manifest in subsequent quarters. This will be observable in the operational costs associated with S&M  R&D G&A  and in CAPEX. Notably  the Group's total personnel costs for H1 2023 decreased to € 40 9 million from € 41 2 million in H1 2022  despite an approximate 5% wage surge across the Group due to inflation. By June 2023  our monthly personnel expense had further reduced to € 6 1 million. The total expenses declined year over year from € 109 5 million to € 108 9 million for the first semester.It's noteworthy that the company has recorded a larger portion of R&D in its results (€ 1 4 million) as it stopped development on some local products but continued maintain services for these products.By diligently managing personnel expenses without sacrificing service quality or growth trajectories  and with a keen commitment to R&D investments for emerging markets  Unifiedpost Group is resolutely navigating towards a cash flow-positive business.Liquidity position pave the way for future growthBy the end of H1 2023  Unifiedpost Group reported a financial position with cash and cash equivalents totalling € 24 7 million. Additionally  the Group has € 15 9 million in undrawn invoice financing and € 2 0 million in undrawn financing facilities. Our working capital continues to align with the figures observed at the end of 2022.As 2023 unfolds  Unifiedpost Group's outlook remains positive. The projected growth in revenue and gross profit is being realised. With a growing customer base that adds to our recurring digital processing revenue  combined with effective cost management  the Group is progressing to reach the cash flow break-even point. With the data from the first half of the year now available  we are further committed to generate over H2 a positive operating cash flow that exceeds the capital expenditure of the Group over the same period.Growing the network: robust customer growthUnifiedpost's emphasis on customer onboarding has proven fruitful. By Q2 2023  our customer count rose to 1.172.197  a 10 2% growth from the end figure of 2022. In detail  Q1 2023 saw 69.930 new customers  and Q2 added 38.491. Our paid customer segment reached 490.936  while third-party financed customers grew to 681.261.Our business network  i.e. own customers and other companies that we can reach in a digital way  now serves over 2 25 million companies  up from 2 11 million at the end of 2022. This growth cements our position in the e-invoice and e-payment segment  particularly among Europe's SMEs.Our core SME platforms  including Banqup  Billtobox  and JeFacture  gained momentum. Their combined customer base reached 151.931 by Q2 2023. Impressively  H1 2023 added 27.598 new subscriptions. Belgium and France  key markets for us  also reported growth. Banqup's Belgian customers (Billtobox) increased to 48.651. In France  early adopters of JeFacture reached 14.291 by Q2's end.Proactively navigating the evolving e-invoicing and e-payment landscapeOn 28 July 2023  the French Ministry of Finance announced a postponement in the e-invoicing and e-reporting mandates originally starting July 2024. These mandates  planned in phases  now face revision due to challenges integrating daily B2C sales data  international B2B sales invoices  and more. This digital transition is compounded by technological  operational  and regulatory challenges.Unifiedpost Group has consistently been at the forefront  actively preparing for these complexities. The recent developments underscore the importance of flexible and diverse solutions  an area where Unifiedpost has consistently excelled. Our strategy revolves around offering an extensive integrated range of services suitable for businesses of all sizes. Ready to adopt the new systems swiftly  we have always anticipated potential market complexities and possible delays. Nevertheless  our commitment to our mission remains strong.With Europe transitioning to a new framework for e-invoicing and e-payment  Unifiedpost Group consistently evaluates its services  ensuring we maintain a comprehensive offering that addresses all requirements. Services that are not integrated or not fully digital are scrutinised for potential divestment. The divestment of FitekIN and Onea as standalone products  expected to close in Q4 2023  marked a strategic move in this direction. Announced on 1 August 2023  this decision emphasizes our commitment to streamlining core business operations. On the other hand  Unifiedpost Group successfully incorporated the software product Valitax  a mandatory feature for the future e-invoicing market  further enhancing its suite of solutions. This functionality will be embedded in the Banqup product offering and delivers important added value on validating indirect taxes applied on e-invoices.This constantly evolving landscape presents numerous opportunities for Unifiedpost Group. The escalating demand for e-invoicing and e-reporting highlights the vast potential for growth across the EU. While challenges persist  they also signal the start of new partnerships and collaborations  helping Unifiedpost Group to strengthen its market position.<End>Investors & Media webcastManagement will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 10:00 a.m. CET.A recording will be available shortly after the event.

Despite the delay in our revenue growth  I am highly confident that we are on the right track of our future growth path. We remain closely collaborating with our customers and continue to be positive on the conversion of our pilots. Our major opportunities that we had planned to deliver in the first half of 2023 are still part of our pipeline today.In fact  the underlying drivers for our business are stronger than ever: the market is developing very favorably  our pipeline continues to grow  and we experience great traction with major customers that are clearly entering the next stage of roll-out of our technology. We put our shoulders to the wheel and continue to stick to our medium- and long-term objectives.""Total revenues were €3 737k in the first half year of 2023 compared to €3 692k in the first half year of 2022  representing a delay in revenue growth that is caused by longer lead times to convert pilot projects into large full-scale projects. This accounts for both pilot trajectories taking longer than anticipated  as well as longer lead times towards larger projects after the pilot phase amongst others caused by permitting lead times  decision making and engineering.In our Clean Municipal Water business line  revenues were €1 427k in the first half year of 2023  compared to €1 180k in the first half year of 2022. This business line benefitted from various drinking water projects in Asia. In Europe major steps forward were made with several key OEMs (e.g. Veolia  Aqualia  Suez and Nijhuis Saur) who further intensified their pilot programs  entered into cooperation agreements with NX Filtration  and started offering NX Filtration's products in full-scale projects.In our Sustainable Industrial Water business line  revenues were €1 934k in the first half year of 2023  compared to €2 073k in the first half year of 2022. The focus in this business line remains on industries looking to reduce their water footprint and optimize their water systems in a sustainable way. The majority of revenues in this business line is currently coming from various OEMs across Europe.Other income slightly declined from €439k in the first half year of 2022 to €376k in the first half year of 2023. This decline was driven by reduced government grants for innovation projects  partly offset by rental income from pilots growing from €231k in the first half year of 2022 to €271k in the first half year of 2023.Gross margin increased to 58.9% in the first half year of 2023 compared to 55.3% in the first half year of 2022  reflecting our strong technology position.Changes in inventory of finished goods and work in progress positively contributed €2 517k in the first half year of 2023  compared to €219k in the first half year of 2022  driven by a build up of finished good inventory anticipating future growth.Personnel costs increased from €3 797k in the first half year of 2022 to €6 293k in the first half year of 2023  reflecting ahead-of-the-curve investments in personnel. Total FTEs increased from 104 at 30 June 2022 (135 at 31 December 2022) to 159 at 30 June 2023. Key additions in the first half year of 2023 relate to application engineers and production personnel.Other operating cost increased from €2 595k in the first half year of 2022 to €3 891k in the first half year of 2023. This increase is mainly related to increased cost for marketing and sales activities  research & development  travel and energy consumption.EBITDA loss was €5 310k in the first half year of 2023 compared to a loss of €3 936k in the first half-year of 2022. The EBITDA loss is mainly driven by investing in the organization ahead-of-the-curve to facilitate future business. Net loss amounted to €4 872k compared to a net loss of €3 989k in the first half year of 2022.Capex amounted to €12 942k compared to €8 060k in the first half year of 2022. Capex mostly relates to the ongoing construction of our new megafactory and further additions to NX Filtration's fleet of pilot systems. Additionally  NX Filtration capitalized €625k of development costs which demonstrates our continued efforts to invest in innovations for the future.Net cash position at 30 June 2023 amounted to €82.2 million compared to a net cash position of €104.3 million at 31 December 2022.Working capital (2) increased to €13 455k as per 30 June 2023 versus €8 471k at 31 December 2022  as a result of increased inventories to support future growth of the business. This also impacted operating cash flow  that was €9 585k negative in the first half year of 2023  compared to €8 438k negative in the first half year of 2022.Sustainability and a clear Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG) agenda are at the heart of NX Filtration's business. We passionately believe we have a responsibility to contribute positively to society and the environment. In the first half year of 2023  Sustainalytics updated its independent ESG risk assessment on NX Filtration  ranking us amongst the 12% best performers in our global subindustry peer group compared to 13% in the previous year.We continue to use our targeted ESG framework to address and monitor our impact along three pillars:Clean water for all : Our membrane sales in the first half year of 2023 can enable the production of 93 billion liters of clean water (3)  enabling access to clean water across 22 countries Avoiding emissions at our customers : With our membrane module sales in the first half year of 2023  we enabled 2 305 ton CO2e savings during the deployment lifetime of our modules  by avoiding the use of 4.3 million kg of chemicals and saving 53 GWh energy compared to conventional technologies (4) Our internal initiatives : We have implemented various sustainability measures and initiatives around ESG related themes in our own operations  for our employees and our partnersMarket developments that benefit our direct nanofiltration technology have developed very favorably in the first half year of 2023. Driven by droughts and pollution  many countries are implementing new regulations and investment plans related to water. For example  in March 2023  France introduced 53 measures to share  reuse and save water. One of the objectives of this plan is to achieve 10% wastewater reuse by 2030  compared to less than 1% today. This represents nearly 1 000 projects in five years to recycle and reuse water. Also in March 2023  the US Biden-Harris Administration proposed the first-ever national drinking water standard related to PFAS. In May 2023  Spain announced a €2.2 billion package to alleviate drought impact  and in June 2023 Germany announced new limit values for PFAS in drinking water.NX Filtration is actively working with its OEM partners on deploying its direct nanofiltration technology in  amongst others  the above-mentioned market trends. Pilots play an important role in this commercial roll-out strategy  that is based on converting pilot projects into larger demo or full-scale projects  with subsequent repeat orders from existing clients  and periodic module replacements at existing plants. In the first half year of 2023  NX Filtration initiated 104 pilot projects compared to 81 in the first half year of 2022. On 30 June 2023  NX Filtration had 186 pilot systems in its fleet  up from 162 at the end of 2022. Pilot projects continue the generate very positive outcomes with our customers. In the first half year of 2023 we delivered our dNF modules for 3 demo projects and 8 full-scale projects  of which 4 were repeat orders from customers who had already worked with NX Filtration before.We are particularly proud that we are making major steps forward with key OEMs across all geographies. In Europe  large OEMs (e.g. Veolia  Aqualia  Suez and Nijhuis Saur) further intensified their pilot programs with our technology  entered into cooperation agreements with NX Filtration  and started offering NX Filtration's products in full-scale projects. We also received follow-on orders from Belgian Water-as-a-Service company Ekopak. In Asia  we experience an increasing size of full-scale projects with large orders from e.g. Greentech in China and Hydroflux in Australia  who also entered into cooperation agreements with NX Filtration that form the basis for further roll-out of our technology. In the Americas  our sales team continued to plant the seeds with a focus on industrial and smaller municipal projects across North America  and various larger drinking water projects across Central and South America that have many similarities with the fast commercial roll-out we experience in Asia.As a result of these favorable market dynamics  our increased pilot program and our traction with key OEMs  we see our pipeline of commercial opportunities further strengthening and growing  being today more than 50% larger than at the end of the first half of 2022.We are fully on track with the construction of our new large-scale manufacturing facility. Last year  NX Filtration decided to upsize the design of this megafactory with a higher initial capacity and allowing more space for future capacity additions. Initial capacity is expected to be approximately 50k (5) membrane modules per year  compared to approximately 10k (6) membrane modules in our current facilities. We also anticipated for further capacity additions within the same facility  with a total targeted annual capacity of >120k (7) membrane modules in addition to the existing capacity at the current locations.ESG is strongly embedded in the design of this factory  with more than 400 solar panels for electricity generation  an extensive heat energy management and reuse system  and an inhouse water treatment facility. We are making strong progress on the construction  with completion of the new megafactory being anticipated by the first quarter of 2024  and start-up during the first half-year of 2024 within the anticipated Capex budget.Our commercial roll-out strategy remains top priority in the second half year of 2023. We will continue our existing approach in which our global sales teams work with OEMs to roll-out pilot projects and convert these pilots into demo- and full-scale projects.NX Filtration will increasingly be able to benefit from the ahead-of-the-curve investments it has made. For example  over the past 1.5 years  we have expanded our global commercial organization from 18 to 42 FTEs  who are increasingly becoming effective in onboarding new OEMs  rolling out pilot projects and working towards converting these pilots into larger projects. Also in terms of our fleet of pilot systems  we have made ahead-of-the-curve investments  growing this fleet from 85 systems at the beginning of 2022 to 186 systems at the end of the first half year of 2023. Therewith we are nearing closely to our medium-term objective of 200 pilot systems  and therewith gradually shifting our focus from rapid expansion of our pilot fleet towards optimal deployment for near  medium and long-term commercial opportunities.2023 is a key year for the construction of our new megafactory. We are fully on track and completion of this megafactory is anticipated by the first quarter of 2024 and start-up during the first half-year of 2024. By then  we expect the additional capacity is needed to meet expected demand from our rapidly growing overall pipeline of opportunities for the medium term.Our outlook on total revenues for 2023 is €10m to €14m  a substantial increase from €8.4 million in 2022. We are reiterating our medium- and long term objectives on revenue growth and profitability. The growth for the years to come is further substantiated by strong building blocks that are in place: e.g. benefiting from stronger than ever market trends  making major steps forward with key OEMs  and seeing a rapidly growing pipeline of commercial opportunities.We remain fully committed to making an impact based on our mission 'clean and affordable water for all'  whilst offering strong sustainability benefits to our customers and providing an inspiring working environment for our employees.The half year 2023 report is available on the Investor Relations section of the websitewww.nxfiltration.com.NX Filtration will host an analyst call and webcast at 9:30 CEST on 29 August 2023 to comment on the H1 2023 results.
