The findings have potential to remove significant friction slowing the growth of tokenised asset markets and enable them to scale globally as they mature.While tokenisation is in its infancy  97% of institutional investors believe it will revolutionise asset management and be a positive force in the industry1  not least because of its potential to increase efficiency  reduce costs and  by enabling fractional ownership  open up opportunities to more investors.One issue challenging investors and institutions  however  is that tokenised assets are managed on different blockchains  each with its own functionality and liquidity profile. Interoperability between these blockchains is crucial  otherwise financial institutions must build connections to each platform  creating significant operational challenges and cost.Working with more than a dozen major financial institutions and market infrastructures and Chainlink  a leading Web3 services platform  Swift has successfully demonstrated that it can provide a single point of access to multiple networks using existing  secure infrastructure  thereby significantly reducing operational challenges and investment required for institutions to support the development of tokenised assets.The experiments are part of Swift’s wider strategy to ensure secure  global interoperability as new technologies and platforms emerge. They build on work over the past few years to show how Swift infrastructure could support the financial community in interconnecting Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and other digital assets with new and existing payments systems.Tom Zschach  Chief Innovation Officer at Swift  said: “ Interoperability is at the heart of everything we are doing at Swift to facilitate the seamless flow of value across the world in the face of increasing fragmentation. For tokenisation to reach its potential  institutions will need to be able to seamlessly connect with the whole financial ecosystem. Our experiments have demonstrated clearly that existing secure and trusted Swift infrastructure can provide that central point of connectivity  removing a huge hurdle in the development of tokenisation and unlocking its potential.”About the experimentsSwift collaborated with several major financial institutions on the experiments  including Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ)  BNP Paribas  BNY Mellon  Citi  Clearstream  Euroclear  Lloyds Banking Group  SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) and The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. Chainlink was used as an enterprise abstraction layer to securely connect the Swift network to the Ethereum Sepolia network  while Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) enabled complete interoperability between the source and destination blockchains.In addition to demonstrating that existing Swift infrastructure can provide a secure  scalable way for financial institutions to connect to multiple types of blockchain  they advanced understanding around the technical and business requirements for interacting with business and public blockchains. The experiments also explored the value of a blockchain interoperability protocol for securely transferring data between existing systems and a potentially unlimited number of blockchains.The experiments looked at the design and technical development of a solution and considerations around data privacy and governance  operational risk  and legal liability. Transfers of simulated tokenised assets took place – between two wallets on the same public Distributed Ledger Technology network; between two wallets on different public blockchains; and between a public and private blockchain network.Swift will continue to work with the financial community to understand the most concrete use cases for tokenised asset adoption and will prioritise its efforts accordingly. It is anticipated that the most compelling case  in the near term  will be in the secondary trading of non-listed assets and private markets.The full report can be found here.Nigel Dobson  Banking Services Portfolio Lead at ANZ  said: “ ANZ is actively exploring the use of decentralised networks and tokenisation via a ‘test and learn’ approach  particularly in underserved markets such as the trading of nature-based assets. Establishing interoperability between existing financial market infrastructure and multiple blockchains will be critical for greater adoption so we were naturally delighted to participate in this experiment with the Swift community.""Alain Pochet  Head of Client Delivery  Securities Services at BNP Paribas  said: “ With the increasing number of blockchains  the task of connecting our traditional technical platforms and ensuring interoperability between blockchains presents a growing challenge that we must overcome. In this regard  the experiment demonstrated the potential to leverage the extensive connectivity already established with Swift.”Thilo Derenbach  Head of Business Development & Commercialisation for Digital Securities Services at Clearstream  said: “ As a provider of financial market infrastructure  Clearstream has a key role in supporting the financial industry in its transition to the digital era. Driving digitisation  supported by latest technologies and the tokenisation of assets  is a key topic for us at Clearstream. Joint partnerships and experiments like these help progress the industry innovation agenda while at the same time offering solutions for the interoperability of existing and future ecosystems.”Jennifer Peve  Managing Director  Global Head of Strategy & Innovation at DTCC  said: “ As a financial market infrastructure provider  DTCC is committed to co-ideating and developing solutions to connect the broadest set of market participants and ensure that innovative solutions don’t form in silos and deliver maximum value. We are pleased to engage with Swift on this important experiment that has taken meaningful steps in understanding what cross-network interoperability could mean in the future.”Stephanie Lheureux  Head of Digital Assets Excellence Centre at Euroclear  said: “ We are delighted to have participated in this important project collaborating with other Financial Market Infrastructures (FMI) and institutions with the aim to tangibly unlock DLT value through interoperability experiments. As an FMI  our approach to innovation has been to develop solutions in cooperation with our ecosystem with the objective to continuously drive efficiencies to reduce cost and risk.”Alexandre Kech  Head Digital Securities at SIX Digital Exchange (SDX)  said: “ This interoperability exercise is critical to the understanding on how banks and FMIs can realise the promise of blockchain for institutional business  that is  the building of a multi-party  regulated global digital asset agnostic trading  settlement and asset servicing 24/7 infrastructure for issuers and investors.”Sergey Nazarov  Co-Founder at Chainlink  said: “ It’s now clear that both top global banks and leading market infrastructures believe there will be greater adoption of digital assets across the entire banking industry  and that this adoption will happen using multiple different blockchain technologies at the same time. The collaboration between Swift  over ten of the largest financial institutions  and Chainlink also proved that interoperability across chains is critical to enabling the next stage of digital asset adoption across the global financial system. When combining Swift and CCIP  we were able to show that this new level of interoperability across various blockchains is now possible with minimal resources from even the largest banks and market infrastructures.”About SwiftSwift is a global member owned cooperative and the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services.

At the Nibirii electronic music festival in Düren  Germany  Deutsche Telekom AG tested the H 2 Genset by SFC Energy (F3C:DE  ISIN: DE0007568578)  a leading supplier of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions  as an environmentally friendly power supply for its mobile transmission tower.At the Nibirii Festival  Deutsche Telekom powered a mobile base station 100 percent with green hydrogen in live operation for the first time. These transmitter masts can be used independently of a stationary power supply  for example at festivals  outdoor events and trade fairs as well as in disaster areas.The mobile trailer solution H 2 Genset by SFC Energy ensured the reliable power supply of the transmission tower. The H 2 Genset by SFC Energy is an emission-free and self-sufficient power generator that is ideally suited for areas without access to the conventional power grid and can call up a peak power of up to 20 kW. This ensured stable  mobile communication in the 5G and LTE standards for the approximately 30 000 visitors to the festival. With the environmentally friendly energy solution  Deutsche Telekom replaced a diesel generator that consumes 35 to 40 liters of fuel per day.""We are pleased that together with Deutsche Telekom AG we were able to provide the fans of the Nibirii Festival with a stable mobile phone connection with sustainable energy supply. The H 2 Genset has already proven its performance in a wide range of industries and has now also been able to convince in the supply of temporarily installed mobile phone masts. The fuel cell  which runs on green hydrogen  generates electricity in a reliable and environmentally friendly way – unlike the diesel generator  it does not pollute people or the environment "" says Dr. Peter Podesser  CEO of SFC Energy AG.For more information on SFC Energy's Clean Energy and Clean Power Management solutions  visit sfc.com.About SFC Energy AGSFC Energy AG is a leading provider of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions.

""Yes  the implementation of these active accounts will have a cost for the actors of the sector  but this cost is very far from being problematic or prohibitive.""Dorien Rookmaker  from the right in parliament  said the active account proposal should be deleted because EU market share in clearing should be increased by competition and not by imposing rules that would make the sector ""less competitive and lazy"".The committee aims to vote on an agreed position in early November before opening talks with EU states on a final deal.Britain's clearers have EU permission to continue serving EU customers until end June 2025  though few believe they will be cut off entirely after then.

With global production of durum wheat headed for a 22-year low  Italy's famed pasta makers have had to turn to unusual suppliers such as Turkey for their main ingredient.In Toronto  Continental Noodles knew there was trouble when the cost of a 20-kilogram bag of semolina flour  milled from durum  rose 24% in a few weeks of July to C$26 ($19.15). Family-owned Continental  which sells fettuccine and ravioli to Whole Foods and the general public  is also paying more for tomatoes used in sauce after crop setbacks in Spain and India.One of Continental's owners  Vincent Liberatore  fears prices will rise even more now that farmers in top durum exporter Canada have seen their harvest devastated by drought. He said the business will absorb the costs as long as possible  uncertain how much more consumers will pay.""The population has tapped out - everything has been going up "" Liberatore said. ""The biggest stress for us business owners right now is the unknown - the roller coaster up and down.""Retail pasta prices rose about 12% this year in Europe and 8% in the United States  according to market research firm Nielsen. Prices of another staple  rice  have also spiked following export curbs in India.The International Grains Council forecasts 2023/24 global durum production at a 22-year low  pushing world stocks to their smallest in three decades.CANADA DRYWhen the Prairies turned dry this summer  Canadian farmer Darold Niwa saw hopes of a bumper durum harvest dashed.""Until June 10  I felt I was sitting pretty "" Niwa  67  said from his farm near Oyen  Alberta. Now ""we'll probably take a loss.""Story continuesNiwa's durum has produced only six to eight kernels per head  instead of the usual 45-52. His break-even level is 32-35 bushels per acre (bpa) but he is harvesting just 10-11 bpa  about 1 metric ton per hectare.Canada accounts for around half of global trade in durum but this year's harvest looks to be the country's second-smallest harvest in 12 years. Canadian farmers are expected to produce 4.3 million metric tons of durum this year  Statistics Canada reported on Tuesday.""The pipeline in Canada is empty "" said agriculture analyst Jerry Klassen.The United States is also expected to harvest a smaller crop due to dryness  while drought has cut production in Spain and severe weather has produced mixed quality in Italy and France.Deteriorating supplies drove up the Euronext futures price benchmark to a six-month peak in early August. The spike led major importer Algeria to cancel a durum tender in early August. The major importer announced a new tender this week.TURKEY TURNS EXPORTERIn Italy  which relies on imports to complement domestic crops  some firms are turning to new supply sources. Turkey has emerged as a surprise durum exporter.Market estimates place Turkish durum export sales so far this season at 300 000 metric tons  with most bound for Italy.Traders said Turkey is tapping a bumper harvest and high stocks to reverse its usual role as an importer. Its exports are widely expected to reach 500 000 tons and possibly 1 million depending on government export approvals.The Turkish trade ministry did not respond to a request for comment.Turkish exports have cooled Mediterranean and North American durum prices  but they should resume their climb when Turkey runs out in a month or two  said Philip Werle  partner at Spain-based Northstar Brokerage.Short-term supply relief has also come from Russia  which has shipped over 100 000 tons to the European Union since July according to EU import data.Pasta giant Barilla  which processes local durum in various countries  said it currently saw no critical supply issues.Consultancy Strategie Grains says pasta makers could possibly use more soft wheat where regulations allow and consumer income is limited. Durum  the hardest wheat  produces pasta with the prized ""al dente"" firm texture  unlike soft wheat.

These include the Ingrandes Foundry (a 43-hectare site with 40 000 sq. metres of buildings) and the Oyré Technical Landfill Centre (a 35-hectare site).The Ingrandes Foundry site will be taken over by the consortium  formed of a joint venture between Lhyfe and TSE. As for the Technical Landfill Centre  it is being fully taken over by TSE  which will devote the land entirely to the production of solar energy with a 45 GWh plant.Lhyfe and TSE have been preparing the site take-over for over a year and a half  accompanied and supported by the Nouvelle-Aquitaine Region  the urban community of Grand Châtellerault  the Prefecture of Vienne and the Sub-Prefecture of Châtellerault  with a view to building a common project that goes far beyond the “simple” production of green hydrogen or green electricity.A reindustrialisation project centred around green energy“The joint Lhyfe and TSE project for the Ingrandes Foundry site is particularly ambitious. It involves firstly dismantling the existing infrastructure and cleaning up the site to make it compatible with the industrialisation process  thanks to the Green Fund  and then building the bases of a truly ecological industrial park where companies will work in synergy”  explained Ghislain Robert  Sales Director for France at Lhyfe.“After nearly two years' work  in consultation with and with the support of the regional authorities  TSE and Lhyfe are proud to have formed an innovative consortium that is leading this project for the revitalisation of the historic Poitou Foundries site. It is a green and virtuous reindustrialisation project  creating jobs that will accelerate energy transition and regional economic development”  said Alban Casimir  Deputy Managing Director in charge of Industry Convergence at TSE.The photovoltaic power facilities that TSE plans to install at the landfill centre site and at the Ingrandes Foundry site could supply electricity to the latter  allowing Lhyfe to produce green and renewable hydrogen. The power produced will be equivalent to half that consumed by the city of Poitiers.A virtuous project to revitalise the local economySeveral companies have already expressed their interest in joining the Ingrandes site  in synergy with Lhyfe and TSE  such as an industrial logistics company which plans to create a 20 000 sq. metre logistics centre at the site  as well as e-fuel producing companies (e-methanol and rDME).Eventually this green energy hub should  thanks to the contribution of all involved companies  help create 250 to 300 jobs  with investments expected to amount to several hundreds of millions of euros.“For the Region  this is a landmark regeneration project for a major industrial site in Nouvelle Aquitaine. Focusing on green energy and the circular economy  this project led by the Lhyfe and TSE consortium will create hundreds of qualified and non-relocatable jobs. It is fully in keeping with our NeoTerra strategy and our desire to become France's No.1 eco-responsible region. It is a boost for the Châtellerault employment area  which was heavily impacted by the successive crises of these last few years”  stressed Alain Rousset  President of Nouvelle-Aquitaine Region.“Our community welcomes this news with great enthusiasm and pride. Just a year after the wind up of Fonderies du Poitou  we are going to write it a new chapter  thanks to the combined efforts of public authorities. The project led by the consortium is in line with our desire to make Grand Châtellerault an area for green industry and  most importantly  with the objectives of our Territorial Climate  Air and Energy Plan. Providing more than 250 jobs  this  here  is a major factor of attractiveness for the community”  said Jean-Pierre Abelin  Mayor of Châtellerault and President of the Grand Châtellerault urban community.The Préfecture de la Vienne also confirmed this project as a part of one of the pillars of the France 2030 investment plan (funding could be mobilised in the long term)  like the Council of Nouvelle-Aquitaine Region which must  within the framework of Neoterra  receive financial support.For an interview with the spokespersons above  please contact the press department.Click to access the Lhyfe Media Kit (press kit and visuals)About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

The report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the global digital asset investment landscape  focusing on assets under management  trading volumes  and price performance. Targeting institutional investors  analysts  and regulators  the review aggregates data from multiple sources  including Financial Times  CoinShares  and Bloomberg  among others.📣 Our August Digital Asset Management Review is out!📉 Major decline in AUM  impacted by $BTC's drop to $25 345 on Aug 17.📊 Average daily trading volumes down 17.9% to $208mn.✅ Grayscale’s $GBTC added $1.17bn after ruling news.More insights 👇https://t.co/EyGMDvKEjf — CCData (@CCData_io) August 30  2023Federal Court Sides with GrayscaleIn a landmark decision  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sided with Grayscale  overturning the SEC’s rejection of converting its GBTC fund into an ETF. The court ruling had an immediate impact on the market  causing Bitcoin’s price to surge from $26 000 to $27 600 within minutes. According to CCData  this could serve as a significant catalyst for the U.S.  potentially bringing the country closer to launching its first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF.Europe Takes the Lead in ETF RaceWhile the U.S. is still contemplating its first Bitcoin spot ETF  Europe has already taken the lead. London-based Jacobi Asset Management launched Europe’s first Bitcoin Spot ETF  which began trading on Euronext on August 15th. CCData notes that the U.S. SEC has postponed its decision on ARK Invest & 21Shares’ application  originally slated for August 13th  with the final deadline now set for January 10  2024.SEC Likely to Approve First ETH Futures ETFCCData’s review also highlights informal reports suggesting that the SEC is on the verge of approving the first Ethereum futures ETF. While the specific fund to receive this approval hasn’t been disclosed  the announcement is expected in October. Companies like Bitwise  VanEck  ProShares  Grayscale  and a partnership between Ark Invest and 21Shares have submitted applications for Ethereum futures funds.Decline in AUM and Trading VolumesIn August  the total assets under management (AUM) for digital asset investment products experienced a significant downturn. This drop was exacerbated by market volatility  largely due to a steep fall in Bitcoin’s value  which reached a low of $25 375 on August 17th  as per CCData’s CCCAGG Reference Price. The situation worsened with the SEC’s postponement of approvals for multiple digital asset ETFs. By August 25th  the total AUM had decreased to $29.7 billion  a 12.7% reduction compared to July  marking the lowest level since February 2023.In August  the average daily trading volumes for digital asset investment products experienced a notable reduction  falling by 17.9% to $208 million. This marked the second month in a row of declining volumes and hit the lowest point since January 2023. This downward trend was influenced by a drop in Bitcoin’s price  which led to growing apprehension among market players  dampening the positive outlook that had been prevalent in June and July.,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,negative,0.01,0.3,0.69,True,English,"['August 2023 Review', 'Key Milestones', 'Crypto Investment', 'CCData', 'global digital asset investment landscape', 'digital asset investment products', 'August Digital Asset Management Review', 'London-based Jacobi Asset Management', 'First ETH Futures ETF', 'multiple digital asset ETFs', 'first Ethereum futures ETF', 'institutional-grade digital asset data', 'Average daily trading volumes', 'first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF', 'first Bitcoin spot ETF', 'Ethereum futures funds', 'FCA-authorised benchmark administrator', 'D.C.

REUTERS/Remo Casilli 2/2CAD/USD -0.07% Add to/Remove from WatchlistBy Gus Trompiz and Rod NickelPARIS/WINNIPEG  Manitoba - Pasta lovers must brace to pay even higher prices for their favorite dish  as drought in Canada and bad weather in Europe damages crops of durum wheat and reduces supplies available to flour millers and food companies.Italy's government called a crisis meeting in May as prices for the staple food jumped by more than double the national inflation rate. With global production of durum wheat headed for a 22-year low  Italy's famed pasta makers have had to turn to unusual suppliers such as Turkey for their main ingredient.In Toronto  Continental Noodles knew there was trouble when the cost of a 20-kilogram bag of semolina flour  milled from durum  rose 24% in a few weeks of July to C$26 ($19.15). Family-owned Continental  which sells fettuccine and ravioli to Whole Foods and the general public  is also paying more for tomatoes used in sauce after crop setbacks in Spain and India.One of Continental's owners  Vincent Liberatore  fears prices will rise even more now that farmers in top durum exporter Canada have seen their harvest devastated by drought. He said the business will absorb the costs as long as possible  uncertain how much more consumers will pay.""The population has tapped out - everything has been going up "" Liberatore said. ""The biggest stress for us business owners right now is the unknown - the roller coaster up and down.""Retail pasta prices rose about 12% this year in Europe and 8% in the United States  according to market research firm Nielsen. Prices of another staple  rice  have also spiked following export curbs in India.The International Grains Council forecasts 2023/24 global durum production at a 22-year low  pushing world stocks to their smallest in three decades.CANADA DRYWhen the Prairies turned dry this summer  Canadian farmer Darold Niwa saw hopes of a bumper durum harvest dashed.""Until June 10  I felt I was sitting pretty "" Niwa  67  said from his farm near Oyen  Alberta. Now ""we'll probably take a loss.""Niwa's durum has produced only six to eight kernels per head  instead of the usual 45-52. His break-even level is 32-35 bushels per acre (bpa) but he is harvesting just 10-11 bpa  about 1 metric ton per hectare.Canada accounts for around half of global trade in durum but this year's harvest looks to be the country's second-smallest harvest in 12 years. Canadian farmers are expected to produce 4.3 million metric tons of durum this year  Statistics Canada reported on Tuesday.""The pipeline in Canada is empty "" said agriculture analyst Jerry Klassen.The United States is also expected to harvest a smaller crop due to dryness  while drought has cut production in Spain and severe weather has produced mixed quality in Italy and France.Deteriorating supplies drove up the Euronext futures price benchmark to a six-month peak in early August. The spike led major importer Algeria to cancel a durum tender in early August. The major importer announced a new tender this week.TURKEY TURNS EXPORTERIn Italy  which relies on imports to complement domestic crops  some firms are turning to new supply sources. Turkey has emerged as a surprise durum exporter.Market estimates place Turkish durum export sales so far this season at 300 000 metric tons  with most bound for Italy.Traders said Turkey is tapping a bumper harvest and high stocks to reverse its usual role as an importer. Its exports are widely expected to reach 500 000 tons and possibly 1 million depending on government export approvals.The Turkish trade ministry did not respond to a request for comment.Turkish exports have cooled Mediterranean and North American durum prices  but they should resume their climb when Turkey runs out in a month or two  said Philip Werle  partner at Spain-based Northstar Brokerage.Short-term supply relief has also come from Russia  which has shipped over 100 000 tons to the European Union since July according to EU import data.Pasta giant Barilla  which processes local durum in various countries  said it currently saw no critical supply issues.Consultancy Strategie Grains says pasta makers could possibly use more soft wheat where regulations allow and consumer income is limited. Durum  the hardest wheat  produces pasta with the prized ""al dente"" firm texture  unlike soft wheat. In North Africa  durum is also used to make couscous.""There's not going to be enough durum to supply the whole world at a normal demand level "" Strategie Grains analyst Severine Omnes-Maisons said.In the meantime  Vincenzo Martinelli  president of the durum section of Italian millers association Italmopa  nervously awaits the outcome of the Canadian harvest.""Without Canada  prices will only go up "" he said.($1 = 1.3578 Canadian dollars)",neutral,0.04,0.92,0.04,negative,0.02,0.23,0.75,True,English,"['Analysis-High pasta prices', 'Canada', 'wheat', 'Reuters', 'six to eight kernels', 'Euronext futures price benchmark', 'agriculture analyst Jerry Klassen', 'al dente"" firm texture', 'The International Grains Council', 'The Turkish trade ministry', 'Turkish durum export sales', '2023/24 global durum production', 'North American durum prices', 'Strategie Grains analyst', 'Consultancy Strategie Grains', 'Fara San Martino', 'national inflation rate', 'market research firm', 'Spain-based Northstar Brokerage', 'Short-term supply relief', 'EU import data', 'critical supply issues', 'The United States', 'new supply sources', 'normal demand level', 'Italian millers association', 'Italian pasta maker', 'Pasta giant Barilla', 'government export approvals', 'top durum exporter', 'surprise durum exporter', 'famed pasta makers', 'Retail pasta prices', '4.3 million metric tons', 'bumper durum harvest', 'global trade', 'global production', 'export curbs', 'North Africa', 'Turkish exports', 'TURNS EXPORTER', 'flour millers', 'even level', 'new tender', 'Market estimates', '1 metric ton', 'bumper harvest', 'Pasta lovers', 'durum wheat', 'durum tender', 'local durum', 'enough durum', 'durum section', '300,000 metric tons', 'De Cecco', 'Remo Casilli', 'Gus Trompiz', 'Rod Nickel', 'favorite dish', 'bad weather', 'food companies', '22-year low', 'unusual suppliers', 'main ingredient', '20-kilogram bag', 'semolina flour', 'Whole Foods', 'general public', 'crop setbacks', 'biggest stress', 'roller coaster', 'three decades', 'Canadian farmer', '32-35 bushels', 'smaller crop', 'severe weather', 'mixed quality', 'six-month peak', 'early August', 'high stocks', 'usual role', 'Philip Werle', 'European Union', 'various countries', 'soft wheat', 'consumer income', 'hardest wheat', 'Severine Omnes-Maisons', 'Vincenzo Martinelli', '1.3578 Canadian dollars', 'higher prices', 'smallest harvest', 'Canadian harvest', 'Continental Noodles', 'Family-owned Continental', 'major importer', 'staple food', 'Vincent Liberatore', 'world stocks', '10-11 bpa', 'Deteriorating supplies', 'domestic crops', 'Darold Niwa', 'CANADA DRY', 'business owners', '500,000 tons', '100,000 tons', 'farmers', 'Reuters', 'PHOTO', 'worker', 'factory', 'Italy', 'Watchlist', 'PARIS/WINNIPEG', 'Manitoba', 'drought', 'May', 'Turkey', 'Toronto', 'trouble', 'cost', 'weeks', 'July', 'fettuccine', 'ravioli', 'tomatoes', 'sauce', 'India', 'consumers', 'population', 'everything', 'Nielsen', 'Prairies', 'hopes', 'June', 'Oyen', 'Alberta', 'loss', 'head', 'break', 'acre', 'half', 'country', '12 years', 'Tuesday', 'pipeline', 'dryness', 'France', 'spike', 'Algeria', 'imports', 'firms', 'Traders', 'request', 'comment', 'Mediterranean', 'climb', 'partner', 'Russia', 'regulations', 'prized', 'couscous', 'meantime', 'president', 'Italmopa', 'outcome', '©']",2023-08-30,2023-08-31,investing.com

Prices of another staple  rice  have also spiked following export curbs in India.The International Grains Council forecasts 2023/24 global durum production at a 22-year low  pushing world stocks to their smallest in three decades.CANADA DRYWhen the Prairies turned dry this summer  Canadian farmer Darold Niwa saw hopes of a bumper durum harvest dashed.""Until June 10  I felt I was sitting pretty "" Niwa  67  said from his farm near Oyen  Alberta. Now ""we'll probably take a loss.""Niwa's durum has produced only six to eight kernels per head  instead of the usual 45-52. His break-even level is 32-35 bushels per acre (bpa) but he is harvesting just 10-11 bpa  about 1 metric ton per hectare.Canada accounts for around half of global trade in durum but this year's harvest looks to be the country's second-smallest harvest in 12 years. Canadian farmers are expected to produce 4.3 million metric tons of durum this year  Statistics Canada reported on Tuesday.""The pipeline in Canada is empty "" said agriculture analyst Jerry Klassen.The United States is also expected to harvest a smaller crop due to dryness  while drought has cut production in Spain and severe weather has produced mixed quality in Italy and France. Deteriorating supplies drove up the Euronext futures price benchmark to a six-month peak in early August. The spike led major importer Algeria to cancel a durum tender in early August. The major importer announced a new tender this week.TURKEY TURNS EXPORTER In Italy  which relies on imports to complement domestic crops  some firms are turning to new supply sources. Turkey has emerged as a surprise durum exporter.Market estimates place Turkish durum export sales so far this season at 300 000 metric tons  with most bound for Italy.Traders said Turkey is tapping a bumper harvest and high stocks to reverse its usual role as an importer. Its exports are widely expected to reach 500 000 tons and possibly 1 million depending on government export approvals.The Turkish trade ministry did not respond to a request for comment.Turkish exports have cooled Mediterranean and North American durum prices  but they should resume their climb when Turkey runs out in a month or two  said Philip Werle  partner at Spain-based Northstar Brokerage.Short-term supply relief has also come from Russia  which has shipped over 100 000 tons to the European Union since July according to EU import data. Pasta giant Barilla  which processes local durum in various countries  said it currently saw no critical supply issues. Consultancy Strategie Grains says pasta makers could possibly use more soft wheat where regulations allow and consumer income is limited. Durum  the hardest wheat  produces pasta with the prized ""al dente"" firm texture  unlike soft wheat. In North Africa  durum is also used to make couscous.""There's not going to be enough durum to supply the whole world at a normal demand level "" Strategie Grains analyst Severine Omnes-Maisons said.In the meantime  Vincenzo Martinelli  president of the durum section of Italian millers association Italmopa  nervously awaits the outcome of the Canadian harvest.""Without Canada  prices will only go up "" he said.($1 = 1.3578 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Gus Trompiz and Rod Nickel; additional reporting by Emilio Parodi in Milan  Ceyda Caglayan in Istanbul; Julie Ingwersen in Chicago and Michael Hogan in Hamburg; Editing by Caroline Stauffer and David Gregorio)",neutral,0.04,0.83,0.13,negative,0.02,0.27,0.72,True,English,"['High pasta prices', 'Canada', 'wheat', 'six to eight kernels', 'Euronext futures price benchmark', 'agriculture analyst Jerry Klassen', 'al dente"" firm texture', 'The International Grains Council', 'The Turkish trade ministry', 'Turkish durum export sales', '2023/24 global durum production', 'North American durum prices', 'Strategie Grains analyst', 'Consultancy Strategie Grains', 'national inflation rate', 'market research firm', 'Spain-based Northstar Brokerage', 'Short-term supply relief', 'EU import data', 'critical supply issues', 'The United States', 'new supply sources', 'normal demand level', 'Pasta giant Barilla', 'government export approvals', 'Italian millers association', 'famed pasta makers', 'top durum exporter', 'surprise durum exporter', 'Retail pasta prices', '4.3 million metric tons', 'bumper durum harvest', 'global trade', 'global production', 'export curbs', 'North Africa', 'Turkish exports', 'TURNS EXPORTER', 'even level', 'new tender', 'Market estimates', 'Pasta lovers', '1 metric ton', 'bumper harvest', 'durum wheat', 'durum tender', 'local durum', 'enough durum', 'durum section', '300,000 metric tons', 'favorite dish', 'bad weather', 'food companies', '22-year low', 'unusual suppliers', 'main ingredient', '20-kilogram bag', 'semolina flour', 'Whole Foods', 'general public', 'crop setbacks', 'biggest stress', 'roller coaster', 'three decades', 'Canadian farmer', '32-35 bushels', 'smaller crop', 'severe weather', 'mixed quality', 'six-month peak', 'early August', 'high stocks', 'usual role', 'Philip Werle', 'European Union', 'various countries', 'soft wheat', 'consumer income', 'hardest wheat', 'Severine Omnes-Maisons', 'Vincenzo Martinelli', '1.3578 Canadian dollars', 'Gus Trompiz', 'Rod Nickel', 'additional reporting', 'Emilio Parodi', 'Ceyda Caglayan', 'Julie Ingwersen', 'Michael Hogan', 'Caroline Stauffer', 'David Gregorio', 'higher prices', 'smallest harvest', 'Canadian harvest', 'Continental Noodles', 'Family-owned Continental', 'major importer', 'staple food', 'Vincent Liberatore', 'world stocks', '10-11 bpa', 'Deteriorating supplies', 'domestic crops', 'Darold Niwa', 'CANADA DRY', 'business owners', '500,000 tons', '100,000 tons', 'farmers', 'PARIS/WINNIPEG', 'Manitoba', 'drought', 'Italy', 'May', 'Turkey', 'Toronto', 'trouble', 'cost', 'weeks', 'July', 'fettuccine', 'ravioli', 'tomatoes', 'sauce', 'India', 'consumers', 'population', 'everything', 'unknown', 'Nielsen', 'Prairies', 'hopes', 'June', 'Oyen', 'Alberta', 'loss', 'head', 'break', 'acre', 'half', 'country', '12 years', 'Tuesday', 'pipeline', 'dryness', 'France', 'spike', 'Algeria', 'imports', 'firms', 'Traders', 'request', 'comment', 'Mediterranean', 'climb', 'partner', 'Russia', 'regulations', 'prized', 'couscous', 'meantime', 'president', 'Italmopa', 'outcome', 'Milan', 'Istanbul', 'Chicago', 'Hamburg', 'Editing']",2023-08-30,2023-08-31,marketscreener.com

Excluding PPE  the business overall grew by 5.0% (up 1.0% on an organic basis).In healthcare institutions  the Group recorded revenue of €96.0 million  down 5.6% (down 6.9% on an organic basis). Excluding PPE  revenue was down 2.4% on an organic basis due to the fourth quarter being heavily impacted by a one-off very high basis of comparison.In stores/online  revenue rose by 6.6% to €120.5 million (up 0.7% on an organic basis). Excluding PPE  the segment grew by 3.9% on an organic basis.The “Respiratory” business reported revenue of €162.1 million  up 20.3% (up 11.4% on an organic basis). Momentum remained very strong in France  as well as internationally  notably in Spain where Keylab posted record revenue.

(NASDAQ: XCUR) have signed an exclusive collaboration agreement to research  develop  and commercialize novel Spherical Nucleic Acids (SNAs) as potential investigational treatments for Huntington's disease and Angelman syndrome.Oligonucleotides are synthetic structures of nucleic acids that can be used to modulate gene expression via a range of processes  including gene activation  inhibition  and splice-modulation. These molecules have demonstrated potential in many different therapeutic areas.1 Achieving efficient oligonucleotide delivery to target organs and tissues  including the brain  remains a major limitation to their use.1 2 Exicure's SNAs provide distinct chemical and biochemical properties to oligonucleotides. In preclinical models  SNAs have been shown to enhance the cell penetration  biodistribution and organ persistence properties of oligonucleotides 3 4 which may potentially enhance drug delivery to previously inaccessible target tissues  including deep brain regions.5 6Philippe Lopes-Fernandes  Chief Business Officer at Ipsen  said ""Neuroscience is deeply rooted within Ipsen as a key strategic driver for our business. We are pleased to partner with Exicure to progress development of investigational treatment options for Huntington's disease and Angelman syndrome  two areas of significant unmet need. This collaboration marks an important step in maximizing the potential of this novel technology  bringing together the expertise of Exicure and the robust heritage of Ipsen in neuroscience. With this new collaboration we will deepen our commitment to people living with neurological conditions around the world.""""We are thrilled to partner with Ipsen  a leading global company with significant expertise and commitment to developing treatments for patients with rare neurological diseases "" said David Giljohann  Ph.D.  Chief Executive Officer  Exicure  Inc. ""In collaboration with Ipsen  we have the opportunity to apply our technology to Huntington's disease and Angelman syndrome  both indications requiring deep brain penetration and technological advances to reach previously hard-to-drug targets. We believe our platform technology with its deep penetration and persistence of medicinal effect will allow Exicure and Ipsen to overcome challenges from first-generation oligonucleotides and bring new medicines to patients in need.""Under the agreement  Ipsen will receive exclusive options to license SNA-based therapeutics arising from two collaboration programs for Huntington's disease and Angelman syndrome. Ipsen will pay Exicure a cash upfront payment of $20m upon closing and Exicure will be responsible for discovery and certain pre-clinical development activities. In the event Ipsen exercises its option  Ipsen will be responsible for further development and commercialization of the licensed products.

Abou-Alfa  M.D.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  New York and lead investigator on CELESTIAL. ""These results suggest that  if approved  cabozantinib could become an important addition to the treatment landscape that may help slow disease progression and  critically  improve survival for these patients.""""Patients with advanced HCC have a very poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Given the worldwide prevalence of advanced HCC  there is a continued urgency to bring new treatment options to these patients""  added Lorenza Rimassa M.D.  Deputy Director  Medical Oncology Unit  Humanitas Cancer Center Humanitas Research Hospital  Milan. ""The clinically significant benefits in both overall survival and progression-free survival shown in the CELESTIAL trial  in patients previously treated with up to two treatment lines  suggest that cabozantinib could become (when approved) an important addition to the treatment landscape for this patient population.""Ipsen received validation by the European Medicines Agency in March 2018 for its application for variation to the Cabometyx® marketing authorization to include the new indication for patients with previously treated advanced HCC. Ipsen's partner Exelixis announced in May 2018 that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the company's supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Cabometyx® (cabozantinib) tablets as a treatment for patients with previously treated HCC. The filing has been assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date of January 14  2019.""This publication of CELESTIAL phase 3 data in the NEJM this week further validates the medical importance of these results for the treatment of patients with advanced liver cancer"" said Alexandre Lebeaut  Executive Vice-President Research & Development  Chief Scientific Officer  Ipsen. ""Together with our partner Exelixis we relentlessly contribute to expanding the clinical benefits of cabozantinib across solid tumors to address unmet medical needs"".Median OS in CELESTIAL was 10.2 months with cabozantinib versus 8.0 months with placebo (HR 0.76  95 percent CI 0.63-0.92; p=0.0049). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was more than doubled  at 5.2 months with cabozantinib and 1.9 months with placebo (HR 0.44  95 percent CI 0.36-0.52; p<0.0001). Objective response rates per RECIST 1.1 were 4 percent with cabozantinib and 0.4 percent with placebo (p=0.0086). Disease control (partial response or stable disease) was achieved by 64 percent of patients in the cabozantinib group compared with 33 percent of patients in the placebo group.In a subgroup analysis of patients whose only prior therapy for advanced HCC was sorafenib (70 percent of patients in the study)  median OS was 11.3 months with cabozantinib versus 7.2 months with placebo (HR 0.70  95 percent CI 0.55-0.88). Median PFS in the subgroup was 5.5 months with cabozantinib versus 1.9 months with placebo (HR 0.40  95 percent CI 0.32-0.50).Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of cabozantinib. The most common (≥10 percent) grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the cabozantinib group compared to the placebo group were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (17 percent vs. 0 percent)  hypertension (16 percent vs. 2 percent)  increased aspartate aminotransferase (12 percent vs. 7 percent)  fatigue (10 percent vs. 4 percent) and diarrhea (10 percent vs. 2 percent). Treatment-related grade 5 adverse events occurred in six patients in the cabozantinib group (hepatic failure  esophagobronchial fistula  portal vein thrombosis  upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage  pulmonary embolism and hepatorenal syndrome) and in one patient in the placebo group (hepatic failure). Sixteen percent of patients in the cabozantinib arm and three percent of patients in the placebo arm discontinued treatment due to treatment-related adverse events.ABOUT CELESTIALCELESTIAL is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled global phase 3 study of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib. The study was conducted at more than 100 sites globally in 19 countries. The trial was designed to enroll 760 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who previously received sorafenib and may have received up to two prior systemic cancer therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and had adequate liver function. Enrollment of the trial was completed in September 2017  and 773 patients were ultimately randomized. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 60 mg of cabozantinib once daily or placebo and were stratified based on etiology of the disease (hepatitis C  hepatitis B or other)  geographic region (Asia versus other regions) and presence of extrahepatic spread and/or macrovascular invasion (yes or no). No cross-over was allowed between the study arms.The primary endpoint for the trial is OS  and secondary endpoints include objective response rate and progression-free survival. Exploratory endpoints include patient-reported outcomes  biomarkers and safety.Based on available clinical trial data from various published trials conducted in the second-line setting of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)  the CELESTIAL trial statistics for the primary endpoint of OS assumed a median OS of 8.2 months for the placebo arm. A total of 621 events provide the study with 90 percent power to detect a 32 percent increase in median OS (HR = 0.76) at the final analysis. Two interim analyses were planned and conducted at 50 percent and 75 percent of the planned 621 events.CELESTIAL trial met its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS)  with cabozantinib providing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in median OS compared to placebo in patients with advanced HCC. The independent data monitoring committee for the study recommended that the trial should be stopped for efficacy following review of the second planned interim analysis. The safety data in the study were consistent with the established profile of cabozantinib.About HCCHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer in adults.2 The disease originates in cells called hepatocytes found in the liver. With approximately 800'000 new cases diagnosed each year  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.3 4 According to the GLOBOCAN data  it is estimated that across the European Union (EU-28) nearly 60'000 new patients will be diagnosed with liver cancer in 2020.5 Without treatment  patients with the disease in advanced stage usually survive between 4 and 8 months.6About CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib)Cabometyx® is an oral small molecule inhibitor of receptors  including VEGFR  MET  AXL and RET. In preclinical models  cabozantinib has been shown to inhibit the activity of these receptors  which are involved in normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as tumor angiogenesis  invasiveness  metastasis and drug resistance.In February of 2016  Exelixis and Ipsen jointly announced an exclusive licensing agreement for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib indications outside of the United States  Canada and Japan. This agreement was amended in December of 2016 to include commercialization rights for Ipsen in Canada.On April 25  2016  the FDA approved Cabometyx® tablets for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy and on September 9  2016  the European Commission approved Cabometyx® tablets for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in adults who have received prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy in the European Union  Norway and Iceland. Cabometyx® is available in 20 mg  40 mg or 60 mg doses. The recommended dose is 60 mg orally  once daily.On December 19  2017  Exelixis received approval from the FDA for Cabometyx® for the expanded indication of treatment of first-line advanced RCC .On May 17  2018  Ipsen announced that the European Commission approved Cabometyx® for the first-line treatment of adults with intermediate- or poor- risk advanced renal cell carcinomain the European Union  Norway and Iceland.Cabozantinib is not approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.ABOUT IPSENIpsen is a global specialty-driven biopharmaceutical group focused on innovation and specialty care.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect the Group's future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ""believes "" ""anticipates"" and ""expects"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including the Group's expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by the Group. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. The Group must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that the Group may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  the Group cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during pre-clinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances  new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development  including obtaining regulatory approval; the Group's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of the Group's patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. The Group also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to the Group's activities and financial results. The Group cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of the Group's partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on the Group's business  financial position or performance. The Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. The Group's business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to the Group's 2016 Registration Document available on its website (old.ipsen.com).References:Abou-Alfa  G  Meyer T  Cheng AL  et al.

In doing so  we managed to grow sales in both the B2B and B2C segment. This was realized with a strong growth in net cash position."" The turnover in the first half of the year includes the swim collection  which leads to a higher turnover compared to the second half of the year. Turnover and EBITDA on a comparable basis are the turnover and EBITDA adjusted for the effect of early deliveries in order to show the same seasons. In 2023  this adjustment was m€ 1.8  being the invoiced turnover in 2022 for deliveries of the 2023 summer collection  corrected with the invoiced turnover in 2023 H1 for deliveries of the 2023 winter collection. In 2022 this was a correction of m€ 3.0  being the invoiced turnover in 2021 for deliveries of the 2022 summer collection  corrected with the invoiced turnover in 2022 H1 for deliveries of the 2022 winter collection.

Nevertheless  Van de Velde continued its investments in an optichannel consumer experience during the first half of 2023. This led to a growth in comparable sales of 4.3%. In both segments  swim sales grew significantly for the second consecutive year.In the D2C segment there is a ""double-digit"" growth of 13.6% on a comparable basis thanks to investments in our brands.""double-digit"" growth of 13.6% on a comparable basis thanks to investments in our brands. The B2B segment grew less strongly (+2.2%) in the first half of the year  partly as a result of high inventory levels end 2022 at our independent retail partners. EBITDA On a comparable basis (including comparable seasonal deliveries)  consolidated EBITDA in 2023 H1 amounts to m€ 37.6 compared to m€ 37.8 in 2022 H1. The reported EBITDA increases by 1.5% in 2023 H1 from m€ 35.8 in 2022 H1 to m€ 36.3. The EBITDA on a comparable basis corresponds to 30.7% of the turnover compared to 32.2% in 2022 H1. This EBITDA is the result of a positive effect of a turnover increase  compensated by additional marketing expenses as well as higher write-downs of inventories. FINANCIAL RESULT The financial result amounts to -m€ 0.7 in 2023 H1 compared to -m€ 0.5 in 2022 H1. The difference of m€ 0.2 is mainly explained by: Profits and losses from conversions. These end m€ 0.4 lower than in 2022 H1.Financial revenues. These end m€ 0.2 higher than in 2022 H1 thanks to increased interest rates. (1) The B2B segment refers to sales realized at wholesale price.

AbobotulinumtoxinA: Evidence for Long Duration of Response from 5 Patient Populations is being shared during the TOXINS 2021 conference  which is taking place virtually between 16-17 January 2020 and is organized by the International Neurotoxin Association.1-28 Ipsen is sharing 26 abstracts during the congress  with data including updates from the recently published surveys into the experience of patients and caregivers  data from the Phase IV ULIS-III trial  and ten abstracts focused on basic science research into neurotoxins.1-27Spasticity is one of the most common and disabling conditions associated with many neurological conditions in adults and is characterized by velocity-dependent muscle hypertonia. Spasticity can lead to disabilities related to muscle stiffness  including impaired walking and hand use  pain  disfigurement and contractures.29The new analyses of pivotal Phase III clinical trial data included randomized clinical trials and respective open-label extensions to assess treatment intervals over repeat cycles of Dysport® in the management of cervical dystonia (CD)  adult lower-limb (ALL) and upper-limb (AUL) spasticity  and pediatric lower-limb (PLL) and upper-limb (PUL) spasticity. Flexible study designs allowed patients to be reinjected after week 12 (or  for PUL  week 16)  according to clinical need.1Results from the five patient populations highlighted that Dysport® offered a long duration of response when injected at the recommended and approved dose  with a large proportion of study patients not requiring retreatment for more than 12/16 weeks (% patients injected week-16 or later): in the CD study: 72.6-81.5%  ALL study: 20.1-32.0%  AUL study: 24.0-36.9%  PLL studies: 72.8-93.8%; (% children injected week-22 or later in PUL study: 19.6-67.0%) in the five pivotal studies of Dysport®  whilst safety outcomes were as expected.1The results observed in Ipsen's Phase III clinical studies were reinforced by real-world data from the ULIS-III observational study - the largest observational study investigating a structured approach to goal setting and outcome measurement.Dr. Alberto Esquenazi  Sheerr Gait and Motion Analysis Laboratory  MossRehab  U.S. and lead author of the research commented: ""Waning symptom relief can lead to pain and movement difficulties between treatments. These data showed the duration of response that Dysport® can offer to patients decreases the chance of patients experiencing symptomatic recurrence before the next injection.""""We are constantly striving to uncover new insights into the therapeutic use of botulinum toxins  including key aspects of treatment such as duration of response "" said Prof. Dr. Steven Hildemann  Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Head of Global Medical Affairs and Patient Safety  Ipsen. ""The breadth and depth of our data shared at TOXINS 2021 underscores Ipsen's commitment to advancing the science and understanding the real-world impact of spasticity and dystonia to deliver treatments with individual and clinical benefits.""Follow Ipsen on Twitter via @IpsenGroup and keep up to date with TOXINS 2021 news and updates by using the hashtag #ina_toxins.Overview of Ipsen presentations at TOXINS 2021 Congress:1-27Abstract title AbobotulinumtoxinA: Evidence for Long Duration of Response from 5 Patient PopulationsAlberto Esquenazi  Mauricio R.
