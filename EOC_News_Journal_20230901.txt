29579,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/582131-russia-foreign-investors-assets/,Russia may unblock accounts of investors from ‘friendly’ countries – RBK,Russia’s central bank is reportedly working to simplify the access of ‘friendly’ non-residents to the country’s financial market Read Full Article at RT.com,Over $2 billion in assets of international depositories has been frozen by Moscow in response to Western sanctionsRussia's central bank  The Bank of Russia (CBR)  is working on mechanisms that will unlock the accounts of depositories from ‘friendly’ states in order to allow foreign investors into the country’s financial market  business daily RBK reported on Thursday  citing its sources.Persons familiar with the matter explained to the outlet that investors from ‘friendly’ states (those that abstained from sanctions) at present cannot work on the Russian market because foreign depositories are “locked” in so-called C-type accounts.A C-type account is kept in rubles and cannot be opened in foreign currency or in a foreign financial institution. Meanwhile  the CBR is faced with the task of attracting more foreign investors to the market  the sources confided.“There is such a request from market participants  and the Central Bank is working with it ” one of the unnamed sources told RBK.The report noted that despite the fact that foreign investors’ accounts were completely blocked after the start of the military operation in Ukraine and the introduction of Western sanctions  they still had access to the Russian market.Investors from ‘friendly’ states can reportedly operate on the futures market and the bond market  and may make transactions with Russian shares  with the exception of securities of strategic importance and some other enterprises. All of that  however  is possible only if a non-resident is a client of a local broker  management company  or a bank. At the same time  such investors have to undergo the process of identification before gaining admission to trading.For the accounts of those non-residents who work via foreign depositories  the C-type-account mode applies  which means that crediting and debiting of securities is limited and it’s impossible to withdraw funds. An exception to this rule is valid only when working through a foreign depository registered in Belarus  according to the Central Bank.Russia froze the assets of international depositories last year in response to the seizure of its state funds by Western financial institutions. Moscow blocked 229.1 billion rubles ($2.3 billion) in assets belonging to Belgium’s Euroclear and Luxembourg’s Clearstream clearing houses  according to financial reports from Euroclear and Deutsche Börse Group.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.18,0.76,0.06,negative,0.02,0.32,0.66,True,English,"['friendly’ countries', 'Russia', 'accounts', 'investors', 'RBK', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'Clearstream clearing houses', 'A C-type account', 'Western financial institutions', 'foreign financial institution', 'business daily RBK', 'foreign investors’ accounts', 'financial reports', 'business section', 'financial market', 'C-type accounts', 'foreign currency', 'foreign depository', 'foreign depositories', 'Western sanctions', 'friendly’ states', 'military operation', 'Russian shares', 'strategic importance', 'other enterprises', 'local broker', 'management company', 'same time', 'C-type-account mode', 'Russian market', 'market participants', 'futures market', 'bond market', 'international depositories', 'central bank', 'The Bank', 'state funds', '229.1 billion rubles', 'unnamed sources', 'RBK.', 'assets', 'Moscow', 'response', 'CBR', 'mechanisms', 'order', 'country', 'Thursday', 'Persons', 'matter', 'outlet', 'task', 'request', 'fact', 'start', 'Ukraine', 'introduction', 'access', 'transactions', 'exception', 'securities', 'resident', 'client', 'process', 'identification', 'trading', 'non', 'crediting', 'debiting', 'rule', 'Belarus', 'seizure', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'Luxembourg', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-08-31,2023-09-01,rt.com

The international entity has been experimenting with blockchain technology  both private and public networks  and finally …,The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) announced a success with its integration with Chainlink (LINK). The international entity has been experimenting with blockchain technology  both private and public networks  and finally revealed the progress of its efforts.Chainlink To Improve International Payment Rails?Per an official statement  SWIFT claims that its infrastructure can “seamlessly” integrate with blockchain technology to enable users to transfer “tokenized value” across multiple networks. In that way  the international monetary system aims to reduce friction from these transfers and allow the tokenized asset markets to “scale globally.”A tokenized asset is a “real-world” asset  such as a stock  property  or commodity  whose value is linked to a digital asset. This process is intended to allow its users to easily trade them without the need for a third party to intermediate the transaction or for a third party to verify the value of the underlying asset.In theory  the tokenized asset market has the potential to be worth trillions of dollars  but its adoption has been relatively slow compared to cryptocurrencies. As mentioned  the partnership between SWIFT and Chainlink (LINK) seeks to change this trend.Data from a poll conducted by the financial institution indicates that over 97% of institutional investors believe that tokenization of real-world assets has the potential to “revolutionize asset management and be a positive force in the industry.”However  these institutional investors claim that blockchain-based projects must solve the interoperability issue to achieve this potential. The financial institution stated the following about their experiments with Chainlink:The experiments are part of Swift’s wider strategy to ensure secure  global interoperability as new technologies and platforms emerge. They build on work over the past few years to show how Swift infrastructure could support the financial community in interconnecting Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and other digital assets with new and existing payments systems.BNY Mellon  City  And Others Connect To EthereumFurther details provided by SWIFT revealed that major financial institutions worldwide participated in the experiments. Banks such as BNY Mellon  Citi  Euroclear  Lloyds Banking Group  SIX Digital Exchange (SDX)  etc.Moreover  SWIFT revealed that Chainlink was part of an experiment to create an “enterprise abstraction layer” to connect the international payment rails with the Ethereum blockchain. The participants leverage Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to connect both networks.The financial institution added:The experiments looked at the design and technical development of a solution and considerations around data privacy and governance  operational risk  and legal liability (…). Swift will continue to work with the financial community to understand the most concrete use cases for tokenised asset adoption and will prioritise its efforts accordingly. It is anticipated that the most compelling case  in the near term  will be in the secondary trading of non-listed assets and private markets.As of this writing  LINK trades at $5.9 with sideways movement over the past few days.Cover image from Unsplash  chart from Tradingview,neutral,0.21,0.78,0.01,negative,0.01,0.41,0.58,True,English,"['SWIFT', 'Crypto', 'Integration', 'Chainlink', 'Success', 'Central Bank Digital Currencies', 'Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications', 'existing payments systems', 'Lloyds Banking Group', 'SIX Digital Exchange', 'enterprise abstraction layer', 'concrete use cases', 'International Payment Rails', 'international monetary system', 'secure, global interoperability', 'Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol', 'major financial institutions', 'other digital assets', 'tokenized asset market', 'international entity', 'interoperability issue', 'financial community', 'real-world assets', 'listed assets', 'asset markets', 'real-world” asset', 'underlying asset', 'asset management', 'The Society', 'blockchain technology', 'official statement', 'third party', 'institutional investors', 'positive force', 'blockchain-based projects', 'wider strategy', 'BNY Mellon', 'Further details', 'technical development', 'operational risk', 'legal liability', 'compelling case', 'near term', 'secondary trading', 'sideways movement', 'Cover image', 'public networks', 'tokenized value', 'multiple networks', 'asset adoption', 'new technologies', 'Ethereum blockchain', 'data privacy', 'private markets', 'Swift infrastructure', 'success', 'integration', 'Chainlink', 'progress', 'efforts', 'users', 'friction', 'transfers', 'stock', 'property', 'commodity', 'process', 'need', 'transaction', 'theory', 'potential', 'trillions', 'dollars', 'cryptocurrencies', 'partnership', 'trend', 'poll', 'tokenization', 'industry', 'experiments', 'platforms', 'past', 'years', 'CBDCs', 'City', 'Others', 'Banks', 'Citi', 'Euroclear', 'SDX', 'participants', 'CCIP', 'design', 'solution', 'considerations', 'governance', 'tokenised', 'writing', 'days', 'Unsplash', 'chart', 'Tradingview']",2023-08-31,2023-09-01,bitcoinist.com

The Offer is welcomed by the Boards of RoodMicrotec as we consider it to be in the best interests of all RoodMicrotec stakeholders. In our view  the Offer represents a genuine recognition of RoodMicrotec’s reputation and expertise in the European semiconductor industry. The Transaction is fully in line with the strategy we pursued with RoodMicrotec for the last couple of years  to aim for autonomous growth while at the same time explore the semiconductor industry market and look for a significant larger ecosystem to join  supporting the future growth of RoodMicrotec  and we are thrilled to have found that ecosystem in a merger with Microtest  an entity that is backboned by Xenon with the strategy to invest in growth of such a larger ecosystem.”Martin Sallenhag  CEO of RoodMicrotec:“We are very excited to be able to take this next and very important step in the merger process with Microtest. The merger with Microtest and the expansion plan provided by Xenon will put the new entity in a very strong position to be a major player in the growing market in Europe. We are thrilled to be able to join on this journey towards something better for the future.I am convinced that this is a very good path forward for the customers and employees of RoodMicrotec since it enables a faster and stronger growth potential compared to a stand-alone company.”Franco Prestigiacomo  Chairman of Microtest and CEO of Xenon:“Today marks another step forward towards the realization of a highly synergistic combination of RoodMicrotec and Microtest. Following the announcement in June  we are pleased to see that the offer is supported by many existing Shareholders and all Warrant Holders. We are also thankful for the support of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board in this transaction.We look forward to working closely with them in further developing RoodMicrotec and Microtest by driving synergies and creating an integrated European group specialized in manufacturing ATE  OSAT and fabless microchips. Together with Microtest’s CEOs  Giuseppe Amelio and Moreno Lupi  we are highly committed to setting a clear path for our internationalexpansion strategy  which is only just beginning. As previously announced  our objective is to maintain the current RoodMicrotec corporate structure and to integrate the technologies of both companies better to ensure even better performance for our customers  which I expect will increase significantly after the closing of this transaction.”The OfferMicrotest is making the Offer on the terms and subject to the conditions and restrictions contained in the Offer Memorandum. Shareholders tendering their Shares under the Offer will be paid a cash amount of EUR 0.35 (cum dividend) per Share in consideration for each Share validly tendered and not withdrawn (or defectively tendered provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) and transferred (geleverd) to Microtest.The total value of the Offer for 100% of the Shares as at closing of the Offer (on a fully diluted basis  assuming all of the 7 485 000 outstanding Warrants are exercised immediately prior to the Closing Date) amounts to EUR 28.9 million. Microtest confirmed in the joint press release dated 13 June 2023 that it has funds readily available to finance the Offer. In this context  Microtest has received equity commitment letters from its shareholders  which are fully committed  and has an existing facility agreement with a pool of Italian financial institutions in place pursuant to which Microtest has a committed credit line available for mergers and acquisitions  which it will use to partly finance the Offer. Further details can be found in section 5.4 (Financing of the Offer) of the Offer Memorandum.Rationale for the OfferThe Transaction is the culmination of an extensive strategic review conducted by the RoodMicrotec Boards in the last couple of years  which concluded that RoodMicrotec’s growth potential is hampered by the relatively extensive costs and other non-business-related requirements of operating in a public environment as a listed entity. Also  the current size of RoodMicrotec does not allow substantial investments and capital expenditure in pursuit of strong growth  without obtaining considerable financial obligations. Becoming part of a larger ecosystem will give RoodMicrotec more ‘firepower’ to realise targeted growth and create a higher shareholder value.Microtest is a well-reputed player in designing and manufacturing automated test equipment and in providing testing services. It is an entity controlled by Seven Holding 3 S. à r.l.  a wholly owned subsidiary of the private equity fund Xenon Private Equity VII SCA SICAV RAIF (“Xenon”)  which is managed by Xenon AIFM S.A  a leading mid-cap private equity fund with 33+ years of experience and 175+ investments.RoodMicrotec believes the sustainable and long-term success of RoodMicrotec can be enhanced under Microtest’s ownership as it will be part of a larger ecosystem in the semiconductor industry. Microtest fully supports RoodMicrotec’s growth strategy maintaining the focus on RoodMicrotec’s chosen technologies and services. Furthermore  the aggregation of Microtest and RoodMicrotec will allow the companies to better serve their customers’ increasingly sophisticated needs and to be in a better position to deal with the complex and growing semiconductor market.With Microtest and Xenon  RoodMicrotec will have a financially sound owner  with a strong track record in supporting entrepreneurial businesses and a wealth of experience in the semiconductor industry. Moreover  operating without a public listing will increase the RoodMicrotec Group’s ability to achieve the goals and implement the actions of its strategy.Full and unanimous support and recommendation by the RoodMicrotecBoardsConsistent with their fiduciary responsibilities  the RoodMicrotec Boards have followed a thorough and careful process in which they have frequently monitored and discussed the developments.Also consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities  the RoodMicrotec Boards  with the support of their outside financial and legal advisors  have given careful consideration to all relevant aspects of the Transaction  including the rationale for the Transaction  the interests of all of RoodMicrotec’s stakeholders  the Offer Price  the Non-Financial Covenants (as defined below) and other terms of the Transaction.

Settlement will only take place if the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan).Post-Acceptance PeriodIn the event that Microtest announces that the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan)  Microtest shall  in accordance with Article 17 of the Decree  within three (3) Business Days after declaring the Offer unconditional  publicly announce a Post-Acceptance Period(na-aanmeldingstermijn) of two (2) weeks to enable Shareholders who did not tender their Shares during the Offer Period to tender their Shares under the same terms and conditions as the Offer (including the terms and conditions set out in section 4.3 (Acceptance by Shareholders) of the Offer Memorandum).In the Post-Acceptance Period  Shareholders who hold their Shares through an Admitted Institution are requested to make their acceptance known through their custodian  bank or stockbroker no later than 17:40 hours CEST on the last Business Day of the Post-Acceptance Period. The custodian  bank or stockbroker may set an earlier deadline for communication by Shareholders in order to permit the custodian  bank or stockbroker to communicate its acceptances to the Settlement Agent in a timely manner.

This belief is based  inter alia  on:the fact that having a single shareholder and operating without a public listing increases the RoodMicrotec Group's ability to achieve the goals and implement the actions of its strategy and reduces the RoodMicrotec Group's costs;the ability of RoodMicrotec and Microtest to terminate the listing of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  and all resulting cost savings therefrom;the ability to achieve an efficient capital structure (both from a tax and financing perspective);the ability to implement and focus on achieving long-term strategic goals of RoodMicrotec  as opposed to short-term performance driven by periodic reporting obligations; andas part of long-term strategic objectives the ability to focus on pursuing and supporting (by providing access to equity and debt capital) continued buy-and-build acquisition opportunities as and when they arise.Buy-OutMicrotest and RoodMicrotec will seek to procure the delisting of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  as soon as practicable after the ending of the Post-Acceptance Period.If  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds at least 95% of the Shares  Microtest will as soon as possible commence the Buy-Out.Post-Closing RestructuringIf  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds less than 95%  but at least 80% of the Shares (excluding  for the avoidance of doubt  any Shares held by RoodMicrotec or any of its Group Companies)  Microtest intends to acquire the entire business of the RoodMicrotec Group for an amount equal to the Offer Price  pursuant to:a legal triangular merger of the RoodMicrotec Group into a newly incorporated wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of RoodMicrotec  RoodMicrotec B.V.  with a newly incorporated wholly-owned direct subsidiary of RoodMicrotec  RoodMicrotec Holding B.V. (“ RoodMicrotec Holding ”)  the sole shareholder of RoodMicrotec B.V.  allotting shares to holders of the Shares in a 1:1 exchange ratio and upon which RoodMicrotec will cease to exist and the Shares’ admission to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam will terminate (the “ Triangular Merger ”) 1 ;”)  the sole shareholder of RoodMicrotec B.V.  allotting shares to holders of the Shares in a 1:1 exchange ratio and upon which RoodMicrotec will cease to exist and the Shares’ admission to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam will terminate (the “ ”) ; a subsequent share sale pursuant to which RoodMicrotec Holding will sell and transfer the outstanding RoodMicrotec B.V. share(s) to Microtest (the “ Share Sale ”); and”); and a subsequent dissolution and liquidation of RoodMicrotec Holding (the “Liquidation” and  together with the Triangular Merger and the Share Sale  the “Post-Closing Restructuring”).Microtest will  with the cooperation of RoodMicrotec  ensure that the liquidator of RoodMicrotec Holding arranges for an advance liquidation distribution to the shareholders of RoodMicrotec Holding  which is intended to take place on or about the date of the closing of the Share Sale and will result in a payment per share equal to the Offer Price  without any interest and less applicable withholding taxes or other taxes. The Post-Closing Restructuring is subject to the approval of the General Meeting  which will be sought at the General Meeting.If  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds less than 95% of the Shares  Microtest may effect or cause to effect other restructurings of the RoodMicrotec Group for the purpose of achieving an optimal operational  legal  financial or fiscal structure  all in accordance with applicable laws and the terms of the Merger Agreement.Liquidity and delistingThe purchase of Shares by Microtest pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of Shareholders  as well as the number of Shares that might otherwise be traded publicly. As a result the liquidity and market value of the Shares that were not tendered under the Offer  or were tendered and validly withdrawn  may be adversely affected. Microtest does not intend to compensate for such adverse effect by  for example  setting up a liquidity mechanism for the Shares that are not tendered following the Settlement Date and the Post-Acceptance Period.Should the Offer be declared unconditional  Microtest and RoodMicrotec intend to procure the delisting of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam as soon as possible under Applicable Laws. This may further adversely affect the liquidity and market value of any Shares not tendered.If Microtest acquires 95% or more of the Shares  it will be able to procure delisting of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam in accordance with applicable (policy) rules. However  the listing of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam will also terminate after a successful Legal Merger as set out in section 5.15.3 (Post-Closing Restructuring) of the Offer Memorandum or any other measures or procedures set out in section 5.15 (Post Closing Restructurings) of the Offer Memorandum.AnnouncementsAny announcements in relation to the Offer will be issued by means of a press release.

We are extremely pleased that  with the unanimous support of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management of RoodMicrotec and also supported by many existing Shareholders and all our Warrant Holders  the transaction with Microtest has been launched today. The Offer is welcomed by the Boards of RoodMicrotec as we consider it to be in the best interests of all RoodMicrotec stakeholders. In our view  the Offer represents a genuine recognition of RoodMicrotec’s reputation and expertise in the European semiconductor industry. The Transaction is fully in line with the strategy we pursued with RoodMicrotec for the last couple of years  to aim for autonomous growth while at the same time explore the semiconductor industry market and look for a significant larger ecosystem to join  supporting the future growth of RoodMicrotec  and we are thrilled to have found that ecosystem in a merger with Microtest  an entity that is backboned by Xenon with the strategy to invest in growth of such a larger ecosystem.”Martin Sallenhag  CEO of RoodMicrotec:“We are very excited to be able to take this next and very important step in the merger process with Microtest. The merger with Microtest and the expansion plan provided by Xenon will put the new entity in a very strong position to be a major player in the growing market in Europe. We are thrilled to be able to join on this journey towards something better for the future. I am convinced that this is a very good path forward for the customers and employees of RoodMicrotec since it enables a faster and stronger growth potential compared to a stand-alone company.”Franco Prestigiacomo  Chairman of Microtest and CEO of Xenon:“Today marks another step forward towards the realization of a highly synergistic combination of RoodMicrotec and Microtest. Following the announcement in June  we are pleased to see that the offer is supported by many existing Shareholders and all Warrant Holders. We are also thankful for the support of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board in this transaction. We look forward to working closely with them in further developing RoodMicrotec and Microtest by driving synergies and creating an integrated European group specialized in manufacturing ATE  OSAT and fabless microchips. Together with Microtest’s CEOs  Giuseppe Amelio and Moreno Lupi  we are highly committed to setting a clear path for our international expansion strategy  which is only just beginning. As previously announced  our objective is to maintain the current RoodMicrotec corporate structure and to integrate the technologies of both companies better to ensure even better performance for our customers  which I expect will increase significantly after the closing of this transaction.”The OfferMicrotest is making the Offer on the terms and subject to the conditions and restrictions contained in the Offer Memorandum. Shareholders tendering their Shares under the Offer will be paid a cash amount of EUR 0.35 (cum dividend) per Share in consideration for each Share validly tendered and not withdrawn (or defectively tendered provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) and transferred (geleverd) to Microtest.The total value of the Offer for 100% of the Shares as at closing of the Offer (on a fully diluted basis  assuming all of the 7 485 000 outstanding Warrants are exercised immediately prior to the Closing Date) amounts to EUR 28.9 million. Microtest confirmed in the joint press release dated 13 June 2023 that it has funds readily available to finance the Offer. In this context  Microtest has received equity commitment letters from its shareholders  which are fully committed  and has an existing facility agreement with a pool of Italian financial institutions in place pursuant to which Microtest has a committed credit line available for mergers and acquisitions  which it will use to partly finance the Offer. Further details can be found in section 5.4 (Financing of the Offer) of the Offer Memorandum.Rationale for the OfferThe Transaction is the culmination of an extensive strategic review conducted by the RoodMicrotec Boards in the last couple of years  which concluded that RoodMicrotec’s growth potential is hampered by the relatively extensive costs and other non-business-related requirements of operating in a public environment as a listed entity. Also  the current size of RoodMicrotec does not allow substantial investments and capital expenditure in pursuit of strong growth  without obtaining considerable financial obligations. Becoming part of a larger ecosystem will give RoodMicrotec more ‘firepower’ to realise targeted growth and create a higher shareholder value.Microtest is a well-reputed player in designing and manufacturing automated test equipment and in providing testing services. It is an entity controlled by Seven Holding 3 S. à r.l.  a wholly owned subsidiary of the private equity fund Xenon Private Equity VII SCA SICAV RAIF (“Xenon”)  which is managed by Xenon AIFM S.A  a leading mid-cap private equity fund with 33+ years of experience and 175+ investments.RoodMicrotec believes the sustainable and long-term success of RoodMicrotec can be enhanced under Microtest’s ownership as it will be part of a larger ecosystem in the semiconductor industry. Microtest fully supports RoodMicrotec’s growth strategy maintaining the focus on RoodMicrotec’s chosen technologies and services. Furthermore  the aggregation of Microtest and RoodMicrotec will allow the companies to better serve their customers’ increasingly sophisticated needs and to be in a better position to deal with the complex and growing semiconductor market.With Microtest and Xenon  RoodMicrotec will have a financially sound owner  with a strong track record in supporting entrepreneurial businesses and a wealth of experience in the semiconductor industry. Moreover  operating without a public listing will increase the RoodMicrotec Group’s ability to achieve the goals and implement the actions of its strategy.Full and unanimous support and recommendation by the RoodMicrotec BoardsConsistent with their fiduciary responsibilities  the RoodMicrotec Boards have followed a thorough and careful process in which they have frequently monitored and discussed the developments.Also consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities  the RoodMicrotec Boards  with the support of their outside financial and legal advisors  have given careful consideration to all relevant aspects of the Transaction  including the rationale for the Transaction  the interests of all of RoodMicrotec’s stakeholders  the Offer Price  the Non-Financial Covenants (as defined below) and other terms of the Transaction. After due and careful consideration  the RoodMicrotec Boards consider the Transaction to be in the best interest of RoodMicrotec and to promote the sustainable success of its business  taking into account the interests of all its stakeholders.Accordingly  the RoodMicrotec Boards have unanimously resolved to support the Transaction  recommend the Offer for acceptance by the Shareholders and recommend to the Shareholders to vote in favour of the Resolutions at the General Meeting  to be held on 19 October 2023  each in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement (the “Recommendation”).

At the date of the Offer Memorandum  Microtest does not anticipate any such extension. In the event a third party makes or announces a competing offer for the Shares prior to the expiry of the Offer Period (whether or not extended pursuant to Article 15  paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of the Decree)  Microtest may extend the Offer Period at its own discretion in accordance with Article 15  paragraph 5 of the Decree to the end of the offer period of such competing offer. Further extensions are subject to an exemption from the AFM.If Microtest decides to request an exemption from the AFM it may  subject to receipt of such exemption  extend the Offer Period until such time as Microtest reasonably believes is necessary to cause the Offer Conditions to be satisfied  but no later than the Long Stop Date. If no exemption is granted by the AFM while not all Offer Conditions have been satisfied before the end of the extended Offer Period (and if such Offer Condition(s) has or have not been waived to the extent legally permitted in accordance with section 5.5.2 (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum)  the Offer will be terminated as a consequence of such Offer Condition(s) not having been satisfied or waived on or before the Unconditional Date.In the event of any extension  all references in the Offer Memorandum to 17:40 hours CEST on the Closing Date shall  unless the context requires otherwise  be changed to the latest date and time to which the Offer Period has been so extended.If the Offer Period is extended  so that the obligation pursuant to Article 16 of the Decree to announce whether the Offer is declared unconditional is postponed  a public announcement to that effect will be made ultimately on the third Business Day following the initial Closing Date in accordance with the provisions of Article 15  paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of the Decree. If Microtest extends the Offer Period  the Offer will expire on the latest time and date to which Microtest extends the Offer Period.During an extension of the Offer Period  any Shares previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain subject to the Offer  subject to the right of each Shareholder to withdraw the Shares he or she has already tendered in accordance with section 4.3.5 (Withdrawal rights) of the Offer Memorandum.Declaring the Offer unconditionalThe obligation of Microtest to declare the Offer unconditional is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions. Reference is made to section 5.5 (Offer Conditions  waiver and satisfaction) of the Offer Memorandum. The Offer Conditions may be waived  to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws  as set out in section 5.5.2 (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum. If Microtest or RoodMicrotec  or each of Microtest and RoodMicrotec  as applicable  wholly or partly waive one or more Offer Conditions according to section 5.5.2 (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum  Microtest will inform the Shareholders as required by the Applicable Laws.No later than on the Unconditional Date (i.e. the third Business Day following the Closing Date) Microtest will determine whether the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived as set out in section 5.5 (Offer Conditions  waiver and satisfaction) of the Offer Memorandum  to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws. In addition  Microtest will announce on the Unconditional Date whether (i) the Offer is declared unconditional  (ii) the Offer will be extended in accordance with Article 15 of the Decree  or (iii) the Offer is terminated as a result of the Offer Conditions set out in section 5.5.1 (Offer Conditions) of the Offer Memorandum not having been satisfied or waived  all in accordance with section 5.5.2 (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum and section 5.8 (Satisfaction) of the Offer Memorandum  Article 16 of the Decree and the provisions of the Merger Agreement. In the event that the Offer is not declared unconditional  Microtest will explain such decision.In the event that Microtest announces that the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan)  Microtest will accept all Tendered Shares and shall announce a Post-Acceptance Period (na-aanmeldingstermijn) as set out in section 4.8 (Post-Acceptance Period) of the Offer Memorandum.SettlementIn the event that Microtest announces that the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan)  Shareholders who have validly tendered (or defectively tendered provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) and transferred (geleverd) their Shares for acceptance pursuant to the Offer on or prior to the Closing Date will receive within three (3) Business Days following the Unconditional Date the Offer Price in respect of each Tendered Share  as of which moment dissolution or annulment of a Shareholder’s tender or transfer (levering) shall not be permitted. Settlement will only take place if the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan).Post-Acceptance PeriodIn the event that Microtest announces that the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan)  Microtest shall  in accordance with Article 17 of the Decree  within three (3) Business Days after declaring the Offer unconditional  publicly announce a Post-Acceptance Period(na-aanmeldingstermijn) of two (2) weeks to enable Shareholders who did not tender their Shares during the Offer Period to tender their Shares under the same terms and conditions as the Offer (including the terms and conditions set out in section 4.3 (Acceptance by Shareholders) of the Offer Memorandum).In the Post-Acceptance Period  Shareholders who hold their Shares through an Admitted Institution are requested to make their acceptance known through their custodian  bank or stockbroker no later than 17:40 hours CEST on the last Business Day of the Post-Acceptance Period. The custodian  bank or stockbroker may set an earlier deadline for communication by Shareholders in order to permit the custodian  bank or stockbroker to communicate its acceptances to the Settlement Agent in a timely manner. Accordingly  Shareholders holding Shares through a financial intermediary should comply with the dates communicated by such financial intermediary  as such dates may differ from the dates and times noted in the Offer Memorandum.Microtest will publicly announce the results of the Post-Acceptance Period and the total amount and total percentage of Shares held by it in accordance with Article 17  paragraph 4 of the Decree ultimately on the third Business Day following the last day of the Post-Acceptance Period. Microtest shall continue to accept for payment all Shares validly tendered (or defectively tendered  provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) during such Post-Acceptance Period and shall pay for such Shares as soon as reasonably possible and in any case no later than on the third Business Day following the last day of the Post-Acceptance Period.During the Post-Acceptance Period  Shareholders have no right to withdraw Shares from the Offer  whether validly tendered (or defectively tendered  provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) during the Offer Period or during the Post-Acceptance Period.In the event any Distribution on the Shares is declared by RoodMicrotec prior to the settlement date of the Shares tendered in the Post-Acceptance Period whereby the record date for entitlement to such Distribution is prior to such settlement date  the Offer Price will be decreased by the full amount of any such Distribution made by RoodMicrotec in respect of each Share (before any applicable withholding tax).Post-Closing Restructurings - GeneralMicrotest and RoodMicrotec believe that having the RoodMicrotec Group operate in a wholly-owned set up without a listing on Euronext Amsterdam is better for the sustainable success of its business and long-term value creation. This belief is based  inter alia  on:the fact that having a single shareholder and operating without a public listing increases the RoodMicrotec Group's ability to achieve the goals and implement the actions of its strategy and reduces the RoodMicrotec Group's costs;the ability of RoodMicrotec and Microtest to terminate the listing of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  and all resulting cost savings therefrom;the ability to achieve an efficient capital structure (both from a tax and financing perspective);the ability to implement and focus on achieving long-term strategic goals of RoodMicrotec  as opposed to short-term performance driven by periodic reporting obligations; andas part of long-term strategic objectives the ability to focus on pursuing and supporting (by providing access to equity and debt capital) continued buy-and-build acquisition opportunities as and when they arise.Buy-OutMicrotest and RoodMicrotec will seek to procure the delisting of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  as soon as practicable after the ending of the Post-Acceptance Period.If  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds at least 95% of the Shares  Microtest will as soon as possible commence the Buy-Out.Post-Closing RestructuringIf  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds less than 95%  but at least 80% of the Shares (excluding  for the avoidance of doubt  any Shares held by RoodMicrotec or any of its Group Companies)  Microtest intends to acquire the entire business of the RoodMicrotec Group for an amount equal to the Offer Price  pursuant to:a legal triangular merger of the RoodMicrotec Group into a newly incorporated wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of RoodMicrotec  RoodMicrotec B.V.  with a newly incorporated wholly-owned direct subsidiary of RoodMicrotec  RoodMicrotec Holding B.V. (“ RoodMicrotec Holding ”)  the sole shareholder of RoodMicrotec B.V.  allotting shares to holders of the Shares in a 1:1 exchange ratio and upon which RoodMicrotec will cease to exist and the Shares’ admission to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam will terminate (the “ Triangular Merger ”) 1 ;”)  the sole shareholder of RoodMicrotec B.V.  allotting shares to holders of the Shares in a 1:1 exchange ratio and upon which RoodMicrotec will cease to exist and the Shares’ admission to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam will terminate (the “ ”) ; a subsequent share sale pursuant to which RoodMicrotec Holding will sell and transfer the outstanding RoodMicrotec B.V. share(s) to Microtest (the “ Share Sale ”); and”); and a subsequent dissolution and liquidation of RoodMicrotec Holding (the “Liquidation” and  together with the Triangular Merger and the Share Sale  the “Post-Closing Restructuring”).Microtest will  with the cooperation of RoodMicrotec  ensure that the liquidator of RoodMicrotec Holding arranges for an advance liquidation distribution to the shareholders of RoodMicrotec Holding  which is intended to take place on or about the date of the closing of the Share Sale and will result in a payment per share equal to the Offer Price  without any interest and less applicable withholding taxes or other taxes. The Post-Closing Restructuring is subject to the approval of the General Meeting  which will be sought at the General Meeting.If  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds less than 95% of the Shares  Microtest may effect or cause to effect other restructurings of the RoodMicrotec Group for the purpose of achieving an optimal operational  legal  financial or fiscal structure  all in accordance with applicable laws and the terms of the Merger Agreement.Liquidity and delistingThe purchase of Shares by Microtest pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of Shareholders  as well as the number of Shares that might otherwise be traded publicly. As a result the liquidity and market value of the Shares that were not tendered under the Offer  or were tendered and validly withdrawn  may be adversely affected. Microtest does not intend to compensate for such adverse effect by  for example  setting up a liquidity mechanism for the Shares that are not tendered following the Settlement Date and the Post-Acceptance Period.Should the Offer be declared unconditional  Microtest and RoodMicrotec intend to procure the delisting of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam as soon as possible under Applicable Laws. This may further adversely affect the liquidity and market value of any Shares not tendered.If Microtest acquires 95% or more of the Shares  it will be able to procure delisting of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam in accordance with applicable (policy) rules. However  the listing of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam will also terminate after a successful Legal Merger as set out in section 5.15.3 (Post-Closing Restructuring) of the Offer Memorandum or any other measures or procedures set out in section 5.15 (Post Closing Restructurings) of the Offer Memorandum.AnnouncementsAny announcements in relation to the Offer will be issued by means of a press release.

We are extremely pleased that  with the unanimous support of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management of RoodMicrotec and also supported by many existing Shareholders and all our Warrant Holders  the transaction with Microtest has been launched today. The Offer is welcomed by the Boards of RoodMicrotec as we consider it to be in the best interests of all RoodMicrotec stakeholders. In our view  the Offer represents a genuine recognition of RoodMicrotec’s reputation and expertise in the European semiconductor industry. The Transaction is fully in line with the strategy we pursued with RoodMicrotec for the last couple of years  to aim for autonomous growth while at the same time explore the semiconductor industry market and look for a significant larger ecosystem to join  supporting the future growth of RoodMicrotec  and we are thrilled to have found that ecosystem in a merger with Microtest  an entity that is backboned by Xenon with the strategy to invest in growth of such a larger ecosystem.”Martin Sallenhag  CEO of RoodMicrotec:“We are very excited to be able to take this next and very important step in the merger process with Microtest. The merger with Microtest and the expansion plan provided by Xenon will put the new entity in a very strong position to be a major player in the growing market in Europe. We are thrilled to be able to join on this journey towards something better for the future. I am convinced that this is a very good path forward for the customers and employees of RoodMicrotec since it enables a faster and stronger growth potential compared to a stand-alone company.”Franco Prestigiacomo  Chairman of Microtest and CEO of Xenon:“Today marks another step forward towards the realization of a highly synergistic combination of RoodMicrotec and Microtest. Following the announcement in June  we are pleased to see that the offer is supported by many existing Shareholders and all Warrant Holders. We are also thankful for the support of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board in this transaction. We look forward to working closely with them in further developing RoodMicrotec and Microtest by driving synergies and creating an integrated European group specialized in manufacturing ATE  OSAT and fabless microchips. Together with Microtest’s CEOs  Giuseppe Amelio and Moreno Lupi  we are highly committed to setting a clear path for our international expansion strategy  which is only just beginning. As previously announced  our objective is to maintain the current RoodMicrotec corporate structure and to integrate the technologies of both companies better to ensure even better performance for our customers  which I expect will increase significantly after the closing of this transaction.”The OfferMicrotest is making the Offer on the terms and subject to the conditions and restrictions contained in the Offer Memorandum. Shareholders tendering their Shares under the Offer will be paid a cash amount of EUR 0.35 (cum dividend) per Share in consideration for each Share validly tendered and not withdrawn (or defectively tendered provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) and transferred (geleverd) to Microtest.The total value of the Offer for 100% of the Shares as at closing of the Offer (on a fully diluted basis  assuming all of the 7 485 000 outstanding Warrants are exercised immediately prior to the Closing Date) amounts to EUR 28.9 million. Microtest confirmed in the joint press release dated 13 June 2023 that it has funds readily available to finance the Offer. In this context  Microtest has received equity commitment letters from its shareholders  which are fully committed  and has an existing facility agreement with a pool of Italian financial institutions in place pursuant to which Microtest has a committed credit line available for mergers and acquisitions  which it will use to partly finance the Offer. Further details can be found in section 5.4 (Financing of the Offer) of the Offer Memorandum.Rationale for the OfferThe Transaction is the culmination of an extensive strategic review conducted by the RoodMicrotec Boards in the last couple of years  which concluded that RoodMicrotec’s growth potential is hampered by the relatively extensive costs and other non-business-related requirements of operating in a public environment as a listed entity. Also  the current size of RoodMicrotec does not allow substantial investments and capital expenditure in pursuit of strong growth  without obtaining considerable financial obligations. Becoming part of a larger ecosystem will give RoodMicrotec more ‘firepower’ to realise targeted growth and create a higher shareholder value.Microtest is a well-reputed player in designing and manufacturing automated test equipment and in providing testing services. It is an entity controlled by Seven Holding 3 S. à r.l.  a wholly owned subsidiary of the private equity fund Xenon Private Equity VII SCA SICAV RAIF (“Xenon”)  which is managed by Xenon AIFM S.A  a leading mid-cap private equity fund with 33+ years of experience and 175+ investments.RoodMicrotec believes the sustainable and long-term success of RoodMicrotec can be enhanced under Microtest’s ownership as it will be part of a larger ecosystem in the semiconductor industry. Microtest fully supports RoodMicrotec’s growth strategy maintaining the focus on RoodMicrotec’s chosen technologies and services. Furthermore  the aggregation of Microtest and RoodMicrotec will allow the companies to better serve their customers’ increasingly sophisticated needs and to be in a better position to deal with the complex and growing semiconductor market.With Microtest and Xenon  RoodMicrotec will have a financially sound owner  with a strong track record in supporting entrepreneurial businesses and a wealth of experience in the semiconductor industry. Moreover  operating without a public listing will increase the RoodMicrotec Group’s ability to achieve the goals and implement the actions of its strategy.Full and unanimous support and recommendation by the RoodMicrotec BoardsConsistent with their fiduciary responsibilities  the RoodMicrotec Boards have followed a thorough and careful process in which they have frequently monitored and discussed the developments.Also consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities  the RoodMicrotec Boards  with the support of their outside financial and legal advisors  have given careful consideration to all relevant aspects of the Transaction  including the rationale for the Transaction  the interests of all of RoodMicrotec’s stakeholders  the Offer Price  the Non-Financial Covenants (as defined below) and other terms of the Transaction. After due and careful consideration  the RoodMicrotec Boards consider the Transaction to be in the best interest of RoodMicrotec and to promote the sustainable success of its business  taking into account the interests of all its stakeholders.Accordingly  the RoodMicrotec Boards have unanimously resolved to support the Transaction  recommend the Offer for acceptance by the Shareholders and recommend to the Shareholders to vote in favour of the Resolutions at the General Meeting  to be held on 19 October 2023  each in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement (the “Recommendation”).

Settlement will only take place if the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan).Post-Acceptance PeriodIn the event that Microtest announces that the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan)  Microtest shall  in accordance with Article 17 of the Decree  within three (3) Business Days after declaring the Offer unconditional  publicly announce a Post-Acceptance Period(na-aanmeldingstermijn) of two (2) weeks to enable Shareholders who did not tender their Shares during the Offer Period to tender their Shares under the same terms and conditions as the Offer (including the terms and conditions set out in section 4.3 (Acceptance by Shareholders) of the Offer Memorandum).In the Post-Acceptance Period  Shareholders who hold their Shares through an Admitted Institution are requested to make their acceptance known through their custodian  bank or stockbroker no later than 17:40 hours CEST on the last Business Day of the Post-Acceptance Period. The custodian  bank or stockbroker may set an earlier deadline for communication by Shareholders in order to permit the custodian  bank or stockbroker to communicate its acceptances to the Settlement Agent in a timely manner.

This belief is based  inter alia  on:the fact that having a single shareholder and operating without a public listing increases the RoodMicrotec Group's ability to achieve the goals and implement the actions of its strategy and reduces the RoodMicrotec Group's costs;the ability of RoodMicrotec and Microtest to terminate the listing of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  and all resulting cost savings therefrom;the ability to achieve an efficient capital structure (both from a tax and financing perspective);the ability to implement and focus on achieving long-term strategic goals of RoodMicrotec  as opposed to short-term performance driven by periodic reporting obligations; andas part of long-term strategic objectives the ability to focus on pursuing and supporting (by providing access to equity and debt capital) continued buy-and-build acquisition opportunities as and when they arise.Buy-OutMicrotest and RoodMicrotec will seek to procure the delisting of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  as soon as practicable after the ending of the Post-Acceptance Period.If  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds at least 95% of the Shares  Microtest will as soon as possible commence the Buy-Out.Post-Closing RestructuringIf  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds less than 95%  but at least 80% of the Shares (excluding  for the avoidance of doubt  any Shares held by RoodMicrotec or any of its Group Companies)  Microtest intends to acquire the entire business of the RoodMicrotec Group for an amount equal to the Offer Price  pursuant to:a legal triangular merger of the RoodMicrotec Group into a newly incorporated wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of RoodMicrotec  RoodMicrotec B.V.  with a newly incorporated wholly-owned direct subsidiary of RoodMicrotec  RoodMicrotec Holding B.V. (“ RoodMicrotec Holding ”)  the sole shareholder of RoodMicrotec B.V.  allotting shares to holders of the Shares in a 1:1 exchange ratio and upon which RoodMicrotec will cease to exist and the Shares’ admission to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam will terminate (the “ Triangular Merger ”) 1 ;”)  the sole shareholder of RoodMicrotec B.V.  allotting shares to holders of the Shares in a 1:1 exchange ratio and upon which RoodMicrotec will cease to exist and the Shares’ admission to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam will terminate (the “ ”) ; a subsequent share sale pursuant to which RoodMicrotec Holding will sell and transfer the outstanding RoodMicrotec B.V. share(s) to Microtest (the “ Share Sale ”); and”); and a subsequent dissolution and liquidation of RoodMicrotec Holding (the “Liquidation” and  together with the Triangular Merger and the Share Sale  the “Post-Closing Restructuring”).Microtest will  with the cooperation of RoodMicrotec  ensure that the liquidator of RoodMicrotec Holding arranges for an advance liquidation distribution to the shareholders of RoodMicrotec Holding  which is intended to take place on or about the date of the closing of the Share Sale and will result in a payment per share equal to the Offer Price  without any interest and less applicable withholding taxes or other taxes. The Post-Closing Restructuring is subject to the approval of the General Meeting  which will be sought at the General Meeting.If  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds less than 95% of the Shares  Microtest may effect or cause to effect other restructurings of the RoodMicrotec Group for the purpose of achieving an optimal operational  legal  financial or fiscal structure  all in accordance with applicable laws and the terms of the Merger Agreement.Liquidity and delistingThe purchase of Shares by Microtest pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of Shareholders  as well as the number of Shares that might otherwise be traded publicly. As a result the liquidity and market value of the Shares that were not tendered under the Offer  or were tendered and validly withdrawn  may be adversely affected.

Meanwhile  the CBR is faced with the task of attracting more foreign investors to the market  the sources confided.“There is such a request from market participants  and the Central Bank is working with it ” one of the unnamed sources told RBK.The report noted that despite the fact that foreign investors’ accounts were completely blocked after the start of the military operation in Ukraine and the introduction of Western sanctions  they still had access to the Russian market.Investors from ‘friendly’ states can reportedly operate on the futures market and the bond market  and may make transactions with Russian shares  with the exception of securities of strategic importance and some other enterprises. All of that  however  is possible only if a non-resident is a client of a local broker  management company  or a bank. At the same time  such investors have to undergo the process of identification before gaining admission to trading.For the accounts of those non-residents who work via foreign depositories  the C-type-account mode applies  which means that crediting and debiting of securities is limited and it’s impossible to withdraw funds. An exception to this rule is valid only when working through a foreign depository registered in Belarus  according to the Central Bank.Russia froze the assets of international depositories last year in response to the seizure of its state funds by Western financial institutions. Moscow blocked 229.1 billion rubles ($2.3 billion) in assets belonging to Belgium’s Euroclear and Luxembourg’s Clearstream clearing houses  according to financial reports from Euroclear and Deutsche Börse Group.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.18,0.76,0.06,negative,0.02,0.32,0.66,True,English,"['friendly’ countries', 'Russia', 'accounts', 'investors', 'RBK', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'Clearstream clearing houses', 'A C-type account', 'Western financial institutions', 'foreign financial institution', 'business daily RBK', 'foreign investors’ accounts', 'financial reports', 'business section', 'financial market', 'C-type accounts', 'foreign currency', 'foreign depository', 'foreign depositories', 'Western sanctions', 'friendly’ states', 'military operation', 'Russian shares', 'strategic importance', 'other enterprises', 'local broker', 'management company', 'same time', 'C-type-account mode', 'Russian market', 'market participants', 'futures market', 'bond market', 'international depositories', 'central bank', 'The Bank', 'state funds', '229.1 billion rubles', 'unnamed sources', 'RBK.', 'assets', 'Moscow', 'response', 'CBR', 'mechanisms', 'order', 'country', 'Thursday', 'Persons', 'matter', 'outlet', 'task', 'request', 'fact', 'start', 'Ukraine', 'introduction', 'access', 'transactions', 'exception', 'securities', 'resident', 'client', 'process', 'identification', 'trading', 'non', 'crediting', 'debiting', 'rule', 'Belarus', 'seizure', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'Luxembourg', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-08-31,2023-09-01,rt.com

The proceeds of this financing will contribute to the development of lanifibranor and extend our cash runway beyond two key milestones: the recruitment of the last patient of our pivotal phase III clinical trial in NASH expected before the end of the year and the publication of the results of the trial combining lanifibranor with SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin expected for the first quarter of 2024.""Reasons for the issuance and use of the proceeds of the TransactionThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Capital Increase  together with its available cash  according to the following:95% of the net proceeds for the Phase III evaluation of lanifibranor in the treatment of patients suffering from NASH; and5% of the net proceeds for its other pre-clinical and clinical programs  in particular Yap-Tead  as well as for general corporate purposes.In the Company's opinion  before the Capital Increase and the issuance of the Royalty Certificates  the Company's net working capital is not sufficient to meet its obligations over the next twelve months. As of June 30  20231  the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are estimated to be €31.2 million  short-term deposits to €0.05 million2  and long-term deposits to €9.3 million3  compared to €86.7 million  €1.0 million and €0.7 million as of December 31  2022. This cash position enables the Group to continue its activities until end of fourth quarter 2023.To cover its obligations until the end of August 2024  based on its current business plan  the Company estimates that its additional cash requirements will amount to €80.0 million.Following completion of the Capital Increase and the issuance of Royalty Certificates  the Company will have sufficient net working capital to meet its current obligations until the beginning of the second quarter of 2024  and will have net working capital until the beginning of the third quarter of 2024  subject the disbursement of the European Investment Bank second tranche of the €25 million loan (the ""EIB Financing"") in accordance with the terms of the financing agreement entered into with the Company on 16 May 2022 (see the Company's press release of July 4  2022 detailing the conditions precedent to the granting of EIB Financing) and subject to other sources of financing expected by the end of 2023. As a result  the Company will not have sufficient net working capital over the next twelve months after the Capital Increase and the issuance of the Royalty Certificates.To date  and subject to the settlement and delivery of the New Shares  the remaining conditions precedent to the EIB Financing are as follows: (i) the receipt by the Company of at least €70 million (it being specified that as of today  the Company has already reached an amount of approximately €22.5 million  which does not include the amount raised under the Transaction) and (ii) operating targets. The Company expects to meet these conditions by the end of 2023.In addition to the proceeds of the Capital Increase and the Royalty Certificates  the Company plans to extend its expected financing horizon through :additional financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities  public offerings or private placements  or bank loans;the sale of ADSs under the At-the-Market financing program;strategic transactions such as business development partnerships and/or licensing agreements;milestone payments that may be received in connection with partnerships.Should the above measures fail to materialize  the Company would have to raise new financing to ensure the continuity of its business.Main characteristics of the TransactionCapital IncreaseThe Company's Board of Directors  by virtue of the powers granted to it by the 6th resolution of the shareholders' general meeting of January 25  2023 (capital increase without the exercise of preemptive subscription rights in favor of specific categories of beneficiaries) and in accordance with Articles L. 225-138 et seq. of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) has decided on August 30  2023 to proceed with the Capital Increase and has determined the final number of ordinary shares offered and the subscription price.The specific categories of persons defined by the 6th resolution of the shareholders' general meeting include: (i) natural or legal persons (including companies) trusts or investment funds  or other investment vehicles  in any form  established under French or foreign law  which regularly invest in the pharmaceutical  biotechnological or medical technology sectors; and/or (ii) companies  institutions or entities  in any form  French or foreign  exercising a significant part of its activities in the pharmaceutical  cosmetic or chemical sectors  or medical devices and/or technologies  or researching in such sectors; and/or (iii) French or foreign investment services companies  or any foreign establishment having an equivalent status  able to guarantee the completion of an issue intended to be placed with the persons referred to in (i) and/or (ii) above  and  in this context  to subscribe to the securities that are being issued.Qatar Holding LLC  a new investor  has agreed to subscribe to the Capital Increase for an amount of approximately €16.4 million corresponding to 5 157 233 New Shares  representing an approximate 9.97% stake in the Company.Sofinnova Partner and Yiheng Capital  which are existing shareholders of the Company  participated in the Transaction.Sofinnova Partner  which held a 8.0% stake in the Company  prior to the Capital Increase  subscribed to the Capital Increase for an amount of approximately €5.4 million corresponding to 1 688 327 New Shares. After the Capital Increase  Sofinnova Partner will hold 9.8% of the share capital of the Company  on a non-diluted basis.Yiheng Capital  which held a 6.3% stake in the Company prior to the Capital Increase  subscribed to the Capital Increase for an amount of approximately €3.8 million corresponding to 1 200 750 New Shares. After the Capital Increase  Yiheng Capital will hold 7.4% of the share capital of the Company  on a non-diluted basis.The price of the New Shares was decided by the Board of Directors on August 30  2023  pursuant to the delegation of authority granted by the 6th resolution of the shareholders' general meeting  and is equal to the weighted average of the prices quoted for the last 10 trading sessions on the regulated market of Euronext Paris prior to the setting of the price (i.e. the trading sessions of August 29  28  25  24  23  22  21  18  17 and 16  2023  i.e. €3.34)  less a discount of around 5%  i.e. €3.18. The price of the New Shares represents discount of 0.22% compared with the volume-weighted average price of the Company's shares during the trading session preceding the setting of the issue price in the amount of €3.19.Settlement and delivery of the New Shares is expected to occur on September 5  2023. The New Shares will be fungible with the existing shares of the Company and will be admitted to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris under ISIN FR0013233012.Investors participating in the Capital Increase have agreed to a six (6) month lock-up on the New Shares subject to a number of customary exceptions.Royalty CertificatesThe Royalty Certificates are being issued pursuant to a decision of Board of Directors on August 30  2023  in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 228-36-A of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) to some of the investors as the ones who participated in the Capital Increase.The Royalty Certificates give the holders thereto the right to an annual payment of royalties (the ""Royalties"") equal to 2% of the future net sales of lanifibranor (the ""Product"")  if any  beginning on the fiscal year following the start of the sales of the Product following the granting of the market authorization (Autorisation de mise sur le marché) for the Product in (i) the United States or (ii) the countries of the European Union or (iii) the United Kingdom  whichever occurs the first.The aggregate amount of Royalties that may be paid under the Royalty Certificates is capped at €92.1 million globally corresponding to three times of the amount of gross proceeds from the Transaction (not including subscriptions received solely in connection with the Capital Increase). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Royalty Certificates will be used for the Phase III evaluation of lanifibranor in the treatment of patients suffering from NASH.The Royalty Certificates do not have any additional financial rights besides the right to Royalties referred to above. Specifically  the Royalty Certificates do not grant any financial rights on any other products that may be developed by the Company beyond lanifibranor.The subscription price for the Royalty Certificates is €5.1 million and has been calculated based on the net present value (NPV) of expected cash flows related to the Royalty Certificates. The NPV calculation depends strongly on assumptions made by the Company with regards to the chances of success of its studies  the commercialization calendar of lanifibranor  the market size addressed by lanifibranor  the market share of the product and the discount rate. In the process of setting the discount rate  the Company analyzed the expected cash flow derived from its business plan as regards to its market capitalization.The Royalty Certificates have a term of 15 years following their issuance and do not provide for an accelerated repayment in case of change of control. The Company may at any time repurchase in full the Royalty Certificates by paying an amount equal to (i) the global cap of €92.1 million minus any Royalties paid prior to such repurchase or (ii) a price to be agreed between the Company and the holders of the Royalty Certificates. The Company may also redeem the Royalty Certificates from each holder  subject to offering such redemption to every holders. Lastly  the Company has a pre-emptive right in the event of the sale of Royalty Certificates by a holder.The Royalty Certificates are subject to a six month lock-up period after which they will become freely transferable (in whole  but not in part) only to qualified institutional buyers  as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933  as amended  or qualified investors pursuant to Article 2(e) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129. The Company has a preemptive right on any transfer of Royalty Certificates.The payment of Royalties in the event of the commercialization of the Product (2% of sales of the Product in the United States  in European Union countries and in the United Kingdom) will result in a decrease in cash flow generated by sales of the Product  which will have an unfavourable effect on the Company's financial position  particularly at the beginning of the commercialization phase.Settlement and delivery of the Royalty Certificates is expected to occur on September 5  2023. The Royalty Certificates will not be listed on any stock exchange and will not be assigned an ISIN.Impact of the Capital Increase on the share capitalFollowing the settlement and delivery of the New Shares  expected to occur on September 5  2023  the Company’s total share capital will be equal to €517 528.07 million divided into 51 752 807 shares.For illustration purposes  the impact of the issuance of the New Shares on the ownership of a shareholder holding 1% of the Company’s share capital prior to the Capital Increase and not subscribing to it  is as follows:Percentage of capital Non-diluted basis Diluted basis(1) Before issuance of the New Shares from the Capital Increase 1% 0.90% After issuance of 9 618 638 New Shares from the Capital Increase 0.81% 0.75%(1) Calculations are based on the assumption that all share subscription warrants (BSA)  warrants for the subscription of business creators' shares (BSPCE) and stock options (options de souscription d'actions) will be exercised and that all free shares allocated will vest.Impact of the Capital Increase on shareholders' equityFor illustration purposes  the impact of the issuance of the New Shares on the Company's equity per share (calculation made on the basis of the Company's equity at June 30  2023) is as follows:Equity per share in euros Non-diluted basis Diluted basis(1) Before issuance of the New Shares from the Capital Increase €0.49 €0.49 After issuance of 9 618 638 New Shares from the Capital Increase €0.97 €0.93(1) Calculations are based on the assumption that all share subscription warrants (BSA)  warrants for the subscription of business creators' shares (BSPCE) and stock options (options de souscription d'actions) will be exercised and that all free shares allocated will vest.Evolution of the shareholding structure following the TransactionThe shareholding structure of the Company prior to the issuance of the New Shares is set forth below:Shareholding at June 30  2023 On a non-diluted basis Shareholders Number of Shares % of share capital Number of voting rights % of voting rights Frédéric Cren 5 612 224 13.3% 11 224 448 20.3% Pierre Broqua 3 882 500 9.2% 7 765 000 14.0% Sub-total - Concert 9 494 724 22.5% 18 989 448 34.3% BVF Partners L.P. 8 395 638 19.9% 8 395 638 15.2% New Enterprise Associates (NEA) 5 572 953 13.2% 5 572 953 10.1% Sofinnova 3 381 939 8.0% 4 422 500 8.0% Yiheng 2 644 926 6.3% 2 644 926 4.8% ISLS Consulting 111 000 0.3% 222 000 0.4% Directors (non-executive) 10 000 0.0% 10 000 0.0% Employees 975 127 2.3% 1 909 840 3.5% Treasury shares 106 115 0.3% Free Float 11 441 747 27.2% 13 185 957 23.8% Total 42 134 169 100.0% 55 353 262 100.0%The issuance of the New Shares will have the following impact on the allocation of the share capital and the voting rights of the Company :Shareholding following the Capital Increase On a non-diluted basis Shareholders Number of Shares % of share capital Number of voting rights % of voting rights Frédéric Cren 5 612 224 10.84% 11 224 448 17.3% Pierre Broqua 3 882 500 7.50% 7 765 000 12.0% Sub-total - Concert 9 494 724 18.35% 18 989 448 29.2% BVF Partners L.P. 8 395 638 16.22% 8 395 638 12.9% New Enterprise Associates (NEA) 5 572 953 10.77% 5 572 953 8.6% Sofinnova 5 070 266 9.80% 6 110 827 9.4% Qatar Holding LLC 5 157 233 9.97% 5 157 233 7.9% Yiheng 3 845 676 7.43% 3 845 676 5.9% ISLS Consulting 111 000 0.21% 222 000 0.3% David Nikodem - 0.00% - - M.

Such buyback also had to be submitted to the approval of the group's lenders in accordance with the financing documentation  which was not obtained  as Jean-Michel Aulas was aware. The settlement agreement entered into with OLG also required Jean-Michel Aulas to act in a supportive manner towards OLG consistent with his new role as President in Honorarium of OLG. Therefore  in light of the failure to obtain approval for the repurchase  and also as a consequence of Jean-Michel Aulas' failure to honor material terms of the settlement agreement  OLG could not buy back these shares without jeopardising the Company.OLG thus strongly challenges the decision rendered yesterday by the President of Commercial Court of Lyon  which completely ignores all information provided to him on the impossibility for OLG to repurchase Holnest's shares and the consequences of such measures  in light of the Company's obligations towards the group's lenders. The Company has undertaken to file any recourses against such decision.OLG deeply regrets that its former CEO  who is also a shareholder and director of the Company and  as such  is fully aware of the extremely damaging nature of his actions  has launched an attack against Olympique Lyonnais that is as violent as it is illegitimate.OL GROUPETel: +33 (0)4 81 07 55 00Fax: +33 (0)4 81 07 45 65Email: investisseurs@ol.frwww.ol.frEuronext Paris - Segment CIndices: CAC Small – CAC Mid & Small – CAC All-Tradable – CAC All-Share – CAC Consumer DiscretionaryISIN code: FR0010428771Reuters: OLG.PABloomberg: OLG FPICB: 40501030 Recreational servicesThis publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: xmlpk5hvZJiYyWqaapZsmmJnaJhkx5bHbpfKx5VslJ7KbJ1llmZinMjGZnFimmlr- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Inside Information:- other releases Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/81545-olg-310823-recourse-against-protective-measures-gb.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2023 ActusNews",neutral,0.05,0.8,0.16,negative,0.0,0.07,0.93,True,English,"['OL APPEALS AGAINST PROTECTIVE MEASURES', 'Olympique Lyonnais Groupe', 'IT', 'August', '02:05', 'Segment C Indices', 'original press release', 'next press releases', 'Olympique Lyonnais Groupe', 'OL Groupe LLC', 'SECURITY MASTER Key', 'Actusnews SECURITY MASTER', 'other releases', 'contradictory manner', 'bank accounts', 'share capital', 'OL SASU', 'Jean-Michel Aulas', 'one third', 'settlement agreement', 'general meeting', 'Such buyback', 'financing documentation', 'supportive manner', 'new role', 'material terms', 'Commercial Court', 'damaging nature', 'Euronext Paris', 'ISIN code', 'Recreational services', 'protective measures', 'repurchase price', 'former CEO', 'ol.fr', 'CAC Small', 'CAC Consumer', 'Regulated information', 'OLG.PA', 'OLG FP', 'Holnest shares', 'OLG shares', '31 August', 'Company', 'middle', 'summer', 'instigation', 'receivable', 'relation', 'dismissal', 'approval', 'lenders', 'accordance', 'President', 'Honorarium', 'light', 'failure', 'consequence', 'decision', 'impossibility', 'obligations', 'recourses', 'shareholder', 'director', 'actions', 'attack', 'Tel', 'Fax', 'Email', 'investisseurs', 'Reuters', 'Bloomberg', 'ICB', 'publication', 'Full', 'PDF', 'protective-measures', '4 81']",2023-08-31,2023-09-01,marketscreener.com

Our focus on installation of offshore wind farms and investments in offshore wind capacity through DEME and Green Offshore  have also contributed to our group’s overall resilience in a period of high energy prices.We are proud of our selection as one of the 20 companies forming the new BEL ESG Index  launched by Euronext in January. It constitutes a recognition of our group’s efforts to position itself as 'partners for sustainable growth' with respect for people and for the environment. The sale of our 50% participation in Telemond in February  following a successful collaboration of more than 30 years with the German family Maas  is another example of AvH’s strategy to support family businesses as a long-term partner.The recently announced investments in IQIP and Camlin Fine Sciences (CFS) also fit with our ambition to be 'part of the solution' in these turbulent markets and to put the ~520 million euros cash of the recent divestments to work in market leaders with sustainable business models. IQIP is a specialist in foundation techniques for offshore wind turbines and as such contributes to the energy transition. CFS for its part plays a significant role  as one of the world’s important producers of vanillin and shelf-life solutions  in addressing the global challenge of feeding more than 8 billion people in a cost-efficient way whilst minimising food wastage.

Initiation of this Phase I study marks a significant milestone in treating this complex disease and serves as the leading asset in our clinical development portfolio. BEN-8744 exemplifies our innovative approach targeting a novel pathway with the potential for meaningful differentiation from existing standard-of-care treatments.”Joanna Shields  Chief Executive Officer of BenevolentAI  said:“Our AI powered drug-discovery platform identified PDE10 as a novel target for UC  with no prior direct associations linking it in scientific literature. BEN-8744 demonstrates the capacity of our technology platform to uncover novel avenues in the treatment of disease.”About BEN-8744BEN-8744 is a peripherally restricted small molecule PDE10 inhibitor in development as a potential first-in-class treatment for Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Administered orally  it also has the potential for addressing other indications within inflammatory bowel disease. BEN-8744 constitutes a different mechanism of action for the treatment of UC  providing an opportunity for further differentiation based on safety and efficacy. PDE10 reduces intracellular levels of the signalling molecule cGMP. Restoration of cGMP levels by PDE10 inhibition is anticipated to have a direct anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying benefit. BEN-8744 is a wholly owned asset in the BenevolentAI drug programme pipeline.About Ulcerative ColitisUC is a chronic disease that causes inflammation and ulceration of the inner lining of the colon and rectum. UC affects 0.4% of the US population  and 31% of patients have moderate-to-severe disease. 20-40% of those patients with moderate-to-severe UC do not respond to anti-TNF  the main treatment approach  whilst currently available treatments may come with severe side effects.About BenevolentAIBenevolentAI (AMS: BAI) is a leading developer of advanced artificial intelligence technologies that unlock the value of multimodal data  surface novel insights  and accelerate biomedical discovery. Through the combined capabilities of its AI platform  its scientific expertise  and wet-lab facilities  the Company is developing an inhouse drug pipeline of high-value assets.

Philips Hue Secure all…,"Eindhoven  the Netherlands -Signify (Euronext: LIGHT)  the world leader in lighting  today announces the launch of a new product category with Philips Hue Secure smart cameras  sensors  and app features to help secure your home. Philips Hue Secure allows you to monitor your home in real time  and it offers instant motion alerts and unique light and sound alarms to help deter intruders. The new Security Center in the Philips Hue app offers even more advanced features when users subscribe to a plan. Other updates include Philips Hue Festavia string lights for both indoors and outdoors  and the launch of Matter for all Philips Hue users.Keep an eye on your home with Philips Hue Secure camerasPhilips Hue Secure cameras feature a clear 1080p HD video feed with night vision to help you monitor your home in real time and trigger instant motion notifications. You can help deter intruders by triggering the unique combination of Philips Hue lights and sound alarms  or you can activate two-way talk to tell a delivery person to leave the package or just say ""Hi!"" to a friendly face. Philips Hue cameras feature end-to-end encryption by default  ensuring any video clips  snapshots  and live view remain private. Specifically  the capability to recognize whether a notification is triggered by a person  a pet or a package runs on the camera itself instead of the cloud  which means end-to-end encryption is always enabled.Suitable for both indoors and outdoors  Philips Hue Secure cameras are available in both a battery and wired version  as well as in the colors black or white. The Secure wired camera can be used with a convenient desktop stand  giving you optimal flexibility to place it around the home. Both cameras can also be placed outside with the Secure camera mount with ground spike and can be easily connected to Philips Hue's existing low-voltage outdoor system.Specifically developed for outdoor use  the Philips Hue Secure floodlight camera brings the best of the Philips Hue system together. It allows you to keep an eye on the backyard  patio  or driveway  and - when you trigger a light alarm from the Philips Hue app - the floodlight immediately illuminates a large area in any color  such as bright white or even red.For all Philips Hue Secure cameras  a low-voltage outdoor charging cable and anti-drop cable are available.Get alerted when doors and windows open with contact sensorsThe Philips HueSecure contact sensor - which can be used on doors  windows  cabinets  and more and is available in the colors black or white - sends real-time notifications when the contact sensor is opened or closed. For example  you can program your front door contact sensor to turn on your hallway lights and send a notification  so you can immediately check for potential intruders. You can also use the contact sensor to simply automate your lights anywhere else in the home: for example  you can program your lights to turn on and off when you open and close a cabinet or bathroom door.All-new Security Center in the Philips Hue appThe Philips Hue app now features the new Security Center to control your smart home security system. When you receive a notification  you can tap it to open the app. From the Take action screen  you can manually trigger an alarm that flashes your lights  sound the siren on your Secure camera  or call the local authorities or a trusted contact.Using the Philips Hue app  you can personalize your camera settings. Create Blackout zones  which make certain areas of the video feed private  or Activity zones  which prevent areas from sending notifications - particularly useful for busy sidewalks in front of the house.

The Offer is welcomed by the Boards of RoodMicrotec as we consider it to be in the best interests of all RoodMicrotec stakeholders. In our view  the Offer represents a genuine recognition of RoodMicrotec’s reputation and expertise in the European semiconductor industry. The Transaction is fully in line with the strategy we pursued with RoodMicrotec for the last couple of years  to aim for autonomous growth while at the same time explore the semiconductor industry market and look for a significant larger ecosystem to join  supporting the future growth of RoodMicrotec  and we are thrilled to have found that ecosystem in a merger with Microtest  an entity that is backboned by Xenon with the strategy to invest in growth of such a larger ecosystem.”Martin Sallenhag  CEO of RoodMicrotec:“We are very excited to be able to take this next and very important step in the merger process with Microtest. The merger with Microtest and the expansion plan provided by Xenon will put the new entity in a very strong position to be a major player in the growing market in Europe. We are thrilled to be able to join on this journey towards something better for the future.I am convinced that this is a very good path forward for the customers and employees of RoodMicrotec since it enables a faster and stronger growth potential compared to a stand-alone company.”Franco Prestigiacomo  Chairman of Microtest and CEO of Xenon:“Today marks another step forward towards the realization of a highly synergistic combination of RoodMicrotec and Microtest. Following the announcement in June  we are pleased to see that the offer is supported by many existing Shareholders and all Warrant Holders. We are also thankful for the support of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board in this transaction.We look forward to working closely with them in further developing RoodMicrotec and Microtest by driving synergies and creating an integrated European group specialized in manufacturing ATE  OSAT and fabless microchips. Together with Microtest’s CEOs  Giuseppe Amelio and Moreno Lupi  we are highly committed to setting a clear path for our internationalexpansion strategy  which is only just beginning. As previously announced  our objective is to maintain the current RoodMicrotec corporate structure and to integrate the technologies of both companies better to ensure even better performance for our customers  which I expect will increase significantly after the closing of this transaction.”The OfferMicrotest is making the Offer on the terms and subject to the conditions and restrictions contained in the Offer Memorandum. Shareholders tendering their Shares under the Offer will be paid a cash amount of EUR 0.35 (cum dividend) per Share in consideration for each Share validly tendered and not withdrawn (or defectively tendered provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) and transferred (geleverd) to Microtest.The total value of the Offer for 100% of the Shares as at closing of the Offer (on a fully diluted basis  assuming all of the 7 485 000 outstanding Warrants are exercised immediately prior to the Closing Date) amounts to EUR 28.9 million. Microtest confirmed in the joint press release dated 13 June 2023 that it has funds readily available to finance the Offer. In this context  Microtest has received equity commitment letters from its shareholders  which are fully committed  and has an existing facility agreement with a pool of Italian financial institutions in place pursuant to which Microtest has a committed credit line available for mergers and acquisitions  which it will use to partly finance the Offer. Further details can be found in section 5.4 (Financing of the Offer) of the Offer Memorandum.Rationale for the OfferThe Transaction is the culmination of an extensive strategic review conducted by the RoodMicrotec Boards in the last couple of years  which concluded that RoodMicrotec’s growth potential is hampered by the relatively extensive costs and other non-business-related requirements of operating in a public environment as a listed entity. Also  the current size of RoodMicrotec does not allow substantial investments and capital expenditure in pursuit of strong growth  without obtaining considerable financial obligations. Becoming part of a larger ecosystem will give RoodMicrotec more ‘firepower’ to realise targeted growth and create a higher shareholder value.Microtest is a well-reputed player in designing and manufacturing automated test equipment and in providing testing services. It is an entity controlled by Seven Holding 3 S. à r.l.  a wholly owned subsidiary of the private equity fund Xenon Private Equity VII SCA SICAV RAIF (“Xenon”)  which is managed by Xenon AIFM S.A  a leading mid-cap private equity fund with 33+ years of experience and 175+ investments.RoodMicrotec believes the sustainable and long-term success of RoodMicrotec can be enhanced under Microtest’s ownership as it will be part of a larger ecosystem in the semiconductor industry. Microtest fully supports RoodMicrotec’s growth strategy maintaining the focus on RoodMicrotec’s chosen technologies and services. Furthermore  the aggregation of Microtest and RoodMicrotec will allow the companies to better serve their customers’ increasingly sophisticated needs and to be in a better position to deal with the complex and growing semiconductor market.With Microtest and Xenon  RoodMicrotec will have a financially sound owner  with a strong track record in supporting entrepreneurial businesses and a wealth of experience in the semiconductor industry. Moreover  operating without a public listing will increase the RoodMicrotec Group’s ability to achieve the goals and implement the actions of its strategy.Full and unanimous support and recommendation by the RoodMicrotecBoardsConsistent with their fiduciary responsibilities  the RoodMicrotec Boards have followed a thorough and careful process in which they have frequently monitored and discussed the developments.Also consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities  the RoodMicrotec Boards  with the support of their outside financial and legal advisors  have given careful consideration to all relevant aspects of the Transaction  including the rationale for the Transaction  the interests of all of RoodMicrotec’s stakeholders  the Offer Price  the Non-Financial Covenants (as defined below) and other terms of the Transaction. After due and careful consideration  the RoodMicrotec Boards consider the Transaction to be in the best interest of RoodMicrotec and to promote the sustainable success of its business  taking into account the interests of all its stakeholders.Accordingly  the RoodMicrotec Boards have unanimously resolved to support the Transaction  recommend the Offer for acceptance by the Shareholders and recommend to the Shareholders to vote in favour of the Resolutions at the General Meeting  to be held on 19 October 2023  each in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement (the “Recommendation”). The Recommendation is included in the Position Statement  which also includes the agenda for the General Meeting and the explanatory notes thereto and which has been made available as of today on RoodMicrotec’s corporate website at https://www.roodmicrotec.com/ and https://www.roodmicrotec.com/en/investor-relations-en/information-about-the-public-offer-by-microtest-for-roodmicrotec-shares.Fairness OpinionAXECO Corporate Finance has issued a fairness opinion to the RoodMicrotec Boards on 12 June 2023 to the effect that  as of such date and subject to the qualifications  limitations  and assumptions set forth in the fairness opinion  (i) the Offer Price is fair  from a financial point of view  to the Shareholders  and (ii) the purchase price to be paid in connection with the Share Sale is fair  from a financial point of view  to RoodMicrotec Holding.

As such  the fairness opinion does not contain a recommendation to the Shareholders as to whether they should tender their Shares under the Offer (if and when made) or how they should vote or act with respect to the Resolutions or any other matter.Irrevocable undertakingsThe Offer is supported by several of RoodMicrotec’s substantial Shareholders and all Warrant Holders (as set out in detail in the Offer Memorandum)  together representing approximately 30.9% of the Shares as at closing of the Offer on a Fully Diluted Basis.Each of the Shareholders referred to in the previous paragraph has irrevocably committed to Microtest to support the Offer and tender all Shares held by it (immediately prior to closing of the Offer) in the Offer.Furthermore  all Warrant Holders have  subject to the Offer being declared unconditional  irrevocably committed to either (i) assign their Warrants to Microtest or (ii) exercise their Warrants and tender the Shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of the Warrants.

At the date of the Offer Memorandum  Microtest does not anticipate any such extension. In the event a third party makes or announces a competing offer for the Shares prior to the expiry of the Offer Period (whether or not extended pursuant to Article 15  paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of the Decree)  Microtest may extend the Offer Period at its own discretion in accordance with Article 15  paragraph 5 of the Decree to the end of the offer period of such competing offer. Further extensions are subject to an exemption from the AFM.If Microtest decides to request an exemption from the AFM it may  subject to receipt of such exemption  extend the Offer Period until such time as Microtest reasonably believes is necessary to cause the Offer Conditions to be satisfied  but no later than the Long Stop Date. If no exemption is granted by the AFM while not all Offer Conditions have been satisfied before the end of the extended Offer Period (and if such Offer Condition(s) has or have not been waived to the extent legally permitted in accordance with section 5.5.2 (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum)  the Offer will be terminated as a consequence of such Offer Condition(s) not having been satisfied or waived on or before the Unconditional Date.In the event of any extension  all references in the Offer Memorandum to 17:40 hours CEST on the Closing Date shall  unless the context requires otherwise  be changed to the latest date and time to which the Offer Period has been so extended.If the Offer Period is extended  so that the obligation pursuant to Article 16 of the Decree to announce whether the Offer is declared unconditional is postponed  a public announcement to that effect will be made ultimately on the third Business Day following the initial Closing Date in accordance with the provisions of Article 15  paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of the Decree. If Microtest extends the Offer Period  the Offer will expire on the latest time and date to which Microtest extends the Offer Period.During an extension of the Offer Period  any Shares previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain subject to the Offer  subject to the right of each Shareholder to withdraw the Shares he or she has already tendered in accordance with section 4.3.5 (Withdrawal rights) of the Offer Memorandum.Declaring the Offer unconditionalThe obligation of Microtest to declare the Offer unconditional is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions. Reference is made to section 5.5 (Offer Conditions  waiver and satisfaction) of the Offer Memorandum. The Offer Conditions may be waived  to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws  as set out in section 5.5.2 (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum. If Microtest or RoodMicrotec  or each of Microtest and RoodMicrotec  as applicable  wholly or partly waive one or more Offer Conditions according to section 5.5.2 (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum  Microtest will inform the Shareholders as required by the Applicable Laws.No later than on the Unconditional Date (i.e. the third Business Day following the Closing Date) Microtest will determine whether the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived as set out in section 5.5 (Offer Conditions  waiver and satisfaction) of the Offer Memorandum  to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws. In addition  Microtest will announce on the Unconditional Date whether (i) the Offer is declared unconditional  (ii) the Offer will be extended in accordance with Article 15 of the Decree  or (iii) the Offer is terminated as a result of the Offer Conditions set out in section 5.5.1 (Offer Conditions) of the Offer Memorandum not having been satisfied or waived  all in accordance with section 5.5.2 (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum and section 5.8 (Satisfaction) of the Offer Memorandum  Article 16 of the Decree and the provisions of the Merger Agreement. In the event that the Offer is not declared unconditional  Microtest will explain such decision.In the event that Microtest announces that the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan)  Microtest will accept all Tendered Shares and shall announce a Post-Acceptance Period (na-aanmeldingstermijn) as set out in section 4.8 (Post-Acceptance Period) of the Offer Memorandum.SettlementIn the event that Microtest announces that the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan)  Shareholders who have validly tendered (or defectively tendered provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) and transferred (geleverd) their Shares for acceptance pursuant to the Offer on or prior to the Closing Date will receive within three (3) Business Days following the Unconditional Date the Offer Price in respect of each Tendered Share  as of which moment dissolution or annulment of a Shareholder’s tender or transfer (levering) shall not be permitted. Settlement will only take place if the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan).Post-Acceptance PeriodIn the event that Microtest announces that the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan)  Microtest shall  in accordance with Article 17 of the Decree  within three (3) Business Days after declaring the Offer unconditional  publicly announce a Post-Acceptance Period(na-aanmeldingstermijn) of two (2) weeks to enable Shareholders who did not tender their Shares during the Offer Period to tender their Shares under the same terms and conditions as the Offer (including the terms and conditions set out in section 4.3 (Acceptance by Shareholders) of the Offer Memorandum).In the Post-Acceptance Period  Shareholders who hold their Shares through an Admitted Institution are requested to make their acceptance known through their custodian  bank or stockbroker no later than 17:40 hours CEST on the last Business Day of the Post-Acceptance Period. The custodian  bank or stockbroker may set an earlier deadline for communication by Shareholders in order to permit the custodian  bank or stockbroker to communicate its acceptances to the Settlement Agent in a timely manner. Accordingly  Shareholders holding Shares through a financial intermediary should comply with the dates communicated by such financial intermediary  as such dates may differ from the dates and times noted in the Offer Memorandum.Microtest will publicly announce the results of the Post-Acceptance Period and the total amount and total percentage of Shares held by it in accordance with Article 17  paragraph 4 of the Decree ultimately on the third Business Day following the last day of the Post-Acceptance Period. Microtest shall continue to accept for payment all Shares validly tendered (or defectively tendered  provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) during such Post-Acceptance Period and shall pay for such Shares as soon as reasonably possible and in any case no later than on the third Business Day following the last day of the Post-Acceptance Period.During the Post-Acceptance Period  Shareholders have no right to withdraw Shares from the Offer  whether validly tendered (or defectively tendered  provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) during the Offer Period or during the Post-Acceptance Period.In the event any Distribution on the Shares is declared by RoodMicrotec prior to the settlement date of the Shares tendered in the Post-Acceptance Period whereby the record date for entitlement to such Distribution is prior to such settlement date  the Offer Price will be decreased by the full amount of any such Distribution made by RoodMicrotec in respect of each Share (before any applicable withholding tax).Post-Closing Restructurings - GeneralMicrotest and RoodMicrotec believe that having the RoodMicrotec Group operate in a wholly-owned set up without a listing on Euronext Amsterdam is better for the sustainable success of its business and long-term value creation. This belief is based  inter alia  on:the fact that having a single shareholder and operating without a public listing increases the RoodMicrotec Group's ability to achieve the goals and implement the actions of its strategy and reduces the RoodMicrotec Group's costs;the ability of RoodMicrotec and Microtest to terminate the listing of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  and all resulting cost savings therefrom;the ability to achieve an efficient capital structure (both from a tax and financing perspective);the ability to implement and focus on achieving long-term strategic goals of RoodMicrotec  as opposed to short-term performance driven by periodic reporting obligations; andas part of long-term strategic objectives the ability to focus on pursuing and supporting (by providing access to equity and debt capital) continued buy-and-build acquisition opportunities as and when they arise.Buy-OutMicrotest and RoodMicrotec will seek to procure the delisting of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  as soon as practicable after the ending of the Post-Acceptance Period.If  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds at least 95% of the Shares  Microtest will as soon as possible commence the Buy-Out.Post-Closing RestructuringIf  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds less than 95%  but at least 80% of the Shares (excluding  for the avoidance of doubt  any Shares held by RoodMicrotec or any of its Group Companies)  Microtest intends to acquire the entire business of the RoodMicrotec Group for an amount equal to the Offer Price  pursuant to:a legal triangular merger of the RoodMicrotec Group into a newly incorporated wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of RoodMicrotec  RoodMicrotec B.V.  with a newly incorporated wholly-owned direct subsidiary of RoodMicrotec  RoodMicrotec Holding B.V. (“ RoodMicrotec Holding ”)  the sole shareholder of RoodMicrotec B.V.  allotting shares to holders of the Shares in a 1:1 exchange ratio and upon which RoodMicrotec will cease to exist and the Shares’ admission to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam will terminate (the “ Triangular Merger ”) 1 ;”)  the sole shareholder of RoodMicrotec B.V.  allotting shares to holders of the Shares in a 1:1 exchange ratio and upon which RoodMicrotec will cease to exist and the Shares’ admission to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam will terminate (the “ ”) ; a subsequent share sale pursuant to which RoodMicrotec Holding will sell and transfer the outstanding RoodMicrotec B.V. share(s) to Microtest (the “ Share Sale ”); and”); and a subsequent dissolution and liquidation of RoodMicrotec Holding (the “Liquidation” and  together with the Triangular Merger and the Share Sale  the “Post-Closing Restructuring”).Microtest will  with the cooperation of RoodMicrotec  ensure that the liquidator of RoodMicrotec Holding arranges for an advance liquidation distribution to the shareholders of RoodMicrotec Holding  which is intended to take place on or about the date of the closing of the Share Sale and will result in a payment per share equal to the Offer Price  without any interest and less applicable withholding taxes or other taxes. The Post-Closing Restructuring is subject to the approval of the General Meeting  which will be sought at the General Meeting.If  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds less than 95% of the Shares  Microtest may effect or cause to effect other restructurings of the RoodMicrotec Group for the purpose of achieving an optimal operational  legal  financial or fiscal structure  all in accordance with applicable laws and the terms of the Merger Agreement.Liquidity and delistingThe purchase of Shares by Microtest pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of Shareholders  as well as the number of Shares that might otherwise be traded publicly. As a result the liquidity and market value of the Shares that were not tendered under the Offer  or were tendered and validly withdrawn  may be adversely affected. Microtest does not intend to compensate for such adverse effect by  for example  setting up a liquidity mechanism for the Shares that are not tendered following the Settlement Date and the Post-Acceptance Period.Should the Offer be declared unconditional  Microtest and RoodMicrotec intend to procure the delisting of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam as soon as possible under Applicable Laws. This may further adversely affect the liquidity and market value of any Shares not tendered.If Microtest acquires 95% or more of the Shares  it will be able to procure delisting of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam in accordance with applicable (policy) rules. However  the listing of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam will also terminate after a successful Legal Merger as set out in section 5.15.3 (Post-Closing Restructuring) of the Offer Memorandum or any other measures or procedures set out in section 5.15 (Post Closing Restructurings) of the Offer Memorandum.AnnouncementsAny announcements in relation to the Offer will be issued by means of a press release.

We are extremely pleased that  with the unanimous support of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management of RoodMicrotec and also supported by many existing Shareholders and all our Warrant Holders  the transaction with Microtest has been launched today. The Offer is welcomed by the Boards of RoodMicrotec as we consider it to be in the best interests of all RoodMicrotec stakeholders. In our view  the Offer represents a genuine recognition of RoodMicrotec’s reputation and expertise in the European semiconductor industry. The Transaction is fully in line with the strategy we pursued with RoodMicrotec for the last couple of years  to aim for autonomous growth while at the same time explore the semiconductor industry market and look for a significant larger ecosystem to join  supporting the future growth of RoodMicrotec  and we are thrilled to have found that ecosystem in a merger with Microtest  an entity that is backboned by Xenon with the strategy to invest in growth of such a larger ecosystem.”Martin Sallenhag  CEO of RoodMicrotec:“We are very excited to be able to take this next and very important step in the merger process with Microtest. The merger with Microtest and the expansion plan provided by Xenon will put the new entity in a very strong position to be a major player in the growing market in Europe. We are thrilled to be able to join on this journey towards something better for the future. I am convinced that this is a very good path forward for the customers and employees of RoodMicrotec since it enables a faster and stronger growth potential compared to a stand-alone company.”Franco Prestigiacomo  Chairman of Microtest and CEO of Xenon:“Today marks another step forward towards the realization of a highly synergistic combination of RoodMicrotec and Microtest. Following the announcement in June  we are pleased to see that the offer is supported by many existing Shareholders and all Warrant Holders. We are also thankful for the support of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board in this transaction. We look forward to working closely with them in further developing RoodMicrotec and Microtest by driving synergies and creating an integrated European group specialized in manufacturing ATE  OSAT and fabless microchips. Together with Microtest’s CEOs  Giuseppe Amelio and Moreno Lupi  we are highly committed to setting a clear path for our international expansion strategy  which is only just beginning. As previously announced  our objective is to maintain the current RoodMicrotec corporate structure and to integrate the technologies of both companies better to ensure even better performance for our customers  which I expect will increase significantly after the closing of this transaction.”The OfferMicrotest is making the Offer on the terms and subject to the conditions and restrictions contained in the Offer Memorandum. Shareholders tendering their Shares under the Offer will be paid a cash amount of EUR 0.35 (cum dividend) per Share in consideration for each Share validly tendered and not withdrawn (or defectively tendered provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) and transferred (geleverd) to Microtest.The total value of the Offer for 100% of the Shares as at closing of the Offer (on a fully diluted basis  assuming all of the 7 485 000 outstanding Warrants are exercised immediately prior to the Closing Date) amounts to EUR 28.9 million. Microtest confirmed in the joint press release dated 13 June 2023 that it has funds readily available to finance the Offer. In this context  Microtest has received equity commitment letters from its shareholders  which are fully committed  and has an existing facility agreement with a pool of Italian financial institutions in place pursuant to which Microtest has a committed credit line available for mergers and acquisitions  which it will use to partly finance the Offer. Further details can be found in section 5.4 (Financing of the Offer) of the Offer Memorandum.Rationale for the OfferThe Transaction is the culmination of an extensive strategic review conducted by the RoodMicrotec Boards in the last couple of years  which concluded that RoodMicrotec’s growth potential is hampered by the relatively extensive costs and other non-business-related requirements of operating in a public environment as a listed entity. Also  the current size of RoodMicrotec does not allow substantial investments and capital expenditure in pursuit of strong growth  without obtaining considerable financial obligations. Becoming part of a larger ecosystem will give RoodMicrotec more ‘firepower’ to realise targeted growth and create a higher shareholder value.Microtest is a well-reputed player in designing and manufacturing automated test equipment and in providing testing services. It is an entity controlled by Seven Holding 3 S. à r.l.  a wholly owned subsidiary of the private equity fund Xenon Private Equity VII SCA SICAV RAIF (“Xenon”)  which is managed by Xenon AIFM S.A  a leading mid-cap private equity fund with 33+ years of experience and 175+ investments.RoodMicrotec believes the sustainable and long-term success of RoodMicrotec can be enhanced under Microtest’s ownership as it will be part of a larger ecosystem in the semiconductor industry. Microtest fully supports RoodMicrotec’s growth strategy maintaining the focus on RoodMicrotec’s chosen technologies and services. Furthermore  the aggregation of Microtest and RoodMicrotec will allow the companies to better serve their customers’ increasingly sophisticated needs and to be in a better position to deal with the complex and growing semiconductor market.With Microtest and Xenon  RoodMicrotec will have a financially sound owner  with a strong track record in supporting entrepreneurial businesses and a wealth of experience in the semiconductor industry. Moreover  operating without a public listing will increase the RoodMicrotec Group’s ability to achieve the goals and implement the actions of its strategy.Full and unanimous support and recommendation by the RoodMicrotec BoardsConsistent with their fiduciary responsibilities  the RoodMicrotec Boards have followed a thorough and careful process in which they have frequently monitored and discussed the developments.Also consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities  the RoodMicrotec Boards  with the support of their outside financial and legal advisors  have given careful consideration to all relevant aspects of the Transaction  including the rationale for the Transaction  the interests of all of RoodMicrotec’s stakeholders  the Offer Price  the Non-Financial Covenants (as defined below) and other terms of the Transaction. After due and careful consideration  the RoodMicrotec Boards consider the Transaction to be in the best interest of RoodMicrotec and to promote the sustainable success of its business  taking into account the interests of all its stakeholders.Accordingly  the RoodMicrotec Boards have unanimously resolved to support the Transaction  recommend the Offer for acceptance by the Shareholders and recommend to the Shareholders to vote in favour of the Resolutions at the General Meeting  to be held on 19 October 2023  each in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement (the “Recommendation”).

Microtest shall continue to accept for payment all Shares validly tendered (or defectively tendered  provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) during such Post-Acceptance Period and shall pay for such Shares as soon as reasonably possible and in any case no later than on the third Business Day following the last day of the Post-Acceptance Period.During the Post-Acceptance Period  Shareholders have no right to withdraw Shares from the Offer  whether validly tendered (or defectively tendered  provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) during the Offer Period or during the Post-Acceptance Period.In the event any Distribution on the Shares is declared by RoodMicrotec prior to the settlement date of the Shares tendered in the Post-Acceptance Period whereby the record date for entitlement to such Distribution is prior to such settlement date  the Offer Price will be decreased by the full amount of any such Distribution made by RoodMicrotec in respect of each Share (before any applicable withholding tax).Post-Closing Restructurings - GeneralMicrotest and RoodMicrotec believe that having the RoodMicrotec Group operate in a wholly-owned set up without a listing on Euronext Amsterdam is better for the sustainable success of its business and long-term value creation. This belief is based  inter alia  on:the fact that having a single shareholder and operating without a public listing increases the RoodMicrotec Group's ability to achieve the goals and implement the actions of its strategy and reduces the RoodMicrotec Group's costs;the ability of RoodMicrotec and Microtest to terminate the listing of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  and all resulting cost savings therefrom;the ability to achieve an efficient capital structure (both from a tax and financing perspective);the ability to implement and focus on achieving long-term strategic goals of RoodMicrotec  as opposed to short-term performance driven by periodic reporting obligations; andas part of long-term strategic objectives the ability to focus on pursuing and supporting (by providing access to equity and debt capital) continued buy-and-build acquisition opportunities as and when they arise.Buy-OutMicrotest and RoodMicrotec will seek to procure the delisting of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  as soon as practicable after the ending of the Post-Acceptance Period.If  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds at least 95% of the Shares  Microtest will as soon as possible commence the Buy-Out.Post-Closing RestructuringIf  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds less than 95%  but at least 80% of the Shares (excluding  for the avoidance of doubt  any Shares held by RoodMicrotec or any of its Group Companies)  Microtest intends to acquire the entire business of the RoodMicrotec Group for an amount equal to the Offer Price  pursuant to:a legal triangular merger of the RoodMicrotec Group into a newly incorporated wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of RoodMicrotec  RoodMicrotec B.V.  with a newly incorporated wholly-owned direct subsidiary of RoodMicrotec  RoodMicrotec Holding B.V. (“ RoodMicrotec Holding ”)  the sole shareholder of RoodMicrotec B.V.  allotting shares to holders of the Shares in a 1:1 exchange ratio and upon which RoodMicrotec will cease to exist and the Shares’ admission to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam will terminate (the “ Triangular Merger ”) 1 ;”)  the sole shareholder of RoodMicrotec B.V.  allotting shares to holders of the Shares in a 1:1 exchange ratio and upon which RoodMicrotec will cease to exist and the Shares’ admission to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam will terminate (the “ ”) ; a subsequent share sale pursuant to which RoodMicrotec Holding will sell and transfer the outstanding RoodMicrotec B.V. share(s) to Microtest (the “ Share Sale ”); and”); and a subsequent dissolution and liquidation of RoodMicrotec Holding (the “Liquidation” and  together with the Triangular Merger and the Share Sale  the “Post-Closing Restructuring”).Microtest will  with the cooperation of RoodMicrotec  ensure that the liquidator of RoodMicrotec Holding arranges for an advance liquidation distribution to the shareholders of RoodMicrotec Holding  which is intended to take place on or about the date of the closing of the Share Sale and will result in a payment per share equal to the Offer Price  without any interest and less applicable withholding taxes or other taxes. The Post-Closing Restructuring is subject to the approval of the General Meeting  which will be sought at the General Meeting.If  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds less than 95% of the Shares  Microtest may effect or cause to effect other restructurings of the RoodMicrotec Group for the purpose of achieving an optimal operational  legal  financial or fiscal structure  all in accordance with applicable laws and the terms of the Merger Agreement.Liquidity and delistingThe purchase of Shares by Microtest pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of Shareholders  as well as the number of Shares that might otherwise be traded publicly. As a result the liquidity and market value of the Shares that were not tendered under the Offer  or were tendered and validly withdrawn  may be adversely affected. Microtest does not intend to compensate for such adverse effect by  for example  setting up a liquidity mechanism for the Shares that are not tendered following the Settlement Date and the Post-Acceptance Period.Should the Offer be declared unconditional  Microtest and RoodMicrotec intend to procure the delisting of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam as soon as possible under Applicable Laws. This may further adversely affect the liquidity and market value of any Shares not tendered.If Microtest acquires 95% or more of the Shares  it will be able to procure delisting of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam in accordance with applicable (policy) rules. However  the listing of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam will also terminate after a successful Legal Merger as set out in section 5.15.3 (Post-Closing Restructuring) of the Offer Memorandum or any other measures or procedures set out in section 5.15 (Post Closing Restructurings) of the Offer Memorandum.AnnouncementsAny announcements in relation to the Offer will be issued by means of a press release.

We are extremely pleased that  with the unanimous support of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management of RoodMicrotec and also supported by many existing Shareholders and all our Warrant Holders  the transaction with Microtest has been launched today. The Offer is welcomed by the Boards of RoodMicrotec as we consider it to be in the best interests of all RoodMicrotec stakeholders. In our view  the Offer represents a genuine recognition of RoodMicrotec’s reputation and expertise in the European semiconductor industry. The Transaction is fully in line with the strategy we pursued with RoodMicrotec for the last couple of years  to aim for autonomous growth while at the same time explore the semiconductor industry market and look for a significant larger ecosystem to join  supporting the future growth of RoodMicrotec  and we are thrilled to have found that ecosystem in a merger with Microtest  an entity that is backboned by Xenon with the strategy to invest in growth of such a larger ecosystem.”Martin Sallenhag  CEO of RoodMicrotec:“We are very excited to be able to take this next and very important step in the merger process with Microtest. The merger with Microtest and the expansion plan provided by Xenon will put the new entity in a very strong position to be a major player in the growing market in Europe. We are thrilled to be able to join on this journey towards something better for the future. I am convinced that this is a very good path forward for the customers and employees of RoodMicrotec since it enables a faster and stronger growth potential compared to a stand-alone company.”Franco Prestigiacomo  Chairman of Microtest and CEO of Xenon:“Today marks another step forward towards the realization of a highly synergistic combination of RoodMicrotec and Microtest. Following the announcement in June  we are pleased to see that the offer is supported by many existing Shareholders and all Warrant Holders. We are also thankful for the support of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board in this transaction. We look forward to working closely with them in further developing RoodMicrotec and Microtest by driving synergies and creating an integrated European group specialized in manufacturing ATE  OSAT and fabless microchips. Together with Microtest’s CEOs  Giuseppe Amelio and Moreno Lupi  we are highly committed to setting a clear path for our international expansion strategy  which is only just beginning. As previously announced  our objective is to maintain the current RoodMicrotec corporate structure and to integrate the technologies of both companies better to ensure even better performance for our customers  which I expect will increase significantly after the closing of this transaction.”The OfferMicrotest is making the Offer on the terms and subject to the conditions and restrictions contained in the Offer Memorandum. Shareholders tendering their Shares under the Offer will be paid a cash amount of EUR 0.35 (cum dividend) per Share in consideration for each Share validly tendered and not withdrawn (or defectively tendered provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) and transferred (geleverd) to Microtest.The total value of the Offer for 100% of the Shares as at closing of the Offer (on a fully diluted basis  assuming all of the 7 485 000 outstanding Warrants are exercised immediately prior to the Closing Date) amounts to EUR 28.9 million. Microtest confirmed in the joint press release dated 13 June 2023 that it has funds readily available to finance the Offer. In this context  Microtest has received equity commitment letters from its shareholders  which are fully committed  and has an existing facility agreement with a pool of Italian financial institutions in place pursuant to which Microtest has a committed credit line available for mergers and acquisitions  which it will use to partly finance the Offer. Further details can be found in section 5.4 (Financing of the Offer) of the Offer Memorandum.Rationale for the OfferThe Transaction is the culmination of an extensive strategic review conducted by the RoodMicrotec Boards in the last couple of years  which concluded that RoodMicrotec’s growth potential is hampered by the relatively extensive costs and other non-business-related requirements of operating in a public environment as a listed entity. Also  the current size of RoodMicrotec does not allow substantial investments and capital expenditure in pursuit of strong growth  without obtaining considerable financial obligations. Becoming part of a larger ecosystem will give RoodMicrotec more ‘firepower’ to realise targeted growth and create a higher shareholder value.Microtest is a well-reputed player in designing and manufacturing automated test equipment and in providing testing services. It is an entity controlled by Seven Holding 3 S. à r.l.  a wholly owned subsidiary of the private equity fund Xenon Private Equity VII SCA SICAV RAIF (“Xenon”)  which is managed by Xenon AIFM S.A  a leading mid-cap private equity fund with 33+ years of experience and 175+ investments.RoodMicrotec believes the sustainable and long-term success of RoodMicrotec can be enhanced under Microtest’s ownership as it will be part of a larger ecosystem in the semiconductor industry. Microtest fully supports RoodMicrotec’s growth strategy maintaining the focus on RoodMicrotec’s chosen technologies and services. Furthermore  the aggregation of Microtest and RoodMicrotec will allow the companies to better serve their customers’ increasingly sophisticated needs and to be in a better position to deal with the complex and growing semiconductor market.With Microtest and Xenon  RoodMicrotec will have a financially sound owner  with a strong track record in supporting entrepreneurial businesses and a wealth of experience in the semiconductor industry. Moreover  operating without a public listing will increase the RoodMicrotec Group’s ability to achieve the goals and implement the actions of its strategy.Full and unanimous support and recommendation by the RoodMicrotec BoardsConsistent with their fiduciary responsibilities  the RoodMicrotec Boards have followed a thorough and careful process in which they have frequently monitored and discussed the developments.Also consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities  the RoodMicrotec Boards  with the support of their outside financial and legal advisors  have given careful consideration to all relevant aspects of the Transaction  including the rationale for the Transaction  the interests of all of RoodMicrotec’s stakeholders  the Offer Price  the Non-Financial Covenants (as defined below) and other terms of the Transaction. After due and careful consideration  the RoodMicrotec Boards consider the Transaction to be in the best interest of RoodMicrotec and to promote the sustainable success of its business  taking into account the interests of all its stakeholders.Accordingly  the RoodMicrotec Boards have unanimously resolved to support the Transaction  recommend the Offer for acceptance by the Shareholders and recommend to the Shareholders to vote in favour of the Resolutions at the General Meeting  to be held on 19 October 2023  each in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement (the “Recommendation”). The Recommendation is included in the Position Statement  which also includes the agenda for the General Meeting and the explanatory notes thereto and which has been made available as of today on RoodMicrotec’s corporate website at https://www.roodmicrotec.com/ and https://www.roodmicrotec.com/en/investor-relations-en/information-about-the-public-offer-by-microtest-for-roodmicrotec-shares.Fairness OpinionAXECO Corporate Finance has issued a fairness opinion to the RoodMicrotec Boards on 12 June 2023 to the effect that  as of such date and subject to the qualifications  limitations  and assumptions set forth in the fairness opinion  (i) the Offer Price is fair  from a financial point of view  to the Shareholders  and (ii) the purchase price to be paid in connection with the Share Sale is fair  from a financial point of view  to RoodMicrotec Holding.

If no exemption is granted by the AFM while not all Offer Conditions have been satisfied before the end of the extended Offer Period (and if such Offer Condition(s) has or have not been waived to the extent legally permitted in accordance with section 5.5.2 (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum)  the Offer will be terminated as a consequence of such Offer Condition(s) not having been satisfied or waived on or before the Unconditional Date.In the event of any extension  all references in the Offer Memorandum to 17:40 hours CEST on the Closing Date shall  unless the context requires otherwise  be changed to the latest date and time to which the Offer Period has been so extended.If the Offer Period is extended  so that the obligation pursuant to Article 16 of the Decree to announce whether the Offer is declared unconditional is postponed  a public announcement to that effect will be made ultimately on the third Business Day following the initial Closing Date in accordance with the provisions of Article 15  paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of the Decree. If Microtest extends the Offer Period  the Offer will expire on the latest time and date to which Microtest extends the Offer Period.During an extension of the Offer Period  any Shares previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain subject to the Offer  subject to the right of each Shareholder to withdraw the Shares he or she has already tendered in accordance with section 4.3.5 (Withdrawal rights) of the Offer Memorandum.Declaring the Offer unconditionalThe obligation of Microtest to declare the Offer unconditional is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions.

In addition  Microtest will announce on the Unconditional Date whether (i) the Offer is declared unconditional  (ii) the Offer will be extended in accordance with Article 15 of the Decree  or (iii) the Offer is terminated as a result of the Offer Conditions set out in section 5.5.1 (Offer Conditions) of the Offer Memorandum not having been satisfied or waived  all in accordance with section 5.5.2 (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum and section 5.8 (Satisfaction) of the Offer Memorandum  Article 16 of the Decree and the provisions of the Merger Agreement. In the event that the Offer is not declared unconditional  Microtest will explain such decision.In the event that Microtest announces that the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan)  Microtest will accept all Tendered Shares and shall announce a Post-Acceptance Period (na-aanmeldingstermijn) as set out in section 4.8 (Post-Acceptance Period) of the Offer Memorandum.SettlementIn the event that Microtest announces that the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan)  Shareholders who have validly tendered (or defectively tendered provided that such defect has been waived by Microtest) and transferred (geleverd) their Shares for acceptance pursuant to the Offer on or prior to the Closing Date will receive within three (3) Business Days following the Unconditional Date the Offer Price in respect of each Tendered Share  as of which moment dissolution or annulment of a Shareholder’s tender or transfer (levering) shall not be permitted. Settlement will only take place if the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan).Post-Acceptance PeriodIn the event that Microtest announces that the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan)  Microtest shall  in accordance with Article 17 of the Decree  within three (3) Business Days after declaring the Offer unconditional  publicly announce a Post-Acceptance Period(na-aanmeldingstermijn) of two (2) weeks to enable Shareholders who did not tender their Shares during the Offer Period to tender their Shares under the same terms and conditions as the Offer (including the terms and conditions set out in section 4.3 (Acceptance by Shareholders) of the Offer Memorandum).In the Post-Acceptance Period  Shareholders who hold their Shares through an Admitted Institution are requested to make their acceptance known through their custodian  bank or stockbroker no later than 17:40 hours CEST on the last Business Day of the Post-Acceptance Period. The custodian  bank or stockbroker may set an earlier deadline for communication by Shareholders in order to permit the custodian  bank or stockbroker to communicate its acceptances to the Settlement Agent in a timely manner. Accordingly  Shareholders holding Shares through a financial intermediary should comply with the dates communicated by such financial intermediary  as such dates may differ from the dates and times noted in the Offer Memorandum.Microtest will publicly announce the results of the Post-Acceptance Period and the total amount and total percentage of Shares held by it in accordance with Article 17  paragraph 4 of the Decree ultimately on the third Business Day following the last day of the Post-Acceptance Period.

This belief is based  inter alia  on:the fact that having a single shareholder and operating without a public listing increases the RoodMicrotec Group's ability to achieve the goals and implement the actions of its strategy and reduces the RoodMicrotec Group's costs;the ability of RoodMicrotec and Microtest to terminate the listing of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  and all resulting cost savings therefrom;the ability to achieve an efficient capital structure (both from a tax and financing perspective);the ability to implement and focus on achieving long-term strategic goals of RoodMicrotec  as opposed to short-term performance driven by periodic reporting obligations; andas part of long-term strategic objectives the ability to focus on pursuing and supporting (by providing access to equity and debt capital) continued buy-and-build acquisition opportunities as and when they arise.Buy-OutMicrotest and RoodMicrotec will seek to procure the delisting of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  as soon as practicable after the ending of the Post-Acceptance Period.If  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds at least 95% of the Shares  Microtest will as soon as possible commence the Buy-Out.Post-Closing RestructuringIf  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds less than 95%  but at least 80% of the Shares (excluding  for the avoidance of doubt  any Shares held by RoodMicrotec or any of its Group Companies)  Microtest intends to acquire the entire business of the RoodMicrotec Group for an amount equal to the Offer Price  pursuant to:a legal triangular merger of the RoodMicrotec Group into a newly incorporated wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of RoodMicrotec  RoodMicrotec B.V.  with a newly incorporated wholly-owned direct subsidiary of RoodMicrotec  RoodMicrotec Holding B.V. (“ RoodMicrotec Holding ”)  the sole shareholder of RoodMicrotec B.V.  allotting shares to holders of the Shares in a 1:1 exchange ratio and upon which RoodMicrotec will cease to exist and the Shares’ admission to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam will terminate (the “ Triangular Merger ”) 1 ;”)  the sole shareholder of RoodMicrotec B.V.  allotting shares to holders of the Shares in a 1:1 exchange ratio and upon which RoodMicrotec will cease to exist and the Shares’ admission to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam will terminate (the “ ”) ; a subsequent share sale pursuant to which RoodMicrotec Holding will sell and transfer the outstanding RoodMicrotec B.V. share(s) to Microtest (the “ Share Sale ”); and”); and a subsequent dissolution and liquidation of RoodMicrotec Holding (the “Liquidation” and  together with the Triangular Merger and the Share Sale  the “Post-Closing Restructuring”).Microtest will  with the cooperation of RoodMicrotec  ensure that the liquidator of RoodMicrotec Holding arranges for an advance liquidation distribution to the shareholders of RoodMicrotec Holding  which is intended to take place on or about the date of the closing of the Share Sale and will result in a payment per share equal to the Offer Price  without any interest and less applicable withholding taxes or other taxes. The Post-Closing Restructuring is subject to the approval of the General Meeting  which will be sought at the General Meeting.If  after settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period  Microtest holds less than 95% of the Shares  Microtest may effect or cause to effect other restructurings of the RoodMicrotec Group for the purpose of achieving an optimal operational  legal  financial or fiscal structure  all in accordance with applicable laws and the terms of the Merger Agreement.Liquidity and delistingThe purchase of Shares by Microtest pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of Shareholders  as well as the number of Shares that might otherwise be traded publicly. As a result the liquidity and market value of the Shares that were not tendered under the Offer  or were tendered and validly withdrawn  may be adversely affected. Microtest does not intend to compensate for such adverse effect by  for example  setting up a liquidity mechanism for the Shares that are not tendered following the Settlement Date and the Post-Acceptance Period.Should the Offer be declared unconditional  Microtest and RoodMicrotec intend to procure the delisting of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam as soon as possible under Applicable Laws. This may further adversely affect the liquidity and market value of any Shares not tendered.If Microtest acquires 95% or more of the Shares  it will be able to procure delisting of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam in accordance with applicable (policy) rules. However  the listing of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam will also terminate after a successful Legal Merger as set out in section 5.15.3 (Post-Closing Restructuring) of the Offer Memorandum or any other measures or procedures set out in section 5.15 (Post Closing Restructurings) of the Offer Memorandum.AnnouncementsAny announcements in relation to the Offer will be issued by means of a press release.

The proceeds of this financing will contribute to the development of lanifibranor and extend our cash runway beyond two key milestones: the recruitment of the last patient of our pivotal phase III clinical trial in NASH expected before the end of the year and the publication of the results of the trial combining lanifibranor with SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin expected for the first quarter of 2024.""Reasons for the issuance and use of the proceeds of the TransactionThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Capital Increase  together with its available cash  according to the following:95% of the net proceeds for the Phase III evaluation of lanifibranor in the treatment of patients suffering from NASH; and5% of the net proceeds for its other pre-clinical and clinical programs  in particular Yap-Tead  as well as for general corporate purposes.In the Company's opinion  before the Capital Increase and the issuance of the Royalty Certificates  the Company's net working capital is not sufficient to meet its obligations over the next twelve months. As of June 30  20231  the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are estimated to be €31.2 million  short-term deposits to €0.05 million2  and long-term deposits to €9.3 million3  compared to €86.7 million  €1.0 million and €0.7 million as of December 31  2022. This cash position enables the Group to continue its activities until end of fourth quarter 2023.To cover its obligations until the end of August 2024  based on its current business plan  the Company estimates that its additional cash requirements will amount to €80.0 million.Following completion of the Capital Increase and the issuance of Royalty Certificates  the Company will have sufficient net working capital to meet its current obligations until the beginning of the second quarter of 2024  and will have net working capital until the beginning of the third quarter of 2024  subject the disbursement of the European Investment Bank second tranche of the €25 million loan (the ""EIB Financing"") in accordance with the terms of the financing agreement entered into with the Company on 16 May 2022 (see the Company's press release of July 4  2022 detailing the conditions precedent to the granting of EIB Financing) and subject to other sources of financing expected by the end of 2023. As a result  the Company will not have sufficient net working capital over the next twelve months after the Capital Increase and the issuance of the Royalty Certificates.To date  and subject to the settlement and delivery of the New Shares  the remaining conditions precedent to the EIB Financing are as follows: (i) the receipt by the Company of at least €70 million (it being specified that as of today  the Company has already reached an amount of approximately €22.5 million  which does not include the amount raised under the Transaction) and (ii) operating targets. The Company expects to meet these conditions by the end of 2023.In addition to the proceeds of the Capital Increase and the Royalty Certificates  the Company plans to extend its expected financing horizon through :additional financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities  public offerings or private placements  or bank loans;the sale of ADSs under the At-the-Market financing program;strategic transactions such as business development partnerships and/or licensing agreements;milestone payments that may be received in connection with partnerships.Should the above measures fail to materialize  the Company would have to raise new financing to ensure the continuity of its business.Main characteristics of the TransactionCapital IncreaseThe Company's Board of Directors  by virtue of the powers granted to it by the 6th resolution of the shareholders' general meeting of January 25  2023 (capital increase without the exercise of preemptive subscription rights in favor of specific categories of beneficiaries) and in accordance with Articles L. 225-138 et seq. of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) has decided on August 30  2023 to proceed with the Capital Increase and has determined the final number of ordinary shares offered and the subscription price.The specific categories of persons defined by the 6th resolution of the shareholders' general meeting include: (i) natural or legal persons (including companies) trusts or investment funds  or other investment vehicles  in any form  established under French or foreign law  which regularly invest in the pharmaceutical  biotechnological or medical technology sectors; and/or (ii) companies  institutions or entities  in any form  French or foreign  exercising a significant part of its activities in the pharmaceutical  cosmetic or chemical sectors  or medical devices and/or technologies  or researching in such sectors; and/or (iii) French or foreign investment services companies  or any foreign establishment having an equivalent status  able to guarantee the completion of an issue intended to be placed with the persons referred to in (i) and/or (ii) above  and  in this context  to subscribe to the securities that are being issued.Qatar Holding LLC  a new investor  has agreed to subscribe to the Capital Increase for an amount of approximately €16.4 million corresponding to 5 157 233 New Shares  representing an approximate 9.97% stake in the Company.Sofinnova Partner and Yiheng Capital  which are existing shareholders of the Company  participated in the Transaction.Sofinnova Partner  which held a 8.0% stake in the Company  prior to the Capital Increase  subscribed to the Capital Increase for an amount of approximately €5.4 million corresponding to 1 688 327 New Shares. After the Capital Increase  Sofinnova Partner will hold 9.8% of the share capital of the Company  on a non-diluted basis.Yiheng Capital  which held a 6.3% stake in the Company prior to the Capital Increase  subscribed to the Capital Increase for an amount of approximately €3.8 million corresponding to 1 200 750 New Shares. After the Capital Increase  Yiheng Capital will hold 7.4% of the share capital of the Company  on a non-diluted basis.The price of the New Shares was decided by the Board of Directors on August 30  2023  pursuant to the delegation of authority granted by the 6th resolution of the shareholders' general meeting  and is equal to the weighted average of the prices quoted for the last 10 trading sessions on the regulated market of Euronext Paris prior to the setting of the price (i.e. the trading sessions of August 29  28  25  24  23  22  21  18  17 and 16  2023  i.e. €3.34)  less a discount of around 5%  i.e. €3.18. The price of the New Shares represents discount of 0.22% compared with the volume-weighted average price of the Company's shares during the trading session preceding the setting of the issue price in the amount of €3.19.Settlement and delivery of the New Shares is expected to occur on September 5  2023. The New Shares will be fungible with the existing shares of the Company and will be admitted to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris under ISIN FR0013233012.Investors participating in the Capital Increase have agreed to a six (6) month lock-up on the New Shares subject to a number of customary exceptions.Royalty CertificatesThe Royalty Certificates are being issued pursuant to a decision of Board of Directors on August 30  2023  in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 228-36-A of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) to some of the investors as the ones who participated in the Capital Increase.The Royalty Certificates give the holders thereto the right to an annual payment of royalties (the ""Royalties"") equal to 2% of the future net sales of lanifibranor (the ""Product"")  if any  beginning on the fiscal year following the start of the sales of the Product following the granting of the market authorization (Autorisation de mise sur le marché) for the Product in (i) the United States or (ii) the countries of the European Union or (iii) the United Kingdom  whichever occurs the first.The aggregate amount of Royalties that may be paid under the Royalty Certificates is capped at €92.1 million globally corresponding to three times of the amount of gross proceeds from the Transaction (not including subscriptions received solely in connection with the Capital Increase). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Royalty Certificates will be used for the Phase III evaluation of lanifibranor in the treatment of patients suffering from NASH.The Royalty Certificates do not have any additional financial rights besides the right to Royalties referred to above. Specifically  the Royalty Certificates do not grant any financial rights on any other products that may be developed by the Company beyond lanifibranor.The subscription price for the Royalty Certificates is €5.1 million and has been calculated based on the net present value (NPV) of expected cash flows related to the Royalty Certificates. The NPV calculation depends strongly on assumptions made by the Company with regards to the chances of success of its studies  the commercialization calendar of lanifibranor  the market size addressed by lanifibranor  the market share of the product and the discount rate. In the process of setting the discount rate  the Company analyzed the expected cash flow derived from its business plan as regards to its market capitalization.The Royalty Certificates have a term of 15 years following their issuance and do not provide for an accelerated repayment in case of change of control.

Presentations span multiple forms of epilepsy  as well as rare epileptic conditions such as Dravet syndrome (DS)  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and CDKL5 (cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5) deficiency disorder.Mike Davis  Head of Global Epilepsy & Rare Syndromes  UCB  said: ""Utilizing our experience and expertise  we continuously challenge the status quo in our drive to do more for people living with a variety of seizure types and rare syndromes - from innovative early research  to research in conditions where we have considerable history and heritage  as well as in new therapy areas where we are addressing important unmet needs in Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome - our data at IEC really underlines where we are working to have a positive impact. Our ambition is to do more to improve the lives of patients and families now  and in the future.""Data to be presented at the 35th International Epilepsy Congress (IEC)Fenfluramine impact in children and adults living with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS)A review of published studies where patients were treated with fenfluramine to manage convulsive seizures - including generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) or tonic-clonic seizures (TCS) - was conducted to examine the efficacy of fenfluramine on GTCS reduction in various types of Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEEs) or rare epilepsy conditions. Data from 13 studies (4 randomized-controlled trials (RCTs)  4 observational studies  4 open-label studies  and 1 case series) were included in the review.3In total 561 patients were included in the review (including 360 patients with Dravet syndrome and 176 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome). Not all patients in these studies experienced GTCS or TCS. Eight studies (N=117) reported the proportion of patients experiencing ≥75% and/or 100% reduction in GTCS or TCS; 70% and 55% of patients reported ≥75% and 100% reduction in GTCS or TCS  respectively. 5 studies reported more than half of patients were GTCS-free after fenfluramine treatment.3Lead author and Professor Helen Cross  the Prince of Wales's Chair of Childhood Epilepsy & Director of UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health  London  and Young Epilepsy  Lingfield  UK commented: ""These data demonstrated striking levels of GTCS control  setting new standards for what can be achieved in Dravet syndrome  but also providing important insights into treatment for other developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. These seizures are one of our main concerns because of the risk of SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy).""Orrin Devinsky  MD  Director of NYU Langone Health's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center  US  said: ""The impact of Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes are far reaching  with many emotional and practical consequences for parents  siblings  relatives and loved ones. These data are raising the bar in what can be achieved in advancing the care for both children and adults living with these difficult to treat conditions.""Late-breaking data presented at IEC also provide additional new evidence on the safety profile and efficacy of fenfluramine in adults living with Dravet syndrome.4In LGS  data include an evaluation of the impact of age and weight on the reduction of seizures associated with a fall  in patients in the phase 3 randomized clinical trial and open-label extension study (NCT03355209). These data suggest that fenfluramine treatment results in effective  sustained reductions in frequency of seizures associated with a fall in adults with LGS  comparable to results in children and adolescents with LGS  and in patients with LGS weighing ≥37.5kg  comparable to results in patients weighing <37.5kg.5Focal-Onset SeizuresData presented on brivaracetam will look at the effectiveness and tolerability profile of this treatment in adults with epilepsy of different aetiology  including people with brain tumor-related epilepsy  post-stroke epilepsy  and traumatic brain injury-related epilepsy.6 Additionally  data from the EXPERIENCE analysis will assess effectiveness and tolerability profile of brivaracetam in patients switching from levetiracetam and patients switching from other antiseizure medications.7Rapid and Early Seizure TerminationExpert consensus recommendations will also be presented from the Seizure Termination Project*  discussing best practice for rapid termination of seizure episodes to prevent progression to a higher-level emergency. The advisors unanimously agreed that an ideal acute seizure termination treatment would start to act within 2 minutes of administration to terminate ongoing seizure activity. Consensus was also reached on goals and potential benefits of rapid seizure termination and specific patient and seizure types that could benefit most from rapid termination.8 The project aims to fill the gap which exists in guidelines for seizure emergencies.Pipeline programs**In CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD)  a poster describes the design of an ongoing  two-part  multi-center trial of fenfluramine in people with CDD and uncontrolled seizures  outlining how the study will characterize efficacy and safety of the treatment.9SymposiaUCB-supported symposia aim to increase knowledge and awareness of the different seizure emergencies and the importance of rapid termination of certain ongoing seizures  and the impact of DEEs on seizure and non-seizure outcomes  with focus on adult patients:Prolonged seizures - Time is brain and more: Sunday  3rd September 18.00-19.30 CET  will differentiate the different seizure emergencies and describe the clinical relevance and burden of prolonged seizure duration and progression to more severe seizure types. Making a difference together for patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies: Monday  4th September 09:00-10.30 CET  will increase the knowledge of DEEs with focus on the awareness of the impact of seizure and non-seizure outcomes along the patient lifetime  advancing collaboration between specialists in the transition of patients from pediatric to adult care and sharing best practice on complex clinical cases in DS and LGS.UCB presentations during IEC 2023About FINTEPLA®▼(fenfluramine) oral solution in EU1Fintepla is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome as an add-on therapy to other anti-epileptic medicines for patients 2 years of age and older. Fenfluramine is a serotonin releasing agent  and thereby stimulates multiple 5-HT receptor sub-types through the release of serotonin. Fenfluramine may reduce seizures by acting as an agonist at specific serotonin receptors in the brain  including the 5-HT1D  5-HT2A  and 5-HT2C receptors  and also by acting on the sigma-1 receptor. The precise mode of action of fenfluramine in Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is not known.Fenfluramine oral solution is available under a controlled access program to ensure regular cardiac monitoring and to mitigate potential off-label use.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information.▼This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.Important Safety Information about FINTEPLA▼ in EUAortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertensionBecause of reported cases of valvular heart disease that may have been caused by fenfluramine at higher doses used to treat adult obesity  cardiac monitoring must be performed using echocardiography. In the controlled clinical studies of fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome  no valvular heart disease was observed. Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to establish a baseline prior to initiating treatment and exclude any pre-existing valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension. Echocardiogram monitoring should be conducted every 6 months for the first 2 years and annually thereafter. If an echocardiogram indicates pathological valvular changes  a follow-up echocardiogram should be considered at an earlier timeframe to evaluate whether the abnormality is persistent. If pathological abnormalities on the echocardiogram are observed  it is recommended to evaluate the benefit versus risk of continuing fenfluramine treatment with the prescriber  caregiver  and cardiologist. If treatment is stopped because of aortic or mitral valvular heart disease  appropriate monitoring and follow-up should be provided in accordance with local guidelines for the treatment of aortic or mitral valvular heart disease. With past use in higher doses to treat adult obesity  fenfluramine was reported to be associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pulmonary arterial hypertension was not observed in the clinical programme  but because of the low incidence of this disease  the clinical trial experience with fenfluramine is inadequate to determine if fenfluramine increases the risk for pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. If echocardiogram findings are suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension  a repeat echocardiogram should be performed as soon as possible and within 3 months to confirm these findings. If the echocardiogram finding is confirmed suggestive of an increased probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension defined as ""intermediate probability"" by the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines  it should lead to a benefit-risk evaluation of continuation of Fintepla by the prescriber  carer  and cardiologist. If the echocardiogram finding  after confirmation  suggests of a high probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension  as defined by the 2015 ESC and ERS Guidelines  it is recommended fenfluramine treatment should be stopped.Decreased appetite and weight lossFenfluramine can cause decreased appetite and weight loss. An additive effect on decreased appetite can occur when fenfluramine is combined with other anti-epileptic medicines  for example stiripentol. The decrease in weight appears to be dose related. Most subjects resumed weight gain over time while continuing treatment. The patient's weight should be monitored. A benefit risk evaluation should be undertaken prior to commencing treatment with fenfluramine in patients with a history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.Fintepla controlled access programmeA controlled access programme has been created to 1) prevent off-label use in weight management in obese patients and 2) confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla.SomnolenceFenfluramine can cause somnolence. Other central nervous system depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate the somnolence effect of fenfluramine.Suicidal behaviour and ideationSuicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicines in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials with anti-epileptic medicines that did not include fenfluramine has shown a small increased risk of suicidal behaviour and ideation. The mechanism of this risk is not known  and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for fenfluramine. Patients and caregivers of patients should be advised to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation emerge.Serotonin syndromeAs with other serotonergic agents  serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with fenfluramine treatment  particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents (including SSRIs  SNRIs  tricyclic antidepressants  or triptans); with agents that impair metabolism of serotonin such as MAOIs; or with antipsychotics that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular aberrations (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhoea). If concomitant treatment with fenfluramine and other serotonergic agents that may affect the serotonergic systems is clinically warranted  careful observation of the patient is advised  particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.Increased seizure frequencyAs with other anti-epileptic medicines  a clinically relevant increase in seizure frequency may occur during treatment with fenfluramine  which may require adjustment in the dose of fenfluramine and/or concomitant anti-epileptic medicines  or discontinuation of fenfluramine  should the benefit-risk be negative.CyproheptadineCyproheptadine is a potent serotonin receptor antagonist and may therefore decrease the efficacy of fenfluramine. If cyproheptadine is added to treatment with fenfluramine  patients should be monitored for worsening of seizures. If fenfluramine treatment is initiated in a patient taking cyproheptadine  fenfluramine's efficacy may be reduced.GlaucomaFenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Discontinue therapy in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity. Consider discontinuation if there is ocular pain and another cause cannot be determined.Effect of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 inducersCo-administration with strong CYP1A2 inducers or CYP2B6 inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations  which may lower the efficacy of fenfluramine. If co-administration of a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer with fenfluramine is considered necessary  the patient should be monitored for reduced efficacy and a dose increase of fenfluramine could be considered provided that it does not exceed twice the maximum daily dose (52 mg/day). If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with fenfluramine  consider gradual reduction of the fenfluramine dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Effect of CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitorsInitiation of concomitant treatment with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in higher exposure and  therefore  adverse events should be monitored  and a dose reduction may be needed in some patients.Coadministration of a single 0.35 mg/kg dose of fenfluramine with fluvoxamine (a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor) at steady state (50 mg once daily) in healthy volunteers increased the AUC0-t of fenfluramine by a ratio of 2.1-fold and the Cmax by a ratio of 1.2-fold  and decreased the AUC0-t of norfenfluramine by a ratio of 1.3-fold and the Cmax by a ratio of 1.4-fold  as compared to fenfluramine administered alone.Coadministration of a single 0.35 mg/kg dose of fenfluramine with paroxetine (a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor) at steady state (30 mg once daily) in healthy volunteers increased the AUC0-t of fenfluramine by a ratio of 1.8-fold and the Cmax by a ratio of 1.1-fold  and decreased the AUC0-t of norfenfluramine by a ratio of 1.2-fold and the Cmax by a ratio of 1.3-fold  as compared to fenfluramine administered alone.ExcipientsThis medicinal product contains sodium ethyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 215) and sodium methyl para hydroxybenzoate (E 219) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).

Patients with rare glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per the maximum daily dose of 12 mL  that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. This medicinal product contains glucose which may be harmful to the teeth.About BRIVIACT® (brivaracetam) in the EU2BRIVIACT (brivaracetam) is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information.Important Safety Information about BRIVIACT in the EUContraindicationsHypersensitivity to the active substance  other pyrrolidone derivatives or any of the excipients.Special warnings and precautions for useSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in several indications  including BRIVIACT. Patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviour and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers) should be advised to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. BRIVIACT film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance  total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take BRIVIACT. Brivaracetam film-coated tablets  solution for injection/infusion and oral solution contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per tablet/vial/ml respectively  that is to say essentially 'sodium free'. The oral solution contains 168 mg sorbitol (E420) in each ml. Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not take this medicinal product. The oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218)  which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). Brivaracetam oral solution contains propylene glycol (E1520).PosologyNo dose adjustment is needed in adults with impaired renal function. Based on data in adults  no dose adjustment is necessary neither in paediatric patients with impaired renal function. No clinical data are available in paediatric patients with renal impairment. In patients with hepatic impairment  the following adjusted doses  administered in 2 divided doses  approximately 12 hours apart  are recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment: In adults  adolescents and children weighing ≥50 kg  a 50 mg/day starting dose is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 150 mg/day. For adolescents and children weighing from 20 kg to <50 kg  a 1 mg/kg/day starting dose is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 3 mg/kg/day. For children weighing from 10 kg to <20 kg  a 1 mg/kg/day starting dose is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 4 mg/kg/day. No clinical data are available in paediatric patients with hepatic impairment.Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interactionWith co-administration of BRIVIACT 200 mg single dose and ethanol 0.6 g/L continuous infusion in healthy subjects there was no pharmacokinetic interaction  but the effect of alcohol on psychomotor function  attention and memory was doubled. Intake of BRIVIACT with alcohol is not recommended. Limited clinical data are available implying that coadministration of cannabidiol may increase the plasma exposure of brivaracetam  possibly through CYP2C19 inhibition  but the clinical relevance is uncertain. In healthy subjects  co-administration with rifampicin  a strong enzyme-inducer (600 mg/day for 5 days)  decreased BRIVIACT area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) by 45%. Prescribers should consider adjusting the dose of BRIVIACT for patients starting or ending treatment with rifampicin. Other strong enzyme-inducers (such as St John´s wort [Hypericum perforatum]) may also decrease the systemic exposure of BRIVIACT. Therefore  starting or ending treatment with St John's wort should be done with caution. In vitro studies have shown that brivaracetam exhibits little or no inhibition of CYP450 isoforms except for CYP2C19. Brivaracetam may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g.  lansoprazole  omeprazole  diazepam). CYP2B6 induction has not been investigated in vivo and BRIVIACT may decrease plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 (e.g. efavirenz). In vitro studies have also shown that BRIVIACT has inhibitory effects on OAT3. BRIVIACT 200 mg/day may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products transported by OAT3. BRIVIACT plasma concentrations are decreased when co-administered with strong enzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine  phenobarbital  phenytoin) but no dose adjustment is required.Effects on ability to drive and use machinesBRIVIACT  has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machines until they are familiar with the effects of BRIVIACT  on their ability to perform such activities.Undesirable effectsThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with BRIVIACT (reported by >10% of patients) were somnolence (14.3%) and dizziness (11.0%). They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Somnolence and fatigue were reported at higher incidences with increasing dose. Very common adverse reactions (≥1% to <10%) were influenza  decreased appetite  depression  anxiety  insomnia  irritability  convulsion  vertigo  upper respiratory tract infections  cough  nausea  vomiting  constipation and fatigue. Neutropenia has been reported in 0.5% (6/1 099) BRIVIACT patients and 0% (0/459) placebo-treated patients. Four of these patients had decreased neutrophil counts at baseline  and experienced additional decrease in neutrophil counts after initiation of BRIVIACT. None of the six cases were severe  required any specific treatment  led to BRIVIACT discontinuation  or had associated infections. Suicidal ideation was reported in 0.3 % (3/1099) of BRIVIACT treated patients and 0.7 % (3/459) of placebo-treated patients. In short-term clinical studies of BRIVIACT in patients with epilepsy  there were no cases of completed suicide and suicide attempt  however both were reported in the long-term open-label extension studies. Reactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of BRIVIACT patients (9/3022) during clinical development. The safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children from 1 month of age was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults. In the open label  uncontrolled  long-term studies suicidal ideation was reported in 4.7 % of paediatric patients assessed from 6 years onwards (more common in adolescents) compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioural disorders were reported in 24.8 % of paediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority of events were mild or moderate in intensity  were non-serious  and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug. An additional adverse reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity (4.7 %). No specific pattern of adverse event (AE) was identified in children from 1 month to < 4 years of age when compared to older paediatric age groups. No significant safety information was identified indicating the increasing incidence of a particular AE in this age group. As data available in children younger than 2 years of age are limited  brivaracetam is not indicated in this age range. No clinical data are available in neonates.OverdoseThere is limited clinical experience with BRIVIACT overdose in humans. Somnolence and dizziness were reported in a healthy subject taking a single dose of 1 400 mg of BRIVIACT. The following adverse reactions were reported with brivaracetam overdose: nausea  vertigo  balance disorder  anxiety  fatigue  irritability  aggression  insomnia  depression  and suicidal ideation in the post-marketing experience. In general  the adverse reactions associated with brivaracetam overdose were consistent with the known adverse reactions. There is no specific antidote. Treatment of an overdose should include general supportive measures. Since less than 10% of BRIVIACT is excreted in urine  haemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance BRIVIACT clearance.BRIVIACT® and FINTEPLA® are registered trademarks of the UCB Group of Companies.For further information  contact UCB:Global CommunicationsNick FrancisT +44 7769 307745email nick.francis@ucb.comCorporate CommunicationsLaurent SchotsT +32.2.559.92.64email laurent.schots@ucb.comInvestor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

(""CoolCo"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:CLCO / CLCO.OL).Q2 Highlights and Subsequent EventsGenerated total operating revenues of $90.3 million in Q2  compared to $98.6 million for the first quarter of 2023 (""Q1"" or ""Q1 2023"")  the reduction mainly related to the sale of Golar Seal in late March 2023.in late March 2023. Net income of $44.6 million in Q2  compared to $70.1 million for Q1;Achieved average Time Charter Equivalent Earnings (""TCE"") 1 of $81 100 per day for Q2  compared to $83 700  per day for Q1  mainly attributable to a lower variable rate charter that is linked to the spot-market;of $81 100 per day for Q2  compared to $83 700  per day for Q1  mainly attributable to a lower variable rate charter that is linked to the spot-market; Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $59.9 million for Q2  compared to $67.8 million for Q1;of $59.9 million for Q2  compared to $67.8 million for Q1; The Company announced that it has exercised its option to acquire two newbuild 2-stroke LNG carriers from affiliates of EPS Ventures Ltd (“EPS”). The state-of-the-art MEGA LNG carriers (the “Newbuilds”) are scheduled to be delivered from Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries (“HHI”) in Korea in September and December of 2024;On June 28  2023  bank approval was granted for a $70 million increase under the senior secured sustainability linked amortizing term loan (the “$570 million bank facility"")  in addition to a reduction in the interest rate margin under the $570 million bank facility from 275 basis points to 225 basis points;Declared a dividend for Q2 of $0.41 per share  to be paid to shareholders of record on September 11  2023.Richard Tyrrell  CEO  commented:“During the second quarter  we achieved full utilization across the CoolCo fleet and secured well-timed growth through the exercise of our option on two state-of-the-art newbuild MEGA LNG carriers with deliveries in late 2024  newbuild pricing materially below current levels and committed financing in place subject to documentation. By exercising our option to acquire these vessels with scheduled delivery years well in advance of comparable newbuild orders  we are one of the few independent owners with availability in an early period of rapid expected growth in LNG supply. In conjunction with our three existing vessels that come into the charter market in 2023 and 2024  of which two are currently at rates well below prevailing levels  we have a clear path towards the realization of significant incremental value  cashflow  and continued dividend-paying capacity.“With the approach of winter in the Northern Hemisphere  which is typically accompanied by a surge in LNG carrier demand related to both increased gas consumption and additional utilization for floating storage  trading arbitrage involving lengthy voyages to the Far East  and weather-related delays that soak up shipping capacity  the market seems tightly coiled. Moreover  the recent extreme volatility in gas pricing demonstrates a continued emphasis on energy security  as importers continue to put a premium on the commodity and the shipping capacity required to ensure security of supply.“It remains to be seen how the coming winter will ultimately play out  but similar tightness of both cargoes and shipping capacity has historically presaged dramatic inflections in the spot charter market and provided firm support for both rates and charter durations in the more stable time charter market. As owners of modern LNG carriers that will be available for time charter employment through the medium term  we believe that our strategy of combining the certainty of long-term charter coverage with a measured amount of charter market exposure has the potential to shine in the quarters ahead.”1 Refer to 'Appendix A' - Non-GAAP financial measures and definitions  for definitions of these measures and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure.Financial HighlightsThe table below sets forth certain key financial information for Q2 2023  Q1 2023  1H 2023 and 1H 2022  split between Successor and Predecessor periods  as defined below.Q2 2023 Q1 2023 1H 2023 1H 2022 (in thousands of $  except TCE) Successor Successor Successor Successor Predecessor Total Time and voyage charter revenues 82 071 91 168 173 239 49 822 37 289 87 111 Total operating revenues 90 316 98 649 188 965 56 892 43 456 100 348 Operating income 45 484 52 022 97 506 25 631 27 728 53 359 Net income 44 646 70 132 114 778 17 659 23 244 40 903 Adjusted EBITDA1 59 894 67 814 127 708 33 527 33 473 67 000 Average daily TCE1 (to the closest $100) 81 100 83 700 82 500 60 500 57 100 59 100Note: As noted previously  the commencement of operations and funding of CoolCo and the acquisition of its initial tri-fuel diesel electric (""TFDE"") LNG carriers  The Cool Pool Limited and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited (""Golar"") were completed in a phased process. It commenced with the funding of CoolCo on January 27  2022 and concluded with the acquisition of the LNG carrier and FSRU management organization on June 30  2022  with vessel acquisitions taking place on different dates over that period. Results for the six months that commenced January 1  2022 and ended June 30  2022 have therefore been split between the period prior to the funding of CoolCo and various phased acquisitions of vessel and management entities (the ""Predecessor"" period) and the period subsequent to the various phased acquisitions (the ""Successor"" period). The combined results are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and consist of the aggregate of selected financial data of the Successor and Predecessor periods. No other adjustments have been made to the combined presentation. We cannot adequately benchmark the operating results for the six month period ended June 30  2023 against the previous period reported in our comparative unaudited condensed consolidated and combined carve-out financial statements without combining the applicable Successor and Predecessor periods and do not believe that reviewing the results of the periods in isolation would be useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding our overall operating performance.LNG Market ReviewThe average Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") for the Quarter was $11.06/MMBtu compared to $17.05/MMBtu for Q1 2023. The Quarter commenced with Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $14.31/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $58 500 per day. The Quarter concluded with TTF at $10.91/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $69 250 per day.The LNG market experienced typical seasonal weakness and relatively lower prices during the quarter  reaching price parity with oil for the first time since before the invasion of Ukraine. Shorter haul voyages to southern hemisphere markets increased  as is customary for the time of year. LNG volumes into Europe remained elevated by historic standards  as LNG replaces Russian pipeline gas and filled onshore storage. European inventory levels reached 78% by the end of the quarter and ~90% today. While the impact of these factors on the LNG carrier spot market was pronounced  the spot market continued to be populated almost entirely by sublets and this only affected CoolCo because of a single remaining variable rate charter. Owner-controlled vessels  of which very few are coming into the charter market in the short-term  have remained focused on time charters of 12 months or longer  where terms have remained largely stable at rates well above those prevailing in recent years  as charterers look to ensure access to carriers through the critical winter season in the northern hemisphere.With the winter approaching  the supply of LNG carriers available for term employment remains minimal. The recent extreme volatility in LNG commodity pricing is indicative of a very tight supply/demand balance and the relative fragility of global supply chains still adapting to the sudden removal of large volumes of Russian pipeline gas that previously provided a significant proportion of the EU’s energy needs. Whether as a result of geopolitical developments  labor action  industrial issues  or the weather or congestion-related issues that the industry experiences with some regularity  it is clear that the fast-growing LNG market remains highly dynamic. In this environment  importers are prioritizing certainty of access to both the LNG molecules and the transportation capacity  rather than managing towards maximal efficiency and risking being short gas at a critical juncture. We continue to expect that term rates will remain strong and with the potential of sharp seasonal upswing in the spot market  we expect to fix our vessel coming available in September 2023 on attractive terms.Operational ReviewCoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with no technical off-hire during the Quarter  resulting in a Q2 fleet utilization of 100%  unchanged from Q1. There are no drydocks planned for 2023  with the next drydock expected during the second quarter of 2024.Business DevelopmentIn June 2023  CoolCo signed contracts with HD Hyundai Global Service  a ship service subsidiary of HD Hyundai Group  to retrofit five LNG carriers with sub-coolers for LNG boil-off reliquefaction units. The contract value is approximately $10.0 million per vessel.On June 28  2023  the Company announced that it had exercised its option to acquire two newbuild 2-stroke LNG carriers from affiliates of EPS. The Newbuilds are scheduled to be delivered from HHI in Korea in September and December of 2024. Each of the two Newbuilds is being acquired for an amount of approximately $234 million. The initial option exercise price was $56.9 million per vessel  resulting in a total of $113.8 million paid to EPS on July  3 2023. The Newbuilds  named Kool Tiger and Kool Panther  are expected to be funded with a combination of cash on hand  including cash that was recently released from the sale of the Golar Seal  and committed debt financing.CoolCo is in discussions with multiple potential charterers seeking work for the Newbuilds.Financing and LiquidityIn June 2023  the Company announced that the syndicate of existing lenders in the $570 million bank facility approved an increase in the debt amount of $70.0 million and a reduction of the interest rate margin from 275 basis points to 225 basis points. The $570 million bank facility's underlying  secured overnight financing rate (""SOFR"") exposure is fully hedged and the scheduled amortization has been adjusted proportionally for the increased size. The additional debt funding under this $570 million bank facility will fund the LNGe conversion of five vessels  including retrofits with sub-coolers for LNG boil-off reliquefaction under the recently announced contract with HD Hyundai Global Service.As of June 30  2023 CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $309.4 million and total short and long-term debt  net of deferred finance charges  amounted to $1 063.9 million. Total Contractual Debt1 stood at $1 179.4 million  which comprised of $504.4 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027  $481.3 million in respect of the four-vessel bank financing facility maturing in May 2029 (the “$520 million term loan facility”)  and $193.8 million in respect of the two sale and leaseback facilities maturing in the first quarter of 2025 (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin).During Q2  we entered into further floating interest rate (SOFR) swap agreements for a notional amount of $40.0 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility. Overall  the Company’s interest rate on its debt is fixed or hedged for approximately 90% of the notional debt  adjusting for existing cash on hand  but excluding cash that was earmarked for the option exercise of the Newbuilds.Corporate and Other MattersAs of June 30  2023  CoolCo had 53 688 462 shares issued and outstanding. Of these  31 254 390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22 434 072 (41.8%) were publicly owned.In line with the Company’s variable dividend policy  the Board has declared a Q2 dividend of $0.41 per ordinary share. The record date is September 11  2023 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around September 18  2023  while due to the implementation of Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway  the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or about September 22  2023.OutlookSince the end of the Quarter  TTF has increased to $12/MMBtu and TFDE spot rates have increased to $120 000 per day.In the coming years  the global supply of LNG is set to increase by more than 50% on the basis of projects that have already reached FID  of which at least 40 mtpa of capacity has reached FID in 2023 alone  equal to approximately 10% of total 2022 LNG production. In understanding the current 51% order book-to-fleet ratio (by volume)  it is critical to understand that the order book has overwhelmingly been built on the basis of long-term contracts to service new liquefaction facilities  with the timing and quantity of their deliveries intended to match the commencement of new production. Furthermore  to the extent that project development delays result in vessels delivering to their charterers before their intended startup time  we would expect to see a dynamic similar to that which has recently prevailed  in which the market is sharply bifurcated between charterers seeking to fill interim periods in the spot market and owners such as CoolCo who are in a position to offer multi-year time charters. A number of additional liquefaction projects remain under development across North America and the Middle East in particular  but also in a wide variety of other geographies as there remains a strong and widespread desire to decarbonize by substituting LNG for the vast amounts of coal still being consumed  particularly in emerging markets.Among LNG carriers currently on the water  the older  less efficient vessels in the charter market are expected to face growing competitive pressure over time  particularly among the steam turbine vessels that continue to make up over 30% of the global fleet by volume. The imposition of the IMO’s carbon intensity indicator (“CII”) rules from the beginning of this year  as well as forthcoming European carbon pricing set to come into effect next year  are set to increase the relative advantage of modern  efficient TFDE and 2-stroke tonnage such as those in the CoolCo fleet.The limited supply of modern vessels available for time charter employment through the medium term is concentrated among a small number of owners  including CoolCo. Given the improved bargaining position afforded by a combination of scarcity and concentration  such owners have remained focused primarily on longer-term charters that would bridge the period from now until the next wave of LNG volumes arrives in 2026-2027. A newbuild vessel ordered today would be subject to an approximately 4-year lead time and a purchase price exceeding $260 million  limiting the likelihood of unforeseen newbuild tonnage during that period while further supporting the benchmark against which the overall fleet is priced.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release and any other written or oral statements made by us in connection with this press release include forward-looking statements.

On January 26  2022  CoolCo entered into various agreements (the ""Vessel SPA"") with Golar  as amended on February 25  2022  pursuant to which CoolCo acquired all of the outstanding shares of nine of Golar’s wholly-owned subsidiaries on various dates in March and April 2022. Eight of these entities were each the registered or disponent owner or lessee of the following modern LNG carriers: Crystal  Ice  Bear  Frost  Glacier  Snow  Kelvin and Seal (disposed subsequently). The Cool Pool Limited was the entity responsible for the marketing of these LNG carriers. For CoolCo  for three and six month periods ended June 30  2022  the successor period reflects the period beginning from January 27  2022 with the closing of CoolCo’s Norwegian equity raise and the date CoolCo operations substantially commenced and were considered meaningful. Vessel SPA acquisition dates were staggered reflecting results  as the successor  from the date CoolCo obtained control of the respective vessel entities. (2) Predecessor period includes results derived from the carve-out of historical operations from Golar entities acquired by CoolCo as part of the Vessel SPA and ManCo SPA until the day before the

Monitors the BusinessIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP)  this earnings release and the associated investor presentation and discussion contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures which are included in the table below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business  enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance  and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP  and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are not uniformly defined by all companies  and may not be comparable with similar titles  measures and disclosures used by other companies. The reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.Non-GAAP measure Closest equivalent US GAAP measure Adjustments to reconcile to primary financial statements prepared under US GAAP Rationale for adjustments Performance Measures Adjusted EBITDA Net income +/- Other non-operating income +/- Net financial expense  representing: Interest income  Interest expense  Losses on derivative instruments and Other financial items  net +/- Income taxes + Depreciation and amortization - Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities - charter agreements  net Increases the comparability of total business performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies by removing the impact of other non-operating income  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and liabilities -charter agreements  net  financing and tax items. Average daily TCE Time and voyage charter revenues - Voyage  charter hire and commission expenses  net The above total is then divided by calendar days less scheduled off-hire days. - Measure of the average daily net revenue performance of a vessel. - Standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in the vessel’s net revenue performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e. spot charters  time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessel may be employed between the periods. - Assists management in making decisions regarding the deployment and utilization of its fleet and in evaluating financial performance. Liquidity measures Total Contractual Debt Total debt (current and non-current)  net of deferred finance charges + VIE Consolidation and fair value adjustments upon acquisition + Deferred Finance Charges We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities (for the vessels Ice and Kelvin). This means that on consolidation  our contractual debt is eliminated and replaced with the Lessor VIEs’ debt. Contractual debt represents our actual debt obligations under our various financing arrangements before consolidating the Lessor VIEs. The measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and the split of our debt (current and non-current) based on our underlying contractual obligations. Total Company Cash CoolCo cash based on GAAP measures: + Cash and cash equivalents + Restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) - VIE restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) We consolidate lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities.

The balance increased by € 1.0 million in the period mainly explained by:A balance sheet reclassification made in Q1 2023 related to a legal claim part of an acquired company in 2022 from Trade and other payables to Provisions of € 1.1 million. The legal claim had in first half year a € 0.1 utilization for legal fees incurred.A legal claim settled in Q2 2023 for € 0.4 million with a related release of € 0.6 million.

The fair value measurement of warrants is as follows:The Public Warrants are listed at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange; the listed warrant price at the end of a reporting period is applied. This is a Level 1 valuation technique. The listed warrant price moved from € 0.20 at 31 December 2022 to € 0.02 at 30 June 2023.The terms and conditions of the Founder Warrants are closely comparable to those of the Public Warrants. The Group applies the market price of the listed Public Warrants at the end of a reporting period to measure the liability regarding the Founder Warrants. This is a Level 2 valuation technique. Besides the market price of the Public Warrants no other inputs are used.Public and founder warrants14 BorrowingsBorrowings as at 30 June 2023 are mainly comprised of Senior secured bonds of € 200.8 million (31 December 2022: € 199.8 million) and Debt to credit institutions amounting to € 6.0 million (31 December 2022: € 9.5 million). As at 30 June 2023  the Senior secured bonds have been reclassified from non-current to current with a maturity date within the next 12 months.During first half of 2023  increase in senior secured bonds is related to amortisation of capitalized transaction cost. The decrease in debt to credit institutions in the same period is due to repayments in line with contractual terms.Borrowings of the Group are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The fair values of these instruments are not materially different from their carrying values.15 Income taxIncome tax expense is recognised at an amount determined by multiplying the profit (loss) before tax for the interim reporting period by management’s best estimate of the weighted-average annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year  adjusted for the tax effect of certain items recognised in full in the interim period. As such  the effective tax rate in the interim financial statements may differ from management’s estimate of the effective tax rate for the annual financial statements.The Group’s consolidated effective tax rate for the six months ended 30 June 2023 was negative 23 8 %. The main contributors to the effective tax rate deviating from the Company’s tax rate is the non-recognition of available tax losses  non-deductible expenses and an identified error related to previous year resulting in a derecognition of a deferred tax asset of € 1.5 million.The divestment of the social card games portfolio includes a € 1.3 million deferred tax liability  which materializes at the moment of completion of the transaction.16 Earnings per shareBasic loss per shareBasic profit/(loss) per sharein €30 June 2023 30 June 2022 Total basic profit/(loss) per share attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the company (0.19) (1.30)Profit/(loss) in calculating profit/(loss) per sharein millions of €30 June 2023 30 June 2022 Loss from operations as presented in the statement of profit or loss (22.1) (144.8) Less: Loss from operations attributable to non-controlling interests (0.4) 0.1 Loss attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the company used in calculating basic earnings per share: (22.5) (144.7)Weighted average number of shares used as the denominatorin number of shares30 June 2023 30 June 2022 Weighted average number of ordinary shares used as the denominator in calculating basic loss per share 119 495 416 111 624 272Diluted loss per shareThe dilutive potential common shares are not taken into account in the periods for which there is a loss as the effect would be antidilutive.Diluted profit per sharein €30 June 2023 30 June 2022 Total diluted profit/(loss) per share attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the company (0.14) (0.95)Weighted average number of shares used as the denominatorin number of shares30 June 2023 30 June 2022 Weighted average number of ordinary shares used as the denominator in calculating diluted loss per share 160 792 284 152 697 49917 Subsequent eventsCancellation of Treasury sharesOn 23 August 2023 Azerion announced the completion of the cancellation of 58 690 961 of its ordinary shares held in treasury in line with the resolution of the company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 15 June 2023.After the cancellation  a total of 2 906 088 Azerion ordinary shares will remain held in treasury for purposes including employee bonus schemes  earn outs from previous acquisitions of the Company and other general corporate purposes.As of 25 August 2023 the number of shares listed and traded on Euronext Amsterdam equates to 122 870 787  reflecting the cancelled treasury shares.Completion of the social card games portfolio divestmentOn 28 August 2023 Azerion completed the sale of its social card games portfolio to Playtika Holding Corp.The sale has estimated total proceeds of approximately € 100 million with a potential maximum earnout up to € 150 million.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the asset purchase agreement  the remaining cash proceeds relating to the performance based earnout and other contractual terms will be received in approximately 15 months’ time.The earnout consideration is based on the Adjusted EBITDA  as defined in the asset purchase agreement  of the social card games portfolio for the period running from 1 October 2023 until 30 September 2024 (the “Earnout Period”)  and calculated by multiplying the incremental Adjusted EBITDA of the social card games portfolio above the ""Baseline"" (as defined below) by a multiple of between 6 and 7 (both inclusive); the specific multiple to be applied is contingent upon the revenue growth of the social card games portfolio achieved during the Earnout Period. The ""Baseline"" is defined as the last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA on a carve-out basis of approximately € 13.5 million.DefinitionsAdjusted EBITDA represents operating Profit / (Loss) excluding depreciation  amortization  impairment of non-current assets  restructuring and acquisition related expenses and other items at management discretion.Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net revenueAverage gross revenue per million processed ad requests from the advertising auction platform is calculated by dividing gross advertising revenue by a million of advertisement requests running through advertising auction platform Improve Digital.

The non-IFRS financial measures  along with comparable IFRS measures  are used by Azerion’s management to evaluate the business performance and are useful to investors. They may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as presented by other companies  nor should they be considered as an alternative to the historical financial results or other indicators of Azerion Group N.V.’s cash flow based on IFRS. Even though the non-IFRS financial measures are used by management to assess Azerion Group N.V.’s financial position  financial results and liquidity and these types of measures are commonly used by investors  they have important limitations as analytical tools  and the recipients should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Azerion Group N.V.’s financial position or results of operations as reported under IFRS.For all definitions and reconciliations of non-IFRS financial measures please also refer to www.azerion.com/investors.This report may contain forward-looking non-IFRS financial measures. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-IFRS financial measures to the most comparable IFRS financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-IFRS financial measures to the most comparable IFRS financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Azerion. Moreover  estimating such IFRS financial measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-IFRS financial measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable IFRS financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Azerion Group N.V.’s consolidated financial statements.This communication does not constitute an offer to sell  or a solicitation of an offer to buy  any securities or any other financial instruments.ContactInvestor Relations: ir@azerion.com Media relations: press@azerion.com",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.54,0.17,0.29,True,English,"['interim Q2', 'H1 2023 results', 'Azerion', 'social card games portfolio', 'Azerion Group N.V.', 'Net revenue Operating profit', 'EBITDA Net revenue growth', 'higher gross profit', 'asset purchase agreement', 'AI-integrated bidding system', 'open market auctions', 'lifetime engageable collectables', 'De-SPAC related expenses', 'ongoing cost savings', 'annualized cost savings', 'additional contextual content', 'Total operating expenses', 'premium games segments', 'Azerion Smart Bidding', 'Azerion Smart Content', 'initial cash consideration', 'EBITDA growth Group', 'operating activities', 'total consideration', 'expected savings', 'Zoomin content', 'operating loss', 'Cash flow', 'higher amortization', 'Platform growth', 'foreign exchange', 'January 2023 baseline', 'restructuring costs', 'customary adjustments', 'income tax', 'remaining proceeds', 'Vlyby technology', 'Habbo X', 'metaverse environment', 'blockchain technology', 'Cool Cats', 'full year', 'Financial results', 'Umut Akpinar', 'Financial overview', 'higher margins', 'Adjusted EBITDA', 'Platform segment', 'significant progress', 'previous acquisitions', 'completion date', 'Platform business', 'Increased earnings', '8 acquisitions', 'integrations', 'improved', 'Highlights', 'Q2', 'effects', 'H2', 'Sale', 'earnout', 'performance', 'maximum', 'terms', 'Gain', 'Launch', 'pricing', 'publishers', 'monetisation', 'Alpha', 'play', 'brands', 'Miffy', 'audiences', 'NFT', 'guidance', 'H1', 'KPIs', 'millions', 'YTD', 'Message', 'CEO', 'Company', 'operations', 'benefits', 'work', 'profitability', 'divestment', 'synergies', 'achievements', 'strategy', 'quarter', 'consolidations', '55', '€']",2023-08-31,2023-09-01,globenewswire.com

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance.
