Many businesses we work with selling directly to consumers also find customers have increased expectations around sustainability and want to buy from companies that can demonstrate what they are doing in this space.Businesses now need to develop a sustainability plan covering everything from resource efficiency to supply chain  and this must be supported with an implementation roadmap.The transition to a low-carbon economy and greener future is a journey and not something that will happen overnight.If you are a business owner or entrepreneur  no matter what stage of the sustainability journey you are on  whether it is initial planning or implementation  Enterprise Ireland is ready to support client companies on their green transition.We have developed a new Green Transition Webinar focusing on decarbonisation's opportunities  challenges and benefits.This eight-part series starts on September 6 and will focus on several aspects of the sustainability journey – from initial planning and capability building – to investment  research and innovation  and developing new products and processes.The first webinar will focus on ‘What does a climate action journey look like?’  and attendees will hear from Paul Murphy of Climeaction  an industry expert with extensive experience in industrial energy efficiency and decarbonisation of manufacturing organisations.
