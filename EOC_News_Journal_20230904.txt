Many businesses we work with selling directly to consumers also find customers have increased expectations around sustainability and want to buy from companies that can demonstrate what they are doing in this space.Businesses now need to develop a sustainability plan covering everything from resource efficiency to supply chain  and this must be supported with an implementation roadmap.The transition to a low-carbon economy and greener future is a journey and not something that will happen overnight.If you are a business owner or entrepreneur  no matter what stage of the sustainability journey you are on  whether it is initial planning or implementation  Enterprise Ireland is ready to support client companies on their green transition.We have developed a new Green Transition Webinar focusing on decarbonisation's opportunities  challenges and benefits.This eight-part series starts on September 6 and will focus on several aspects of the sustainability journey – from initial planning and capability building – to investment  research and innovation  and developing new products and processes.The first webinar will focus on ‘What does a climate action journey look like?’  and attendees will hear from Paul Murphy of Climeaction  an industry expert with extensive experience in industrial energy efficiency and decarbonisation of manufacturing organisations. This discussion will offer advice and insights from his work with some of the world’s largest companies across the food and dairy  beverages  manufacturing and life science sectors.The second instalment will focus on SMEs  particularly those at the beginning of their sustainability journey  and participants will learn about the SME Climate Hub  a one-stop shop where they can get free tools to measure emissions  take climate action and report progress.The series will focus on other important topics  including green finance  green skills  sustainability reporting ESG  becoming a B Corp and the circular economy. We will look specifically at the policy  regulatory and business focus on net zero emissions by 2050.Each webinar will hear from industry experts such as Brian O'Kennedy from Clearstream Solutions and Ingrid de Doncker of Future Planet and will also feature an Enterprise Ireland client company  such as Urban Volt and Strong Roots.Enterprise Ireland is ready to support client companies in developing innovative responses to meet the demands and opportunities that sustainable business offers.

Georges Rawadi has a genuine passion for seeking and creating new business opportunities.On May 5th  2023  the Company announced voluntary delisting of its American Depositary Shares representing ordinary shares (""ADSs"") from the Nasdaq Global Market. Delisting was effective as of July 20  2023. The Company continues to be listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Paris.On August 24  2023  the Company announced that it has obtained commitments from Fortress  Tolefi and other longstanding existing shareholders to subscribe to a capital increase of up to €9.8 million in 2 tranches: A first tranche of 2.0 million was disbursed in the context of authorized capital as of September 4  2023; and A second tranche to be subscribed by Fortress is subject to the approval by the extraordinary shareholders' meeting. Following this private placement  the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient  based on the current scope of activities  to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the end of the fourth quarter of 2024.First Half 2023 and recent operational highlights:Short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA) non-gene edited technology During this first half of 2023  we have collected and presented data validating our shRNA multiplexing approach: We developed a micro-RNA (miRNA)-based multiplex shRNA platform designed for easy  efficient  and tunable downregulation of up to four target genes simultaneously; We showed that the downregulation of each target gene could be fine-tuned  from a moderate downregulation up to a functional knock-out  without the need of gene editing thereby avoiding associated potential safety issues; The plug-and-play design of our platform is designed to allow swapping of each target sequence without affecting the performance of the technology and streamlining of the generation of engineered adoptive T-cell therapies; To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach  we have been able to simultaneous knock-down in CAR T-cells several genes involved in different cellular processes such as alloreactivity (CD3?)  cell persistence (ß2M  CIITA)  T-cell exhaustion (PD-1  LAG-3)  or ligand-induced apoptosis (CD95); Data were presented at the World Oncology Cell Therapy Congress in Boston  US (April 25-26  2023) and at the CAR-TCR Summit in Boston  US (August 29 September 1).During this first half of 2023  we have collected and presented data validating our shRNA multiplexing approach:NKG2D-based CAR T-cells and multi-specific CAR T-cell platform During this first half of 2023  we have published data validating our NKG2D-based CAR T-cell approach and presented data from our multi-specific CAR T-cell platform: Results from 16 patients treated in the dose-escalation segment of the hematological arm of the Phase I THINK trial were published in The Lancet Haematology Journal (Lancet Haematol. 2023 Mar;10(3):e191-e202) and provided proof-of-concept for targeting NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) with CAR T-cell therapy; We have developed different CD19/NKG2DL multi-specific CAR T-cells  utilizing both tandem and dual NKG2D-based CARs that encompass the extracellular domain of the natural NKG2D receptor fused to an anti-CD19 scFv  or co-expressed with an anti-CD19 CAR  respectively; The majority of our CD19/NKG2DL multi-specific CAR T-cell candidates were able to secrete cytokines  proliferate  and eliminate acute lymphoblastic leukemia tumor cells lacking the CD19 antigen in vitro . Interestingly  some of these multi-specific CAR T-cells displayed a better in vitro functionality against wild-type leukemia tumor cells expressing the CD19 antigen as compared to CD19-specific single targeting CAR T-cells  highlighting the potential of our approach against both CD19 positive and CD19 negative cancer cells; First in vivo data suggest that our CD19/NKG2DL multi-specific CAR T-cell candidates have an enhanced anti-tumor efficacy against heterogeneous lymphoma tumors as compared to currently existing treatment options; We are currently developing several NKG2D-based multi-specific CAR T-cells for the treatment of diverse solid cancers where there is a high heterogeneity in antigen expression; Data were presented at the Immuno-Oncology Summit Europe 2023 held in London  UK (June 20-22  2023).During this first half of 2023  we have published data validating our NKG2D-based CAR T-cell approach and presented data from our multi-specific CAR T-cell platform:Upcoming anticipated milestonesMore data and evidence in the context of the multi-specific CAR platform and shRNA multiplexing approach in H2 2023  with the aim of a clinical evaluation of assets and initiation of clinical trials either by the Company and/or through strategic partnerships afterwards;Relocation  in H2 2023  into a new research facility which fits better its current needs after the strategic shift. The Company will remain headquartered at the Axis Parc  Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium but with its new business location at Dumont 9.Upcoming ConferencesThe Company will take part in the 4th International Conference on Lymphocyte Engineering (ICLE) in Munich (September 12-14) and the annual congress of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) in San Diego (November 1-5)  as well at several business conferences in the second half of 2023.First Half 2023 Financial ResultsKey financial figures for the first half of 2023  compared with the first half of 2022 and full year 2022  are summarized below:Selected key financial figures (€ millions) Half Year 30 June 2023 Half Year 30 June 2022 Full Year 31 December 2022 Revenue Research and development expenses (2.1) (10.5) (18.9) General and administrative expenses (3.7) (6.2) (10.5) Change in fair value of contingent consideration 1.1 14.7 Impairment of Oncology intangible assets (35.1) Other income/(expenses) 2.1 1.6 9.0 Operating loss (3.7) (14.1) (40.9) Loss for the period/year (3.7) (14.1) (40.9) Net cash used in operations (8.3) (16.3) (28.0) Cash and cash equivalents 5.0 14.4 12.4The Company's license and collaboration agreements generated no revenue in the first half of 2023 similar to the first half of 2022.The Research and Development (R&D) expenses have decreased primarily due to the Company's decision to discontinue some of preclinical programs and manufacturing and clinical study activities after the Company's decision to adopt and implement a new business strategy. Furthermore  there has been a decrease of employee expenses and related travel costs which is mainly related to headcount reduction through 2022  to support the Group's reorganization around preclinical and clinical programs  as well as a decrease of the expenses associated with share-based payments (non-cash expenses) related to the warrant plan offered to the Company's employees  managers and directors.General and Administrative (G&A) expenses were €3.7 million in 2023 as compared to €6.2 million in 2022. This decrease is primarily related to lower insurances costs  the decrease of employee expenses due to headcount reduction and management changes through 2022 to support the Company's reorganization and the decrease of the expenses associated with the share-based payments (non-cash expenses) related to the warrants plan offered to the Company's employees  managers and directors.As of June 30  2023  there was no change in fair value of the contingent consideration and other financial liabilities as Management has determined that there have been no event (such as a firm sublicense or collaboration contract) that increases the probability of the projected future cash outflow due to Celdara Medical  LLC and Dartmouth College  indicating that the probability is remote  similar to December 31  2022.Regarding the other income/other expenses  the Company recorded €2.1 million in net other income for the first half of 2023 compared to a net other income of €1.6 million for the first half of 2022. The net other income for the first half of 2023 is primarily due to the gain on the sale of certain fixed assets to Cellistic for €1.1 million and grant income from the Walloon Region of €0.8 million.Net loss was €3.7 million  or €(0.17) per share  for the first half of 2023 compared to a net loss of €14.1 million  or €(0.62) per share  for the same period of 2022.Net cash used in operations  was €8.3 million for the first half of 2023 compared to €16.3 million for the first half of 2022. The decrease of €8.0 million is primarily driven by the sale of the manufacturing activities in 2022 combined with global decrease on preclinical and clinical activities  insurance costs  headcount  management changes costs and associated impact on the change in working capital.As of June 30  2023  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €5.0 million. No capital increase has occurred in the first half of 2023.As of June 30  2023  the total number of basic shares outstanding were 22.6 million similar to December 31  2022.Conference Call and Webcast DetailsA conference call will be held on Tuesday 5th of September at 1:00 p.m. CET 7:00 a.m. EDT discuss half year 2023 financial results and provide an update on the Company's recent changes and upcoming milestones.Participants may access the conference call by dialing +1-877-407-9716 or +1-201-493-6779 (United States  International)  +32 (0) 800-73-904 (Belgium Fixed) or +32 (0) 800-73-566 (Belgium Mobile).

This proje c t  developed on a former brownfield that belong ed to PSA  turns into reality a shared ambition of high standards in terms of energy approach and ecology: preexisting trees were saved and over 11   000 new ones will be planted following the principles of the (( Miyawaki )) forest .Photo credit: Agence FrancThanks to the road interchange connecting the French“Nationale 814” – the ring road of Caen – and and“A13”  which links Caen to le Havre and to Paris  Mondeville (14) benefits from a strategic location for logistics activities. This location was selected on purpose by ARGAN and CARREFOUR to welcome a new logistics platform of 82 000 sq.m.A quarter of the building will have a cold area  the rest being dedicated to storing products at an ambient temperature. This site will also include 2 500 sq.m in offices and spaces with a social purpose. The delivery of the whole program is scheduled for the Summer of 2024.As for all new ARGAN developments  this site will be labelled Aut0nom®. By installing a photovoltaic power plant on the roof  together with batteries for energy storage  all of the site's needs in terms of heating  cooling and lighting will be met thanks to the green energy that will be generated and used locally. The heating and cooling of the site will be ensured through electric air/water heat pumps that are far less energy-intensive than gas heaters  tleading to CO2 emissions cut by a factor of 12.More than 11   000 trees plant ed on a depolluted former brownfieldThis project is taking place on a former brownfield of the company covering 30 hectares depolluted beforehand. The re-usage of this real-estate field helps limit soil artificialisation and the ecological impact of this operation.The project also includes a large-scale plan to reforest the field and make spaces greener overall.Existing trees were saved  and 11 000 new ones – selected from local species – will be planted following the Miyawaki forest principles. Overall  41% of the land will be dedicated to green spaces.The combined action of an Aut0nom warehouse with the reforestation of the site will turn the project of Mondeville into an exemplary operation regarding its carbon footprint. It will also help target a BREEAM“Very Good” certification  as well as a“Biodivercity” label.Jean-Claude Le Lan  Founder and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of ARGAN:“ARGAN is pursuing and strengthening its historic partnership with CARREFOUR  its main tenant client with over 20 running logistics sites. The creation of this joint-venture  under which future logistics real estate developments with CARREFOUR will take place  is a win-win contract between two complementary entities”.Financial calendar 2023 (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)October 2: 2023 3rd quarter salesFinancial calendar 2024January 3: 2023 Annual SalesJanuary 18: 2023 Annual Results March 21: Annual General MeetingAbout A RGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT.As at June 30  2023  ARGAN's portfolio amounted to 3.5 million sq.m  comprising approximately 100 warehouses located exclusively in France  valued at €3.6 billion.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance.
