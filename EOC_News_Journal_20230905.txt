between two wallets on different public blockchains; and between a public and private blockchain network ” Swift said.As part of its ongoing experiments  Swift published a white paper in 2021 that measured the potential impact of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and how the company could support the financial community as new currencies are developed.Swift also released its proposal for a global CBDC network after an eight-month experiment on different technologies and currencies.Participants collaborating in the latest experiment included ANZ  BNP Paribas  BNY Mellon and Citi.Other participants included Clearstream  Euroclear  Lloyds Banking Group  SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) and The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation.ANZ banking services lead Nigel Dobson said the bank “is actively exploring the use of decentralised networks and tokenisation via a ‘test and learn’ approach  particularly in underserved markets such as the trading of nature-based assets.""“Establishing interoperability between existing financial market infrastructure and multiple blockchains will be critical for greater adoption so we were naturally delighted to participate in this experiment with the Swift community "" he said.ANZ also participated in a recent Reserve Bank of Australia and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) pilot project  which is exploring the use cases of CBDCs and how they could be applied across the Australian economy.The RBA and DFCRC results concluded the need for an Australian CBDC is “likely to be some years away”  however did identify “a number of avenues for future research”.",neutral,0.25,0.74,0.01,positive,0.66,0.33,0.02,True,English,"['Swift', 'blockchain', 'potential', 'same public distributed ledger technology network', 'Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre', 'Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol', 'ANZ banking services lead', 'Financial messaging system provider', 'central bank digital currencies', 'existing financial market infrastructure', 'SIX Digital Exchange', 'existing financial system', 'unified global market', 'Lloyds Banking Group', 'existing backend systems', 'common connectivity layer', 'recent Reserve Bank', 'The Depository Trust', 'DFCRC) pilot project', 'global CBDC network', 'private blockchain platforms', 'private blockchain network', 'existing Swift connectivity', 'simulated tokenised assets', 'different public blockchains', 'future research', 'messaging standards', 'lits network', 'financial institutions', 'financial community', 'private blockchains', 'multiple public', 'different technologies', 'The RBA', 'Australian CBDC', 'new currencies', 'Swift network', 'blockchain networks', 'nature-based assets', 'latest series', 'minimal disruption', 'broader adoption', 'data privacy', 'operational risk', 'legal liability', 'two wallets', 'white paper', 'potential impact', 'BNP Paribas', 'BNY Mellon', 'Clearing Corporation', 'Nigel Dobson', 'decentralised networks', 'underserved markets', 'multiple blockchains', 'greater adoption', 'Australian economy', 'DFCRC results', 'experimental solution', 'eight-month experiment', 'latest experiment', 'Other participants', 'use cases', 'Swift community', 'ongoing experiments', 'transfer', 'value', 'trial', 'organisation', 'CCIP', 'findings', 'solutions', 'confidence', 'tokens', 'operations', 'report', 'development', 'considerations', 'governance', 'place', 'CBDCs', 'company', 'proposal', 'Citi.', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'SDX', 'tokenisation', 'learn', 'approach', 'trading', 'need', 'number', 'avenues']",2023-09-04,2023-09-05,itnews.com.au

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/file photo Acquire Licensing RightsLONDON  Sept 5 (Reuters) - Regulated financial exchanges are talking about how to capitalise on interest in crypto  an industry group said on Tuesday  but a third of respondents to its latest survey said they had no plans to offer the asset class.Exchanges said they were concerned about a lack of uniform regulatory standards  market volatility and the potential for cybersecurity risks relating to crypto assets  a report from the London-based World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) said.Of 29 exchanges that responded to a survey by the WFE - whose members include U.S.-based Nasdaq (NDAQ.O)  Germany's Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) and Switzerland's SIX Group - 12 offer crypto-related products or services while 17 do not  it said  without naming the respondents.The group said of those with no current crypto-related offerings  just seven planned to introduce them in future  while 10 did not.Cryptocurrency prices plunged in 2022 after a series of collapses at top crypto firms  including FTX  left investors with large losses  prompting lawmakers to step up calls for regulation.Some 38% of the exchanges the WFE surveyed have established  or plan to establish  working groups to focus on crypto-related assets or services.Just over a quarter of respondents said they expect crypto assets to become mainstream in the near future  the WFE said.""Crypto is at the forefront of all of our members' minds and we are in constant dialogue with them about how to capitalise on the new opportunities in the area "" said WFE CEO Nandini Sukumar.Mainstream financial institutions have long expressed interest in the potential for blockchain - the technology behind cryptocurrencies - to be used in the process of issuing and trading traditional financial assets. The tech has  however  yet to be deployed on a major scale.On Monday  the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG.L) said it was looking into using blockchain to build a system ""to raise and transfer capital across asset classes""  but that this would not involve building anything around crypto assets.Reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft; Editing by Tom Wilson and Jan HarveyOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",neutral,0.01,0.95,0.04,negative,0.01,0.17,0.82,True,English,"['Financial exchanges', 'industry survey', 'crypto', 'The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles', 'U.S.-based Nasdaq', 'WFE CEO Nandini Sukumar', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'virtual currency Bitcoin', 'London-based World Federation', 'Mainstream financial institutions', 'current crypto-related offerings', 'traditional financial assets', 'uniform regulatory standards', 'top crypto firms', 'Regulated financial exchanges', 'stock graph', 'crypto-related assets', 'crypto-related products', 'industry group', 'SIX Group', 'crypto assets', 'Dado Ruvic', 'file photo', 'Licensing Rights', 'asset class', 'cybersecurity risks', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Cryptocurrency prices', 'large losses', 'working groups', 'a quarter', 'constant dialogue', 'new opportunities', 'major scale', 'Elizabeth Howcroft', 'Tom Wilson', 'Jan Harvey', 'latest survey', 'near future', '29 exchanges', 'representation', 'front', 'illustration', 'interest', 'Tuesday', 'third', 'respondents', 'plans', 'lack', 'market', 'volatility', 'potential', 'report', 'members', 'NDAQ.', 'Germany', 'Switzerland', 'services', 'series', 'collapses', 'FTX', 'investors', 'lawmakers', 'calls', 'regulation', 'minds', 'area', 'blockchain', 'technology', 'cryptocurrencies', 'process', 'Monday', 'LSEG.', 'system', 'capital', 'Editing']",2023-09-05,2023-09-05,reuters.com

We are eager to see the impact of our research efforts on the future of CAR T-cell treatments  with the goal to broaden the range of cancer indications and tackle the main limitations of current CAR T-cell therapies ” commented Georges Rawadi  Celyad Oncology’s Chief Executive Officer.First Half 2023 and recent corporate highlights:Georges Rawadi was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Company as from April 27  2023. Georges Rawadi is a seasoned executive with over 20 years of experience in pharma/biotech  as research director  business developer  CEO  and board member. He also has insightful knowledge of both the company and the CAR-T space as he spent four years at Celyad Oncology (2014-2018) as Vice-President Business Development & Intellectual Property (“BD & IP”). Georges Rawadi has a genuine passion for seeking and creating new business opportunities.On May 5th  2023  the Company announced voluntary delisting of its American Depositary Shares representing ordinary shares (“ADSs”) from the Nasdaq Global Market. Delisting was effective as of July 20  2023. The Company continues to be listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Paris.On August 24  2023  the Company announced that it has obtained commitments from Fortress  Tolefi and other longstanding existing shareholders to subscribe to a capital increase of up to €9.8 million in 2 tranches: A first tranche of 2.0 million was disbursed in the context of authorized capital as of September 4  2023; and A second tranche to be subscribed by Fortress is subject to the approval by the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting. Following this private placement  the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient  based on the current scope of activities  to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the end of the fourth quarter of 2024.First Half 2023 and recent operational highlights:Short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA) non-gene edited technology – During this first half of 2023  we have collected and presented data validating our shRNA multiplexing approach: We developed a micro-RNA (miRNA)-based multiplex shRNA platform designed for easy  efficient  and tunable downregulation of up to four target genes simultaneously; We showed that the downregulation of each target gene could be fine-tuned  from a moderate downregulation up to a functional knock-out  without the need of gene editing thereby avoiding associated potential safety issues; The plug-and-play design of our platform is designed to allow swapping of each target sequence without affecting the performance of the technology and streamlining of the generation of engineered adoptive T-cell therapies; To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach  we have been able to simultaneous knock-down in CAR T-cells several genes involved in different cellular processes such as alloreactivity (CD3ζ)  cell persistence (β2M  CIITA)  T-cell exhaustion (PD-1  LAG-3)  or ligand-induced apoptosis (CD95); Data were presented at the World Oncology Cell Therapy Congress in Boston  US (April 25-26  2023) and at the CAR-TCR Summit in Boston  US (August 29 – September 1).During this first half of 2023  we have collected and presented data validating our shRNA multiplexing approach: NKG2D-based CAR T-cells and multi-specific CAR T-cell platform – During this first half of 2023  we have published data validating our NKG2D-based CAR T-cell approach and presented data from our multi-specific CAR T-cell platform: Results from 16 patients treated in the dose-escalation segment of the hematological arm of the Phase I THINK trial were published in The Lancet Haematology Journal (Lancet Haematol. 2023 Mar;10(3):e191-e202) and provided proof-of-concept for targeting NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) with CAR T-cell therapy; We have developed different CD19/NKG2DL multi-specific CAR T-cells  utilizing both tandem and dual NKG2D-based CARs that encompass the extracellular domain of the natural NKG2D receptor fused to an anti-CD19 scFv  or co-expressed with an anti-CD19 CAR  respectively; The majority of our CD19/NKG2DL multi-specific CAR T-cell candidates were able to secrete cytokines  proliferate  and eliminate acute lymphoblastic leukemia tumor cells lacking the CD19 antigen in vitro. Interestingly  some of these multi-specific CAR T-cells displayed a better in vitro functionality against wild-type leukemia tumor cells expressing the CD19 antigen as compared to CD19-specific single targeting CAR T-cells  highlighting the potential of our approach against both CD19 positive and CD19 negative cancer cells; First in vivo data suggest that our CD19/NKG2DL multi-specific CAR T-cell candidates have an enhanced anti-tumor efficacy against heterogeneous lymphoma tumors as compared to currently existing treatment options; We are currently developing several NKG2D-based multi-specific CAR T-cells for the treatment of diverse solid cancers where there is a high heterogeneity in antigen expression; Data were presented at the Immuno-Oncology Summit Europe 2023 held in London  UK (June 20-22  2023).During this first half of 2023  we have published data validating our NKG2D-based CAR T-cell approach and presented data from our multi-specific CAR T-cell platform:Upcoming anticipated milestonesMore data and evidence in the context of the multi-specific CAR platform and shRNA multiplexing approach in H2 2023  with the aim of a clinical evaluation of assets and initiation of clinical trials either by the Company and/or through strategic partnerships afterwards;Relocation  in H2 2023  into a new research facility which fits better its current needs after the strategic shift. The Company will remain headquartered at the Axis Parc  Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium but with its new business location at Dumont 9.Upcoming ConferencesThe Company will take part in the 4th International Conference on Lymphocyte Engineering (ICLE) in Munich (September 12-14) and the annual congress of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) in San Diego (November 1-5)  as well at several business conferences in the second half of 2023.First Half 2023 Financial ResultsKey financial figures for the first half of 2023  compared with the first half of 2022 and full year 2022  are summarized below:Selected key financial figures (€ millions) Half Year30 June 2023 Half Year30 June 2022 Full Year31 December 2022 Revenue - - - Research and development expenses (2.1) (10.5) (18.9) General and administrative expenses (3.7) (6.2) (10.5) Change in fair value of contingent consideration - 1.1 14.7 Impairment of Oncology intangible assets - - (35.1) Other income/(expenses) 2.1 1.6 9.0 Operating loss (3.7) (14.1) (40.9) Loss for the period/year (3.7) (14.1) (40.9) Net cash used in operations (8.3) (16.3) (28.0) Cash and cash equivalents 5.0 14.4 12.4The Company’s license and collaboration agreements generated no revenue in the first half of 2023 similar to the first half of 2022.The Research and Development (R&D) expenses have decreased primarily due to the Company’s decision to discontinue some of preclinical programs and manufacturing and clinical study activities after the Company’s decision to adopt and implement a new business strategy. Furthermore  there has been a decrease of employee expenses and related travel costs which is mainly related to headcount reduction through 2022  to support the Group’s reorganization around preclinical and clinical programs  as well as a decrease of the expenses associated with share-based payments (non-cash expenses) related to the warrant plan offered to the Company’s employees  managers and directors.General and Administrative (G&A) expenses were €3.7 million in 2023 as compared to €6.2 million in 2022. This decrease is primarily related to lower insurances costs  the decrease of employee expenses due to headcount reduction and management changes through 2022 to support the Company’s reorganization and the decrease of the expenses associated with the share-based payments (non-cash expenses) related to the warrants plan offered to the Company’s employees  managers and directors.As of June 30  2023  there was no change in fair value of the contingent consideration and other financial liabilities as Management has determined that there have been no event (such as a firm sublicense or collaboration contract) that increases the probability of the projected future cash outflow due to Celdara Medical  LLC and Dartmouth College  indicating that the probability is remote  similar to December 31  2022.Regarding the other income/other expenses  the Company recorded €2.1 million in net other income for the first half of 2023 compared to a net other income of €1.6 million for the first half of 2022. The net other income for the first half of 2023 is primarily due to the gain on the sale of certain fixed assets to Cellistic for €1.1 million and grant income from the Walloon Region of €0.8 million.Net loss was €3.7 million  or €(0.17) per share  for the first half of 2023 compared to a net loss of €14.1 million  or €(0.62) per share  for the same period of 2022.Net cash used in operations  was €8.3 million for the first half of 2023 compared to €16.3 million for the first half of 2022. The decrease of €8.0 million is primarily driven by the sale of the manufacturing activities in 2022 combined with global decrease on preclinical and clinical activities  insurance costs  headcount  management changes costs and associated impact on the change in working capital.As of June 30  2023  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €5.0 million. No capital increase has occurred in the first half of 2023.As of June 30  2023  the total number of basic shares outstanding were 22.6 million similar to December 31  2022.Conference Call and Webcast DetailsA conference call will be held on Tuesday 5th of September at 1:00 p.m. CET / 7:00 a.m. EDT discuss half year 2023 financial results and provide an update on the Company’s recent changes and upcoming milestones.Participants may access the conference call by dialing +1-877-407-9716 or +1-201-493-6779 (United States  International)  +32 (0) 800-73-904 (Belgium Fixed) or +32 (0) 800-73-566 (Belgium Mobile).

This location was selected on purpose by ARGAN and CARREFOUR to welcome a new logistics platform of 82 000 sq.m.A quarter of the building will have a cold area  the rest being dedicated to storing products at an ambient temperature. This site will also include 2 500 sq.m in offices and spaces with a social purpose. The delivery of the whole program is scheduled for the Summer of 2024.As for all new ARGAN developments  this site will be labelled Aut0nom®. By installing a photovoltaic power plant on the roof  together with batteries for energy storage  all of the site’s needs in terms of heating  cooling and lighting will be met thanks to the green energy that will be generated and used locally. The heating and cooling of the site will be ensured through electric air/water heat pumps that are far less energy-intensive than gas heaters  thus leading to CO 2 emissions cut by a factor of 12.More than 11 000 trees planted on a depolluted former brownfieldThis project is taking place on a former brownfield of the company PSA covering 30 hectares depolluted beforehand. The re-usage of this real-estate field helps limit soil artificialisation and the ecological impact of this operation.The project also includes a large-scale plan to reforest the field and make spaces greener overall.Existing trees were saved  and 11 000 new ones – selected from local species – will be planted following the Miyawaki forest principles. Overall  41% of the land will be dedicated to green spaces.The combined action of an Aut0nom warehouse with the reforestation of the site will turn the project of Mondeville into an exemplary operation regarding its carbon footprint. It will also help target a BREEAM “Very Good” certification  as well as a “Biodivercity” label.Jean-Claude Le Lan  Founder and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of ARGAN: “ARGAN is pursuing and strengthening its historic partnership with CARREFOUR  its main tenant client with over 20 running logistics sites. The creation of this joint-venture  under which future logistics real estate developments with CARREFOUR will take place  is a win-win contract between two complementary entities”.Financial calendar 2023 (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)October 2: 2023 3rd quarter salesFinancial calendar 2024January 3: 2023 Annual SalesJanuary 18: 2023 Annual ResultsMarch 21: Annual General MeetingAbout ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT.As at June 30  2023  ARGAN’s portfolio amounted to 3.5 million sq.m  comprising approximately 100 warehouses located exclusively in France  valued at €3.6 billion.

The delivery of the whole program is scheduled for the Summer of 2024.As for all new ARGAN developments  this site will be labelled Aut0nom®. By installing a photovoltaic power plant on the roof  together with batteries for energy storage  all of the site’s needs in terms of heating  cooling and lighting will be met thanks to the green energy that will be generated and used locally. The heating and cooling of the site will be ensured through electric air/water heat pumps that are far less energy-intensive than gas heaters  thus leading to CO 2 emissions cut by a factor of 12.More than 11 000 trees planted on a depolluted formerbrownfieldThis project is taking place on a former brownfield of the company PSA covering 30 hectares depolluted beforehand. The re-usage of this real-estate field helps limit soil artificialisation and the ecological impact of this operation.The project also includes a large-scale plan to reforest the field and make spaces greener overall.Existing trees were saved  and 11 000 new ones – selected from local species – will be planted following the Miyawaki forest principles. Overall  41% of the land will be dedicated to green spaces.The combined action of an Aut0nom warehouse with the reforestation of the site will turn the project of Mondeville into an exemplary operation regarding its carbon footprint. It will also help target a BREEAM “Very Good” certification  as well as a “Biodivercity” label.Jean-Claude Le Lan  Founder and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of ARGAN: “ARGAN is pursuing andstrengtheningits historic partnershipwith CARREFOUR  itsmaintenant client with over 20 running logistics sites. The creation ofthis joint-venture  under which futurelogistics real estate developments with CARREFOUR will take place  is a win-win contractbetweentwo complementary entities”.Financial calendar 2023 (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)October 2: 2023 3rd quarter salesFinancial calendar 2024January 3: 2023 Annual SalesJanuary 18: 2023 Annual ResultsMarch 21: Annual General MeetingAbout ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT.As at June 30  2023  ARGAN’s portfolio amounted to 3.5 million sq.m  comprising approximately 100 warehouses located exclusively in France  valued at €3.6 billion.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s latest Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com .1 Representing 42%  the Directors representing the employees not being taken into account in this calculation  pursuant to article L. 225-18-1 of the French Code of CommerceAttachment,neutral,0.11,0.88,0.01,mixed,0.14,0.25,0.62,True,English,"['new independent director', 'Pascal Touchon', 'Ipsen', 'Board', 'Directors', 'Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program', 'Craig Marks Vice President', 'global, mid-sized biopharmaceutical company', 'successful track record', 'Marc de Garidel', 'differentiated technological platforms', 'other professional commitments', 'last five years', 'Corporate Brand Strategy', 'early development phase', 'reasonable macroeconomic conditions', 'potential future acquisitions', 'necessary regulatory approvals', 'experienced biotech CEO', 'Global Media Relations', 'four independent directors', 'global pharma', 'US biotech', '30-plus years', 'external-innovation strategy', 'Investor Relations', 'management strategy', 'Development Committee', 'development process', 'Pascal Touchon', 'Paul Sekhri', 'director role', 'ATARA Biotherapeutics', 'leadership positions', 'several biotechs', 'seven women1', 'seven men', 'Nomination Committee', 'Audit Committee', 'strong contribution', 'Rare Disease', 'total sales', 'leading biotechnological', 'life-science hubs', 'U.K.', 'U.S.', 'Nicolas Bogler', 'Senior Manager', 'Amy Wolf', 'Ioana Piscociu', 'looking statements', 'current views', 'Such statements', 'future ability', 'similar expressions', 'regulatory filings', 'clinical trial', 'several stages', 'substantial risk', 'significant sums', 'effective nature', 'Other risks', 'actual results', 'favorable results', 'development efforts', 'fourteen directors', 'two directors', 'next Shareholder', 'transformative medicines', 'future events', 'external-growth assumptions', 'historical data', 'competition reasons', 'market share', 'underlying assumptions', 'unknown risks', 'financial targets', 'promising medicine', 'commercial targets', 'generic medicine', '2026 Shareholder', 'PARIS', 'FRANCE', '4 September', 'Ipsen', 'Euronext', 'IPN', 'ADR', 'IPSEY', 'optation', 'Board', 'decision', 'date', 'Novartis', 'Servier', 'graduate', 'INSEAD', 'MBA', 'employees', 'member', 'meeting', 'request', 'ratification', 'remainder', 'term', 'office', 'behalf', 'Chairman', 'involvement', 'Committees', 'ENDS', 'Oncology', 'Neuroscience', 'FY', '100 countries', 'research', 'innovative', 'heart', 'Oxford', 'Cambridge', 'Shanghai', 'China', '5,300 colleagues', 'information', 'Contacts', 'Investors', 'VP', 'Head', 'Communications', 'forward', 'objectives', 'uncertainties', 'performance', 'Use', 'words', 'expects', 'expectations', 'document', 'account', 'parameters', 'facts', 'loss', 'regards', 'safe', 'guarantees']",2023-09-04,2023-09-05,marketscreener.com

We are eager to see the impact of our research efforts on the future of CAR T-cell treatments  with the goal to broaden the range of cancer indications and tackle the main limitations of current CAR T-cell therapies ” commented Georges Rawadi  Celyad Oncology’s Chief Executive Officer.First Half 2023 and recent corporate highlights:Georges Rawadi was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Company as from April 27  2023. Georges Rawadi is a seasoned executive with over 20 years of experience in pharma/biotech  as research director  business developer  CEO  and board member. He also has insightful knowledge of both the company and the CAR-T space as he spent four years at Celyad Oncology (2014-2018) as Vice-President Business Development & Intellectual Property (“BD & IP”). Georges Rawadi has a genuine passion for seeking and creating new business opportunities.On May 5th  2023  the Company announced voluntary delisting of its American Depositary Shares representing ordinary shares (“ADSs”) from the Nasdaq Global Market. Delisting was effective as of July 20  2023. The Company continues to be listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Paris.On August 24  2023  the Company announced that it has obtained commitments from Fortress  Tolefi and other longstanding existing shareholders to subscribe to a capital increase of up to €9.8 million in 2 tranches: A first tranche of 2.0 million was disbursed in the context of authorized capital as of September 4  2023; and A second tranche to be subscribed by Fortress is subject to the approval by the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting. Following this private placement  the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient  based on the current scope of activities  to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the end of the fourth quarter of 2024.First Half 2023 and recent operational highlights:Short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA) non-gene edited technology – During this first half of 2023  we have collected and presented data validating our shRNA multiplexing approach: We developed a micro-RNA (miRNA)-based multiplex shRNA platform designed for easy  efficient  and tunable downregulation of up to four target genes simultaneously; We showed that the downregulation of each target gene could be fine-tuned  from a moderate downregulation up to a functional knock-out  without the need of gene editing thereby avoiding associated potential safety issues; The plug-and-play design of our platform is designed to allow swapping of each target sequence without affecting the performance of the technology and streamlining of the generation of engineered adoptive T-cell therapies; To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach  we have been able to simultaneous knock-down in CAR T-cells several genes involved in different cellular processes such as alloreactivity (CD3ζ)  cell persistence (β2M  CIITA)  T-cell exhaustion (PD-1  LAG-3)  or ligand-induced apoptosis (CD95); Data were presented at the World Oncology Cell Therapy Congress in Boston  US (April 25-26  2023) and at the CAR-TCR Summit in Boston  US (August 29 – September 1).During this first half of 2023  we have collected and presented data validating our shRNA multiplexing approach: NKG2D-based CAR T-cells and multi-specific CAR T-cell platform – During this first half of 2023  we have published data validating our NKG2D-based CAR T-cell approach and presented data from our multi-specific CAR T-cell platform: Results from 16 patients treated in the dose-escalation segment of the hematological arm of the Phase I THINK trial were published in The Lancet Haematology Journal (Lancet Haematol. 2023 Mar;10(3):e191-e202) and provided proof-of-concept for targeting NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) with CAR T-cell therapy; We have developed different CD19/NKG2DL multi-specific CAR T-cells  utilizing both tandem and dual NKG2D-based CARs that encompass the extracellular domain of the natural NKG2D receptor fused to an anti-CD19 scFv  or co-expressed with an anti-CD19 CAR  respectively; The majority of our CD19/NKG2DL multi-specific CAR T-cell candidates were able to secrete cytokines  proliferate  and eliminate acute lymphoblastic leukemia tumor cells lacking the CD19 antigen in vitro. Interestingly  some of these multi-specific CAR T-cells displayed a better in vitro functionality against wild-type leukemia tumor cells expressing the CD19 antigen as compared to CD19-specific single targeting CAR T-cells  highlighting the potential of our approach against both CD19 positive and CD19 negative cancer cells; First in vivo data suggest that our CD19/NKG2DL multi-specific CAR T-cell candidates have an enhanced anti-tumor efficacy against heterogeneous lymphoma tumors as compared to currently existing treatment options; We are currently developing several NKG2D-based multi-specific CAR T-cells for the treatment of diverse solid cancers where there is a high heterogeneity in antigen expression; Data were presented at the Immuno-Oncology Summit Europe 2023 held in London  UK (June 20-22  2023).During this first half of 2023  we have published data validating our NKG2D-based CAR T-cell approach and presented data from our multi-specific CAR T-cell platform:Upcoming anticipated milestonesMore data and evidence in the context of the multi-specific CAR platform and shRNA multiplexing approach in H2 2023  with the aim of a clinical evaluation of assets and initiation of clinical trials either by the Company and/or through strategic partnerships afterwards;Relocation  in H2 2023  into a new research facility which fits better its current needs after the strategic shift. The Company will remain headquartered at the Axis Parc  Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium but with its new business location at Dumont 9.Upcoming ConferencesThe Company will take part in the 4th International Conference on Lymphocyte Engineering (ICLE) in Munich (September 12-14) and the annual congress of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) in San Diego (November 1-5)  as well at several business conferences in the second half of 2023.First Half 2023 Financial ResultsKey financial figures for the first half of 2023  compared with the first half of 2022 and full year 2022  are summarized below:Selected key financial figures (€ millions) Half Year30 June 2023 Half Year30 June 2022 Full Year31 December 2022 Revenue - - - Research and development expenses (2.1) (10.5) (18.9) General and administrative expenses (3.7) (6.2) (10.5) Change in fair value of contingent consideration - 1.1 14.7 Impairment of Oncology intangible assets - - (35.1) Other income/(expenses) 2.1 1.6 9.0 Operating loss (3.7) (14.1) (40.9) Loss for the period/year (3.7) (14.1) (40.9) Net cash used in operations (8.3) (16.3) (28.0) Cash and cash equivalents 5.0 14.4 12.4The Company’s license and collaboration agreements generated no revenue in the first half of 2023 similar to the first half of 2022.The Research and Development (R&D) expenses have decreased primarily due to the Company’s decision to discontinue some of preclinical programs and manufacturing and clinical study activities after the Company’s decision to adopt and implement a new business strategy. Furthermore  there has been a decrease of employee expenses and related travel costs which is mainly related to headcount reduction through 2022  to support the Group’s reorganization around preclinical and clinical programs  as well as a decrease of the expenses associated with share-based payments (non-cash expenses) related to the warrant plan offered to the Company’s employees  managers and directors.General and Administrative (G&A) expenses were €3.7 million in 2023 as compared to €6.2 million in 2022. This decrease is primarily related to lower insurances costs  the decrease of employee expenses due to headcount reduction and management changes through 2022 to support the Company’s reorganization and the decrease of the expenses associated with the share-based payments (non-cash expenses) related to the warrants plan offered to the Company’s employees  managers and directors.As of June 30  2023  there was no change in fair value of the contingent consideration and other financial liabilities as Management has determined that there have been no event (such as a firm sublicense or collaboration contract) that increases the probability of the projected future cash outflow due to Celdara Medical  LLC and Dartmouth College  indicating that the probability is remote  similar to December 31  2022.Regarding the other income/other expenses  the Company recorded €2.1 million in net other income for the first half of 2023 compared to a net other income of €1.6 million for the first half of 2022. The net other income for the first half of 2023 is primarily due to the gain on the sale of certain fixed assets to Cellistic for €1.1 million and grant income from the Walloon Region of €0.8 million.Net loss was €3.7 million  or €(0.17) per share  for the first half of 2023 compared to a net loss of €14.1 million  or €(0.62) per share  for the same period of 2022.Net cash used in operations  was €8.3 million for the first half of 2023 compared to €16.3 million for the first half of 2022. The decrease of €8.0 million is primarily driven by the sale of the manufacturing activities in 2022 combined with global decrease on preclinical and clinical activities  insurance costs  headcount  management changes costs and associated impact on the change in working capital.As of June 30  2023  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €5.0 million. No capital increase has occurred in the first half of 2023.As of June 30  2023  the total number of basic shares outstanding were 22.6 million similar to December 31  2022.Conference Call and Webcast DetailsA conference call will be held on Tuesday 5th of September at 1:00 p.m. CET / 7:00 a.m. EDT discuss half year 2023 financial results and provide an update on the Company’s recent changes and upcoming milestones.Participants may access the conference call by dialing +1-877-407-9716 or +1-201-493-6779 (United States  International)  +32 (0) 800-73-904 (Belgium Fixed) or +32 (0) 800-73-566 (Belgium Mobile).
