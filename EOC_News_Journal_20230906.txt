recognised by the Company as holding any share on any trust. Except as provided by these Articles or by law  the Company is not bound by and is not to recognise any interest in any share except an absolute right of the holder to share in its entirety (even if the Company has notice of such interest).FORM OF SHARESCertificated shares1. Every person (except any person to whom the Company is not required by law to issue a share certificate) on becoming the holder of a certificated share is entitled without charge to one certificate for all the certificated shares of a class registered in their name or  in the case of certificated shares of more than one class  to a separate certificate for each class of shares  unless the terms of issue of the shares provide otherwise.A member (other than a person to whom the Company is not required by law to issue a share certificate) who transfers part of their shares comprised in a certificate is entitled without charge to one certificate for the balance of those shares.The Company is not bound to issue more than one certificate for certificated shares held jointly by two or more persons. Delivery of a certificate to one joint holder will be sufficient delivery to all joint holders.Every share certificate sent in accordance with these Articles will be sent at the risk of the holder of the shares concerned and any other person entitled to them. The Company will not be responsible for any share certificate lost or delayed in the course of delivery.If any certificate is worn-out  defaced  lost or destroyed  the Company may cancel it and issue a replacement certificate subject to such terms as the Board may decide as to evidence and indemnity (with or without security) and to payment of any exceptional out-of-pocket expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such indemnity or such security but otherwise free of charge  and (if the certificate is worn-out or defaced) on delivery up of the old certificate.Uncertificated shares1. The Board may resolve that a class of shares is to become  or is to cease to be  a participating security. Shares of a class are not to be treated as a separate class to other shares of the same class as a consequence of some being held in certificated form and others in uncertificated form or of any provision in these Articles or the CREST Regulations applying only to one form or the other. Any share of a class which is a participating security may be changed from uncertificated form into certificated form and from certificated form into uncertificated form in accordance with the CREST Regulations. No provision in these Articles which is inconsistent with the holding of uncertificated shares of any class or with the transfer of title to them by means of the CREST System or with the CREST Regulations applies to such shares. The Company may treat a member's holding of uncertificated shares and of certificated shares of the same class as if they were separate holdings.Where the Company is permitted to dispose of or sell or otherwise procure the sale of any uncertificated shares  the Board may take such steps as it considers necessary or appropriate to do so including by:requiring  by written notification to the Operator  their conversion into uncertificatedrequiring their holder:to have them converted into certificated form within a specified period and then to hold them in certificated form for so long as the Company requires; and/orto take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to transfer them to such person as the Company directs; andappointing any person to take any steps in the holder's name to have them converted into certificated form and/or to effect their transfer to such person as the Company directs.NEW SHARESAllotment1. Subject to these Articles and the rights attached to any existing shares  the Board may offer  allot  grant options over or otherwise dispose of shares in the Company to such persons and on such terms as it may decide.Subject to any rights attached to any existing shares  any share may be issued with or have attached to it such rights or restrictions as the Company may by ordinary resolution decide or  so far as the resolution does not make specific provision or if no such resolution has been passed  as the Board may decide.Subject to company legislation  any share may be issued which is to be redeemed  or is to be liable to be redeemed at the option of the Company or the holder  on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the Board may decide.Tag Company may exercise all powers conferred by company legislation of paying commissions in relation to a subscription for shares or other allotment. These commissions may be satisfied in cash or by the allotment of fully paid shares or partly in one way and partly in the other.Consolidation and division1. The Company may confer any preference or other advantage on one or more of the shares resulting from any division or sub-division of its share capital as compared with the others and make any such share subject to any restriction as compared with the others.If  as a result of a consolidation  consolidation and division or sub-division of shares  fractions of shares become attributable to members  the Board may deal with the fractions as it considers appropriate  including in either of the ways prescribed below in this Article.The Board may sell shares representing fractions on such basis and in such manner as it may decide to any person and distribute the net proceeds of sale amongst the persons to whom the fractions are attributable (except that if the amount that would otherwise be due to a person does not exceed £3.00  or such other sum as the Board may decide  the Company may distribute it to an organisation that is registered as a charity in the United Kingdom or in any part of it). To do so the Board may authorise a person to sign an instrument of transfer of shares to the purchaser or as the purchaser may direct or  for uncertificated shares  exercise any power conferred on it under these Articles to effect their transfer.The purchaser will not be bound to see to the application of the purchase monies in respect of any such sale. The title of the transferee to the shares will not be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings connected with the sale or transfer. Any instrument or exercise referred to above in this Article will be effective as if it had been signed or exercised by the holder of the shares to which it relates.In relation to the fractions the Board may issue to a member fully paid by way of capitalisation the minimum number of shares required to round up their holding of shares to a number which  following a consolidation and division or a sub-division  leaves a whole number of shares (such issue to be treated as effected immediately before the consolidation or the sub-division  as the case may be). The amount required to pay up those shares may be capitalised as the Board considers appropriate out of amounts standing to the credit of any reserve or fund of the Company and applied in paying up in full the appropriate number of shares.SHARE TRANSFERSFormSubject to these Articles  a member may transfer all or any of their shares:in the case of certificated shares  by an instrument of transfer in writing in any usual form or in another form approved by the Board signed by or on behalf of the transferor and (in the case of a transfer of a share which is not fully paid) by or on behalf of the transferee; orin the case of uncertificated shares  without a written instrument in accordance with the CREST Regulations.Right to refuse registration1. The Company may refuse to register a transfer of certificated shares unless:the instrument of transfer is properly stamped or is certified or otherwise shown to the Board's satisfaction to be exempt from stamp duty and is presented for registration to Company at the Registered Office or such other place as the Board may decide  accompanied by the certificate for the shares to which it relates (except in the case of a transfer by a person to whom the Company was not required to issue a share certificate and has not issued one in respect of the share concerned) and any other evidence as the Board may require to show the right of the person signing the instrument to make the transfer or  if the instrument is signed by some other person on their behalf  the authority of such person to do so;all the shares to which it relates are fully paid and of the same class; andit is in favour of a single transferee or not more than four joint transferees  in each case being a natural or legal person.Registration of the transfer of an uncertificated share may be refused if it is in favour of more than four persons jointly or if any other circumstances apply in respect of which refusal to register a share transfer is permitted or required by the CREST Regulations.Renunciation of allotmentsThe Board may recognise a person's renunciation of their right to the allotment of any share in accordance with the allotment terms in favour of some other person. The renunciation will be treated as a transfer (to the extent applicable) for the purposes of these Articles. The Board has the same powers of refusing to give effect to it as if it were a transfer.General1. The transferor will remain the holder of the share transferred until the name of the transferee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of it.All instruments of transfer which are registered may be retained by or on behalf of the Company. Any instrument of transfer which the Board refuses to register shall (except in the case of fraud) be returned to the person delivering it when notice of the refusal is given.The Company will not charge any fee for registering any transfer  document or instruction relating to or affecting the title to any share or for making any other entry in the Register of Members.A person who becomes entitled to a share will be bound by any notice in respect of that share (other than a section 793 notice) which  before their name is entered in the Register of Members  the Company has given to the person from whom they derive their title.TRANSMISSION OF SHARESRecognition of transmission1. The Company is required to recognise a person's entitlement to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member or of any other event giving rise to its transmission by operation of law only if that person has:provided the Company with a postal address and  if that address is not in the United Kingdom  with a postal address in the United Kingdom or an address for the purposes of communications by electronic means;provided the Company with such evidence as it may reasonably require for the purpose of proving their entitlement; andproven their entitlement to the Board's satisfaction.The Company shall  within two months of becoming required to recognise the entitlement of any person to a share  notify that person that it has done so and  if the share is certificated  have that entitlement noted in its issuer register of members.Notices following recognition1. The Company may send or supply to a person entitled by transmission to a share  at such postal address in the United Kingdom or at such other address for the purpose of electronic communications that they have provided to the Company  any document or information or payment to which they would be entitled if they were the holder of that share. The Company may notify them at such an address of the availability of any document or information on a website.Any document or information sent or supplied to a person entitled by transmission to a share shall be deemed to have been sent or supplied to all persons interested (whether jointly with or as claiming through or under them) in the share.If a person claims to be entitled by transmission to a share but has not been recognised by the Company as entitled to it  in relation to that share the Company may send or supply any document or information or make any payment in respect of it as if the event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred or withhold any such document or information or payment.Rights on transmission1. A person's rights under these Articles as a member in respect of a share of which they are the registered holder shall cease on another person becoming entitled to that share in consequence of their death or bankruptcy or of any other event giving rise to its transmission by operation of law.A person that the Company has recognised as being entitled by transmission to a share has the rights that they would have if they were its holder  except that they will not  before being registered as its holder  be entitled in respect of it (except with the Board's authority) to receive notice of  or to attend or vote at  any general meeting or at any class meeting or to exercise any other rights in relation to any such meeting.Elections following transmission1. A person entitled by transmission to a share may elect to be registered as its holder or to have some person nominated by them so registered. If they elect to be registered  they shall give notice to the Company to that effect. If they elect to have some other person registered  they shall sign an instrument of transfer or  for an uncertificated share  give appropriate instructions for its transfer through the CREST System or have it converted into certificated form and then sign an instrument of transfer.All the provisions of these Articles relating to the transfer of shares apply to the notice or instrument of transfer or instructions (as the case may be) referred to above in this Article as if the notice were an instrument of transfer and as if the notice or instrument were signed  or the instructions were given  by the member and the event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred.The Board may give notice requiring a person to make an election referred to above in this Article. If such notice is not complied with within 60 days  the Board may withhold payment of all dividends and other amounts payable in respect of the share until such an election has been made. If it is not complied with within one year  the Board may register that person as the holder of that share.Death of a memberIf a member dies  the survivor or survivors where they were a joint holder  or (subject to these Articles) their personal representatives where they were the sole or only surviving holder  will be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to their shares. Nothing in these Articles will release the estate of a deceased holder from any liability in respect of a share which has been held by them solely or jointly.GENERAL MEETINGSConvening general meetings1. The Board shall convene annual general meetings in accordance with company legislation and shall decide the place and the time and date at which an annual general meeting is convened to be held. The Board may convene a general meeting which is not an annual general meeting whenever and wherever it considers appropriate. A general meeting that is not an annual general meeting may also be called an ""extraordinary"" general meeting.References to the ""chair"" in subsequent provisions of these Articles concerning general meetings are to the chair of the meeting concerned.General meetings may be held partly (but not wholly) by means of an Electronic Facility or Facilities  as may be determined by the Board.The Board shall determine in relation to each general meeting the means of attendance at and participation in the meeting  including whether the persons entitled to attend and participate in the meeting shall be enabled to do so:(subject to Article 22(D)) by means of an Electronic Facility or Facilities pursuant to Article 22(A) (and for the avoidance of doubt  the Board shall be under no obligation to offer or provide such a facility or facilities  whatever the circumstances); and/orby simultaneous attendance and participation at a Satellite Meeting Place or Places pursuant to Article ‎28(B).Unless otherwise specified in the notice of meeting or determined by the chair  a general meeting is deemed to take place at the place where the chair is at the time of the meeting.Two or more persons who may not be in the same place as each other attend a general meeting if their circumstances are such that if they have (or were to have) rights to speak and vote at that meeting  they are (or would be) able to exercise them.In determining whether persons are attending or participating in a meeting  other than at a physical place or places  it is immaterial where any of them are or how they are able to communicate with each other.A person is able to exercise the right to speak at a general meeting when that person is in a position to communicate to all those attending the meeting  during the meeting  any information or opinions which that person has on the business of the meeting.If  at any general meeting at which members are entitled to participate by means of an Electronic Facility or Facilities determined by the Board pursuant to Article 22(A)  any document is required to be on display or to be available for inspection at the meeting (whether prior to or for the duration of the meeting or both)  the Company shall ensure that it is available in electronic form to persons entitled to inspect it for at least the required period of time  and this will be deemed to satisfy any such requirement.Notice1. An annual general meeting and each other general meeting shall be called by at least such minimum period of notice as is prescribed for such meeting under company legislation.A notice of general meeting shall be given to each person who is:a member (other than one who  under these Articles or any restrictions imposed on any shares  is not entitled to receive it or to whom the Company has not sent and is not required to send its latest annual accounts and reports nor any summary of the latest annual accounts and reports as permitted by company legislation) at a time and date selected by the Board in accordance with these Articles and company legislation;a Director on the date of the notice; andthe Auditor on that date.The accidental omission or failure to send a notice of a general meeting or of any resolution intended to be moved at a general meeting to  or the non-receipt of any such notice (even if the Company becomes aware of such non-receipt) by  any person entitled to receive it will not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting.If:0. notice of a resolution has been given without the Company having any obligation under company legislation to give it:the Board resolves that the resolution be withdrawn; andbefore the commencement of the general meeting at which it is to be considered or (following an adjournment) before its recommencement the Company announces the withdrawal of that resolution or at the meeting any officer of the Company informs the meeting or its chair of the withdrawal that resolution shall not then be considered at the general meeting nor put to the vote.If pursuant to Article 22(A) the Board determines that a general meeting shall be held partly by means of an Electronic Facility or Facilities  the notice shall:include a statement to that effect;specify the means  or all different means  of attendance and participation at such meeting  and any access  identification and security arrangements; andstate how it is proposed that persons attending or participating in the meeting electronically should communicate with each other during the meeting.Rearranged meetings1. The Board can change the place or the time and date for which a general meeting is convened (including  for a combined physical and electronic general meeting  the Electronic Facility or Electronic Facilities) to be held if the Board considers that:it is likely that (on the assumption that one or more directors will attend the meeting) the chair of the meeting:will wish to adjourn it on or shortly after its commencement to another place or another time on the same date or another time and date; andwill have the power to so adjourn it; orholding a general meeting at the place or at the time and date stated in the notice calling the meeting will be.impossible or impracticable; orhazardous or inadvisable or undesirable  having regard to the comfort or health or safety or wellbeing of persons attending or travelling to or from the meeting; orno longer appropriate  having regard to circumstances outside the Company's control.If the Board makes such a change  an announcement of the place and the time and date of the rearranged meeting must be advertised in the manner that the Directors (at their sole discretion) determine prior to the time at which the meeting was convened to be held. Notice of the business to be transacted at the rearranged meeting will not be required. The Board must take reasonable steps to ensure that any member who arrives at the place specified in the notice of meeting to attend it at the original time is informed of the place and the time and date of the rearranged meeting.

Subject only to the requirement for the chair to adjourn a general meeting in accordance with the provisions of Article ‎28(E)  any inability of a person or persons to attend or participate in a general meeting by way of electronic facility or facilities shall not invalidate the proceedings of that meeting.1. Nothing in these Articles authorises or allows a general meeting to be held exclusively on an electronic basis.Security and order1. Any of the Board  the chair and the secretary can put in place or authorise  both before and during any general meeting and on its conclusion or adjournment  any arrangement that it or they consider necessary or appropriate for ensuring the proper and orderly conduct of the meeting or the safety and wellbeing of people arriving  attending or leaving it.

Their decision on procedural matters  points of order or matters arising from the business of the meeting shall be final as shall be their determination as to whether a matter or point is of such a nature.If a general meeting is held partly by means of an Electronic Facility or Facilities pursuant to Article ‎22(A)  the Board and the chair may make any arrangement and impose any requirement or restriction that is:0. necessary to ensure the identification of those taking part by means of such electronic facility or facilities and the security of the electronic communication; and0. in their view  proportionate to those objectives.In this respect  the Board may authorise any voting application  system or facility for attendance and participation as they see fit.Nothing in these Articles limits any right or power that a chair has in relation to the conduct of a general meeting.Attendance1. Any person who is:a member at the time and date specified in the notice of a general meeting as when a person is to be registered as the holder of a share in order to be entitled to attend the meeting as a member;a proxy or corporate representative validIy appointed by any such member to attend the meeting; ora Director or the Secretary at the commencement of the meeting is entitled to attend that general meeting  subject to these Articles and company legislation.A Director who attends a general meeting may speak at it.Any person:0. who is invited to attend a general meeting by or on the authority of the Board or the Secretary;whose attendance at the meeting is agreed to in advance by or on the authority of the Board or the Secretary; orwhose attendance is agreed to at the meeting by the chair is permitted to attend that general meeting.Any person permitted to attend a general meeting in accordance with the previous paragraph may speak at the meeting if invited to do so by the chair.

The person who is  at the commencement of a general meeting  the chair of the Board or  in their absence  the deputy chair or any person with equivalent status designated by a different title (if any) will preside as chair of that meeting. If more than one deputy chair or other person with equivalent status is present they will agree between themselves who is to take the chair. If they do not do so  the one who has been a director the longest will take the chair. If there is no chair or deputy chair  or if at a meeting neither is present within five minutes after the time appointed for the start of the meeting  or neither is willing to act  the Directors present shall select one of their number to be chair. If only one Director is present and willing to act  they shall be chair.If no Director is present  or if each Director present declines to take the chair  the persons present and entitled to vote shall appoint one of their number who is present in person (but not by proxy) to be chair of the meeting.No poll shall be demanded or taken on the appointment of a chair of a meeting. The selection or appointment of a chair will not be treated as being part of the business of the meeting and will not be prevented by the absence of a quorum.Quorum1. No business shall be transacted at a general meeting unless a quorum is present when the meeting proceeds to business. Two members present in person or by proxy (or  being a corporation  present by duly appointed corporate representative) and entitled to vote upon the business being transacted at the meeting will be a quorum.

No amendment may be made to the text of a special resolution proposed in a notice of general meeting  other than an amendment which (in the chair's view) is required to correct a manifest error  before the resolution is voted on.No amendment may be made to the text  terms or scope of an ordinary resolution proposed in a notice of general meeting before the resolution is voted on unless (subject to company legislation):at least 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting notice of the amendment and intention to propose it at the meeting addressed to the Secretary from a member entitled to vote on the resolution has been received in hard copy form at the Registered Office and the amendment does not  in the chair's view  negate the resolution or extend or (other than by reduction) materially alter its scope; orthe chair decides that the proposed amendment is appropriate for consideration by the meeting.No notice need be given to any member of any amendment permitted under this Article. Any such amendment shall be made only if at the meeting a member present or the chair proposes that the amendment be made and either:0. the chair moves that the meeting approve the amendment and the meeting then votes on it with a simple majority of votes cast being in its favour; orthe chair asks the meeting whether any member present and entitled to vote on the resolution objects to the amendment and is not then informed by any such member of that member's objection to it (other than by a member who withdraws their objection) before the amended resolution is first put to the vote.A proposed amendment may be withdrawn by the person who proposed it  with the chair's consent  before the resolution is voted on. If a proposed amendment to a resolution is ruled out of order or is otherwise rejected by the chair  any error made by them in doing so will not affect the validity of the vote on that resolution.Adjournments1. The chair may  with the consent of any general meeting at which a quorum is present  and shall  if so directed by that meeting  adjourn that meeting including any part of the meeting to be held by means of the Electronic Facility or Facilities specified in the notice to another time on the same date or to any time on another date at the same or another place and/or from such Electronic Facility or Facilities for attendance and participation to such other Electronic Facility or Facilities or indefinitely.No poll shall be demanded or taken on any proposal for an adjournment  or on any proposal to consider or vote on any matters in a different order to that set out in the notice of general meeting  except (in any case) at the direction or demand of the chair  in which event the poll shall be taken promptly.The chair may  without the consent of the general meeting  adjourn the meeting after the time for which it is convened to be held to another time on the same date or to any time on another date at the same or another place or indefinitely and/or change the Electronic Facility or Facilities if they decide that it is necessary or appropriate to do so in order to:secure the proper and orderly conduct of the meeting;ensure the comfort  safety and wellbeing of persons attending the meeting;give persons entitled to vote on any resolution to be proposed at the meeting:an adequate and reasonable opportunity of attending the meeting; ora reasonable and proper opportunity to take into account any information not disclosed by the Company when it gave notice of the meeting that the chair considers is or may be material to their decision on how to vote; orensure that the business of the meeting is properly concluded or disposed of  including for the purpose of determining the result of a poll.Nothing in these Articles limits the powers that the chair would otherwise have to adjourn a general meeting without the consent of that meeting.If it appears to the chair that the facilities at the Principal Meeting Place or any Satellite Meeting Place or an Electronic Facility or Facilities or security at any general meeting have become inadequate for the purposes referred to in Articles 22(A) or 22(B) or are otherwise not sufficient to allow the meeting to be conducted substantially in accordance with the provisions set out in the notice of meeting  then the chair shall  without the consent of the meeting  interrupt or adjourn the general meeting.Adjourned meetings1. At least seven days' notice of an adjourned meeting is to be given in the same manner as originally given for the meeting (including details of any Electronic Facility or Facilities if applicable) if that meeting is adjourned:to another day without the meeting being informed  on or before its adjournment  of the time and date and the place of the adjourned meeting;to another day if  after the adjournment  the time and date or the place of the adjourned meeting is changed; orfor 30 days or more.No member is entitled to any notice of an adjournment in any other circumstances.No business shall be transacted at a adjourned meeting other than the business which might properly have been transacted at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.SHARE VOTINGVoting rights1. Subject to any rights or restrictions attaching to any shares and to these Articles  on a vote on a resolution on a show of hands:each member present in person has one vote;every proxy present who has been duly appointed by one or more members entitled to vote on the resolution has (unless the next sub-paragraph applies) one vote; anda proxy has one vote for and one vote against the resolution if they have been duly appointed by more than one member entitled to vote on the resolution and has been instructed (or exercises a discretion given) by one or more of those members to vote for it and by one or more other of those members to vote against it.Subject to any rights or restrictions attaching to any shares  on a vote on a resolution on a poll every member present has one vote for each share of which they are the holder.A member entitled to more than one vote need not  if they vote  use all their votes or cast all the votes they use in the same way.In the case of joint holders of shares  the vote tendered by the senior of them present who tenders a vote is to be accepted to the exclusion of all votes tendered by the others. In these Articles seniority in relation to joint holders of a share is determined by the order in which their names appear in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding.A member in respect of whom an order has been made or recognised by any court or official having jurisdiction (whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) in matters concerning mental disorder or incapacity may vote through any person authorised to act on their behalf  provided that evidence to the Board's satisfaction of that person's authority has been received at an address specified by the Company for the receipt of proxy forms in hard copy form for the meeting concerned by the last time for their receipt in relation to the meeting or poll. That person may attend  speak and vote at the meeting as if they were the member and may appoint a proxy to do so on their behalf.No matter shall be voted on at a general meeting  other than for the appointment of a chair  until it is put to vote by the chair.Proxies1. A member who is entitled to attend and vote at a general meeting is entitled to appoint another person  or two or more persons in respect of different shares held by them  as their proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and to vote at the meeting.For the appointment of a proxy to be effective  it must be notified to the Company in writing in any usual form or in any other form approved by the Board (whether in hard copy or electronic form) and signed or authenticated by the member or by their attorney (a ""proxy form""). If the member is a company  the proxy form should be sealed by that company or signed by someone authorised to sign it. The appointment of a proxy will not preclude a member from attending  voting and speaking at the meeting or voting on a poll. A proxy form shall  unless it provides to the contrary  be valid for any adjournment of the meeting to which it relates. A proxy form is to be treated (unless the contrary is stated in it) as authorising the proxy to demand or join in demanding a poll and to vote on any amendment to a resolution put to  or other business which may properly come before  the meeting for which it is given.Proxy forms must be received at an address given by the Company for their receipt in respect of the meeting concerned by the time:48 hours before the meeting or an adjourned meeting;24 hours before a poll is taken  if the poll is taken more than 48 hours after it was demanded; orbefore the end of the meeting at which the poll was demanded  if the poll is taken after the end of the meeting or adjourned meeting but not more than 48 hours after it was demanded or  in each case  by such later time as the Board may decide.If a proxy form is signed or authenticated for a member by another person  the Board may require that:0. the power of attorney or other authority relied on to sign it (or a copy which has been certified by a notary or in some other way approved by the Board); andsuch other reasonable evidence of that person's authority to appoint a proxy on the member's behalf as the Board may specify must be received by the relevant time and at an address referred to in the previous paragraph.A proxy form which (or in respect of which any other document referred to above in this Article) is not received in a manner and within the time limits set out above in this Article shall be invalid (unless and to the extent that the Board  in relation to any proxy form  waives any such requirement).A proxy form will not be valid after 12 months from the date of its receipt  except at an adjourned meeting or on a poll demanded at a meeting or an adjourned meeting in cases where the meeting was originally held within 12 months from such date.If more than one valid proxy form is received in respect of the same share for use at the same meeting or poll  the one which is received last (regardless of its date or the date on which it is signed) will be treated as the valid form. If it is not possible to determine the order of receipt  none of them will be treated as valid. Proxy forms submitted by a member that would give different persons the apparent right to exercise votes over more shares than are held by them will be invalid. None of those persons will be entitled to attend  speak or vote at the relevant meeting as proxy for them. The proceedings at a general meeting will not be invalidated if  as a result of technical difficulties existing after the last time for the receipt of proxy forms  a proxy form sent in electronic form cannot be read by the person authorised to read it on the Company's behalf when they attempt to do so.The Company is not obliged to check whether any proxy or corporate representative has voted or demanded a poll in accordance with their appointor's instructions. A vote given or poll demanded by a proxy or a corporate representative will be valid notwithstanding that person did not act in accordance with the instructions given to them. Such a vote or demand will also be valid notwithstanding that that person's authority to act as such had been terminated  unless written notice of the termination was received by the Company at the Registered Office  or at such other place or address specified by the Company for receipt of proxy forms  by the time 24 hours before the time of the meeting or adjourned meeting or poll concerned.Taking a vote1. Subject to Article 32(D)  a vote on a resolution that is put to a general meeting is to be taken and decided on a show of hands  unless:the chair directs  whether before or after it has been put to the vote on a show of hands  that a poll be taken on it (such a direction is to be treated  for the purposes of these Articles  as a demand for a poll); orbefore or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands a poll is demanded by:at least five members present having the right to vote on the resolution; ora member or members present representing not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all the members having the right to vote on the resolution; ora member or members present holding shares conferring a right to vote on the resolution on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right.Unless a poll is so demanded and the demand is not withdrawn  a declaration by the chair that a resolution has or has not been passed or has been passed with a particular majority is conclusive evidence of that fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or against such resolution.A demand for a poll may be withdrawn before the poll is taken  but only with the consent of the chair. Its withdrawal will not invalidate the result of a show of hands declared before the demand was made.A resolution put to the vote at a general meeting held partly by means of an Electronic Facility or Facilities shall be decided on a poll  and such poll votes may be cast by such electronic means as the Board  in its sole discretion  deems appropriate for the purposes of the meeting. Any such poll shall be deemed to have been validly demanded at the time fixed for the holding of the meeting to which it relates.Polls1. The chair shall direct where and when any poll on any matter is to be taken. Subject to their directions  that poll can be taken at the meeting (without an adjournment) or after the meeting or at an adjourned meeting and shall be taken within 30 days from the date of the demand.The chair may direct the manner in which a poll is to be taken and may appoint scrutineers. The scrutineers need not be members. No notice need be given of a poll not taken at the meeting (before any adjournment to another date) at which it is demanded if the time and place at which it is to be taken are announced to the meeting. In any other case at least seven days' notice is to be given specifying the time and place at which the poll is to be taken. The result of the poll is to be treated as the resolution of the meeting at which it was demanded.The demand for a poll  except on a proposed adjournment  will not prevent the meeting from transacting business on matters other than that on which a poll has been demanded.Objection to voting errorsAny objection to the qualification of any person voting or to the counting of  or failure to count  any vote must be made at the meeting or (if not taken at the meeting) poll at which the vote objected to is given or at which the error occurs. Any objection or error shall be referred to the chair. Their decision on the matter will be final and conclusive. If a vote is allowed at a meeting or poll  it will be valid for all purposes. Any decision not to count a vote at a meeting or a poll will not affect the decision of the meeting or poll.Default in disclosing share interests1. Where notice is given by the Company under section 793 of the Companies Act (a ""section 793 notice"") to a member  or another person appearing to be interested in shares held by a member  and the member or other person has failed in relation to any shares (""default shares""  which expression applies also to any shares issued after the date of the section 793 notice in respect of those shares and to such other shares as the Board may decide which are first registered in the member's name on or after that date) to give the Company the information required by such notice within 14 days after the date on which the section 793 notice was sent to the person concerned  unless the Board otherwise decides:the member is not entitled in respect of the default shares to be present or to vote at a general meeting or on a poll  or to exercise any other rights conferred by membership in relation to the meeting or poll; andwhere the default shares represent at least 0.25 per cent. of the issued shares of their class:a dividend (or any part of a dividend) or other distribution or amount payable in respect of the default shares (except on a winding up) may be withheld by the Company  which has have no obligation to pay interest on it;the member is not entitled to elect to receive shares instead of a dividend; andthe Board may refuse to register the transfer of any default shares unless:the transfer is an exempt transfer; orthe member is not themselves in default in supplying the information required and proves to the satisfaction of the Board that no person in default of supplying the information required is interested in any shares which are the subject of the transfer.The sanctions under the previous paragraph will cease to apply seven days after the earlier of:0. receipt by the Company of notice of an exempt transfer  but only in relation to the shares transferred; andreceipt by the Company  in a form satisfactory to the Board  of all the information required by the section 793 notice.The Board may:give notice to any member holding default shares requiring the member:if they are in uncertificated form  to have them converted into certificated form within a specified period; and/orto hold them in certificated form for so long as the default subsists  andappoint any person to take any steps in the name of any holder of default shares to have them converted into certificated form.This Article does not restrict the Company's powers under company legislation in respect of any matter.For the purpose of this Article:0. ""exempt transfer"" means a transfer of shares by a member which is shown to the Board's satisfaction to be made to a third party unconnected with that member or with any other person appearing to be interested in the shares and made pursuant to:an acceptance of a takeover offer (as defined in Part 28 of the Companies Act);a sale through a recognised investment exchange (as defined in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) or any other securities investment exchange outside the United Kingdom on which (in either case) such shares have been admitted to trading on the Company's application; ora sale of the whole of the beneficial interest in the shares;""interested"" has the meaning that it has in Part 22 of the Companies Act;a person  other than the member holding a share  is to be treated as appearing to be interested in such share if the member has informed the Company that the person is or may be so interested  or if the Company (after taking account of information obtained from the member or  pursuant to a section 793 notice  from anyone else) knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the person is or may be so interested; andreference to a person having failed to give to the Company information required by a section 793 notice  or being in default of supplying such information  includes references to their having:failed or refused to give all or any part of such information; andgiven information which they know to be false in a material particular or recklessly given information which is false in a material particular.CLASS RIGHTSVariation1. The rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of the class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of shares of the class.The rights attached to allotted or issued shares of the same class will not be treated as varied (unless otherwise expressly provided in the terms conferring such rights) by the allotment or issue of new shares ranking in all respects equally with them.Class meetings1. The provisions of these Articles as to general meetings apply to any separate general meeting of the holders of shares of a class (a ""class meeting"")  subject to any necessary modifications in accordance with company legislation or these Articles.No member  other than a Director  is entitled to notice of a class meeting or to attend it unless they are a holder of shares of the class concerned. No vote may be given except in respect of a share of that class.For a class meeting in connection with the variation of rights attached to that class (a ""variation of class rights meeting""):the quorum (unless an adjourned meeting) is two persons present holding at least one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of that class;the quorum for an adjourned meeting is one person present holding shares of that class;a person present by proxy or proxies is treated as holding only the shares in respect of which those proxies are authorised to exercise voting rights; anda poll may be demanded by any holder of the shares of that class present.For the purpose of these Articles  a general meeting which is not a variation of class rights meeting and at which no holder of a share other than an Ordinary Share may  in their capacity as a member  attend or vote constitutes a separate general meeting of the holders of the ordinary shares.BOARD POWERSBoard to manage the Company's business1. The Board shall manage the Company's business.The Board may exercise all the Company's powers and may do on the Company's behalf all such acts as may be done by it or on its behalf and which are not required to be exercised or done by the Company in general meeting subject (in all cases) to company legislation  these Articles and any direction that the Company gives to the Board by passing a special resolution.No such direction and no alteration of these Articles will invalidate any prior act of the Board which would have been valid if such direction or alteration had not been given or made. The provisions in these Articles giving specific powers to the Board do not limit the general powers given by this Article.Board committees1. The Board may establish any committee (a ""Board committee"") for the purpose of carrying out any exercise  function or task that the Board has the power to carry out itself. The members of a Board committee need not include more than one Director.The Board's power to delegate to a Board committee:includes the power to delegate the determination of any fee  monies  remuneration or other benefit to be paid or provided to any Director and the power to authorise any situation or matter to which section 175 of the Companies Act applies; andis not limited by the making of express reference in some Articles but not others to the exercise of any particular power by the Board or a Board committee.Proceedings of a Board committee shall be conducted in accordance with any regulations prescribed by the Board. Subject to those regulations  such proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with applicable provisions of these Articles regulating the proceedings of the Board (except that a Board committee will not have the power to change or modify any such regulations or provisions as they apply to it or to regulate its own proceedings). If a Board resolution states that the members of a Board committee are to include one or more unnamed Directors  it will not be necessary to give notice of a Board committee meeting to any Director who is not a member of that committee.Delegation1. The Board may delegate any of its powers under these Articles and any other of its powers that can be delegated:to such person or persons or to any Board committee;to such an extent (including in relation to any matter or any territory  region or country);on such terms and subject to such conditions;for such period or indefinitely; andby such means as the Board considers appropriate.The Board may.0. grant to any person or persons or to any Board committee to whom it delegates any power the power to sub-delegate that power (with or without a power of further sub- delegation) to one or more persons or to a sub-committee;retain or exclude the right of the Board to exercise any delegated power collaterally with the person or persons or the Board committee to whom it has been delegated; andrevoke the delegation or alter its terms or conditions.References in these Articles to any Board committee include any sub-committee permitted under this Article.Voting and appointments1.

The Board may make and vary such provisions as it considers appropriate regarding the keeping of any such register.For a member registered on an overseas branch register  documents and other information can be sent or supplied to them by the Company in or from the United Kingdom or in or from the country or territory where the branch register is kept. Any notice that is published by the Company in a newspaper for the purposes of these Articles shall also be published in a newspaper circulated in hard copy form in the territory or country where an overseas branch register is kept.The Board may  by sending a written notice to the member concerned  require a member who is registered on an overseas branch register to provide any information (with such supporting evidence as the Board may decide) for the purpose of determining whether they are resident in the country or territory in which that branch register is situated. If such information and evidence is not provided within 21 days or if  in the Board's opinion  the evidence provided indicates that the member is not so resident or is unsatisfactory the Company may move the shares registered in their name off that branch register and register them in that member's name in certificated form on the Register of Members. If the Company does so  it shall send a notice to the member informing them that it has done so.Borrowings1.

In the case of an equality of votes  the chair has a second or casting vote (unless they are not entitled to vote on the matter)  provided that there are more than two Directors present who are entitled to vote on the matter.Written resolutions1. A resolution in writing signed by all the Directors entitled to receive notice of a Board meeting and who would be entitled to vote on the resolution at a Board meeting (if their number is sufficient to constitute a quorum) will be as valid and effective as a resolution passed at a Board meeting properly called and constituted.Such a resolution may consist of several documents in the same form each signed by one or more of the Directors or members of the relevant committee.Validity of Board's actsAll acts done by the Board or a Board committee or by a person acting as a Director or as a member of a Board committee will be valid even if it is discovered later that any Director or person acting as a Director or as a member of a Board committee was not properly appointed. This is also applies if it is discovered later that anyone was disqualified from being a director or was not entitled to vote. In all these cases  anything done will be as valid as if there was no defect or irregularity of a kind referred to in this Article.DIRECTORSNumberThe number of Directors shall be:not less than four; andnot more than (unless otherwise determined by the Company by ordinary resolution) 12.Appointment1.

If the persons present at the commencement of the meeting and entitled to vote include only one person who has been a Director within the previous five years and is willing to act as chair of the meeting  that person shall be the chair of the meeting. If more than one such person is then present  all such persons may decide between themselves (by majority vote  if necessary) who is to take the chair. If no such decision is made by such persons within 30 minutes of the commencement of the meeting or if no such person is present at its commencement  the persons present and entitled to vote may appoint one of their number to be chair of the meeting.

29726,Euroclear,Bing API,https://news.yahoo.com/eu-moves-forward-plan-tax-114341549.html,EU Moves Forward on Plan to Tax Sanctioned Russian Assets,European Union officials will begin meeting with member states this week to outline the bloc’s plan on how to impose a windfall tax on profits generated by more than €200 billion ($215 billion) of frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Ukraine’s reconstruction.,(Bloomberg) -- European Union officials will begin meeting with member states this week to outline the bloc’s plan on how to impose a windfall tax on profits generated by more than €200 billion ($215 billion) of frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Ukraine’s reconstruction.Most Read from BloombergThe European Commission  the EU’s executive arm  will propose how to legally transfer revenue being generated by the assets to the bloc’s budget  according to a draft paper on the process seen by Bloomberg.The commission will meet with officials from Spain  Belgium  Italy  France and Germany on Thursday  then with all member states next week  according to a person familiar with the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen previously said she would put forward a legislative proposal before the summer break but that timeline has since slipped.A commission working group backs implementing the three main proposals in the paper step-by-step  rather than all at once  according to the document.The steps include clarifying the scope of the duties of the financial obligations involved  imposing requirements for central securities depositories to separate cash balances of the Russian assets and transferring the revenues to the EU’s budget as external assigned revenues  according to the paper.The Russian central bank assets immobilized in the EU are expected to generate some €3 billion in windfall profits. Over half the assets are in cash and deposits  while a “substantial amount” of the remainder is in securities that will transform to cash as they mature in the next two to three years  Bloomberg previously reported.Many of the funds are in Belgium at settlement giant Euroclear Ltd.  where they generated nearly €750 million by the first quarter of this year.The prospect of taxing and seizing the windfall profits raises legal as well as financial questions. Several countries have raised concerns that using the proceeds from the assets could encourage official reserve holders to turn their back on the euro  according to the people.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2023 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.06,0.49,0.45,negative,0.05,0.35,0.6,True,English,"['Russian Assets', 'EU', 'Plan', 'Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'next two to three years', 'settlement giant Euroclear Ltd.', 'Russian central bank assets', 'three main proposals', 'The European Commission', 'commission working group', 'official reserve holders', 'central securities depositories', 'European Union officials', 'Bloomberg L.P.', 'Russian assets', 'member states', 'windfall tax', 'executive arm', 'legislative proposal', 'summer break', 'financial obligations', 'substantial amount', 'first quarter', 'financial questions', 'Several countries', 'windfall profits', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'draft paper', 'cash balances', 'bloc', 'plan', 'Ukraine', 'reconstruction', 'revenue', 'budget', 'process', 'Spain', 'Belgium', 'Italy', 'France', 'Germany', 'Thursday', 'person', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'timeline', 'step', 'document', 'scope', 'duties', 'requirements', 'external', 'half', 'deposits', 'remainder', 'funds', 'prospect', 'legal', 'concerns', 'proceeds', 'back', 'people']",2023-09-06,2023-09-06,news.yahoo.com

This is an outcome of the periodic review of the DAX index family by Deutsche Börse AG on 5 September 2023. As Krones shares will also not become a component of the SDAX index  they are set to leave the DAX index family altogether on 18 September 2023.The reason for Deutsche Börses decision is that Krones no longer meets a basic criterion for index membership. This relates to a partial departure from Recommendation C.10 of the German Corporate Governance Code. Among other things  this requires the chairperson of a companys audit committee to be independent of the company and the executive board. Krones ceased to comply with the recommendation on 23 May 2023. On that day  Norbert Broger was elected as chairman of the Audit and Risk Management Committee. As Norbert Broger was CFO of Krones AG until 31 December 2022  it was decided  as a precautionary measure  that he should be classified as not being independent of the company within the meaning of the German Corporate Governance Code.Membership in the Deutsche Börse AG DAX index family has a very high priority for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Krones AG. Krones AG will therefore take immediate steps to restore full compliance with Recommendation C.10 of the German Corporate Governance Code so that all of Deutsche Börses basic index membership criteria are once again met in full in the very near future. As soon as this has been done  Krones shares will regain a place on the list underlying Deutsche Börses index review process. Krones AG shares will consequently then again be a candidate for inclusion in the Deutsche Börse DAX index family as of the next review on 5 December 2023.Contact:Olaf ScholzHead of Investor Relations  Krones AGPhone: +49 9401 70 1169E-mail: olaf.scholz@krones.com,neutral,0.11,0.87,0.01,negative,0.01,0.43,0.56,True,English,"['DAX index family', 'quick return', 'Krones AG', 'EQS-News', 'way', 'Deutsche Börse AG DAX index family', 'Deutsche Börse DAX index family', 'Deutsche Börses index review process', 'Deutsche Börses decision', 'German Corporate Governance Code', 'basic index membership criteria', 'Risk Management Committee', 'companys audit committee', 'Krones AG shares', 'MDAX index', 'SDAX index', 'periodic review', 'next review', 'basic criterion', 'Krones shares', 'Key word', 'quick return', 'partial departure', 'other things', 'executive board', 'Norbert Broger', 'precautionary measure', 'high priority', 'Supervisory Board', 'immediate steps', 'full compliance', 'near future', 'Investor Relations', 'Olaf Scholz', 'Recommendation C.', 'EQS-News', 'Statement', 'way', 'CET', 'CEST', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'September', 'effect', 'outcome', 'component', 'reason', 'chairperson', '23 May', 'day', 'chairman', 'CFO', '31 December', 'meaning', 'place', 'list', 'candidate', 'inclusion', '5 December', 'Contact', 'Head', 'Phone', 'mail', '14']",2023-09-06,2023-09-06,markets.businessinsider.com

This solution creates a virtualized compute environment to run multiple Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) on a uCPE (universal Customer Premise Equipment). The main counterargument of uCPE solutions so far  especially due to a higher hardware price vs. a traditional CPE  has been that the economics of the hardware investment can be challenging if it is not delivered with at least the equivalent feature set of a CPE (such as advanced routing capabilities).Ekinops' answer is to leverage the hardware to its full extent  by optimizing the footprint and performance to the level that superior services can be provided on a more cost-optimized hardware platform. OneOS6-LIM comes with an embedded ONEe600 router which includes all OneOS6 feature set such as QoS  zone-based firewall  encryption  and tunneling mechanisms. The goal of ONEe600 router is to offer all standard networking services at the lowest footprint possible and to save processing resources for vendors VNFs running on the same device.Ekinops commissioned EANTC AG  the European Advanced Networking Test Center  internationally recognized objective test center  to perform tests and evaluate its embedded router performance. EANTC  which provides vendor-neutral network performance test facilities for manufacturers  service providers and enterprise customers  executed in total fifteen test runs for three test scenarios of the Ekinops virtualization and embedded router e600 on an entry level uCPE hardware platform based on Intel's C3xxx Atom Denverton CPU. Overall  the ONEe600 demonstrated solid performance and versatility  making it a valid option for small to medium sized offices looking for a routing solution. Ekinops has demonstrated its virtualization solution made it possible for service providers to maximize compute cycle and monetize the Edge quickly.Sylvain Quartier  VP Marketing & Product Strategy for Access at Ekinops says: ""Not so long ago  NFV was pronounced dead  and we say no way. Ekinops has a long history of providing network access solutions to Service providers. By working with them in close partnership  we acknowledge the huge opportunities  but also the challenges associated with virtualization  especially in terms of return on investment. By using our experience as a carrier-grade software connectivity solutions  we succeeded in combining routing and VPN technology with virtualization  in such a way that not only a fast time to market  but also a quick return on investment can be achieved. In the past two years  we have signed a significant number of telcos for virtualization  and we have more projects lined-up. We have also noted a strong interest from enterprises and our partners eco-system is constantly growing. NVF is not only ""alive"" but definitively kicking and healthy for the foreseeable future.""Full EANTC test report is available here.PressFor further media information  or to schedule an interview with Ekinops  please contact Fraser Kay  iseepr +44(0) 113 350 1922 / fraser@iseepr.co.ukAbout EKINOPSEkinops is a leading provider of open  trusted and innovative network connectivity solutions to service providers around the world.

This solution creates a virtualized compute environment to run multiple Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) on a uCPE (universal Customer Premise Equipment). The main counterargument of uCPE solutions so far  especially due to a higher hardware price vs. a traditional CPE  has been that the economics of the hardware investment can be challenging if it is not delivered with at least the equivalent feature set of a CPE (such as advanced routing capabilities).Ekinops' answer is to leverage the hardware to its full extent  by optimizing the footprint and performance to the level that superior services can be provided on a more cost-optimized hardware platform. OneOS6-LIM comes with an embedded ONEe600 router which includes all OneOS6 feature set such as QoS  zone-based firewall  encryption  and tunneling mechanisms. The goal of ONEe600 router is to offer all standard networking services at the lowest footprint possible and to save processing resources for vendors VNFs running on the same device.Ekinops commissioned EANTC AG  the European Advanced Networking Test Center  internationally recognized objective test center  to perform tests and evaluate its embedded router performance. EANTC  which provides vendor-neutral network performance test facilities for manufacturers  service providers and enterprise customers  executed in total fifteen test runs for three test scenarios of the Ekinops virtualization and embedded router e600 on an entry level uCPE hardware platform based on Intel's C3xxx Atom Denverton CPU. Overall  the ONEe600 demonstrated solid performance and versatility  making it a valid option for small to medium sized offices looking for a routing solution. Ekinops has demonstrated its virtualization solution made it possible for service providers to maximize compute cycle and monetize the Edge quickly.Sylvain Quartier  VP Marketing & Product Strategy for Access at Ekinops says: ""Not so long ago  NFV was pronounced dead  and we say no way. Ekinops has a long history of providing network access solutions to Service providers. By working with them in close partnership  we acknowledge the huge opportunities  but also the challenges associated with virtualization  especially in terms of return on investment. By using our experience as a carrier-grade software connectivity solutions  we succeeded in combining routing and VPN technology with virtualization  in such a way that not only a fast time to market  but also a quick return on investment can be achieved. In the past two years  we have signed a significant number of telcos for virtualization  and we have more projects lined-up. We have also noted a strong interest from enterprises and our partners eco-system is constantly growing. NVF is not only ""alive"" but definitively kicking and healthy for the foreseeable future.""Full EANTC test report is available here.PressFor further media information  or to schedule an interview with Ekinops  please contact Fraser Kay  iseepr +44(0) 113 350 1922 / [email protected]About EKINOPSEkinops is a leading provider of open  trusted and innovative network connectivity solutions to service providers around the world.

We have noted that the trading volumes of our shares are unusually low  and have received reports suggesting that certain brokers are arbitrarily declining orders to purchase VEON shares.Allow me to reiterate once more that VEON is a global company  headquartered in Amsterdam  and listed on NASDAQ and Euronext Amsterdam stock exchanges. We have no majority or ultimate controlling shareholder  and  as a publicly traded company  we have a diverse investor base including US  EU and UK investors. Independent directors make up the majority of VEON's Board of Directors and we have a multinational management team. We operate in 6 emerging markets including Ukraine and continue to deliver accelerating growth with our digital operators that serve nearly 160 million customers with connectivity and digital services. We are also in the final stages of our exit from Russia  originally announced on November 24th  2022  and continue to engage proactively with our counterparts to close this sale process.Let me also clarify once again that VEON Group has not been targeted by US  EU  or UK sanctions at any point since the onset of the conflict in February 2022. Over the course of the past 18 months  we have communicated that we have received various regulatory approvals and licenses from US  UK and EU authorities  adding further clarity and transparency to the trading status of our shares  and enabling the completion of several key liquidity projects  including our Scheme of Arrangement in 2023  extending the maturities of our 2023 bonds.

Shareholders are now advised as follows: The scrip reference price is ZAR cents 10 470.75169 per share  being a 3% discount to the five-day volume weighted average price (less the final dividend of 25.67 euro cents per share) of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE as at 4 September 2023.

Shareholders electing to receive the scrip issue will receive 5 29266 new NEPI Rockcastle shares for every 100 NEPI Rockcastle shares held by such shareholders on the record date of Friday  15 September 2023  representing the ratio that the 27.10 euro cents per share bears to the scrip reference price.Shareholders holding shares traded on the JSE and A2X will receive any capital repayment or cash dividend in South African Rand converted from Euro at an average exchange rate of EUR1.00:ZAR20.44948. Accordingly  the capital repayment and cash dividend of 25.67 euro cents per share will be equal to ZAR cents 524.93815 per share. Shareholders holding shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam will receive any capital repayment or cash dividend in Euros. Should all shareholders elect to receive the scrip issue  the maximum total number of new NEPI Rockcastle shares to be issued by NEPI Rockcastle pursuant to the scrip issue will be 33 652 326.

A summary of the Dutch  South African and United States (""U.S."") tax implications is set out below. Shareholders are further referred to the detailed commentary on the Dutch  South African and U.S. tax implications as set out in the announcement of Tuesday  29 August 2023. Capital repayment (default option) No Dutch dividend tax will be withheld on capital repayments paid to shareholders. For South African shareholders  the capital repayment should be treated as a return of capital (because from a Dutch standpoint it is treated as repayment of capital)  therefore no South African dividend tax should apply. The capital repayment will reduce the shares' tax base  resulting in a potentially higher capital gain in the future when the shares are sold. Insofar as the repayment exceeds the shares' tax base  it may immediately result in capital gains tax. Thus  the gross capital repayment amount paid by the Company is ZAR cents 524.93815 per share for shareholders electing the capital repayment (the default option) subject to tax implication according to South African law. Cash dividend (election) The Company must withhold 15% Dutch dividend tax (""Dutch DWHT"") on the cash dividend  leaving a distribution amount per share net of Dutch DWHT. The actual amount withheld may vary slightly due to rounding  depending on the number of shares owned and the applied exchange rate. The Dutch DWHT will be remitted to the Dutch tax authorities on behalf of the recipient of the cash dividend. Where required  a dividend note will be issued. As a general rule  for private individuals tax resident in South Africa  the gross cash dividend is subject to 20% South African dividends withholding tax (""SADWT"")  leaving a distribution amount per share net of SADWT (i.e. 80% of the gross distribution)  as discussed hereafter. where a regulated intermediary in South Africa ("" CSDP "") is satisfied that a particular private individual tax resident in South Africa has suffered non-recoverable Dutch DWHT  such CSDP should withhold 10% SADWT (being the 20% SADWT less 10% Dutch DWHT  according to the tax treaty between the Netherlands and South Africa("" NL/SA Treaty "")."") is satisfied that a particular private individual tax resident in South Africa has suffered non-recoverable Dutch DWHT  such CSDP should withhold 10% SADWT (being the 20% SADWT less 10% Dutch DWHT  according to the tax treaty between the Netherlands and South Africa NL/SA Treaty Private individuals who are tax resident in South Africa and beneficially own the distributions are generally entitled to a refund of 5% Dutch DWHT of the gross distribution which they may request from the Dutch tax authorities on the basis of the NL/SA Treaty. Thus  the net dividend amount for shareholders (private individuals) electing the cash dividend is ZAR cents 393.70361 per share  being the gross dividend of ZAR cents 524.93815 per share affected by 15% Dutch DWHT withheld by the Company and 10% SADWT withheld by the CSDP. A refund of 5% Dutch DWHT applied to 25.67 euro cents from Dutch tax authorities is available subject to tax claim processes initiated by shareholder or its appointed agent. The above could be different if sufficient proof has been provided to the CSDP of the below: a shareholder qualifies for an exemption from SADWT on the basis of South African domestic law; andthe formal requirements to apply such exemption from SADWT are timely satisfied (insofar as applicable). Issuance of new NEPI Rockcastle shares as a scrip issue (election) The issuance of NEPI Rockcastle shares pursuant to the scrip issue is not subject to Dutch DWHT or SADWT. U.S. tax implications This is a brief summary of the relevant U.S. tax implications and shareholders should consult the Circular for further information. Subject to the passive foreign investment company (""PFIC"") rules discussed in the Circular  a distribution made by the Company on the NEPI Rockcastle shares generally will be treated as a dividend includible in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder as ordinary income to the extent of the Company's current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent the amount of such distribution exceeds the Company's current and accumulated earnings and profits as so computed  the distribution will be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such U.S. shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the NEPI Rockcastle shares and  to the extent the amount of such distribution exceeds such adjusted tax basis  will be treated as gain from the sale of such shares. The Company does not maintain calculations of earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore  a U.S. shareholder should expect that cash distributions to the extent of the capital repayment and the cash dividend will generally be treated as a dividend. Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations. Additionally  the Company intends to treat a distribution of scrip pursuant to the scrip issue as a distribution of property for these purposes  and as such will be treated as a dividend. The amount of the dividend pursuant to the scrip issue will be the fair market value of the scrip received. Distributions pursuant to the capital repayment  the cash dividend and the scrip issue generally will constitute income from sources outside the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The capital repayment and the cash dividend will be paid in currency other than U.S. dollars. The U.S. dollar value of the capital repayment and the cash dividend in foreign currency must be calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt of such distribution by the U.S. shareholder  regardless of whether the foreign currency is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. If the foreign currency so received is converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt  such U.S. shareholder generally will not recognise foreign currency gain or loss on such conversion. If the foreign currency so received is not converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt  such U.S. shareholder will have a basis in the foreign currency equal to its U.S. dollar value on the date of receipt. Any gain or loss on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the foreign currency generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to such U.S. shareholder and generally will be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The information provided above does not constitute tax advice and is intended only as a high-level guide on the tax treatment of the distributions detailed in this announcement. Shareholders should consult their own professional advisers to confirm their tax position. For shareholders residing outside of South Africa  the interim dividend and scrip issue may have other legal or tax implications and such shareholders are advised to obtain appropriate advice from their professional advisers in this regard. The salient dates and times announced on Tuesday  29 August remain unchanged. For further information please contact: NEPI Rockcastle N.V.

Sept. 05  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO – NASDAQ: NBTX – the “Company”)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced the appointment of Louis Kayitalire  MD  as chief medical officer. Dr. Kayitalire brings an exceptional biopharmaceutical industry track record with proven success in the research  development  registration  and commercialization of therapeutics in oncology.“We are pleased to welcome Dr. Kayitalire to our executive leadership team at this pivotal moment for the development and commercialization of potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3 ” said Laurent Levy  Nanobiotix co-founder and chairman of the executive board. “Given the disruptive potential of our radioenhancer for millions of patients with cancer around the world  we are clear-eyed in our understanding that a truly novel product candidate requires the type of seasoned  innovative clinical stewardship on which Dr. Kayitalire has built his career. Dr. Kayitalire’s clinical leadership and expertise in oncology are ideally suited to the task of bringing our ongoing programs to successful completion and helping to build the future of Nanobiotix.”Dr. Kayitalire’s career in biopharmaceuticals and biotechnology  spanning nearly 25 years with a focus on oncology and immuno-oncology agents  features growth through the ranks of several major companies in Europe and the United States. Prior to Nanobiotix  Dr. Kayitalire served most recently as chief medical officer for F-star Biotechnology  a biotechnology company based in Cambridge UK and Cambridge US dedicated to immune-oncology with a platform of bi-specific monoclonal antibodies. He has also held leadership positions at Bristol-Myers Squibb  Celgene  and Eli Lilly  where he helped drive product registration for GEMZAR®  ALIMTA®  ERBITUX® and OPDIVO®.“I have been honored to lead the development of effective therapeutic innovations for patients with cancer throughout my career and am excited by the practice-changing potential of NBTXR3 for those suffering from disease  their loved ones  and the practitioners fighting on their behalf in the clinic ” said Dr. Kayitalire. “I look forward to working with the experts within our team  along with our collaborators  to bring NBTXR3 to registration in head and neck cancer and across solid tumor indications.”Dr. Kayitalire is a medical oncologist who completed his training in oncology and hematology at the Gustave-Roussy Cancer Center in Villejuif  France  where he served as a senior resident in adult solid tumors after receiving his medical degree from Butare University in Rwanda. In addition  Dr. Kayitalire served as Assistant Professor in Oncology at the Paris XI University of France. Dr. Kayitalire is an active member of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)  the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR)  the Society for Immuno-oncology of Cancer (SITC) and the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO).About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways.

Jefferson's Tropics Aged in Humidity is a fully matured Kentucky straight bourbon finished in Singapore's extreme heat and humidity to deliver a rich  textured  and completely unique tasting experience.Photo Courtesy of Pernod RicardJefferson's is constantly experimenting with various blending  aging  and finishing techniques to achieve unique flavors. Its newest release is the ultimate culmination of founder Trey Zoeller's efforts to continue to explore unique maturation techniques and environments. After the success of the innovative Ocean Aged at Sea Voyage Series  founder Trey Zoeller was convinced climate could affect the maturation process more than the mashbill or barrel itself and sought to find new and interesting climates for further proof. But first  he needed a location.""After taking barrels to many different locations  it was evident that the hot and humid climates had such a positive impact on the bourbon. So when homing in on a location to age our first Jefferson's Tropics Aged in Humidity™ release  we knew we needed to be near the equator  where the heat and humidity would be year-round and intense. Singapore - one of my bucket list travel destinations - was absolutely perfect for this experiment "" said Zoeller. ""The result is a remarkable bourbon  one that further reinforces my belief that terroir for whiskey comes from the environment that the bourbon matures in rather than the ground from which the grains are grown. The Jefferson's Tropics Aged in Humidity series embodies the result of this with its richness and complexity - we can't wait for you to experience it firsthand.""The journey to create this special liquid was a wild one. Nine containers with a combined capacity of 720 barrels of fully matured Kentucky straight bourbon set sail for Singapore via an ocean ship in July 2019  marking the start of the journey. Following that journey  these barrels were exposed to Singapore's severe heat and humidity for an astounding 18 months resulting in a bourbon that is intensely caramelized and steeped with flavor. The extreme heat essentially slow cooks and caramelizes the sugars in the wood.The containers finally made their way back to Kentucky in March 2023  where Zoeller evaluated and selected the ideal flavor profile and proof point. The result is a harmoniously blended bourbon that boasts aromatic baking spices on the nose  notes of bing cherry  toffee  and sea salt  and a long  textured  full-bodied finish.Jefferson's Tropics Aged in Humidity™ is fully matured and bottled at 52% ABV. An allocated limited edition special release will be available starting September 2023 in fine spirits retailers and restaurants/bars across the US (MSRP $99.99 /750mL).

They were continuing a family tradition that goes back to 1799 when Trey's eighth generation grandmother became the first woman on record in America to be arrested for the ""production and sales of spirituous liquors."" Over the last 25 years  Trey has brought a unique perspective to Jefferson's  seeing bourbon through the lens of nature  exploration  and experiences.

The tests were conducted using surrogate eFuels provided by Aramco  one of the world’s leading integrated energy and chemicals companies.Low-carbon eFuel is a drop-in synthetic fuel made by reacting CO 2   captured either directly from the atmosphere or from an industrial facility  with renewable hydrogen. The use of low-carbon eFuel has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing internal combustion vehicles by at least 70% on a lifecycle basis  compared to conventional fuels.Ned Curic  Stellantis Chief Engineering and Technology Officer  said: “Our priority is providing zero-emission mobility for all with a focus on electrification  while our collaboration with Aramco is an important and complementary step in this journey for existing fleets on the road. We are exploring all solutions to reinforce our ambitious strategy of becoming a carbon net zero company by 2038. Drop-in eFuels can have a massive and almost immediate impact on reducing the CO 2 emissions of the existing vehicle fleet  offering our customers an easy and economically efficient option to reduce their carbon footprint — one as simple as choosing a different fuel pump at the station  with no additional modification to their vehicles.”Amer Amer  Aramco Transport Chief Technologist  said: “We are delighted to work with Stellantis  one of the world’s leading automakers  to assess the performance of our fuel formulations that are designed to represent expected eFuel characteristics in its existing vehicle engines. The results of the testing reinforce our view that synthetic fuel can be a drop-in solution in existing vehicles  and when produced via a low-carbon pathway it can play an important role in reducing carbon emissions in the transport sector and supporting an orderly energy transition.”Through its long-term strategic plan Dare Forward 2030   Stellantis aims to halve its carbon footprint by 2030  benchmarking 2021 metrics  and achieve carbon net zero by 2038. Stellantis estimates that the use of low-carbon eFuels in up to 28 million of its European vehicles could reduce up to 400 million tons of CO 2 in Europe between 2025 and 2050. Testing of the surrogate eFuels by Stellantis covers tailpipe emissions  startability  engine power  reliability endurance  oil dilution  fuel tank  fuel lines and filters  as well as fuel performance in extreme cold and hot temperatures.Aramco is currently working on two demonstration plants to explore production of low-carbon synthetic fuels. In Saudi Arabia  Aramco and ENOWA (Neom Energy and Water Company) are working to demonstrate the production of synthetic gasoline for light-duty passenger vehicles. Meanwhile  in Bilbao  Spain  Aramco and Repsol are exploring the production of low-carbon synthetic diesel and jet fuel for automobiles and aircraft. In addition  Aramco is working with motorsport teams and competitions to further test and demonstrate the potential of low-carbon fuel as a drop-in solution to reduce carbon emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles.---Aramco Contact InformationInternational Media Relations: media.inquiries@aramco.comAramcoStellantis Contact InformationFernão Silveira  Global Communicationsfernao.silveira@stellantis.com+31 6 43 25 43 41communications@stellantis.comAbout AramcoAramco is a global integrated energy and chemicals company.

Company well positioned to reach the break-even pointOutlook 2023: Further value-enhancing acquisitions to be completed. Significant increase in revenues and earnings expected following successful turnaroundZurich  Switzerland – September 5  2023 – Second half year 2022 results  which corresponds to the short financial year 2022/2023  are reported by beaconsmind AG (“beaconsmind”) (ISIN: CH0451123589 – Ticker: MLBMD)  a leading SaaS provider in the field of location-based marketing (LBM) & analytics. The company’s half year results were negatively impacted by its single product focus in beaconsmind as well as high one-off costs stemming from M&A-related costs. In addition  the financial ratios were negatively impacted by costs inflicted by reorganization measures introduced in FY2022 by Management. Financials of FREDERIX Hotspot GmbH (“FREDERIX”) were not yet consolidated in FY2022  whereas costs related to the acquisition are fully reflected in the financial statements.beaconsmind has prepared consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS and reports its key financial figures in Swiss francs. For the second half year of 2022  beaconsmind posted revenues of CHF 0.55MM and Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortisation (EBITDA) of CHF -3.18MM including aforementioned one-off costs. The Gross Profit margin remained stable at 82.8 percent (prior second half year 2021: 85.4 percent). Annual recurring revenues (ARR) of the beaconsmind Suite software made up around 93 percent of total revenues. Services  hardware  and installation revenues accounted for the remaining 7 percent.FY2023 is beaconsmind's first fiscal year  which will correspond to the respective calendar year with being on track for breakeven by FY2023 end.Following a challenging year 2022 and a successful conclusion of its restructuring measures including change of strategy in 2023  product chain and management  beaconsmind is set for growth. Under its new Group structure  beaconsmind Group continues to increase its service offerings through selected add-on acquisitions such as FREDERIX  Netopsie or Socialwave. In July 2023  the Board of Directors of beaconsmind has appointed Jonathan Sauppe as new CEO of beaconsmind Group to focus on cost-cutting  efficiency and install profitable growth. Through its leadership  beaconsmind Group has already implemented a cost-cutting programme of total CHF 1.0MM by leveraging its range of products and services and centralizing critical functions and operations.In November 2022  a majority stake in FREDERIX  provider of cloud Wi-Fi solutions for businesses and developer of intelligent  cloud-based Wi-Fi hotspot technologies  was acquired. In February 2023  the DSL provider Netopsie was acquired and in March 2023  Socialwave  provider of guest Wi-Fi and marketing solutions. Through these bolt-on acquisitions  beaconsmind will strengthen its Wi-Fi Hotspot vertical and increase its reach significantly in the market whilst unlocking sales and cost synergies between Socialwave  Frederix  Netopsie and beaconsmind. Respective run-rate EBITDA contributions from Socialwave and Frederix including Netopsie amount to ca. CHF 1.5MM and CHF 0.7MM p.a.For FY2023  beaconsmind Group expects to increase its revenues well beyond the EUR 8MM threshold on the back of new revenue streams due to an integrated product portfolio available to both existing and new costumers. In 2023  beaconsmind expects to reach profitability  laying the foundation for further growth in 2024 and beyond. Moving forward  beaconsmind Group plans to further explore accretive acquisition opportunities  as well as delve deeper into the value chain.beaconsmind successfully carried out a capital increase in kind and a cash capital increase with a total volume of CHF 9.6 million in the current financial year. The company is well positioned to reach break-even in 2023.Jonathan Sauppe  CEO of beaconsmind: ""The second half year 2022 results were below our expectations and include certain write-offs in conjunction with decisions by previous Management. Since the strategic and operational re-focus under my leadership the Group has taken significant improvement measures to ensure a profitable growth trajectory on the back of a lean cost structure. Those measures were costly and fully reflected in our second half year 2022 financials including necessary write offs. We are now switching into growth mode into 2024. At beaconsmind Group  the central  strong growth areas will be bundled in the future  the product offerings will be dovetailed into an integrated product portfolio and synergies will be created by centralising the most important Group functions. With the acquisitions of FREDERIX  Netopsie and Socialwave  we have significantly expanded our business activities to offer our customers further innovative solutions from a single source. This should lead to a further growth boost  so that we are optimistic about the future and expect to continue our dynamic development in FY2023.""The second half year financial report 2022 is available for download on beaconsmind's website (www.beaconsmind.com) in the ""Investor Relations"" section.

Presentations include data from the Dupixent (dupilumab) COPD and asthma pivotal trial programs  and data evaluating the role of Xenpozyme (olipudase alfa) in treating interstitial lung disease. Results from the Dupixent Phase 3 trial (BOREAS)  showing significant improvements in annualized rate of exacerbations  lung function  quality of life  as well as symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a new analysis showing reduced systemic corticosteroid use in adults with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation  will be presented as an oral presentation during the New England Journal of Medicine NEJM/ERS journal session and as a late breaking abstract. Additionally  new data from a Phase 3 trial in children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe asthma (VOYAGE) show Dupixent reduced systemic corticosteroid use related to exacerbations compared to placebo regardless of prior exacerbation history. The safety results of the COPD and asthma trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved respiratory indications. Data from Sanofi's Phase 1b study of SAR443765 in adults with asthma also demonstrate proof-of-mechanism  the first report of a novel biologic targeting both the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and interleukin-13(IL-13) pathways. Late-breaking results from the Severe Asthma Index  a first-of-its-kind free-to-access evidence-based tool that provides a holistic view of how 29 different countries approach severe asthma care  will also be presented illustrating the inadequate prioritization of the condition around the world and the need for a comprehensive approach to disease management. The Severe Asthma Index was developed by the Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studiesand funded by Sanofi and Regeneron. New Phase 2/3 data demonstrated that Xenpozyme significantly improved pulmonary function in adults with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD)  providing positive disease modification across four critical domains of interstitial lung disease. The safety profile for Xenpozyme was comparable across studies.Data to be presented at the 2023 ERS International Congress Dupixent in adults with COPD Late Breaking Abstract (September 10  12:30pm-14:00pm CEST): #PA1308: Efficacy and Safety of Dupilumab for COPD with Type 2 Inflammation Indicated by Elevated EosinophilsOral NEJM /ERS Joint Journal Session (September 11  13:45pm-14:00pm CEST):/ERS Joint Journal Session (September 11  13:45pm-14:00pm CEST): #3108: Dupilumab for COPD with Type 2 Inflammation Indicated by Eosinophil CountsDupixent in children and adults with asthma Poster #PA2101: Dupilumab reduces systemic corticosteroid exposure in children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma regardless of prior exacerbationsmoderate-to-severe asthma regardless of prior exacerbations Poster #PA2090: Dupilumab improves lung function responder rates in children with type 2 asthma in the VOYAGE studyPoster #PA2091: Long-term dupilumab effect on lung function in paediatric patients with uncontrolled asthmaLong-term dupilumab effect on lung function in paediatric patients with uncontrolled asthma Oral presentation (September 10  2:15pm - 3:30pm CEST): #OA1416: Long-Term Dupilumab Efficacy in Patients with Type 2 Asthma by Ageof Onset: LIBERTY ASTHMA TRAVERSEPoster #PA3618: Long-term efficacy and tolerability of dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe type 2 asthma stratified by baseline characteristicsLong-term efficacy and tolerability of dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe type 2 asthma stratified by baseline characteristics Poster #PA5286: Dupilumab in Asia-Pacific patients with persistent asthmaAsia-Pacific patients with persistent asthma Poster #PA3607: Fractional exhaled nitric oxide as a biomarker in patients with uncontrolled asthmaPoster #PA5290: Baseline characteristics of patients with asthma and prior systemic corticosteroid use in the RAPID (dupilumab) registry Disease burden and diagnosis Late-Breaking Poster #PA4746: Novel Index assesses severe asthma care across 29 OECD countriesPoster #PA4746: Novel Index assesses severe asthma care across 29 OECD countries Poster #PA4605: Oral corticosteroid (OCS) burden and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) who did or did not undergo functional endoscopic sinonasal surgery (FESS) in US real-world practicereal-world practice Poster #PA3948: Machine learned decision tree for diagnosis of ASMD among patients with unexplained ILD Sanofi respiratory pipeline Late breaking abstract #OA4296: Early improvement in asthma small airway dysfunction after one dose of SAR443765  a novel bispecific anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin/anti- IL-13 nanobody molecule Xenpozyme in adults with ASMD Oral presentation (September 11  3:45 - 5:00pm CEST) #OA3281: Reversal of interstitial lung disease after olipudase alfa enzyme replacement therapy in adults with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency About Dupixent Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis. Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations.

29811,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/who-owns-deezer-today/,Who owns Deezer today?,A group of well-known entertainment investors and French entrepreneurs comprise the music streaming service’s major shareholders.,Deezer’s investors have had a rough time of things since the company went public on the Euronext Paris stock exchange via a SPAC merger last year.Since debuting on the market at EUR €8.50 per share in July 2022  Deezer’s stock price has fallen by more than 75% (with a good part of that decline taking place on its first day of trading).As of the close of trading on Wednesday (September 6)  according to Euronext data  Deezer’s share price was trading at EUR €2.15.That gives the France-headquartered music streaming service a market cap of €251.66 million  a quarter of the size of the €1.05 billion valuation it had at the time of its SPAC merger.This tumble in Deezer’s value is no doubt driven by investor uncertainty about the outlook for an independent music streaming service competing against a much-larger rival (Spotify) as well as DSPs backed by deep-pocketed US technology companies (Apple Music  YouTube Music).Deezer’s less-than-stellar performance since the IPO hasn’t helped  either.Subscriber growth has stalled  with Deezer’s latest earnings report showing a decline in total subscribers of 100 000 YoY – to 9.3 million from 9.4 million – at the close of June 2023.One saving grace in those numbers: Deezer continued to see some growth in ‘direct’ subscribers in its home and largest market  France  with an increase of 300 000 YoY.As recently as April  Deezer was telling investors it expected double-digit revenue growth in 2023; just four months later  in August  Deezer had revised that downwards to 7%-10% revenue growth.At the time of its public listing in 2022  Deezer was aiming for €1 billion in annual revenue by 2025.With revenue in H1 2023 coming at just €233.2 million (up 6.5% YoY at constant currency) that billion-Euro goal seems increasingly out of reach.Deezer described itself last year as “the second largest independent music streaming platform in the world”.But in truth it is miles behind Spotify  which recorded 220 million paying subscribers  and a total of 551 million monthly active users (MAUs) as of Q2 2023.The careful placement of the word “independent” in Deezer’s statement encourages us to overlook all the non-independent (i.e. non-‘pureplay’) DSPs that have popped up in the years since Deezer began operating back in 2007 – such as Apple Music  Amazon Music  Tencent Music Entertainment’s various services  YouTube Music  and most recently  TikTok Music.According to BusinessOfApps  when taking all the other music DSPs into account  Deezer was in 10th place worldwide as of last year  by number of users.The overall lack of growth in its subscriber base may explain why investors have punished its stock price over the past year.But who  exactly  are Deezer’s largest investors?MBW looked into it  and it turns out that Deezer has some major music and entertainment industry heavyweights behind it – as well as a number of France’s most prominent entrepreneurs.According to financial services company Cofisem  whose data is integrated into the Euronext database  Deezer’s single largest investor is Access Industries  with a 36.79% share of the company as of July 31.To those who follow the music industry  the name Access Industries may ring a bell: it’s the company controlled by Len Blavatnik  through which the business magnate and philanthropist acquired Warner Music Group (WMG) back in 2011.As of the start of 2023  Blavatnik controlled 73.03% of WMG’s outstanding shares.As of last count  Blavatnik’s net worth is estimated at USD $39.6 billion  making him the 32nd wealthiest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.(Deezer’s ownership has another link to WMG  too: 3.05% of the streaming company’s shares are owned by WEA International  a part of WMG that was formed in 1982 to handle distribution of Warner Bros.  Elektra and Atlantic Records releases outside the US.)Next in the rankings of Deezer shareholders (see above) is the “other” category – meaning various different stock owners who buy and sell Deezer’s shares on the stock exchange. These companies jointly own 33.70% of Deezer’s shares  and their ranks could well include a major player in the music business  namely Universal Music Group.The “other” category includes investors who were part of a PIPE (private investment into public equity) at the time of Deezer’s IPO  an effort that raised €135 million for Deezer ahead of its stock market debut.According to a press release at the time  the PIPE included most of the company’s existing shareholders at the time  including UMG and Warner Music Group  as well as French investment company Eurazeo  French telecom and tech entrepreneur Xavier Niel  France-based investment bank Bpifrance and French/Belgian media conglomerate Média-Participations.What’s not clear is how much of Deezer these PIPE investors still own today. The PIPE involved Deezer issuing 15 million new shares of the company  which were then floated on the Euronext exchange  meaning these investors could have sold their shares at any time since the IPO  or held on to them.Deezer’s second-largest single stakeholder is Saudi Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal Al Saud  who’s invested in the company in two different ways: via a subsidiary of Kingdom Holding Company  of which Al Waleed is Chairman  CEO and 95% owner  and through Rotana Audio Holding Ltd.  a Cayman Islands-registered subsidiary of Rotana Group  a Saudi Arabia-based entertainment company owned entirely by Al Waleed.Kingdom Holdings owns 5.23% of Deezer’s shares  while Rotana Audio Holding has 5.15%.Rotana and Kingdom Holding were investors in Deezer well before the company went public in 2022  participating in a 2018 funding round that raised €160 million for the company.At that time  Rotana became the exclusive digital distributor of Deezer’s music and video content in the Middle East and North Africa.More than a quarter of Deezer’s revenue comes from what it calls “partnership” subscriptions  that is  customers who’ve subscribed via bundle deals with a service provider  typically a telco.One of the most important partnerships for Deezer has been with wireless provider Orange  so it may be little surprise to find that a subsidiary of the France-based company – Orange Participations SA – holds a 7.86% share of Deezer.Another major investor is Francois Pinault  the prominent French billionaire businessman who founded Kering  the luxury goods company known for brands such as Gucci  Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga.Through his family holding company  Groupe Artemis  Pinault controls 4.35% of Deezer’s shares  according to Cofisem.The Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates Pinault’s net worth at $40.8 billion  placing him 30th on the ranking.Notably  Pinault’s son  Francois-Henri Pinault  was Co-Founder and member of the board of directors of I2P0  the SPAC with which Deezer merged to go public last year. The younger Pinault has served as Chairman and CEO of Kering since 2005.(News recently broke that Francois-Henri Pinault is nearing a $7-billion deal to buy a majority stake in Los Angeles-headquartered talent and sports agency Creative Artists Agency  aka CAA.)I2P0’s CEO and Board Chair was Iris Knobloch  who spent nearly 15 years as President of Operations for the French division of WarnerMedia (not to be confused with Warner Music Group  which was spun off from what was then Time Warner in 2004).Knobloch currently serves as President of the Cannes Film Festival  and her company SaCh27 SAS owns 1.88% of Deezer’s shares.Another Deezer investor who came to the company by way of I2P0 is Matthieu Pigasse  the French investment banker and media mogul  who was among the investors who initially formed I2P0 in 2021. Among many other things  Pigasse is co-owner of Le Monde  arguably France’s most prominent newspaper.Pigasse’s holding company  Combat Holding SAS  owns 1.88% of Deezer shares  per Soficem.What can we conclude from this?While many of Deezer’s major shareholders are a tightly-knit bunch of prominent French entrepreneurs  the company has also attracted serious money from international investors who’ve proven they know what they’re doing – Blavatnik and Al Waleed being the two prime examples.On the strength of that alone we can conclude that  although the company is struggling today with a declining share price and a stagnant subscriber base  it would be unwise to count Deezer out of the game just yet.Music Business Worldwide,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.12,0.29,0.59,True,English,"['Deezer', 'second largest independent music streaming platform', 'French/Belgian media conglomerate Média-Participations', 'independent music streaming service', 'France-headquartered music streaming service', '551 million monthly active users', 'various different stock owners', 'deep-pocketed US technology companies', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'latest earnings report', 'One saving grace', '32nd wealthiest person', 'Bloomberg Billionaires Index', 'Atlantic Records releases', 'Tencent Music Entertainment', 'Universal Music Group', '220 million paying subscribers', 'France-based investment bank', 'entertainment industry heavyweights', 'Warner Music Group', 'single largest investor', 'stock market debut', '15 million new shares', 'financial services company', 'double-digit revenue growth', 'French investment company', 'other music DSPs', 'streaming company', 'various services', 'music industry', 'largest market', 'Euronext exchange', 'stock price', 'Apple Music', 'YouTube Music', 'Amazon Music', 'TikTok Music', 'major music', 'music business', 'Warner Bros.', 'private investment', 'largest investors', 'investor uncertainty', 'Euronext database', 'French telecom', 'single stake', 'direct’ subscribers', 'SPAC merger', 'first day', 'market cap', '€1.05 billion valuation', 'larger rival', 'stellar performance', 'public listing', 'annual revenue', 'constant currency', 'billion-Euro goal', 'careful placement', 'last year', 'overall lack', 'subscriber base', 'past year', 'prominent entrepreneurs', 'Access Industries', 'business magnate', 'last count', 'net worth', 'WEA International', 'major player', 'public equity', 'press release', 'existing shareholders', 'Xavier Niel', 'total subscribers', 'Subscriber growth', '7%-10% revenue growth', '10th place', 'outstanding shares', 'other” category', 'good part', 'share price', 'Len Blavatnik', 'rough time', 'Deezer shareholders', 'PIPE investors', '36.79% share', 'things', 'July', 'decline', 'trading', 'close', 'Wednesday', 'September', 'size', 'tumble', 'value', 'Spotify', 'IPO', '100,000 YoY', 'June', 'numbers', 'home', 'increase', '300,000 YoY', 'April', 'August', 'H1', 'reach', 'world', 'truth', 'MAUs', 'Q2', 'word', 'statement', 'pureplay', 'years', 'BusinessOfApps', 'account', 'MBW', 'Cofisem', 'name', 'bell', 'WMG', 'start', 'ownership', 'link', 'distribution', 'Elektra', 'rankings', 'ranks', 'effort', 'UMG', 'Eurazeo', 'Bpifrance']",2023-09-06,2023-09-06,musicbusinessworldwide.com

Verimatrix is set to demo the new Counterspy™ offering Sept 15-18 in Amsterdam at IBC 2023 booth #1.D81.Traditional set-top box security leverages operator-issued hardware with protected pre-shared keys  securely linking identified customers. This is no longer the norm  as consumers have multiple ways to consume content  including bring-your-own-device (BYOD)  accessing content via apps. Generic DRM systems often lack inherent customer authentication  offloading identity to secondary mechanisms vulnerable to attack.Verimatrix Counterspy redefines security for the modern BYOD-connected era. It goes beyond traditional set-top box protections to enable robust  studio-grade content security across any device utilizing media apps customers choose to use. Counterspy fills the authentication gap left by the shift away from operator-controlled hardware  safeguarding previously vulnerable identity factors against theft. This allows operators to confidently distribute experiences once locked to proprietary platforms  while opening new monetization opportunities through a peace of mind security approach fit for the complexities of today’s viewing landscape.Verimatrix Counterspy uniquely protects critical identity factors like login credentials and tokens  monitoring and responding to theft attempts across devices. This robust defense is beyond current MDRM vendor capabilities.Verimatrix Counterspy is part of the Verimatrix Streamkeeper family of content security and anti-piracy solutions. This new availability is a notable advancement for a set-top box’s protection posture and is a first in the industry.Integrated through Amlogic  a leading fabless semiconductor company  and initially used within set-top boxes from Beacon  Verimatrix Counterspy provides a host of powerful capabilities that protect valuable content as well as video operator revenues. It uniquely protects against credential theft  protection circumvention  app fraud and ad revenue loss – all while also enabling operators to control defensive measures such as picture quality degradation  on-screen warnings and instance termination.“Verimatrix Counterspy is a leap forward when it comes to future-proofing content security  arming operators with advanced anti-piracy tools and providing the industrial-scale defensive countermeasures they need to combat ever-creative pirates that try to take full advantage of today’s modern  internet-connected boxes ” said Sofia Regojo  Chief Revenue Officer at Verimatrix. “We are pleased to work with both Beacon and Amlogic to showcase anti-piracy measures that were never before available on an Android set-top box. It’s an answer to a pressing problem for operators who face a host of piracy-related threats that create significant dents in revenue and put premium content at risk.”“Integrating Verimatrix Counterspy into our set-top boxes is a game-changer ” said Richard Kim  COO at Beacon. “By protecting content integrity across devices  Counterspy allows us to offer a new way to extend anti-piracy protection to operators across apps and devices  while providing seamless  entertainment experiences that today’s discerning consumers demand.”“We’re pleased to help support the advancement of video content protection and operator revenues  placing the latest anti-piracy technologies where and how its needed ” said James Xie  senior vice president of corporate business strategy at Amlogic  “Amlogic looks forward to promoting Counterspy’s availability at IBC  as it serves the latest innovation from Verimatrix during our many years of jointly serving operators.”Both Beacon (IBC booth #1.A21) and Amlogic (IBC booth #5.A33) are long-time Verimatrix partners.

These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for Q4 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company has commenced MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0  with initial data expected in Q4 2023.Story continuesSequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.
