The EU has long been irked by the dominance of the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) in the clearing of euro-denominated interest rate swaps ,"By Huw JonesLONDON (Reuters) - Leading users of derivatives markets in the European Union called on the bloc on Thursday to scrap a plan that would force them to shift euro derivatives clearing from London to the EU.The EU has long been irked by the dominance of the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) in the clearing of euro-denominated interest rate swaps  a contract widely used by companies to hedge against moves in borrowing costs.Its executive European Commission has proposed a draft law that would require banks and asset managers in the EU to have an active account with a clearer based in the bloc - in practice Deutsche Boerse's Eurex Clearing in Frankfurt - to shift business from LSEG to Eurex.In a joint statement  funds and derivatives industry bodies said reforms to derivatives markets implemented since the global financial crisis had made them safer  and that it was important not to disrupt and fragment the global clearing market.""The proposed active account requirement (AAR) would negatively impact EU capital markets by introducing fragmentation and loss of netting benefits  and make the EU less resilient to market stresses  with no benefit to EU financial stability "" they said.The statement was signed by funds industry groups EFAMA  ICI Global and AIMA  derivatives sector bodies FIA and ISDA  along with the Federation of the Dutch Pension Funds  the Finance Denmark association and the Nordic Securities Association.AAR would put EU firms at a competitive disadvantage compared to third-country firms  which would still be able to transact in global markets without restriction  the industry bodies said.""We therefore strongly recommend the deletion of the proposed Active Account Requirement "" they said.The draft clearing law is now being scrutinised by the European Parliament and EU states  with splits already emerging as some lawmakers call for the active account plan to be deleted. Others want a tougher approach to setting ""thresholds"" for moving clearing from London to the EU.(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Helen Popper)",neutral,0.06,0.75,0.19,negative,0.03,0.27,0.71,True,English,"['Industry bodies', 'relocation plan', 'EU', 'euro-denominated interest rate swaps', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'Finance Denmark association', 'Nordic Securities Association', 'global financial crisis', 'active account requirement', 'Dutch Pension Funds', 'derivatives sector bodies', 'funds industry groups', 'derivatives industry bodies', 'EU financial stability', 'active account plan', 'global clearing market', 'EU capital markets', 'global markets', 'derivatives markets', 'market stresses', 'ICI Global', 'euro derivatives', 'Huw Jones', 'Leading users', 'European Union', 'borrowing costs', 'European Commission', 'asset managers', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'netting benefits', 'competitive disadvantage', 'third-country firms', 'clearing law', 'European Parliament', 'tougher approach', 'Helen Popper', 'EU firms', 'EU states', 'draft law', 'Eurex Clearing', 'joint statement', 'Reuters', 'bloc', 'Thursday', 'The', 'dominance', 'LSEG', 'contract', 'companies', 'moves', 'executive', 'banks', 'clearer', 'practice', 'Frankfurt', 'business', 'reforms', 'AAR', 'fragmentation', 'loss', 'EFAMA', 'AIMA', 'FIA', 'ISDA', 'Federation', 'restriction', 'deletion', 'splits', 'lawmakers', 'thresholds', 'Editing']",2023-09-07,2023-09-07,uk.news.yahoo.com

Adjusted for Estetrol  this growth came to +35.3% (+35.0% at constant exchange rates)  mainly as a result of a strong activity at the Turku and Aramon sites  as well as higher demand for R&D services. Sales also benefited from the price increases implemented during the course of 2022 . net sales of Specialty Fine Chemicals totaled €44.7 million  a 5.4% increase compared to 2022 (a 4.7% increase at constant exchange rates). Excluding sales of June 2022 of the Canadian subsidiary which was disposed at the beginning of June 2023  the increase is 11.0% (a 10.2% increase at constant exchange rates). Demand was generally good at the start of the year  with however a slowdown in the Lubricants business  offset by the dynamism of other activities and the effects of price increases implemented during the course of 2022.PCAS Group EBITDA amounted to 4.7 million euros in the first half of 2023  compared to -0.5 million euros in the first half of 2022.Current operating income for the first half of 2023 amounted to -11.0 million euros  compared to -15.3 million euros for the first half of 2022.These results are affected by a level of activity still insufficient to cover fixed costs at several Pharmaceutical Synthesis sites.Other operating income and expenses in the first half of 2023 include:. a capital gain of 66.1 million euros from the sale of the Group's Canadian subsidiary which was completed on June 1  2023 . a partial depreciation of Mithra receivables for 15.6 million euros since the risk of a future default of Mithra cannot be totally excluded and that PCAS has had to start legal proceedings to obtain the payment of its receivables  being precised that there have been no major developments in this dispute in recent months.As a reminder  other operating income and expenses included in 2022 a goodwill impairment for an amount of 14.5 million euros.Financial expenses rose sharply as a result of the increase in PCAS Group debt before the impact of the disposal of the Canadian subsidiary  and the increase in the financial interests paid on the Seqens loan and current accounts in line with the overall trend in interest rates and the cost of Seqens Group debt.The net result for the first half of 2023 shows a profit of 25.4 million euros compared to a loss of 32.2 million euros for the first half of 2022.The Group's net debt (including Seqens net current accounts) totaled 195.1 million euros vs. 228.4 million euros as of December 31  2022. This change is mainly due to the cash generated by the sale of the Group's Canadian subsidiary  partly offset by operating losses  financial expenses and capital expenditure in the first half of 2023.OutlookIn the context of the ongoing dispute with the customer Mithra  a temporary shutdown of activity has been implemented during the second quarter of 2023 at the production site concerned  some of which workshops being dedicated to the production of Estetrol. Due to this reduction of activity  PCAS decided during today's Board of Directors to launch a project to reorganize the site in order to increase its industrial capabilities and reposition it as a more flexible contract manufacturing activity for active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates  and thus ensure its future. This reorganization and repositioning project requires the launch of an employment protection plan (Plan de sauvegarde de l’emploi) subject to an ongoing information-consultation of the competent workers’ councils. As part of this employment protection plan  PCAS would offer support and redeployment measures  including at other PCAS Group sites which are not concerned by the proposed reorganization. The resizing and repositioning of the site would have no impact on PCAS's commitments towards its customers  be it for existing or future projects which deployment will be pursued over the long run.The disposal of the Group's Canadian subsidiary at the beginning of June 2023 enabled the Group to repay part of Seqens' current account liability for an amount of 79.4 million euros  and to reinforce PCAS Group shareholders' equity (7.2 million euros as of June 30  2023 versus -17.7 million euros as of December 31  2022).As indicated in the press releases of March 30  April 24  and July 27  2023  the return to positive results  previously announced for 2023  has been postponed.PCAS Group will continue to benefit from the support of its majority shareholder Seqens (owning 76.66%) for the financing of its activities and its development.Filing of a simplified tender offer for PCAS shares and proposed share capital increasePCAS has been informed of the intention of Seqens  which holds 76.66% of the share capital and 86.66% of the theoretical voting rights of PCAS  to file a simplified public tender offer (OPAS) for the PCAS shares not yet held by Seqens. If  after the OPAS  the necessary conditions are met  this offer will be followed by a squeeze-out. Today's Board of Directors also welcomed Seqens' intention to carry out  following the OPAS  ashare capital increase in PCAS for approximately 200 million euros (including share premium) with preferential subscription rights. This transaction would enable to significantly reduce PCAS indebtedness and strengthen its shareholders' equity.A press release detailing the practical terms of these operations is also being issued today.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:Q3 2023 net sales – October 30  2023ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies.

PCAS considers that EBITDA is a measurement that is frequently indicated and widely used by investors and other interested parties as a measurement of the operational performance of PCAS and its debt service capacity insofar as it makes it possible to make a constant comparison of performance without taking into account amortization expenses  which may vary significantly depending on the accounting methods used (particularly in the event of acquisitions) or non-operational factors (such as historical cost). Consequently  this information is indicated in the present document to enable a more exhaustive and global analysis of operational performance in comparison with other companies and of PCAS’ debt service capacity. Insofar as not all companies calculate the EBITDA in the same way  the presentation of EBITDA in the present document may not be comparable to the EBITDA communicated by other companies.Reconciliation of EBITDA with Current Operating Incomeen millions d'euros 30 June 2022 30 June 2023 Current Operating Income -15.3 -11.0 + Amortization of tangible and intangible assets 10.4 12.1 + Net allocations to provisions for inventories (recorded in consumed purchases) 4.7 3.7 + Net provisions for emloyee benefits (recorded in personnel costs) - - +/- Net variation in other provisions -0.3 -0.1 EBITDA -0.5 4.7Attachment,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.17,0.23,0.6,True,English,"['PCAS', 'RESULTS', 'JUNE', 'flexible contract manufacturing activity', 'several Pharmaceutical Synthesis sites', 'Seqens net current accounts', 'other PCAS Group sites', 'active pharmaceutical ingredients', 'Fine Specialty Chemicals', 'research tax credit', 'constant exchange rate', 'R&D services', 'Specialty Fine Chemicals', 'employment protection plan', 'Plan de sauvegarde', 'Pharmaceutical Synthesis business', 'Current operating income', 'Other operating income', 'PCAS Canada securities', 'Seqens Group debt', 'PCAS Group debt', 'The PCAS Group', 'PCAS Group EBITDA', 'consolidated net sales', 'Aramon sites', 'net debt', 'Parmaceutical Synthesis', 'other activities', 'Seqens loan', 'The Group', 'interest rates', 'operating losses', '4.7 EBITDA margin', 'Lubricants business', 'accounts receivables', 'Net result', 'Euronext Paris', 'complex molecules', 'life sciences', 'innovative technologies', 'capital gain', 'same period', 'higher demand', 'price increases', 'Canadian subsidiary', 'first half', 'fixed costs', 'legal proceedings', 'major developments', 'recent months', 'financial interests', 'overall trend', 'capital expenditure', 'temporary shutdown', 'second quarter', 'industrial capabilities', 'ongoing information-consultation', 'competent workers', 'redeployment measures', '113.4 million euros', '3.6 million euros', '4.7 million euros', '0.5 million euros', '66.1 million euros', '15.6 million euros', '14.5 million euros', '25.4 million euros', '32.2 million euros', '195.1 million euros', '228.4 million euros', 'strong activity', 'consolidated results', 'partial depreciation', 'customer Mithra', 'Financial result', 'last year', 'future default', 'goodwill impairment', 'ongoing dispute', 'Financial expenses', 'Mithra receivables', 'repositioning project', 'production site', 'Ecully', 'JUNE', 'specialist', 'publication', 'today', 'Board', 'Directors', 'millions', 'Taxes', 'CIR', '2.0% increase', '1.7% increase', 'Estetrol', 'growth', 'Turku', 'course', '5.4% increase', '4.7% increase', 'beginning', '10.2% increase', 'start', 'slowdown', 'dynamism', 'effects', 'level', 'risk', 'payment', 'reminder', 'amount', 'impact', 'disposal', 'line', 'profit', 'December', 'cash', 'Outlook', 'context', 'workshops', 'reduction', 'order', 'intermediates', 'reorganization', 'launch', 'emploi', 'councils', 'support', 'resizing', 'commitments', '2023', '2022', '1.0']",2023-09-06,2023-09-07,globenewswire.com

Mr. Stevensefurther asked if the Company considered to move the production site in Hazelwood  St. Louis  USA. Mr. Litjensresponded that the Company checked possibilities to move but concluded that to stay and build up with adequate flood protection was the best solution from a financial point of view since such a flood only happens once in 125 years. Mr. Stevensefurther asked why the current EBITDA of 11% is so far away from the communicated goal of 20% EBITDA and how the Company plans to reach this goal. Mr. Litjensexplained that the flood in the US site had a big impact and that with stabilizing material and energy prices and maximum utilization and innovative products with high added value  this goal could be reached. Mr. Lemoineasked what the ceiling of the inflation correction for price increases is. Mr. Litjensreplied that the ceiling for price increases for the lower end products is reached.

Santa Monica & Paris September 06  2023- Universal Music Group (UMG)  the world leader in music-based entertainment  and Deezer  one of the largest independent music streaming platforms  today announced the launch of an artist-centric streaming model  designed to better reward the artists  and the music that fans value the most. Deezer will launch the model in France  Q4 2023 with additional markets to follow. The two companies developed the new model together as part of their previously announced collaboration  using their respective deep data analysis to develop an economic model that better reflects the true value of artist-fan relationships. The collaboration to launch an artist-centric model is driven by the companies' recognition that the current music streaming model needs to be re-imagined. While streaming has been the most significant technology advancement in music in many years  a flood of uploads with no meaningful engagement  including non-artist noise content  has necessitated reassessment of the approach that platforms  labels  and artists take to foster a thriving music ecosystem. Based on Deezer's in-depth data analysis the following key enhancements are being integrated into the new artist-centric model: Focusing on artists -Deezer will attribute a double boost to what they define as ""professional artists"" - those who have a minimum of 1 000 streams per month by a minimum of 500 unique listeners - in order to more fairly reward them for the quality and engagement they bring to the platforms and fans;-Deezer will attribute a double boost to what they define as ""professional artists"" - those who have a minimum of 1 000 streams per month by a minimum of 500 unique listeners - in order to more fairly reward them for the quality and engagement they bring to the platforms and fans; Rewarding engaging content - additionally assigning a double boost for songs that fans actively engage with  reducing the economic influence of algorithmic programming;- additionally assigning a double boost for songs that fans actively engage with  reducing the economic influence of algorithmic programming; Demonetizing non-artist noise audio - Deezer is planning to replace non-artist noise content with its own content in the functional music space  and this won't be included in the royalty pool; and- Deezer is planning to replace non-artist noise content with its own content in the functional music space  and this won't be included in the royalty pool; and Tackling fraud - continuing to drive an updated  and stricter  proprietary fraud detection system  removing incentives for bad actors  and protecting streaming royalties for artists.Moreover  the size of the catalog available on digital platforms has exploded in recent years. Deezer's catalog grew from 90 to over 200 million pieces of content in the past two years alone. As part of the artist-centric model  Deezer intends to apply a stricter provider policy to ensure quality and a better user experience. This includes steps to limit non-artist noise content. ""This is the most ambitious change to the economic model since the creation of music streaming and a change that will support the creation of high-quality content in the years to come "" said Jeronimo Folgueira  CEO of Deezer. ""At Deezer we always put music first  providing a high-quality experience for fans and championing fairness in the industry. We are now embracing a necessary change  to better reflect the value of each piece of content and eliminate all wrong incentives  to protect and support artists. There is no other industry where all content is valued the same  and it should be obvious to everyone that the sound of rain or a washing machine is not as valuable as a song from your favorite artist streamed in HiFi."" ""The goal of the artist centric model is to mitigate dynamics that risk drowning music in a sea of noise and to ensure we are better supporting and rewarding artists at all stages of their careers whether they have 1000 fans or 100 thousand or 100 million. With this multi-faceted approach  music by artists that attracts and engages fans will receive weighting that better recognizes its value  and the fraud and gaming  which serves only to deprive artists their due compensation  will be aggressively addressed "" said Michael Nash  UMG's EVP and Chief Digital Officer. He continued  ""Embracing the commonly shared objectives we highlighted at the outset of this chapter in our partnership  together we'll maintain a flexible and adaptive approach. As the ever-evolving music landscape continues its rapid transformation  UMG and Deezer will rigorously address the impact of these changes as we incorporate new insights from data analysis  and fine-tune the model  as appropriate."" Olivier Nusse  CEO of Universal Music France  said  ""After extensive engagement with Deezer throughout 2023  we are very proud to be pioneers in France in the highly anticipated roll out of their version of the Artist Centric model. This comprehensive initiative will much more effectively value fan engagement and active streaming of music created by artists."" *** Notes to editors: Highlights from Preliminary Work No surprise: fans listen to music by the artists they love Deezer's data analysis showed that fans mostly consume music from the artists they love and show little interest in music from hobbyists or functional music.Content clutter is degrading the fan experience and impeding discovery of artists.For example  97% of all uploaders on the Deezer platform generated only 2% of the total streams. Whereas only 2% of all uploaders-those artists attracting a consistent fanbase-had more than 1 000 monthly unique listeners. Reward the artists that attract and retain subscribers In designing a fairer allocation of revenue  Deezer seeks to provide greater incentives to those artists who drive valuable engagement on the platform:A double boost will be given to all artists who have a minimum of 1 000 streams per month by a minimum of 500 unique listeners.Deezer's data shows that these artists can come from a wide spectrum-from DIY to indie to major label. By examining user behavior over the initial period immediately after they subscribe to Deezer  and then looking at that same user's behavior in the first month after joining  conclusions can be drawn regarding which artists drove them to subscribe and which artists kept them engaged on the platform.spectrum-from DIY to indie to major label. By examining user behavior over the initial period immediately after they subscribe to Deezer  and then looking at that same user's behavior in the first month after joining  conclusions can be drawn regarding which artists drove them to subscribe and which artists kept them engaged on the platform. Data indicates that the artists listened to by new subscribers in their first month may drive as much as 25% to 30% of user's streams over the first two years of their activity on the service. To reward artists that fans engage with  Deezer will boost the value of their streams that drive engagement on the platform.Addressing fraud  system gaming  and undue influence By continuing to improve safeguards to prevent fraud  system gaming and undue influence  revenue in the artist pool is likely to increase. Deezer's data showed that this could be done in a variety of ways including:Fully deploying and further developing Deezer's proprietary fraud detection system to optimize the removal of manipulated streams. Deezer's best-in-class algorithm identified approximately 7% of streams as fraudulent in 2022: this algorithm uses machine learning at the user level to identify financial fraud (fake accounts  payment fraud)  and potential system-gaming behaviors.Removing ""noise"" content from royalty pool Streams tagged as ""noise"" represented approximately 2% of streams on the platform.Deezer's intention is to replace non-artist noise content on the platform with its own content in the functional music space  which will not be accounted for in the royalty pool. Integrating additional artist-centric components to benefit both artists and fans The partnership construct will enable data-based adjustments to optimize model performance and establish the foundation for introduction of future elements such as ARPU enhancements  including superfan monetization. Other elements of the partnership Universal will collaborate with Deezer on the development of Deezer's fraud detection tools and AI detection  and intends to experiment with new technology and label services from Deezer. # # # About Deezer Deezer is one of the largest independent music streaming platforms in the world  with more than 200 million pieces of content available in 180 countries  providing access to lossless HiFi audio  innovative recommendation technology and industry defining features.

The target regulatory action date assigned by the FDA under a Priority Review status is 30 November 2021.FOP is an ultra-rare genetic disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1.36 per million individuals; however  the number of confirmed cases varies by country.1 2 It is characterized by new bone formation outside of the normal skeletal system  like in soft connective tissues  a process known as heterotopic ossification (HO) 3 which can be preceded by painful soft-tissue swelling or ""flare-ups"".2 Flare-up episodes are common and are a substantial contributor to the formation of new HO  however HO can form in the absence of a flare-up. HO  once formed  is irreversible and leads to loss of mobility and shortened life expectancy.3Dr. Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development  Ipsen  said ""With no approved treatments for this progressive and debilitating disease  there remains a great unmet medical need for the FOP community. This year marks 15 years since the discovery of the mutation in the gene ALK2/ACVR1 which causes FOP  and the palovarotene submission is the first worldwide for a potential treatment in this disease. Our teams at Ipsen are now focused on working closely with regulatory authorities to bring this potential treatment option to people living with FOP around the world. We want to thank all the people living with FOP  their families  caregivers and healthcare teams who have participated in the palovarotene clinical program.""The NDA for palovarotene is primarily based on data from the ongoing MOVE trial  the first global multi-center Phase III trial in FOP. MOVE is an open-label  single-arm trial  evaluating the efficacy and safety of a chronic/flare-up dosing regimen of palovarotene in decreasing new annualized HO volume in patients with FOP. Post hoc analyses* of the primary endpoint from the trial demonstrated a 62% reduction in mean annualized new HO volume in participants treated with palovarotene (8 821 mm3) (n=97) versus untreated participants from a natural-history study (23 318 mm3) (n=98) (nominal weighted linear mixed effects [wLME] model est. -11 611mm3  p-value = 0.0292). Overall  29.3% of participants reported at least one serious adverse event (AE)  including premature physeal closure (PPC) or epiphyseal disorder in 27.1% of the participants who were skeletally immature at baseline.4 As of the data cut-off  the most common treatment related AEs included skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (97%)  gastrointestinal disorders (77.8%)  and infections and infestations (74.7%).4""This FDA filing acceptance marks a significant milestone for Ipsen and those living with this relentless condition of FOP  which we hope will have a significant impact "" said Robert J. Pignolo  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chair  Geriatric Medicine & Gerontology  Mayo Clinic College of Medicine. ""News of this potential new treatment will be welcomed by the FOP community  and we await further updates from the FDA. With ultra-rare conditions by their nature affecting very few people around the world it is so important we continue to make progress and advance the management of diseases like FOP.""In addition to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Swissmedic MAA validations  Ipsen anticipates additional applications to other regulatory agencies in due course.Lilijesthrom  M & Bogard  B 2016  'The global known FOP population'  FOP Drug Development Forum  Boston  MA  24-25 October.

The Notes are expected to obtain the following ratings: Ba1 by Moody’s (while Rexel’s corporate rating is Ba1 with a stable outlook) and BB+ by S&P (while Rexel’s corporate rating is BB+ with a stable outlook).Rexel published yesterday its new Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework (the “Framework”) which covers debt instruments whose financial characteristics are linked with sustainability performance targets.The Framework has been established in accordance with the Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles (SLBP) administered by ICMA and reviewed by Moody’s Investors Service  which provided a Second Party Opinion (“SPO”) on September 5  2023. Both the Framework and the SPO are available on the Company’s website:https://www.rexel.com/en/finance/debt/#slbUnder this Framework  Rexel selected two indicators (the “Key Performance Indicators” or “KPIs”) and committed to achieve:A 45% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions related to the use of products sold  per euro of turnover (scope 3) by December 31  2025 from a 2016 baseline (“Sustainability Performance Target 1”); andA 38% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions related to energy consumption in its operations (scopes 1 and 2) by December 31  2025 from a 2016 baseline (“Sustainability Performance Target 2”).These objectives are in line with Rexel’s 2030 ambition to reduce the first KPI (in intensity) by 60% and the second KPI (in absolute terms) by 60% from a 2016 baseline.The interest rate of the Notes shall be increased by 25 basis points to 5.500% per annum from September 15  2026  if Rexel does not achieve these Sustainability Performance Targets.Rexel will use the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes for general corporate purposes  including the financing of the acquisition of Wasco.This issuance will allow Rexel to enhance its financial structure by extending its debt maturity profile at favorable financing conditions.Guillaume TEXIER  Chief Executive Officer  said:“B2B distributors like Rexel have a key role to play in the adoption of greener products and solutions  especially when it comes to electrification technologies. This new issuance of sustainability linked notes confirms that ESG is at the heart of our strategy  setting short term milestones on the way to achieving our 2030 goals on greenhouse gas emissions. With this issuance  all our outstanding bonds are now linked to sustainability targets.

Adjusted for Estetrol  this growth came to +35.3% (+35.0% at constant exchange rates)  mainly as a result of a strong activity at the Turku and Aramon sites  as well as higher demand for R&D services. Sales also benefited from the price increases implemented during the course of 2022 . net sales of Specialty Fine Chemicals totaled €44.7 million  a 5.4% increase compared to 2022 (a 4.7% increase at constant exchange rates). Excluding sales of June 2022 of the Canadian subsidiary which was disposed at the beginning of June 2023  the increase is 11.0% (a 10.2% increase at constant exchange rates). Demand was generally good at the start of the year  with however a slowdown in the Lubricants business  offset by the dynamism of other activities and the effects of price increases implemented during the course of 2022.PCAS Group EBITDA amounted to 4.7 million euros in the first half of 2023  compared to -0.5 million euros in the first half of 2022.Current operating income for the first half of 2023 amounted to -11.0 million euros  compared to -15.3 million euros for the first half of 2022.These results are affected by a level of activity still insufficient to cover fixed costs at several Pharmaceutical Synthesis sites.Other operating income and expenses in the first half of 2023 include:. a capital gain of 66.1 million euros from the sale of the Group's Canadian subsidiary which was completed on June 1  2023 . a partial depreciation of Mithra receivables for 15.6 million euros since the risk of a future default of Mithra cannot be totally excluded and that PCAS has had to start legal proceedings to obtain the payment of its receivables  being precised that there have been no major developments in this dispute in recent months.As a reminder  other operating income and expenses included in 2022 a goodwill impairment for an amount of 14.5 million euros.Financial expenses rose sharply as a result of the increase in PCAS Group debt before the impact of the disposal of the Canadian subsidiary  and the increase in the financial interests paid on the Seqens loan and current accounts in line with the overall trend in interest rates and the cost of Seqens Group debt.The net result for the first half of 2023 shows a profit of 25.4 million euros compared to a loss of 32.2 million euros for the first half of 2022.The Group's net debt (including Seqens net current accounts) totaled 195.1 million euros vs. 228.4 million euros as of December 31  2022. This change is mainly due to the cash generated by the sale of the Group's Canadian subsidiary  partly offset by operating losses  financial expenses and capital expenditure in the first half of 2023.OutlookIn the context of the ongoing dispute with the customer Mithra  a temporary shutdown of activity has been implemented during the second quarter of 2023 at the production site concerned  some of which workshops being dedicated to the production of Estetrol. Due to this reduction of activity  PCAS decided during today's Board of Directors to launch a project to reorganize the site in order to increase its industrial capabilities and reposition it as a more flexible contract manufacturing activity for active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates  and thus ensure its future. This reorganization and repositioning project requires the launch of an employment protection plan (Plan de sauvegarde de l’emploi) subject to an ongoing information-consultation of the competent workers’ councils. As part of this employment protection plan  PCAS would offer support and redeployment measures  including at other PCAS Group sites which are not concerned by the proposed reorganization. The resizing and repositioning of the site would have no impact on PCAS's commitments towards its customers  be it for existing or future projects which deployment will be pursued over the long run.The disposal of the Group's Canadian subsidiary at the beginning of June 2023 enabled the Group to repay part of Seqens' current account liability for an amount of 79.4 million euros  and to reinforce PCAS Group shareholders' equity (7.2 million euros as of June 30  2023 versus -17.7 million euros as of December 31  2022).As indicated in the press releases of March 30  April 24  and July 27  2023  the return to positive results  previously announced for 2023  has been postponed.PCAS Group will continue to benefit from the support of its majority shareholder Seqens (owning 76.66%) for the financing of its activities and its development.Filing of a simplified tender offer for PCAS shares and proposed share capital increasePCAS has been informed of the intention of Seqens  which holds 76.66% of the share capital and 86.66% of the theoretical voting rights of PCAS  to file a simplified public tender offer (OPAS) for the PCAS shares not yet held by Seqens. If  after the OPAS  the necessary conditions are met  this offer will be followed by a squeeze-out. Today's Board of Directors also welcomed Seqens' intention to carry out  following the OPAS  ashare capital increase in PCAS for approximately 200 million euros (including share premium) with preferential subscription rights. This transaction would enable to significantly reduce PCAS indebtedness and strengthen its shareholders' equity.A press release detailing the practical terms of these operations is also being issued today.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:Q3 2023 net sales–October 30  2023ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies.

PCAS considers that EBITDA is a measurement that is frequently indicated and widely used by investors and other interested parties as a measurement of the operational performance of PCAS and its debt service capacity insofar as it makes it possible to make a constant comparison of performance without taking into account amortization expenses  which may vary significantly depending on the accounting methods used (particularly in the event of acquisitions) or non-operational factors (such as historical cost). Consequently  this information is indicated in the present document to enable a more exhaustive and global analysis of operational performance in comparison with other companies and of PCAS’ debt service capacity. Insofar as not all companies calculate the EBITDA in the same way  the presentation of EBITDA in the present document may not be comparable to the EBITDA communicated by other companies.Reconciliation of EBITDA with Current Operating Incomeen millions d'euros 30 June 2022 30 June 2023 Current Operating Income -15.3 -11.0 + Amortization of tangible and intangible assets 10.4 12.1 + Net allocations to provisions for inventories (recorded in consumed purchases) 4.7 3.7 + Net provisions for emloyee benefits (recorded in personnel costs) - - +/- Net variation in other provisions -0.3 -0.1 EBITDA -0.5 4.7Attachment,neutral,0.07,0.91,0.02,mixed,0.17,0.23,0.6,True,English,"['PCAS', 'RESULTS', 'JUNE', 'Yesterday', '02', '10', 'several Pharmaceutical Synthesis sites', 'flexible contract manufacturing activity', 'other PCAS Group sites', 'Seqens net current accounts', 'Pharmaceutical Synthesis business', 'active pharmaceutical ingredients', 'Fine Specialty Chemicals', 'research tax credit', 'constant exchange rate', 'R&D services', 'Specialty Fine Chemicals', 'employment protection plan', 'Plan de sauvegarde', 'Current operating income', 'Other operating income', 'PCAS Canada securities', 'Seqens Group debt', 'PCAS Group debt', 'The PCAS Group', 'PCAS Group EBITDA', 'consolidated net sales', 'Aramon sites', 'net debt', 'other activities', 'Seqens loan', 'The Group', 'interest rates', 'operating losses', '4.7 EBITDA margin', 'Lubricants business', 'Net result', 'Euronext Paris', 'complex molecules', 'life sciences', 'innovative technologies', 'capital gain', 'same period', 'higher demand', 'price increases', 'Canadian subsidiary', 'first half', 'fixed costs', 'legal proceedings', 'major developments', 'recent months', 'financial interests', 'overall trend', 'capital expenditure', 'temporary shutdown', 'second quarter', 'industrial capabilities', 'ongoing information-consultation', 'competent workers', 'redeployment measures', '113.4 million euros', '3.6 million euros', '4.7 million euros', '0.5 million euros', '66.1 million euros', '15.6 million euros', '14.5 million euros', '25.4 million euros', '32.2 million euros', '195.1 million euros', '228.4 million euros', 'strong activity', 'consolidated results', 'partial depreciation', 'customer Mithra', 'Financial result', 'last year', 'future default', 'goodwill impairment', 'ongoing dispute', 'Financial expenses', 'Mithra receivables', 'repositioning project', 'production site', 'Ecully', 'September', 'OFJUNE', 'specialist', 'publication', 'today', 'Board', 'Directors', '30 June', 'millions', 'ParmaceuticalSynthesis', 'Taxes', 'CIR', '2.0% increase', '1.7% increase', 'Estetrol', 'growth', 'Turku', 'course', '5.4% increase', '4.7% increase', 'beginning', '10.2% increase', 'start', 'slowdown', 'dynamism', 'effects', 'level', 'risk', 'payment', 'reminder', 'amount', 'impact', 'disposal', 'line', 'profit', 'December', 'cash', 'Outlook', 'context', 'workshops', 'reduction', 'order', 'intermediates', 'reorganization', 'launch', 'emploi', 'councils', 'support', 'resizing', 'commitments', '2022', '1.0', '2023']",2023-09-06,2023-09-07,marketscreener.com

R&D progress was marked by the enrolment of the first patients in a 4-arm Phase 2 clinical trial of AlenuraTM  a product candidate targeting acute interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). This huge unmet medical need affects at least 6 million people in the U.S. alone.”“Another major expected milestone  only weeks away  is the potential approval for Maxigesic® IV by the US Food & Drug Administration. Such an NDA approval would be a rare occurrence for a Belgian company  and would demonstrate the strength of our R&D capabilities. Maxigesic® IV  our valueable non-opioid intravenous pain treatment for use post-operatively in hospitals has the potential to offer pain relief and reduce the use of opioids in the U.S. The U.S. is the world’s largest healthcare market  where Maxigesic® IV can contribute to improving patient’s lives.”“Financially  our rigorous focus on costs and cash management resulted in a healthy balance sheet with no financial debt and a cash position of close to €40 million. This is a significant advantage in today’s buyer’s market as we are in advanced discussions on multiple product candidates  driving innovation for better patient outcomes.”COMMERCIAL VALUE DRIVERSMaxigesic® IV is a novel  unique combination  intravenous formulation for the treatment of post-operative pain and is currently licensed to partners covering over 100 countries across the globe.The number of countries in which Maxigesic® IV has been approved has increased to more than 40. So far  launches have occurred in around 20 countries.A potential approval date for the US market was set for 17 October 2023 by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. The U.S. regulatory body confirmed that it had received a complete response in relation to the additional data on E&L (extractables and leachables) it had requested in July 2022.Maxigesic® IV aims to provide an alternative  non-opioid treatment option for post-operative pain. In the United States  chronic opioid usage in patients following surgery averages around 9%  ranging from 4% to 24% among various specialties4. Drug overdoses involving opioids resulted in over 80.000 deaths in the U.S. in 20215. Patients who experienced an opioid overdose accounted for nearly $2 billion in annual hospital costs6.On the condition of FDA approval  sales of Maxigesic® IV could start soon  with an exclusive license and distribution agreement already signed between Hyloris’ partner AFT Pharmaceuticals and Hikma Pharmaceuticals  a leading supplier of complex  injectable hospital products in the U.S.Under the terms of the development collaboration agreement between Hyloris and AFT  Hyloris is eligible to receive a share on any product-related revenues  such as license fees  royalties  milestone payments  received by AFT.Subject to market approval by the FDA and the first U.S. sales  Hyloris will be be entitled to to a milestone of approximately $2 million as revenue.Sotalol IV is a novel  patented  intravenous formulation of Sotalol for the treatment of atrial fibrillation  and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias developed for the US. Sotalol IV allows to significantly reduce the length of hospital stay and potentially the overall cost of care potentially improving patient outcomes.Hyloris is taking further steps to capture more of the growth potential in the future. In addition  Hyloris will capture a larger share of the product sales in the second half of the year as the royalty percentages are attributed to the Company on a step-up basis.COMMERCIAL ROLL-OUT PREPARATIONOut-licensing agreements were signed for Tranexamic Acid RTU in early 2023  covering an important European country and a major Southeast Asian country  with a combined population of over 60 million people. Earlier agreements have been signed in 2021 for Australia  New-Zealand and Canada. Regulatory submissions in the partnered territories are in progress  and additional out-licensing agreements are expected going forward.For product candidates which Hyloris intends to out-license  the strategic goal is to capture a substantial part of the net product margin realized by our commercial partners. The Company aims to achieve this by partnering these assets close to regulatory submission  except in countries where additional local clinical trials are required. In general  we will prioritize in-market product sales or profit-based participation over (upfront) milestone payments.Cardiovascular portfolioHyloris is actively analyzing different go-to-market strategies to bring its range of cardiovascular product candidates to the U.S healthcare market in the most efficient way.The strategic grouping of submission dates targeted by Hyloris makes 2025 a pivotal year for the Company  with several launches anticipated or in in preparation for the U.S. market by that year. These product candidates will be promoted primarily to electrophysiologists  and a subset of cardiologists in hospitals.Other value-added product candidatesWith a growing portfolio and multiple product candidates progressing towards commercialization  the Company intends to sign partnerships with leading companies in their respective territories.PIPELINE EXPANSIONThe business development team applies its knowledge of established products and real-world data in the search for solutions to underserved medical needs. Inhouse knowhow is supplemented by leveraging dialogues with healthcare professionals  patient groups  payors and partners as well as our extensive sourcing network and R&D capabilities. We aim to create value by expanding our portfolio to 30 assets before 2025  and expect to accelerate pipeline expansion in the coming months.In January 2023  Hyloris in-licensed HY-088  a product candidate targeting hypophosphatemia  a serious condition causing patients to have low level of phosphate in the blood. While mild hypophosphatemia is common and many patients are asymptomatic  severe hypophosphatemia can be life-threatening and requires medical treatment. Treatment protocols for patients deficient in phosphate are well-established and have proven useful in other situations of bone mineral imbalance  but in most countries no approved oral drugs exist.By definition  the compounded drugs currently administered to patients have not been submitted for regulatory scrutiny regarding safety  efficacy and quality. Hyloris intends to achieve market access with an approved treatment in European countries.R&D UPDATE & OUTLOOKSwift & steady progress was made in the first half of 2023 to bring 14 repurposed and reformulated product candidates closer to patients in need  as well as 3 high barrier generics.Our new and improved R&D lab is now operational at Légiapark in Liège (Belgium)  the life sciences hub where Hyloris moved its head office at the end of 2022. Expanded R&D facilities and expertise will allow the Company to perform drug formulation and analytical activities in-house for its growing pipeline  further streamlining processes and more effectively deploying internal resources.A non-exhaustive list of R&D achievements as well as selected milestones can be found below.Cardiovascular portfolioProgress has been made on all cardiovascular assets in the first half of 2023.For Dofetilide IV  the results of the pivotal clinical study  allowing regulatory submission  are expected by the summer of 2024. Additional U.S. patent applications have been submitted.Dofetilide IV aims to reduce hospitalization stays and related risks and costs. Currently  Dofetilide is only available as an oral capsule  and Dofetilide formulated as an IV could be used as an initial loading dose with subsequent oral Dofetilide dosing to reduce the time to reach steady state and hospital discharge.Metolazone IV: The process of manufacturing the final registration batches is currently in progress  with stability testing expected to be initiated as soon as October 2023. The pivotal clinical trial is currently in preparation and an additional U.S. patent application has been submitted.Metolazone tablets are used in patients with congestive heart failure  the most rapidly growing cardiovascular condition globally and the leading cause of hospitalization. The potential benefits of Metolazone IV include accelerating onset of action  allowing simultaneous administration with furosemide IV (the most frequently used intravenous hospital diuretic)  and improving drug absorption for patients with concomitant gastrointestinal oedema. The intravenous formulation will also allow drug administration in patients who are too ill to receive oral medications or who are unconscious.Aspirin IV: The transfer to a new contract manufacturing organization (CMO)  required following a strategic review  has been successfully concluded. Discussions with the FDA on the drug development program are ongoing.Aspirin IV is an intravenous formulation of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) targeting Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). When ACS occurs  fast diagnosis and treatment is crucial and potentially lifesaving.HY-074: Regulatory submission for the U.S. market is expected shortly after submissions related to the other cardiovascular assets mentioned in this list. For HY-074  Hyloris is exploring additional indications outside of the cardiovascular space.HY-074 is an IV formulation of a current standard of care treatment significantly reducing risk of death in ACS patients. HY-074 aims to offer faster onset of action  more convenient administration (more notable in patients who are nauseated or unconscious) and dosage control.Other value-added product candidatesNotable points of progress for our these product candidates are described below. Other product candidates have advanced in line with the timelines previously indicated.AlenuraTM : At the start of the summer  the first patients entered a 4-arm study which is part of an ambitious adaptive phase 2 program. The 4-arm trial is currently targeting to enroll 120 patients across multiple sites in the U.S. Each subject will receive a single blinded dose of Alenura™  placebo  lidocaine  or heparin by random assignment.AlenuraTM is being developed as a ready-to-use instillation to be administered intra-vesicularly. The product candidate targets acute pain flares in patients with IC/BPS  which affects at least 6 million people in the US alone.HY-083: A Phase 1 study was conducted demonstrating no systemic exposure could be detected following intranasal administration of the molecule using a nasal spray.HY-083 targets idiopathic rhinitis  a medical disorder characterized by a collection of nasal symptoms that resemble nasal allergies and hay fever (allergic rhinitis) but are not caused by a known cause like allergens or infectious triggers.Tranexamic Acid Oral Suspension: FDA agreement to proceed with the Phase 3 study was obtained  with the enrolment of the first patient expected in September 2023.TXA oral mouth rinse aims to reduce oral bleeding in patients undergoing dental procedures.Miconazole-Domiphen Bromide: A full read-out of the Phase 2 dose-finding study can be expected shortly  with the results guiding the company for the design of the next clinical trial.Miconazole-DB is a topical synergistic combination treatment for vulvovaginal candidiasis .HY-029: Subject to a successful outcome of the planned pivotal clinical study  regulatory filing to the U.S. FDA can be expected by mid-2024.HY-029 is a liquid formulation of an existing non-disclosed antiviral drug that is currently only available in oral solid form. Hyloris aims to improve ease of administration and dosage control  and thus potentially improving clinical outcome.The total headcount of the Company grew to slightly over 40 people  with several key recruitments occurring over the summer. To enhance the development activities  only limited additional hiring is required.With a net cash position of €39 2 million and assuming continued strategic out-licensing  commercial success for Maxigesic® IV and Sotalol IV  additional non-dilutive funding and milestone payments  the Company believes it is sufficiently capitalized to fund all expected R&D expenditures of the current product candidates (14 product candidates & 3 generics)FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSPeriod ended 30 June (in € thousands) 2023 2022 Variance Total revenue and other income 2 391 1 229 95% Revenues 1 160 1 033 12% Other income 1 231 196 528% Cost of sales (46) (61) (25%) Operating expenses (9 361) (5 986) 56% Research and development expenses (6 871) (4 712) 46% General and administration expenses (2 490) (1 274) 95% Operating result (7 100) (4 876) 46% Net financial result 466 (66) (806%) Net result (6 634) (4 942) 34% Net operating cashflow (4 129) (6 401) -35% Cash and cash equivalents 39 159 57 687 -32%Total Revenue and Other IncomeDuring the first six months of 2023  total revenue and other income increased to €2 391 thousand compared to €1 229 thousand in the first half year of 2022  which is approximately 95% higher compared to last year. The strong growth is mainly driven by increase of royalties  out-licensing income for Maxigesic IV and non-dilutive funding which we received from a US State Government and the Walloon region in Belgium.ResultsThe Company realized a net loss of €6 634 thousand for the six-month period ending 30 June 2023  compared to a net loss of €4 942 thousand for the first half year of 2022.In the first half of this year  the net loss is mainly resulting from the increase in R&D expenditure and G&A expensesR&D expenditure during the first six months of 2023 amounted to €6 871 thousand  compared to €4 712 thousand for the same period of 2022. The increase was mainly driven by intensified activities to progress product candidates through the drug development stages.General and administrative expenses increased to €2 490 thousand in the first half-year of 2023 versus €1 274 thousand in 2022  primarily driven by the enlargement of the Group’s structure  additional recruitments  increased IP costs and higher legal costs compared to last year.The net financial income in the first six months of 2023 was €466 thousand compared to a net financial loss of €66 thousand in the same period of 2022. The positive evolution of the financial result is mainly due to the impact of an active cash management strategy in a context of high short term interest rates both in EURO and USD.As a result  net losses in the first-half year of 2023 increased to €6 634 thousand versus €4 942 thousand in the same period of 2022.Balance SheetCompared to the end of 2022  the Group is free of debt. The increase in right-of-use assets and borrowings is due to the start of the lease agreement related to the new inhouse R&D lab. The Company received an advance payment related to a government grant from the Walloon region  supporting the drug development of the product candidate HY-083. €43 thousand of this advance is a financial liability and €37 thousand is part of Trade and other liabilities.Cash Position and cash flowThe Company maintains its strong cash position  with current cash and cash equivalents totaling €39 159 thousand on 30 June 2023  compared to €43 457 thousand on 31 December 2022.Net cash outflow generated from operating activities was €4 158 thousand during the first six months of 2023  compared to a net operating cash outflow of €6 401 thousand in the same period of 2022. The decrease of 35% in the operating cash outflow is the result of revenue growth and good working capital management.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION FOR THE FIRST HALF-YEAR OF 2023ASSETS(in € thousands)30-Jun-2331-Dec-22Non-current assets 12 258 11 063 Intangible assets 3 785 3 607 Property  plant and equipment 275 176 Right-of-use assets 1 667 885 Equity accounted investments 3 863 3 948 Other investment  including derivatives 1 000 1 000 Trade and other receivables 1 667 1 447 Current assets 45 015 50 801 Trade and other receivables (current) 4 541 5 127 Other investment  including derivatives (Current) 489 469 Prepayments 826 1 748 Cash and cash equivalents 39 159 43 457 TOTAL ASSETS 57 273 61 863 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES(in € thousands)30-Jun-2331-Dec-22Equity attributable to owners of the parent 48 723 55 045 Share capital 140 140 Share premium 121 513 121 513 Retained earnings (64 246) (53 476) Result of the period (6 634) (10 770) Share based payment 1 934 1 622 Cost of Capital (4 460) (4 460) Other reserves 476 476 Total equity 48 723 55 045 Non-current liabilities 1 822 1 047 Borrowings 1 478 747 Other financial liabilities 344 300 Current liabilities 6 728 5 772 Borrowings (current) 195 138 Other financial liabilities (current) 3 200 3 212 Trade and other liabilities 3 332 2 422 Total liabilities 8 550 6 819 TOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 57 273 61 863CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE FIRST HALF-YEAR OF 2023in € thousands 30-Jun-23 30-Jun-22 Revenue 1 160 1 033 Cost of sales (46) (61) Gross profit 1 114 973 Research and development expenses (6 871) (4 712) Selling  general and administrative expenses (2 490) (1 274) Share of result of equity-accounted investees (85) (58) Other operating income 1 231 196 Operating profit/(loss) (EBIT) (7 100) (4 876) Financial income 566 55 Financial expenses (100) (621) Profit/(loss) before taxes (6 634) (4 942) PROFIT/(LOSS) FOR THE PERIOD (6 634) (11.579)Detailed financial statements as well as the financial notes can be found on the Company website.AUDIT REPORTThe statutory auditor  KPMG Bedrijfsrevisoren - Réviseurs d’Entreprises  represented by Olivier Declercq  has confirmed that the audit procedures  which have been substantially completed  have not revealed any material misstatement in the accounting information included in the Company’s annual announcement.WEBCAST DETAILSThe Company will host a webcast conducted in English to present its 2023 Half-Year results and Business Outlook  followed by a live Q&A session.

SANTA MONICA  Calif. and PARIS  Sept. 6  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Music Group (UMG)  the world leader in music-based entertainment …,"Deezer to implement an artist-centric streaming model to better reward artists and music  while enhancing fan experience.SANTA MONICA  Calif. and PARIS  Sept. 6  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Music Group (UMG)  the world leader in music-based entertainment  and Deezer  one of the largest independent music streaming platforms  today announced the launch of an artist-centric streaming model  designed to better reward the artists  and the music that fans value the most. Deezer will launch the model in France  Q4 2023 with additional markets to follow.The two companies developed the new model together as part of their previously announced collaboration  using their respective deep data analysis to develop an economic model that better reflects the true value of artist-fan relationships.The collaboration to launch an artist-centric model is driven by the companies' recognition that the current music streaming model needs to be re-imagined. While streaming has been the most significant technology advancement in music in many years  a flood of uploads with no meaningful engagement  including non-artist noise content  has necessitated reassessment of the approach that platforms  labels  and artists take to foster a thriving music ecosystem.Based on Deezer's in-depth data analysis the following key enhancements are being integrated into the new artist-centric model:Focusing on artists – Deezer will attribute a double boost to what they define as ""professional artists"" – those who have a minimum of 1 000 streams per month by a minimum of 500 unique listeners – in order to more fairly reward them for the quality and engagement they bring to the platforms and fans;– Deezer will attribute a double boost to what they define as ""professional artists"" – those who have a minimum of 1 000 streams per month by a minimum of 500 unique listeners – in order to more fairly reward them for the quality and engagement they bring to the platforms and fans; Rewarding engaging content – additionally assigning a double boost for songs that fans actively engage with  reducing the economic influence of algorithmic programming;– a double boost for songs that fans actively engage with  reducing the economic influence of algorithmic programming; Demonetizing non-artist noise audio - Deezer is planning to replace non-artist noise content with its own content in the functional music space  and this won't be included in the royalty pool; and- Deezer is planning to replace non-artist noise content with its own content in the functional music space  and this won't be included in the royalty pool; and Tackling fraud – continuing to drive an updated  and stricter  proprietary fraud detection system  removing incentives for bad actors  and protecting streaming royalties for artists.Moreover  the size of the catalog available on digital platforms has exploded in recent years. Deezer's catalog grew from 90 to over 200 million pieces of content in the past two years alone. As part of the artist-centric model  Deezer intends to apply a stricter provider policy to ensure quality and a better user experience. This includes steps to limit non-artist noise content.""This is the most ambitious change to the economic model since the creation of music streaming and a change that will support the creation of high-quality content in the years to come "" said Jeronimo Folgueira  CEO of Deezer. ""At Deezer we always put music first  providing a high-quality experience for fans and championing fairness in the industry. We are now embracing a necessary change  to better reflect the value of each piece of content and eliminate all wrong incentives  to protect and support artists. There is no other industry where all content is valued the same  and it should be obvious to everyone that the sound of rain or a washing machine is not as valuable as a song from your favourite artist streamed in HiFi.""""The goal of the artist centric model is to mitigate dynamics that risk drowning music in a sea of noise and to ensure we are better supporting and rewarding artists at all stages of their careers whether they have 1000 fans or 100 thousand or 100 million. With this multi-faceted approach  music by artists that attracts and engages fans will receive weighting that better recognizes its value  and the fraud and gaming  which serves only to deprive artists their due compensation  will be aggressively addressed "" said Michael Nash  UMG's EVP and Chief Digital Officer.He continued  ""Embracing the commonly shared objectives we highlighted at the outset of this chapter in our partnership  together we'll maintain a flexible and adaptive approach. As the ever-evolving music landscape continues its rapid transformation  UMG and Deezer will rigorously address the impact of these changes as we incorporate new insights from data analysis  and fine-tune the model  as appropriate.""Olivier Nusse  CEO of Universal Music France  said  ""After extensive engagement with Deezer throughout 2023  we are very proud to be pioneers in France in the highly anticipated roll out of their version of the Artist Centric model. This comprehensive initiative will much more effectively value fan engagement and active streaming of music created by artists.""Notes to editors:Highlights from Preliminary WorkNo surprise: fans listen to music by the artists they loveDeezer's data analysis showed that fans mostly consume music from the artists they love and show little interest in music from hobbyists or functional music.Content clutter is degrading the fan experience and impeding discovery of artists.For example  97% of all uploaders on the Deezer platform generated only 2% of the total streams. Whereas only 2% of all uploaders—those artists attracting a consistent fanbase—had more than 1 000 monthly unique listeners.Reward the artists that attract and retain subscribersIn designing a fairer allocation of revenue  Deezer seeks to provide greater incentives to those artists who drive valuable engagement on the platform:A double boost will be given to all artists who have a minimum of 1 000 streams per month by a minimum of 500 unique listeners.Deezer's data shows that these artists can come from a wide spectrum—from DIY to indie to major label. By examining user behavior over the initial period immediately after they subscribe to Deezer  and then looking at that same user's behavior in the first month after joining  conclusions can be drawn regarding which artists drove them to subscribe and which artists kept them engaged on the platform.Data indicates that the artists listened to by new subscribers in their first month may drive as much as 25% to 30% of user's streams over the first two years of their activity on the service.To reward artists that fans engage with  Deezer will boost the value of their streams that drive engagement on the platform.Addressing fraud  system gaming and undue influenceBy continuing to improve safeguards to prevent fraud  system gaming and undue influence  revenue in the artist pool is likely to increase. Deezer's data showed that this could be done in a variety of ways including:Fully deploying and further developing Deezer's proprietary fraud detection system to optimize the removal of manipulated streams.Deezer's best-in-class algorithm identified approximately 7% of streams as fraudulent in 2022: this algorithm uses machine learning at the user level to identify financial fraud (fake accounts  payment fraud)  and potential system-gaming behaviors.Removing ""noise"" content from royalty poolStreams tagged as ""noise"" represented approximately 2% of streams on the platform.Deezer's intention is to replace non-artist noise content on the platform with its own content in the functional music space  which will not be accounted for in the royalty pool.Integrating additional artist-centric components to benefit both artists and fansThe partnership construct will enable data-based adjustments to optimize model performance and establish the foundation for introduction of future elements such as ARPU enhancements  including super fan monetization.Other elements of the partnershipUniversal will collaborate with Deezer on the development of Deezer's fraud detection tools and AI detection  and intends to experiment with new technology and label services from Deezer.About DeezerDeezer is one of the largest independent music streaming platforms in the world  with more than 200 million pieces of content available in 180 countries  providing access to lossless HiFi audio  innovative recommendation technology and industry defining features.

With this multi-faceted approach  music by artists that attracts and engages fans will receive weighting that better recognizes its value  and the fraud and gaming  which serves only to deprive artists their due compensation  will be aggressively addressed "" said Michael Nash  UMG's EVP and Chief Digital Officer.He continued  ""Embracing the commonly shared objectives we highlighted at the outset of this chapter in our partnership  together we'll maintain a flexible and adaptive approach. As the ever-evolving music landscape continues its rapid transformation  UMG and Deezer will rigorously address the impact of these changes as we incorporate new insights from data analysis  and fine-tune the model  as appropriate.""Olivier Nusse  CEO of Universal Music France  said  ""After extensive engagement with Deezer throughout 2023  we are very proud to be pioneers in France in the highly anticipated roll out of their version of the Artist Centric model. This comprehensive initiative will much more effectively value fan engagement and active streaming of music created by artists.""Notes to editors:Highlights from Preliminary WorkNo surprise: fans listen to music by the artists they loveDeezer's data analysis showed that fans mostly consume music from the artists they love and show little interest in music from hobbyists or functional music.Content clutter is degrading the fan experience and impeding discovery of artists.For example  97% of all uploaders on the Deezer platform generated only 2% of the total streams. Whereas only 2% of all uploaders—those artists attracting a consistent fanbase—had more than 1 000 monthly unique listeners.Reward the artists that attract and retain subscribersIn designing a fairer allocation of revenue  Deezer seeks to provide greater incentives to those artists who drive valuable engagement on the platform:A double boost will be given to all artists who have a minimum of 1 000 streams per month by a minimum of 500 unique listeners.Deezer's data shows that these artists can come from a wide spectrum—from DIY to indie to major label. By examining user behavior over the initial period immediately after they subscribe to Deezer  and then looking at that same user's behavior in the first month after joining  conclusions can be drawn regarding which artists drove them to subscribe and which artists kept them engaged on the platform.Data indicates that the artists listened to by new subscribers in their first month may drive as much as 25% to 30% of user's streams over the first two years of their activity on the service.To reward artists that fans engage with  Deezer will boost the value of their streams that drive engagement on the platform.Addressing fraud  system gaming and undue influenceBy continuing to improve safeguards to prevent fraud   system gaming and undue influence  revenue in the artist pool is likely to increase. Deezer's data showed that this could be done in a variety of ways including:  system gaming and undue influence  revenue in the artist pool is likely to increase. Deezer's data showed that this could be done in a variety of ways including: Fully deploying and further developing Deezer's proprietary fraud detection system to optimize the removal of manipulated streams.detection system to optimize the removal of manipulated streams.Deezer's best-in-class algorithm identified approximately 7% of streams as fraudulent in 2022: this algorithm uses machine learning at the user level to identify financial fraud (fake accounts  payment fraud )  and potential system-gaming behaviors.Removing ""noise"" content from royalty poolStreams tagged as ""noise"" represented approximately 2% of streams on the platform.Deezer's intention is to replace non-artist noise content on the platform with its own content in the functional music space  which will not be accounted for in the royalty pool.Integrating additional artist-centric components to benefit both artists and fansThe partnership construct will enable data-based adjustments to optimize model performance and establish the foundation for introduction of future elements such as ARPU enhancements  including super fan monetization.Other elements of the partnershipUniversal will collaborate with Deezer on the development of Deezer's fraud detection tools and AI detection  and intends to experiment with new technology and label services from Deezer.About DeezerDeezer is one of the largest independent music streaming platforms in the world  with more than 200 million pieces of content available in 180 countries  providing access to lossless HiFi audio  innovative recommendation technology and industry defining features.

Now  the company has taken this a step further by fully embedding the technology into its devices  achieving another industry-first in the process.Getac is working closely with Signify's Trulifi technology on the project  with the aim of bringing LiFi technology to its customers. Further announcements detailing the devices themselves and their commercial availability will be made in the future.Backed by the Light Communication AllianceBoth Signify and Getac are part of the Light Communication Alliance (LCA)  a community of industry leaders  researchers  and innovators who believe in the power of Optical Wireless Communication to transform the way organisations connect and communicate.The LCA understands that advancing light communication requires a collaborative ecosystem approach  with members working closely together to research  develop and deploy viable LiFi technology.Signify Trulifi and rugged technology: The future of secure  reliable communicationLiFi (Light Fidelity) technology uses light to transmit data rather than radio frequency  which is the case with traditional technologies such as WiFi  LTE  4G  5G etc. This innovative approach has multiple benefits over RF-based technologies  including extremely low latency  improved privacy and security  and superior connection quality  especially in RF-denied environments.Combining these benefits with the reliability of Getac's rugged solutions unlocks a wide range of powerful new applications across sectors where professionals work in challenging conditions every day. For example  LiFi's minimal cabling requirements enables defence professionals to install highly secure field communications networks in a matter of minutes. LiFi can be especially beneficial in RF-constrained or RF-denied environments  aiding digital transformation in industries such as industrial manufacturing  where there can be concerns over RF-based equipment interfering with safety-critical operations.""Getac has long recognised the potential of LiFi technology to fundamentally change the way many organisations work and communicate"" says Amanda Ward  EMEA Senior Director  Technology & Services at Getac. ""Through our partnership with Signify  we're fully committed to designing  manufacturing and embedding innovative rugged LiFi solutions that will enable our customers to turn this potential into a reality.""""Some of LiFi's most game-changing applications and use cases are in sectors where highly challenging work conditions make rugged solutions an essential part of the technology equation "" says Mark Gunther  Global Segment Leader LiFi Systems at Signify.
