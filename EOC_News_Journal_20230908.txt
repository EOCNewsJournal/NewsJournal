""Such discussions happened earlier too - there were some concerns over a parallel yield curve developing  although the market has developed more now and is much deeper.""In most cases  bonds listed on an international index are settled on global platforms such as those offered by the Belgium-based Euroclear.Although Euroclear settlements are not mandatory for inclusion of Indian sovereign debt on global bond indices such as those offered by JP Morgan and Bloomberg Barclays  the presence of a settlement mechanism on a global platform is seen to help push the cause for inclusion.A Reuters report  citing Bank of America Securities  said last month that index inclusion could lead to inflows of $6 to $12 billion over a period of time into India  thereby helping lower yields on sovereign debt. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.To be sure  New Delhi is unlikely to provide any tax breaks for overseas investors that may use Euroclear for buying and selling in Indian sovereign bonds.""However  as things stand  it is unlikely that the government will give in to any of the long-standing requests for tax relief for foreign investors "" the source said.An email sent to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) remained unanswered until the publication of this report.Indian authorities have been in talks with the managers of bond indices such as the JP Morgan Emerging Market Index and the Bloomberg Barclays index over the past five years regarding the inclusion of domestic sovereign debt on these gauges.Late September of last year  the FTSE said that India remains a potential candidate for index inclusion. Early October last year  JP Morgan said that India's bonds continue to stay on the watchlist for entry.Index reviews are typically concluded by the end of September.Over the past couple of years  foreign investors have often pushed for settlement of Indian bonds on overseas platforms  citing operational ease.However  settlement on Euroclear - while preferred by foreign investors - is not strictly an essential requirement for inclusion in a global bond index  with China continuing to settle bonds locally despite having its debt listed overseas.""Investors and index providers have met multiple times over the past few months. There is eagerness from their side as it is important to bring in a large  liquid market in the absence of Russia "" said another banking industry source.""On the tax front  it seems a foregone conclusion that the Indian government will not provide special treatment for foreign investors.""A key demand that was made by overseas investors was for easier treatment of capital gains tax for foreign settlement of bonds.""Foreign banks in India have been working on the operational side of things  keeping in mind the settlement requirements of international investors.

Photo / APThere’s a war going on between fixed interest and equities  and fixed interest is winning.The S&P/NZX-50 index dropped by 4.2 per cent in August  its worst month in just under a year.The benchmark index is now down by about 16 per cent from its record high of 13 558.19  set on January 8  2021.In the meantime  interest rates are elevated  and look set to stay high for a while yet if central banks here and around the world have anything to do with it.Craigs Investment Partners investment director Mark Lister said high interest rates  and the proximity of the October 14 general election  were weighing on sharemarket sentiment.“August is typically a difficult month for markets everywhere ” Lister said  noting the US market broke its six-month winning streak last month.“This month is typically the worst month of the year for international markets  so don’t be surprised if the volatility continues ” he said.Interest rates are now at their highest in 15 or so years.“Investors  particularly those who are looking for income  have so many more options than they used to have ” Lister said.“If you think back two  three or even five years  if you were looking for income  you really did not have many choices other than to put your money into shares or property ” he said.Salt Funds managing director Matt Goodson said the “battle” between the asset classes was anything but compelling.At this point  the NZ Government Bond Index has delivered a total return of -0.25 per cent year-to-date  while the S&P/NZX50 Gross Index has returned -0.30 per cent.“Cash and term deposits have been the winner in an environment where all domestic asset classes have struggled ” he said.“The most interesting thing is that real bond yields have now returned to reasonably positive levels for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis.“Ten-year inflation-indexed yields are now a little bit more than 2 per cent  so you’re actually getting paid in real terms to hold bonds for the first time in many years ” Goodson said.The Reserve Bank’s official cash rate sits at 5.5 per cent  where the bank has forecast it to remain until early 2025.Some economic forecasters expect a cut by late next year  but Craigs Investment’s Lister said he wouldn’t rule out even earlier cuts  particularly given China’s downturn and its depressing impact on the New Zealand dairy sector.“You might see it happen sooner than people think if the Chinese economy slows by more than people expect.“For investors  that could be quite a positive because as soon as people see these interest rates start to come down  I think you might see an investment behaviour change  which would be supportive for our sharemarket.”Harbour Asset Management fixed income and currency strategist Hamish Pepper said bonds are typically viewed as “rainy day” investments.“Being conscious of the uncertain outlook - an outlook where the global economy is slowing - I think what we are expecting is that bonds will have that role to play ” he said.Harbour Asset  in a market commentary  said New Zealand and Australian sharemarket returns over the month were dominated by profit results  earnings downgrades and a sharp move up in long-term US and New Zealand Government bond yields  which increased the return hurdle required by investors and dragged on returns for defensive shares - including electricity utilities Mercury and Meridian.August winnersOf the top 50 stocks  eight finished the month with positive or flat returns  while 42 saw negative returns  brokers Forsyth Barr said.Top performers for the month included THL  up 9.3 per cent  SkyCity up 4.9 per cent and Fonterra Shareholders Fund up 4.8 per cent.Pacific Edge (down 21.6 per cent)  Synlait Milk (19.8 per cent) and Investore Property (16.1 per cent) performed the worst.Season wash-upForsyth Barr said the June period-end earnings season has seen the highest proportion of earnings downgrades for at least a decade.The downgrades have been broad-based  but primarily driven by opex and interest expense rather than revenues  it said.“We have been in a downgrade cycle for some time  but what stands out this earnings season is that it has spread from economically sensitive stocks  such as retail and industrials  through to infrastructure ” Forsyth Barr said.Of the 10 companies with the largest downgrades  four were infrastructure companies.AIA exitAuckland Airport (AIA) announced chief infrastructure officer Andre Lovatt has resigned after five years with the organisation to take up a new role at KiwiRail in December. A process is under way to find a replacement.AIA chief executive Carrie Hurihanganui said Lovatt’s strong leadership skills and extensive knowledge in engineering have been invaluable  particularly as Auckland Airport has rebuilt its infrastructure team and ramped up the infrastructure development programme post-pandemic.One fund manager said the timing was “interesting” given AIA is about to embark on the biggest phase of infrastructure investment since the airport was built.Three major projects are now progressing across transport  terminals and AIA’s airfield.Super buyThe New Zealand Super Fund has acquired a 4.99 per cent shareholding in Brussels-based Euroclear  a provider of critical financial markets infrastructure.“With approximately €36 trillion ($65.7t) of assets under custody and over €1 quadrillion per annum worth of securities transactions  Euroclear provides post-trade services including transaction settlement  asset servicing and collateral management ” the fund said.The Euroclear group includes Euroclear Bank  the International Central Securities Depositories  and operates the national Central Securities Depositories in Belgium  Finland  France  Ireland  the Netherlands  Sweden and the United Kingdom.Euroclear Bank is the premier provider of settlement and related securities services for cross-border transactions involving domestic and international bonds  equities  derivatives and investment funds  the fund said.NZ Super Fund head of direct Investments Will Goodwin said the transaction  which makes the NZ Super Fund Euroclear’s fifth-largest shareholder  provided a rare opportunity for the NZ Super Fund to increase its exposure to the global financial services sector.Forsyth Barr on RWCBrokers Forsyth Barr - which has Dunedin’s covered stadium named after it - has branched out from the world of stock picking and into sports.In a glossy guide for the upcoming Rugby World Cup  the broker has applied its analytical skills.Managing director Neil Paviour-Smith  writing in the “Rugby and Markets” foreword  said developing the publication allowed the broker’s team of research analysts to apply their skills in a novel way.“Ahead of the 2011 Rugby World Cup  the team has developed the Forsyth Barr Tournament Prediction Model and will proudly tell you that it has a 67 per cent success rate since its inception ” Paviour-Smith said.Jamie Gray is an Auckland-based journalist  covering the financial markets and the primary sector.

India  on the other hand  has made little progress in resolving operational issues. “There are a few criteria ...,Bond Bulls in Korea and India Need to be Patient on Index Boost(Bloomberg) -- Money managers say South Korea will have to wait until next year to be added to FTSE Russell’s global bond index while it may take even longer for India’s inclusion into its emerging-market benchmark.Among 10 global investors surveyed by Bloomberg  only two expected Korea’s addition into the World Government Bond Index to take place as early as in the September review. The rest including BNP Paribas Asset Management and abrdn plc said it will likely happen next year as the country needs to make more progress in improving market accessibility.A potential inclusion has been a keenly awaited event ever since FTSE Russell added Korea to the watch list in 2022. HSBC Global Research says it may attract foreign inflows of as much as $70 billion. The government has taken steps to facilitate foreigners’ access  most recently agreeing to open an omnibus account with Euroclear Bank SA. India  on the other hand  has made little progress in resolving operational issues.“There are a few criteria FTSE requires South Korea to fulfill before accepting it into the World Global Bond Index ” said Jean-Charles Sambor  head of emerging markets fixed income at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “The more possible time line is March 2024.”Foreigners purchased a net $49 billion of Korean bonds this year  making it the most popular debt market in Asia. They bought $3.4 billion of Indian notes.While the actual opening of the omnibus account is scheduled in the first half of next year  other changes may take longer. The government plans to let some offshore firms participate directly in the local interbank currency market as soon as the second half of 2024  a change essential to get inclusion in key indexes.Korea’s reforms “appear to be steps in the right direction in making it simpler for foreign investors to buy local bonds ” said Sanjay Shah  investment director of Asian fixed income at HSBC Asset Management in Singapore. “We remain positive on Korean duration ” as expectations that the Bank of Korea’s rate has peaked add to the securities attraction  he said.In March  FTSE Russell held off on adding both Korea and India to its key bond indexes and kept them on the watch list. The next review is scheduled Sept. 28.For India  a majority of the investors surveyed don’t expect the South Asian country to be added to FTSE Russell’s emerging market bond index any time soon as many issues raised in the March review — improvement in market structure  operational issues regarding the settlement cycle  trade matching and tax clearance — remain unresolved.The Reserve Bank of India has been making informal inquiries with some bond market participants about the impact of allowing settlement of domestic sovereign debt on the Euroclear platform  the Economic Times reported this week. Still  the government is unlikely to give any tax breaks for overseas investors that may use Euroclear for trading Indian sovereign bonds  the report said.India’s push to have its bonds listed on global indexes has stalled in recent years as the nation backed away from any changes to tax policies that will make it easier for the securities to be included in global indexes.In the absence of further changes  it would be difficult to see India’s inclusion in the near future  said Prashant Singh  senior portfolio manager for emerging-markets debt at Neuberger Berman in Singapore. “A lot of issues that have been outstanding for a while still exist and haven’t been fully resolved.”Bloomberg LP is the parent company of Bloomberg Index Services Ltd  which administers indexes that compete with those from other service providers.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.19,0.73,0.08,mixed,0.1,0.39,0.5,True,English,"['Bond Bulls', 'Index Boost', 'Korea', 'India', 'Patient', 'BNP Paribas Asset Management', 'emerging markets fixed income', 'local interbank currency market', 'Bloomberg Index Services Ltd', 'emerging market bond index', 'World Global Bond Index', 'World Government Bond Index', 'HSBC Asset Management', 'Asian fixed income', 'bond market participants', 'possible time line', 'senior portfolio manager', 'HSBC Global Research', 'The Reserve Bank', 'domestic sovereign debt', 'other service providers', 'Bloomberg L.P.', 'key bond indexes', 'Indian sovereign bonds', 'Euroclear Bank SA', 'South Asian country', 'Index Boost', 'Bond Bulls', 'debt market', 'local bonds', 'market accessibility', 'market structure', 'global indexes', 'Indian notes', 'key indexes', '10 global investors', 'other hand', 'emerging-markets debt', 'Bloomberg LP', 'Money managers', 'next year', 'emerging-market benchmark', 'September review', 'abrdn plc', 'watch list', 'foreign inflows', 'omnibus account', 'Jean-Charles Sambor', 'Korean bonds', 'actual opening', 'first half', 'offshore firms', 'second half', 'right direction', 'Sanjay Shah', 'investment director', 'Korean duration', 'next review', 'trade matching', 'tax clearance', 'informal inquiries', 'Euroclear platform', 'Economic Times', 'tax breaks', 'recent years', 'tax policies', 'near future', 'Prashant Singh', 'Neuberger Berman', 'parent company', 'FTSE Russell', 'operational issues', 'foreign investors', 'many issues', 'overseas investors', 'other changes', 'South Korea', 'foreigners’ access', 'little progress', 'securities attraction', 'settlement cycle', 'March review', 'potential inclusion', 'Patient', 'addition', 'place', 'rest', 'event', 'steps', 'criteria', 'head', 'net', 'reforms', 'Singapore', 'expectations', 'rate', 'majority', 'improvement', 'impact', 'trading', 'report', 'push', 'nation', 'absence', 'lot']",2023-09-08,2023-09-08,bnnbloomberg.ca

WestRock shareholders could receive shares of the combined entity should a merger proceed  the companies said.The deal would create a packaging behemoth that provides everything from corrugated storage boxes to beer carriers and e-commerce shipping materials.Forest industry companies have increasingly been turning to packaging from paper to benefit from the growth in online shopping while demand for paper has been in constant decline since the early 2000s.Following a couple years of growth in demand and profits  the highly cyclical industry is now in the throes of a downturn  as consumers paring back spending translates into lower demand for packaging. The industry has also been consolidating for years  as market players seek scale to cut costs and better serve large customers.Smurfit Kappa declined as much as 3.8% in early Dublin trading and was 1.8% lower at 9:10 a.m.Read more: Smurfit Is Set to Join Exodus of Big Names From UK Stock MarketFollowing the completion of the potential deal  ordinary shares of Smurfit WestRock would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and on the standard listing segment of the London Stock Exchange  scrapping Smurfit Kappa’s premium listing there. Smurfit Kappa would also delist from Euronext Dublin.Smurfit WestRock would be domiciled in Dublin  according to the statement  with a hub for Americas operations in Atlanta  Georgia.Story continuesSmurfit Kappa has long been seen as a potential player in the consolidation of the paper and packaging industry. In 2018  the firm rejected a takeover attempt by US rival International Paper Co. The Memphis  Tennessee-based company this week announced plans to look for a new chief executive officer.Due diligence is ongoing and terms and conditions will be set out in a subsequent announcement  the companies said  after The Wall Street Journal reported on the merger talks. There’s still no certainty a transaction will happen  they added.Shares of WestRock have fallen about 9% this year  giving the firm a market value at about $8 billion. Smurfit Kappa has risen around 6.6%  valuing it at approximately $10.3 billion.Sustainability demands have also put pressure on companies to come up with lighter packaging and recycled products. As an underlying trend  paper-based packaging benefits from an increasing consumer preference for alternatives to plastic.--With assistance from Kiel Porter.(Adds context on packaging industry from third paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2023 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,negative,0.01,0.35,0.63,True,English,"['$20 Billion Paper Firm', 'Merger Talks', 'WestRock', 'Smurfit', 'US rival International Paper Co', 'new chief executive officer', 'The Wall Street Journal', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Smurfit Kappa Group Plc', 'London Stock Exchange', 'corrugated storage boxes', 'e-commerce shipping materials', 'increasing consumer preference', 'UK Stock Market', 'standard listing segment', 'paper-based packaging benefits', 'Bloomberg L.P.', 'early Dublin trading', 'Forest industry companies', 'WestRock Co.', 'The Memphis', 'early 2000s', 'premium listing', 'market value', 'market players', 'industry giant', 'possible combination', 'combined entity', 'merger proceed', 'beer carriers', 'online shopping', 'constant decline', 'cyclical industry', 'large customers', 'Big Names', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Americas operations', 'potential player', 'takeover attempt', 'Tennessee-based company', 'Due diligence', 'subsequent announcement', 'Sustainability demands', 'recycled products', 'Kiel Porter', 'third paragraph', 'Smurfit WestRock', 'packaging behemoth', 'packaging industry', 'lighter packaging', 'WestRock shareholders', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'key terms', 'couple years', 'potential deal', 'merger talks', 'Packaging companies', 'lower demand', 'ordinary shares', 'statement', 'everything', 'growth', 'profits', 'downturn', 'consumers', 'spending', 'scale', 'costs', '9:10 a', 'Exodus', 'completion', 'hub', 'Atlanta', 'Georgia', 'Story', 'consolidation', 'firm', 'plans', 'conditions', 'certainty', 'transaction', 'pressure', 'alternatives', 'plastic', 'assistance', 'context']",2023-09-07,2023-09-08,finance.yahoo.com

(NYSE: PFE) announced today positive pediatric and adolescent immunogenicity and safety data for their Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15…,"Strong immune response shown in both children and adolescents one month after booster dose (month 19) in VLA15-221 studyPreviously observed high anamnestic antibody response in adults confirmedVLA15 well-tolerated in all age groups following booster doseSaint-Herblain (France) & New York  September 7  2023 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today positive pediatric and adolescent immunogenicity and safety data for their Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15  when given as a booster. These results from the VLA15-221 Phase 2 study showed a strong anamnestic antibody response for all serotypes in pediatric (5 to 11 years of age) and adolescent participants (12 to 17 years of age)  as well as in adults (18 to 65 years of age)  one month after administration of a booster dose (month 19).Depending on the primary schedule they received (month 0-2-6 or month 0-6)  participants seroconverted after the booster dose  yielding seroconversion1 rates (SCRs) of 95.3% and 94.6% for all outer surface protein A (OspA) serotypes in all age groups  respectively. Additionally  OspA antibody titers were significantly higher one month after the booster dose compared to one month after the primary schedule with 3.3- to 3.7-fold increases (Geometric Mean Fold Rises) in adults  2.0- to 2.7- fold increases in adolescents and 2.3- to 2.5-fold increases in children for all serotypes.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are pleased with these data which validate the use of a booster dose in all age groups. Lyme disease continues to spread  representing an important unmet medical need that impacts the lives of many people in the Northern Hemisphere. With each new set of positive data  we come one step closer to potentially bringing this vaccine to both adults and children living in areas where Lyme disease is endemic.”The Phase 2 booster results emphasize the vaccine candidate’s potential to provide immunity against Lyme disease in pediatric and adolescent populations. Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) one month following the booster dose were similarly high for children and adolescents.The safety and tolerability profile of VLA15 after a booster dose was consistent with previous studies as the vaccine candidate was well-tolerated in all age groups regardless of the primary vaccination schedule. No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no safety concerns were observed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).“Protection against Lyme disease is important for anyone who lives or spends time outdoors in areas where Lyme disease is endemic. This data from the VLA15-221 study is vital to improve our understanding of how vaccination may help to protect both adults and children from this potentially devastating disease ” said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head Vaccine Research and Development at Pfizer. “We are encouraged by the positive Phase 2 results for VLA15  and  in partnership with Valneva  look forward to continuing to study the vaccine candidate in ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.”These results follow six-month antibody persistence data in children and adults reported for the VLA15-221 study in December 20221 and positive immunogenicity and safety data reported in April 20222.In August 2022  Pfizer and Valneva initiated the currently ongoing Phase 3 clinical study  Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524)  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in participants five years of age and older in highly endemic regions in the United States (U.S.) and Europe3. A second Phase 3 study (VLA15-1012)  aiming to provide further evidence on the safety profile of VLA15 in the pediatric population  is also ongoing.Pfizer aims to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2026  subject to positive Phase 3 data.About VLA15There are currently no approved human vaccines for Lyme disease  and VLA15 is the most advanced Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development  with a Phase 3 study in progress. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immune response and satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.4 5 The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA in July 2017.6About Clinical Study VLA15-221VLA15-221 is a randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old).585 healthy participants received VLA15 in two immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=190] or month 0-6 [N=187]) or three doses of placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=208]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 µg  which was selected based on data generated in the two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout was performed one month after the primary vaccination series. All eligible subjects received a booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 18 (booster phase) and will be followed for three additional years to monitor antibody persistence. In addition  all eligible subjects will be asked to receive an additional booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 30  in order to generate additional data and assess the need for periodic booster doses.VLA15 is tested as an alum-adjuvanted formulation and administered intramuscularly. The study is being conducted at U.S. sites located in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and has enrolled both volunteers with a prior infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi-naïve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected Ixodes ticks.7 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.8 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the U.S. and 129 000 people in Europe.9 10 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the skin  joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.9 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.11About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

SBTi defines and promotes best practice in science-based target setting  provides resources and guidance to limit barriers to adopting these practices  and independently assesses and approves organizations' targets.This publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: mp2eaJdqkmvHyWyaY5hnmJSZbZiUkpPIaJWXyWebapvGmnJoyGqXnMWaZnFim2tv- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Inside Information:- other releases Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/81669-herige_certification_sbti_vdef_vuk.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2023 ActusNews",neutral,0.13,0.86,0.02,positive,0.87,0.12,0.01,True,English,"['Science Based Targets initiative', 'climate targets', 'Herige', 'SBTi', '12:35', 'The Science Based Targets initiative', 'United Nations Global Compact', 'EURONEXT GROWTH ALL SHARE', 'ambitious emissions reductions targets', 'GHG) emissions reduction targets', 'latest climate science', 'short-term greenhouse gas', 'first mid-tier company', 'Construction Materials” category', 'Benoît Hennaut', 'Djaméla Bouabdallah', 'Vendée region', 'EURONEXT FAMILY BUSINESS', 'active network active', 'Building Materials Trading', 'leading conservation organizations', 'science-based target setting', 'absolute GHG emissions', 'original press release', 'World Wide Fund', 'renewable natural resources', 'World Resources Institute', 'Actusnews SECURITY MASTER', 'environmental transition issues', 'SECURITY MASTER Key', ""organizations' targets"", 'ambitious approach', 'global warming', 'global body', 'science-based methodologies', 'building industry', 'indirect emissions', 'natural environment', 'environmental progress', 'Press Relations', 'environmental footprint', '1.5°C standard', 'Paris Agreement', 'development strategy', 'energy consumption', 'value chain', 'services suppliers', 'carbon trajectory', 'climate change', 'low-carbon economy', 'Executive Board', 'practical, tailored', 'carbon footprint', 'Marie-Christine Korniloff', 'Corporate Engagement', 'Emilie Saint-Pierre', 'three sectors', 'Concrete Industry', 'Industrial Joinery', 'strong presence', 'Caroline Lutinier', 'Corinne Puissant', 'Investor Relations', 'Anne-Catherine Bonjour', '6 million members', 'biological diversity', 'wasteful consumption', 'concrete actions', 'sustainable lifestyles', 'best practice', 'other releases', 'Western France', 'key role', 'Reuters ALHRG', 'living planet', 'future generations', 'Regulated information', 'SBTi standard', 'international SBTi', 'ACTUS finance', 'young people', 'Group Communication', 'WWF France', 'HERIGE Group', 'Cabinet Verley', '3,000 people', 'approval', 'priority', 'CSR', 'part', 'Scopes', 'measures', 'goods', 'conjunction', 'Nature', 'process', 'commitment', 'transformation', 'Chairman', 'Businesses', 'compliance', 'companies', 'Director', 'Images', 'request', 'communications', 'website', 'PEA/PME', 'Indices', '©PEA-PME', 'ISIN', 'Ticker', 'Head', 'Tel.', 'mail', 'groupe', 'cpuissant', 'acbonjour', '100 countries', 'support', 'degradation', 'harmony', 'pollution', 'volunteers', '220,000 donors', 'species', 'decision-makers', 'place', 'manner', 'individual', 'philosophy', 'dialogue', 'efforts', 'zero', 'result', 'collaboration', 'CDP', 'WRI', 'guidance', 'barriers', 'practices', 'publication', 'Full', 'PDF']",2023-09-07,2023-09-08,marketscreener.com

The guide focuses on the most significant requirements the new law will impose on US businesses subject to the new reporting obligations.Approved in September 2022 by the US Congress as part of the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA)  the new law is administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and will require companies to collect  document and monitor previously unreported data on a company’s primary owners via completion of a Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) report. FinCEN estimates that the rule will impact approximately 32.6 million reporting companies in 2024 alone  and 5.5 million new reporting companies that are formed and registered every year going forward.Every person who owns or manages a limited liability company (LLC) needs to be aware of the new reporting requirement  first to determine if their company is subject to BOI reporting and  if so  to begin preparing to comply.“Beneficial Ownership represents the most sweeping regulatory change to impact small businesses in this country since the Depression era of the 1930s ” notes George May  Vice President and Segment Leader  Small Business  for CT Corp  a Wolters Kluwer business. “And the stakes are high  given the consequences of non-compliance  including hefty fines and  potentially  incarceration. It is critical that companies understand their reporting obligations under the new rule and begin preparing for compliance.”The “Countdown to Compliance” guide addresses frequently asked questions  from definitions on the eligibility of “beneficial owners” and “reporting companies” to details on the filing process  costs  and other considerations. Special sections pertaining to law firms and accounting firms provide insights on CTA compliance  whether a firm is subject to the rule itself or in the capacity of guiding clients.For more information on navigating the new beneficial ownership rule  visit the CTA Resources page.For more than 130 years  Wolters Kluwer CT Corporation has been the leading provider of registered agent services  incorporation services  and legal entity compliance.

CNES has selected Atos to lead one of the five French and European consortia contributing to its various civil  scientific and military programs under the Ingénierie Bord et Informatique Spatiale (IBIS) framework agreement.Atos has joined forces with Ausy  Clemessy (Eiffage Group)  Epsyl (Alcen Group)  Geo4i  OHB  Serco and Terma to form a consortium that meets CNES's objective to strengthen the role of digital technology in its innovation strategy while also covering all of its technical  functional and business areas. The members of the consortium  led by Atos  are experts in the space industry and are involved in major European programs in the sector.Atos's expertise managing major projects  its ability to integrate technologies and its 20 years of collaboration with CNES  combined with the business know-how of its partners  will be applied to the industrial design and IT operation of the ground and onboard segments  as well as the communication resources between these two segments.The groundsegment manages the satellite  the orbit modifications and receives the observation data. The Atos-led consortium will provide expertise in the design  maintenance and operation of these systems. The onboardsegment provides the satellite's onboard perimeter with instruments that transmit data to the ground. The consortium will be involved in the engineering and testing of both the onboard and ground systems.Space expertise is provided from Toulouse  the European Space capital  by teams located at the Atos Technology Services center of excellence and its partners.To leverage the complementary capabilities of the consortium  Atos has developed a collaborative innovation approach supported by its network of R&D centers and Inno'Labs in France  as well as by the innovation centers of its partners. The other members of the consortium will be able to rely on Atos's expertise to integrate digital technologies to optimize their business solutions.For example  one of the innovation programs that the group is tasked with is to improve the data processing and transmission capacity of satellites. As the high-performance onboard satellite instrumentation generates a growing volume of data  the transmission of this data to the ground is becoming increasingly complex. The mission of Atos  an expert in artificial intelligence (AI)  and its partners is to equip satellites with on-board AI technology to perform data processing farther upstream. This reduces the amount of data to be transmitted and maximizes the use of the limited bandwidth.""New technologies such as artificial intelligence and automation are leading to innovations that are revolutionizing the industrial and digital models of the space industry. Together with Atos and its partners  CNES is taking full advantage of these advances  which are helping our ecosystem evolve  strengthening our sovereignty and competitiveness  and fostering the emergence of new services that will enable the space industry to assert France's and Europe's leadership "" said François Sillion Chief Technology and Digital Officer at CNES.""Atos and its partners are very proud to contribute to the strategic missions of CNES in the civil and military domains. CNES can count on a group of European leaders whose diversity of expertise will provide it with a strong support to meet the needs of transformation and evolution of the space sector. For example  the introduction of AI as a digital transformation vector is a major challenge  and Atos's expertise in this field will enable CNES to open up a range of possibilities  with the challenge of preserving national and European sovereignty in the sensitive areas of application of this technology "" said Stéphane Richard  Director of Technology Services  Atos.CNES is a public institution responsible for shaping and implementing France’s space policy within Europe. The Agency designs satellites  placing them into orbit as well as inventing tomorrow’s space systems  as well as fostering the deployment of new and practical everyday services.Founded in 1961  CNES spearheads large-scale space projects  launchers and satellites  acting as the go-to partner for the industry to propel innovation. Supported by a passionate team of 2 400 employees  CNES is helping develop innovative applications guided by four strategic ambitions: national sovereignty  science  economic performance and climate.CNES is leading the way in France’s technological innovation  economic development and industrial policy. Finally  this agency strives to forge scientific partnerships  frequently collaborating at an international level. Thanks to CNES  France is one of the key contributors to the European Space Agency (ESA).***About AtosAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with 107 000 employees and annual revenue of c. € 11 billion.

CNES has selected Atos to lead one of the five French and European consortia contributing to its various civil  scientific and military programs under the Ingénierie Bord et Informatique Spatiale (IBIS) framework agreement.Atos has joined forces with Ausy  Clemessy (Eiffage Group)  Epsyl (Alcen Group)  Geo4i  OHB  Serco and Terma to form a consortium that meets CNES's objective to strengthen the role of digital technology in its innovation strategy while also covering all of its technical  functional and business areas. The members of the consortium  led by Atos  are experts in the space industry and are involved in major European programs in the sector.Atos's expertise managing major projects  its ability to integrate technologies and its 20 years of collaboration with CNES  combined with the business know-how of its partners  will be applied to the industrial design and IT operation of the ground and onboard segments  as well as the communication resources between these two segments.The ground segment manages the satellite  the orbit modifications and receives the observation data. The Atos-led consortium will provide expertise in the design  maintenance and operation of these systems. The onboard segment provides the satellite's onboard perimeter with instruments that transmit data to the ground. The consortium will be involved in the engineering and testing of both the onboard and ground systems.Space expertise is provided from Toulouse  the European Space capital  by teams located at the Atos Technology Services center of excellence and its partners.To leverage the complementary capabilities of the consortium  Atos has developed a collaborative innovation approach supported by its network of R&D centers and Inno'Labs in France  as well as by the innovation centers of its partners. The other members of the consortium will be able to rely on Atos's expertise to integrate digital technologies to optimize their business solutions.For example  one of the innovation programs that the group is tasked with is to improve the data processing and transmission capacity of satellites. As the high-performance onboard satellite instrumentation generates a growing volume of data  the transmission of this data to the ground is becoming increasingly complex. The mission of Atos  an expert in artificial intelligence (AI)  and its partners is to equip satellites with on-board AI technology to perform data processing farther upstream. This reduces the amount of data to be transmitted and maximizes the use of the limited bandwidth.""New technologies such as artificial intelligence and automation are leading to innovations that are revolutionizing the industrial and digital models of the space industry. Together with Atos and its partners  CNES is taking full advantage of these advances  which are helping our ecosystem evolve  strengthening our sovereignty and competitiveness  and fostering the emergence of new services that will enable the space industry to assert France's and Europe's leadership "" said François Sillion  Chief Technology and Digital Officer at CNES.""Atos and its partners are very proud to contribute to the strategic missions of CNES in the civil and military domains. CNES can count on a group of European leaders whose diversity of expertise will provide it with a strong support to meet the needs of transformation and evolution of the space sector. For example  the introduction of AI as a digital transformation vector is a major challenge  and Atos's expertise in this field will enable CNES to open up a range of possibilities  with the challenge of preserving national and European sovereignty in the sensitive areas of application of this technology "" said Stéphane Richard  Director of Technology Services  Atos.CNES is a public institution responsible for shaping and implementing France’s space policy within Europe. The Agency designs satellites  placing them into orbit as well as inventing tomorrow’s space systems  as well as fostering the deployment of new and practical everyday services.Founded in 1961  CNES spearheads large-scale space projects  launchers and satellites  acting as the go-to partner for the industry to propel innovation. Supported by a passionate team of 2 400 employees  CNES is helping develop innovative applications guided by four strategic ambitions: national sovereignty  science  economic performance and climate.CNES is leading the way in France’s technological innovation  economic development and industrial policy.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the second quarter and first half ended June 30  2023. Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries  commented: ""The second quarter of 2023 was strong for Pharming. After the reimbursement disruptions experienced in the HAE market in the first quarter  RUCONEST® recovered significantly in the second quarter increasing 20% over the first quarter of 2023. Our RUCONEST® business performed well across a variety of leading revenue indicators  positioning us well for the second half of the year. RUCONEST® continues to provide a stable base for Pharming's future growth  and we continue to foresee low single digit growth in sales for the year. The Joenja® (leniolisib) U.S. launch got off to a strong start with the first reimbursed shipments to patients taking place in April; within two weeks of FDA approval. Our focus throughout the second quarter was enrolling identified U.S.-based APDS patients on Joenja® and working with payors on reimbursement. As of June 30  we have 60 patient enrollments and 43 patients on paid therapy  and US$3.8 million in associated revenues for the second quarter. 1We continue to make good progress in identifying additional patients with APDS in key global markets. We have now identified over 640 patients in markets including the U.S.  Europe  the U.K.  Japan  Canada  Australia and Israel. Through our regulatory  clinical  patient finding  and genetic testing efforts  we continue to make significant progress towards our goal of bringing this disease modifying treatment to adult and pediatric APDS patients worldwide. Pharming's progress continues to aid our patients and stakeholders as we focus on  and invest in  the long term growth of the company. I am immensely proud of our teams' many achievements in the first half of 2023."" Second quarter and first half highlights Commercialized assets RUCONEST® marketed for the treatment of acute HAE attacks Our RUCONEST® business had a strong second quarter  performing well across leading revenue indicators including active patients  vials shipped  and number of physicians prescribing. These positive indicators should position us well for the second half of the year. Moreover  the underlying in-market demand for RUCONEST® in the U.S. continues to be strong. We received over 70 new patient enrollments in each quarter of 2023 underpinning the importance of RUCONEST® to HAE patients  including those patients on prophylaxis who should have medication on hand to treat any breakthrough attacks. In the second quarter of 2023  RUCONEST® revenues were US$51.1 million  a 20% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023 and a 2% increase compared to the second quarter of 2022. For the first half of the year  RUCONEST® revenues were US$93.6 million  a 3% decrease compared to the first half of 2022. This was however a significant improvement when compared to the 9% revenue decrease experienced in the first quarter of 2023. The disruptions experienced in the first quarter  particularly in the month of February  impacted the entire U.S. HAE market across acute and prophylactic products and were temporary - as anticipated - and accounted for lower revenues in the first half of 2023 when compared to 2022. Joenja® (leniolisib) marketed in the U.S. - the first and only approved disease modifying treatment for APDS On March 24  the U.S. FDA approved Joenja® (leniolisib) for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja®  an oral  selective PI3Kδ inhibitor  is the first and only disease modifying treatment approved in the U.S. for APDS. 2The U.S. commercial launch of Joenja® is off to a strong start. First reimbursed shipments to patients took place in April; within two weeks of FDA approval. As of June 30  we received enrollments of 60 APDS patients of which 43 patients are already on paid therapy. Of the 43 patients on paid therapy  19 were previously on therapy under our Expanded Access Program (EAP) or Open Label Extension trial (OLE). The remaining 24 patients were previously untreated patients or naïve. We anticipate nearly all future patients to be naïve to Joenja®. Access and reimbursement discussions have been proceeding as expected. Given the rarity of APDS  the limited number of treatment options available  and that Joenja® is a disease modifying treatment and the only treatment indicated for APDS  we have seen high approval rates and fast timelines to covered therapy. Pharming's market access teams are continuing to work with government and private payors to both educate and provide the resources needed to formulate their policies to ensure access and reimbursement. Patient finding Based on available literature  Pharming estimates that over 1 500 patients are affected by APDS in our key global markets including the U.S.  Europe  U.K.  Japan  Canada  Australia and Israel. Our patient finding efforts continue to progress  and as of June 30  Pharming has identified over 640 patients - versus the over 500 patients reported as of December 2022. Of these 640 patients  approximately 200 are U.S.-based with approximately 75% over the age of 12 and are therefore currently eligible for treatment with Joenja®. During the second quarter  our primary focus during was enrolling patients previously identified with APDS in the U.S. and moving them onto paid therapy. As we enter the third quarter of 2023  we will intensify our focus towards conducting genetic testing  including testing family members of diagnosed patients  to identify additional individuals with APDS who may be eligible for treatment with Joenja®. Milestone and royalty payments As announced in April 2023  the first commercial sale of Joenja® triggered a US$10 million milestone payment by Pharming to Novartis. The regulatory approval for APDS also triggered a US$0.5 million milestone payment by Pharming to another party in the first quarter of 2023. With the approval of Joenja®  and pursuant to the terms of Pharming's 2019 exclusive license agreement with Novartis for leniolisib  Pharming is obligated to make certain one-off milestone payments to Novartis totaling up to US$200 million upon the first achievement of certain leniolisib sales levels in a calendar year and tiered royalty payments to Novartis calculated as low-teens mid-teens to high-teens percentages of leniolisib net sales. 3Sale of Priority Review Voucher In June 2023  Pharming announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) to Novartis for a pre-agreed one-time payment of US$21.1 million. Pharming was granted the PRV by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2023 in connection with the approval of Joenja®. The sale price was a pre-agreed  contractually defined percentage of the PRV value pursuant to the terms of the August 2019 exclusive license agreement between Pharming and Novartis for leniolisib. Additional information on the PRV  milestones  and royalties can be found in our Annual Report 2022 or in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on April 5  2023. Joenja® (leniolisib) strategic highlights - regulatory and clinical updates Leniolisib for APDS Pharming made significant progress over the first half of 2023 towards our objective of obtaining leniolisib regulatory approvals for APDS patients 12 years of age and older and for pediatric patients in key global markets. Furthermore  we continued to make progress in identifying additional indications for development of leniolisib beyond APDS. EEA and U.K. market In February  Pharming announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) decided to shift its assessment of the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib for patients 12 years of age and older to a standard review timetable. The list of questions received by Pharming included a request to submit updated data from the ongoing long-term extension study collected after the interim analysis included in the original MAA. In May  Pharming submitted its response to the CHMP Day 120 list of questions. Subsequently  as part of the MAA review procedure timetable  Pharming received the CHMP's Day 180 list of outstanding issues in July. Considering the rarity of the disease and the unmet need for the treatment of APDS patients  the CHMP will consult an Ad-hoc Expert Group (AEG) at a closed meeting also involving Pharming representatives including leniolisib investigators and APDS patients. Under EMA regulations  the CHMP may call an AEG meeting when a medicine is being assessed that requires input from specialized scientific advisors on matters that may fall outside the expertise of the EMA's established Scientific Advisory Groups  as is typically the case for rare diseases with few experts. Pharming anticipates that the CHMP will issue its opinion on the leniolisib MAA in the fourth quarter of 2023  with European marketing authorisation following approximately two months later. 4",neutral,0.07,0.9,0.03,mixed,0.64,0.23,0.13,True,English,"['Halfjaarlijkse financiële verslaggeving', 'Pharming N', '03:05', 'low single digit annual revenue growth', 'low single digit growth', 'The U.S. commercial launch', 'entire U.S. HAE market', 'activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta', 'U.S.-based APDS patients', 'preliminary (unaudited) financial report', 'oral, selective PI3Kδ inhibitor', 'regulatory, clinical, patient finding', 'Pharming Group N.V.', 'U.S. Joenja® launch', 'U.S. launch', 'long term growth', 'US$3.8 million revenue', 'leading revenue indicators', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Sijmen de Vries', ""teams' many achievements"", 'U.S. FDA', 'genetic testing efforts', 'Commercialized assets RUCONEST®', '70 new patient enrollments', 'key global markets', 'acute HAE attacks', 'pediatric APDS patients', 'strong second quarter', 'strong RUCONEST® revenues', 'disease modifying treatment', 'future growth', 'U.K.', '2023 financial results', 'regulatory submissions', 'The Netherlands', 'market demand', 'PI3Kδ) syndrome', '9% revenue decrease', 'patient program', '60 patient enrollments', 'HAE patients', 'positive indicators', 'key markets', 'The Joenja®', 'breakthrough attacks', 'Strong start', 'FDA approval', 'associated revenues', 'lower revenues', 'Strong progress', 'second half', 'Overall cash', 'cash equivalents', 'restricted cash', 'CHMP opinion', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'stable base', 'two weeks', 'significant improvement', 'prophylactic products', 'first half', 'first quarter', 'RUCONEST® business', 'good progress', 'significant progress', 'additional patients', 'active patients', '60 APDS patients', '1H 2023 revenues', '2Q 2023 revenues', 'reimbursement disruptions', '43 patients', '640 patients', '3% decrease', 'therapy', '1Q', 'end', 'leniolisib', 'Canada', 'Australia', 'Israel', 'Leiden', 'Company', 'PHARM/Nasdaq', 'variety', 'year', 'sales', 'shipments', 'place', 'April', 'focus', 'payors', 'June', 'Europe', 'Japan', 'goal', 'adult', 'stakeholders', 'vials', 'number', 'physicians', 'underlying', 'importance', 'prophylaxis', 'medication', 'hand', '20% increase', '2% increase', 'month', 'February', 'March', 'age']",2023-09-07,2023-09-08,marketscreener.com

Including the dividend  NAV was up 0.9% compared with 31 December 2022 (€35.93/share).1. PERFORMANCENet Asset Value (shareholders' equity  IFRS basis) stood at €1 284.2m (vs. €1 312.0m as of 31 December 2022). The change in Net Asset Value during the first half resulted from the following factors:Management AccountsIn € m Portfolio Cash (Debt) Carried interest provision Other assets and liabilitiesNAV NAV 31/12/2022 1 468.0 (2.0) (172.4) 18.41 312.0+ Investments 52.9 (52.9) - - -- Divestments(27.5) 27.5 - - - + Interest and other financial income (including dividends)- (2.0) - - (2.0) +/- Positive or negative change in fair value48.1 (10.1) (2.9) - 35.1 +/- Funds held as nominee on behalf of Altaroc - 24.7 - (24.7) - +/- Purchases and external expenses- (31.5) 1.3 8.8 (21.4) - Dividends paid- (45.3) 5.9 - (39.4) NAV 30/06/2023 1 541.5 (91.6) (168.1) 2.4 1 284.2Value creation during the first half totalled €35.4m  after taking into account a negative currency effect of €8.3m.It derived principally from a very robust increase in the valuation of the Consumer sector (up €49.0m)  driven by THOM (up €34.2m)  and Europe Snacks (up €14.0m)  two companies that achieved excellent operating performance in the first half despite the inflationary context.The valuations of Tech & Telco companies posted mixed trends (down €12.2m): InfoVista (down €49.2m) and ThoughtWorks (down €12.1m) experienced a slowdown in customer demand  which depressed their topline performance  while the sales of Marlink (up €20.1m) and Graitec (€11.1m) remained robust during the half-year period.Lastly  the operating performance of companies in the Healthcare (up €5.6m) and Services (down €7.0m) sectors remained positive on the whole  but the €16.4m decline in Entoria's valuation  reflecting the discussions underway with its lenders  weighed on the overall valuation of the Services sector.2. ACTIVITYa) €37.7m invested and committed during the first half (vs. €95.2m in H1 2022):€24.3m invested and committed in two new companies:Infraneo  a major engineering firm active in the European market  specialised in diagnostics and consulting for the safeguarding of infrastructure  in particular from the effects of time and climate change (€15.5m committed via Seven2 MidMarket X - transaction not yet finalised as of 30 June) IBS Software  a leader in SaaS software solutions serving companies in the logistics and tourism sectors  including airlines  travel agencies and cruise lines (€8.8m committed via Apax XI LP - transaction non yet finalised as of 30 June).In addition  €2.3m was invested in Altaroc Global 2021 (which carried out 21 acquisitions) and Altaroc Global 2022 (one new investment)  €1.4m in Apax Digital 2 (one acquisition) and €1.1m in Apax Development (one new investment).Lastly  Altamir recognised an adjustment of €1.2m during the first half to take into account the definitive amount of the investment in Vitaprotech made by the Seven2 MidMarket X fund.€7.4m in follow-on investments were carried out on existing portfolio companies  principally:€2.3m to finance the transformation of Odigo's business model €1.7m to strengthen the financial condition of Vocalcom €1.5m to finance build-ups in Crystal €1.3m in Lutech to finance the acquisition of Atos Italia €1.2m to finance build-ups in Dstny €1.2m to strengthen the financial condition of MatchesFashion.com €1.0m to strengthen the financial condition of Vyaire Medical.Altamir recognised an adjustment of (€3.8m) to take into account the definitive amount of Europe Snacks's equity investment in Burts Snacks.b) €12.1m in total and partial divestment proceeds received during the first half (vs. €85.1m in H1 2022)  including:The principal components were €5.4m from the full divestment of Duck Creek Technologies and €2.0m from the divestment of the remaining shares of Shriram. These two transactions were carried out via the Apax VIII LP fund.In addition  €4.7m in sundry revenue were recognised during the period  principally related to the refinancing of EcoOnline (€1.5m) and T-Mobile (€0.8m) and Inmarsat's dividend recap (€1.5m).3. CASH AND COMMITMENTSAltamir's net cash position as of 30 June 2023 on a statutory basis was €51.3m (vs. €88.6m as of 31 December 2022 and €94.2m as of 31 March 2023).As of 30 June 2023  Altamir had maximum outstanding commitments of €670.1m (including €114.8m committed but not yet called)  which will be invested between now and end-2026  principally as follows:2023 vintage: €254m in the Apax XI LP fund;2019 vintage: €377.5m   of which:€226.3m in the Seven2 Midmarket X fund (ex-Apax MidMarket X);€82.0m in the Altaroc Global 2021  2022 and 2023 funds;€48.2m in the Apax X LP fund  including €12.2m in recallable distributions;$20.0m in the Apax Digital II fund;€2.2m in Dstny ;; $1.1m in recallable distributions in the Apax Digital fund;2016 vintage: €38.7m   of which:€13.0m in distributions recallable by the Apax IX LP fund;€22.5m in the Apax MidMarket IX fund  including €17.3m in recallable distributions;€2.7m in distributions recallable by the Apax VIII LP fund.As a reminder  Altamir benefits from an opt-out clause  usable every six months  under which it can adjust the level of its commitment to the Seven2 MidMarket X fund by €100m.4. EVENTS SINCE 30 JUNE 2023Apax Partners has announced the acquisition of Palex  via the Apax XI LP fund. Palex is the principal  independent distributor of innovative and high value-added MedTech solutions for public and private hospitals and laboratories in Spain  Portugal and Italy.5. OBJECTIVESOver 2021  2022 and the first half of 2023  Altamir significantly outpaced the medium-term objectives (2021-25) management announced with the publication of 2020 full-year results: investments of €189m p.a. on average over the period vs. a target of €170m (including follow-on investments)  divestment proceeds of €282m p.a. on average vs. a target of €230m  and growth in the average EBITDA of portfolio companies of 12.9% vs. a target of at least 7% p.a. (organic growth).Management is thus confident that the objectives for the 2021-23 period will be achieved.6. FORTHCOMING EVENTSNAV as of 30/09/2023 8 November 2023  post-trading* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *FOCUS ON THE PORTFOLIO IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2023As of 30 June 2023  Altamir's portfolio was valued at €1 541.5m (vs. €1 468.0m as of 31 December 2022). It was composed of 68 companies (vs. 69 as of 31 December 2022). Ten of these companies are publicly traded and represented 4% of portfolio fair value (Baltic Classifieds Group  Genius Sports Group  Guotai  Inmarsat  Innovage  Manappuram  Openlane - formerly KAR Global  Paycor  ThoughtWorks and Verint).The portfolio did not include Infraneo or IBS Software  as those acquisitions had not yet been finalised as of 30 June 2023.During the first half of 2023  the companies in Altamir's portfolio posted an increase of 1.4% in their average EBITDA  weighted by the residual amount invested in each company.The 20 largest investments  representing nearly 74% of the portfolio's total value as of 30 June 2023  are as follows  in decreasing order:THOM Leading jewellery retailer in Europe (more than 1 000 points of sale)After an excellent performance in the 2021/22 financial year  THOM posted a 10% increase in sales over the first nine months of 2022/23 (FYE 30/09) vs. the year-earlier period. This increase reflected successful marketing investments in the Histoire d'Or and Stroili brands  development of the product range and the synergies implemented among the various distribution channels.EBITDA was up 2%. The positive impact of higher sales was partially offset by cost increases resulting from inflation and by investments in marketing.Now 100% owned and consolidated  Agatha has revitalised its Chinese business.EUROPE SNACKS A European leader in private-label savoury snacksOver the first five months of the 2023/24 financial year (FYE 31/01)  the sales of Europe Snacks grew by an estimated 12% compared with the year-earlier period. The rise in sales reflected both strong business trends in the group's three markets and price increases.Following the acquisition of Burts Snacks in March 2023  Europe Snacks has reorganised its manufacturing facilities and expanded its customer base. Burts Snacks is one of the main savoury snacks producers in the United Kingdom  with annual sales of around €100m.Dstny Leading European provider of secure cloud communication solutions (UCaaS) for innovative companiesDstny's sales and EBITDA increased by 26% and 24%  respectively  during the first half of 2023 compared with the year-earlier period. Organically  sales increased by 6%  while EBITDA declined by 9%. These figures principally reflected a decline in volumes and the full impact of the wage increase that took effect on 1 January. Prices were increased and the product portfolio rationalised  both successfully. These initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on the bottom line in the second half of the year.After entering the German market with the acquisition of Easybell at the end of 2022  Dstny pursued its international deployment strategy with two acquisitions in Denmark (Flexfone and Mobikom)  as it aimed to reach critical mass in the country. In the space of two years  Dstny has become a major player in the UCaaS market  with leadership positions in five European countries: France  the Netherlands  Belgium  Sweden  and Denmark.Marlink One of the world's leaders in satellite communication servicesMarlink's first-half 2023 was very favourable  with sales up 21% and EBITDA up 30% compared with the year-earlier period. Growth was driven by all Maritime division segments  in particular Transport (up 20%)  Offshore (up 27%) and Cruise (up 51%).Sales in the digitised services business (IoT  cybersecurity  etc.) continued to accelerate during the first half  growing 38%  driven by several projects with large maritime customers.Starlink's low earth orbit (LEO) solution was integrated into Marlink's existing range of solutions  giving the company a competitive advantage over operators of traditional satellite networks.Graitec International developer and distributor of BIM (Building Information Modelling) software for design  calculation  simulation  manufacturing and collaborative managementGraitec continued to grow in the first half of 2023  posting a 19% increase in sales compared with H1 2022  reflecting very good performance in the resale of Autodesk solutions as well as that of proprietary software solutions  in particular Powerpack.EBITDA rose by 69% compared with the year-earlier period  as the positive impact of the rise in sales combined with synergies deriving from the integration of Applied Software. In addition  investments to improve the organisation optimised operating costs.AEB Worldwide leader in ingredients and services for the food and beverage industryAEB demonstrated strong resilience in the first half  with sales down 2% and an EBITDA margin in line with that of H1 2022  even though harvest volumes in the southern hemisphere declined 15–30%. The new pricing policy enabled the company to recover most cost increases through higher sales prices.A new CEO with more than 20 years of experience in the wine sector and a very good track record took office on 1 September and will focus in particular on finding new acquisition targets.Odin One of the principal suppliers of managed IT and cloud services in the NetherlandsOdin's sales and EBITDA increased by 1% and 7%  respectively  in the first half of 2023. Through successful new pricing and sales policies  the company regained the margin it had lost in 2022 as a result of the rapid rise in energy costs.With the support of the Seven2 team  the company is exploring several acquisition opportunities.Lastly  Odin's supervisory board has been strengthened  with the appointment of two experienced members: Cees van den Heijkant as Chairman and Harald Roesch as independent member. In addition  the management team welcomed Tim Timmerman  who was promoted from head of the Previder business unit to the position of Head of Operations.InfoVista Leading global provider of network performance software solutionsOver the 2022/23 financial year (FYE 30/06)  InfoVista experienced a market slowdown  and sales performance fell short of budget (sales down 23%  EBITDA margin of 25%). To improve the situation  management launched several initiatives. It reinforced the management team  implemented a new organisation aimed at improving sales & marketing efficiency and optimised the cost structure.Opteven A leading European vehicle services and insurance solutions company  covering mechanical breakdowns  roadside assistance and maintenance  with a commercial presence in 10 countries.In a lacklustre French used vehicles market (sales down an estimated 6%)  Opteven's gross profit rose by 7.5% in the first half of 2023  in line with the investment plan.The company's management was strengthened during the period  as a new COO and a new head of M&A were recruited. The management team also intends to step up the pace of acquisitions and is actively evaluating several potential transactions.Odigo Leader in Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) solutions intended principally for large companiesFirst-half 2023 revenue was in line with that of the year-earlier period  owing to (i) the HMRC contract (UK tax authority) that started in 2022 and is now at full potential and (ii) the ramp-up in the Crédit Agricole contract. These two factors offset the erosion in the existing customer base. Odigo is working on several sales opportunities for the second half.EBITDA was up sharply (by 47%) compared with H1 2022  as the company has realised significant cost savings by implementing a new SaaS model. As of end-June 2023  more than 95% of Odigo's eligible customer base had migrated to the new  public cloud based version of the “One release” solution.Crystal One of France's leaders in wealth management advisory servicesCrystal's first-half 2023 performance far exceeded that of Seven2's investment plan. Revenue advanced by more than 18% and EBITDA was stable compared with the year-earlier period  owing to acquisitions and a robust increase in assets under management  and in spite of a complex worldwide macroeconomic environment.Since being acquired by Seven2  Crystal has carried out 23 significant build-ups  bringing its assets under management to nearly $7 billion.Lastly  Crystal continued to pursue its value-creation initiatives. The company launched a review of its ESG strategy and began restructuring its management team  appointing a new CFO and a new CDMO (Chief Digital & Marketing Officer).Mentaal Beter Leading provider of outpatient services for mental health problems of light-to-moderate severityMentaal Beter's sales and EBITDA rose by 23% and 36%  respectively (10% and 20% organic growth  resp.) in the first half of 2023 compared with H1 2022  principally reflecting an increase in the number of doctors and psychologists in the network  a decrease in absenteeism among them (absenteeism was high during the Covid crisis) and the price increases agreed with insurers and municipalities.During the half-year period  Mentaal Beter transitioned its top management  with Jan-Willem van der Windt replacing Martin de Heer as CEO  a clinical psychologist by training. Mr de Heer will remain active within the group. The management team was also strengthened.Entoria Wholesale broker specialised in supplemental insurance protection for self-employed persons and the managers and employees of SMEsSix years after investment  Entoria's performance is still short of expectations. But the company is back on a growth track following implementation of a strategic transformation plan in 2021  the results of which started to materialise in 2022. To successfully carry out this plan  Seven2 overhauled the management team  and the management committee was considerably strengthened with new hires in all divisions.Entoria's sales and EBITDA increased by 8% and 13.5%  respectively  during the first half of 2023 compared with the year-earlier period  demonstrating the continuing success of the recovery plan. The very positive sales trends that characterised 2022 have continued into 2023  with a 60% rise in new business in the first half.Nevertheless  in light of Entoria's heavy debt load  discussions are underway with lenders and the company's valuation was revised down to reflect the situation.VitaprotechA French leader in premium electronic solutions for securing sensitive sitesFormed from the 2014 merger of Sorhea and TIL Technologies  Vitaprotech is a French leader in premium electronic security. The group develops and supplies software and hardware solutions for sites with generally high security needs (including regulated sites with complex system requirements) with regard to perimeter intrusion detection  access control and intelligent video.Vitaprotech's R&D staff number more than 100  or 25% of its workforce. Through this strong expertise  the company is constantly at the cutting-edge of innovation.Vitaprotech's business was robust in the first half of 2023  with sales and EBITDA growth of 8% vs. H1 2022 at constant scope. It benefited in particular from a high volume of access control projects.In purchasing Harper Chalice  a British specialist in perimeter intrusion detection  Vitaprotech has initiated its acquisition strategy. It has also implemented numerous value-creation initiatives  including (i) launching a review of the ESG strategy and (ii) recruiting for key management positions.Expereo Global internet connectivity and managed services providerExpereo's sales grew 6% in the first half of 2023  reflecting the increasing proportion of high valued-added segments (SD-WAN and XCA) in the product mix and an increase in direct sales to large accounts. Direct sales accounted for 75% of the order book in June 2023  vs. 13% in 2018  the year Seven2 acquired the company.EBITDA was down 2%  impacted by continued investment in the salesforce to accelerate direct corporate sales.Assured PartnersOne of the largest independent insurance brokers in the United StatesLTM revenue advanced by 14% as of 31 March 2023  reflecting both sound organic growth (6%)  driven principally by acquisitions and successful new property & casualty and professional income protection solutions.EBITDA also advanced by 14% despite investment in IT and expenses incurred in creating the Large Accounts division.Assured Partners continued to carry out an active bolt-on acquisition strategy.TOI TOI & Dixi European leader in the leasing  installation and maintenance of mobile toiletsAlthough the construction industry has lost momentum since the start of the year  the sales and EBITDA of ADCO (Toi Toi and Dixi brands) rose 32% and 25%  respectively on an LTM basis (30/04/2023 vs. 30/04/2022)  because (i) Apax has implemented value-creation plans since it acquired the company at the end of 2019 (“premiumisation”)  (ii) new  post-Covid needs have emerged (warehouses  schools  reception centres for refugees  etc.)  and (iii) the outdoor events business is continuing apace (concerts  etc.).Efficy A European leader in CRM softwareRevenue rose by 3% during the first half (vs. H1 2022)  reflecting double-digit growth in the cloud segment of Efficy's legacy CRM business. This was partially offset by the decline in cloud sales in Apsis's legacy Marketing Automation business  as customers transitioned to the single platform currently being deployed. Non-recurrent sales (licences and services) posted double-digit growth during the period.PIB Group An insurance broker based in the United Kingdom with a presence in continental EuropeLTM sales as of 30 June 2023 (vs. LTM as of 30/06/2022) were up 30%  reflecting both strong performance in the Specialist and International divisions and the impact of acquisitions  in particular in continental Europe. EBITDA rose 15% over the same period  held back by investments to support growth.Since PIB Group was acquired by Apax in February 2021  it has evaluated 67 targets and acquired most of them  including 52 outside the UK.Candela A leading US company specialised in energy-based  innovative solutions for non-surgical aesthetic applications  including treatment of vascular and pigmented lesions  tattoo removal and laser hair removalCandela's sales declined by 4% during the first half of 2023 (vs. H1 2022)  impacted by negative exchange rate movements and the company's exit from Russia.Despite price increases and favourable mix trends  the EBITDA margin narrowed slightly owing to marketing expenses related to a new product launch.About AltamirAltamir is a listed private equity company (Euronext Paris-B  ticker: LTA) founded in 1995 and with a NAV of nearly €1.3bn.

These results from the VLA15-221 Phase 2 study showed a strong anamnestic antibody response for all serotypes in pediatric (5 to 11 years of age) and adolescent participants (12 to 17 years of age)  as well as in adults (18 to 65 years of age)  one month after administration of a booster dose (month 19).Depending on the primary schedule they received (month 0-2-6 or month 0-6)  participants seroconverted after the booster dose  yielding seroconversion1 rates (SCRs) of 95.3% and 94.6% for all outer surface protein A (OspA) serotypes in all age groups  respectively. Additionally  OspA antibody titers were significantly higher one month after the booster dose compared to one month after the primary schedule with 3.3- to 3.7-fold increases (Geometric Mean Fold Rises) in adults  2.0- to 2.7- fold increases in adolescents and 2.3- to 2.5-fold increases in children for all serotypes.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are pleased with these data which validate the use of a booster dose in all age groups. Lyme disease continues to spread  representing an important unmet medical need that impacts the lives of many people in the Northern Hemisphere. With each new set of positive data  we come one step closer to potentially bringing this vaccine to both adults and children living in areas where Lyme disease is endemic.”The Phase 2 booster results emphasize the vaccine candidate’s potential to provide immunity against Lyme disease in pediatric and adolescent populations. Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) one month following the booster dose were similarly high for children and adolescents.The safety and tolerability profile of VLA15 after a booster dose was consistent with previous studies as the vaccine candidate was well-tolerated in all age groups regardless of the primary vaccination schedule. No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no safety concerns were observed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).“Protection against Lyme disease is important for anyone who lives or spends time outdoors in areas where Lyme disease is endemic. This data from the VLA15-221 study is vital to improve our understanding of how vaccination may help to protect both adults and children from this potentially devastating disease ” said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head Vaccine Research and Development at Pfizer. “We are encouraged by the positive Phase 2 results for VLA15  and  in partnership with Valneva  look forward to continuing to study the vaccine candidate in ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.”These results follow six-month antibody persistence data in children and adults reported for the VLA15-221 study in December 20221 and positive immunogenicity and safety data reported in April 20222.In August 2022  Pfizer and Valneva initiated the currently ongoing Phase 3 clinical study  Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524)  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in participants five years of age and older in highly endemic regions in the United States (U.S.) and Europe3. A second Phase 3 study (VLA15-1012)  aiming to provide further evidence on the safety profile of VLA15 in the pediatric population  is also ongoing.Pfizer aims to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2026  subject to positive Phase 3 data.About VLA15There are currently no approved human vaccines for Lyme disease  and VLA15 is the most advanced Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development  with a Phase 3 study in progress. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immune response and satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.4 5 The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA in July 2017.6About Clinical Study VLA15-221VLA15-221 is a randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old).585 healthy participants received VLA15 in two immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=190] or month 0-6 [N=187]) or three doses of placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=208]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 µg  which was selected based on data generated in the two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout was performed one month after the primary vaccination series. All eligible subjects received a booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 18 (booster phase) and will be followed for three additional years to monitor antibody persistence. In addition  all eligible subjects will be asked to receive an additional booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 30  in order to generate additional data and assess the need for periodic booster doses.VLA15 is tested as an alum-adjuvanted formulation and administered intramuscularly. The study is being conducted at U.S. sites located in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and has enrolled both volunteers with a prior infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi-naïve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected Ixodes ticks.7 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.8 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the U.S. and 129 000 people in Europe.9 10 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the skin  joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.9 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.11About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

BioSenic publishes its interim financial report in English. A French translation of the report will also be made available. In the event of differences between the English and the French version of the report  the original French version will prevail.The BioSenic Phase 2 clinical study with arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of chronic Graft versus Host disease (cGvHD) has been completed and provided positive results. In 2024  the BioSenic Group expects to prioritize the use of the proceeds of anticipated future fundraising for the progression of the Phase 3 clinical trial in cGvHD.Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  7 September 2023  7am CEST – BioSenic (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BIOS)  theclinical-stage company specializing in serious autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and cell therapy  today publishes its business update for the first half  ended 30 June 2023  prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union  and the outlook for the remainder of the year.""BioSenic has made the best of its efforts on restructuring and accomplishing important technical steps in implementing key features of its Arsenic salts (ATO) and its cell repair platforms after succeeding its reverse merger between Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics 10 months ago” said François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic “Successfully interpreting clinical and scientific complex data – and specifically those inherited from the former Bone Therapeutics – gives us now the essential basic elements to develop our activities on licensing opportunities and further Phase 2/3 clinical trials. Our immediate leading project is a Phase 3 confirmatory trial on the efficacy of an oral formulation of arsenic trioxide on chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease  an autoimmune rare condition following allogeneic hematopoietic cells used for treating several types of leukaemia. We now expect a productive end of 2023 for further developing the best values of BioSenic.""Operational and Corporate highlightsIn January 2023  BioSenic strengthened its scientific team with the appointment of Dr. Carole Nicco  as Chief Scientific Officer (CSO).In January 2023  BioSenic appointed Yves Sagot as a member of the Board of Directors and Independent Director.In March 2023  BioSenic re-evaluated the results of its Phase 3 trial of its enhanced viscosupplement JTA-004 targeting knee osteoarthritis (OA). The Company indeed announced that it has used the statistical analysis capabilities of Artialis to study the results of the Phase 3 JTA-004 trial in the subset of patients with the most painful and inflammatory form of knee osteoarthritis (OA). This allows BioSenic to distinguish a group of patients  representing about one third of the total patients  who show a pain-relieving effect of JTA-004 not only superior to placebo but also to the active comparator. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase 3 clinical study.In March 2023  BioSenic published new data on the mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide (ATO) to prevent autoimmune diseases has now been published in a peer-reviewed paper (Frontiers in Immunology). This new data shows that combination of ATO with copper salts can allow BioSenic to work towards reducing the dosage of ATO in future trials overall and maintain efficacy. This new formulation data has been completed following pre-clinical activities and does not constitute data validated through clinical trial.In April 2023  BioSenic appointed Lieven Huysse  MD  as permanent Chief Medical Officer (CMO).In April 2023  BioSenic received European patent from EPO  for further therapeutic development in cancer  infectious and immune diseases. The patent covers the therapeutic use of a new composite formulation of anti-inflammatory compounds with unique advantages. This new formulation lowers the dosage of arsenic trioxide by combining it with copper salts to maintain therapeutic efficacy  with the potential of administration through multiple routes  including intravenous  oral  and other novel routes of administration.In May 2023  BioSenic identified key biomarkers for cGvHD and submitted patent to EPO. The technology covered by the patent applies to a method and kit for diagnosing and monitoring cGvHD in an individual who has undergone an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patent describes biomarkers to be used to determine if the condition of a patient worsens or improves following standard or new treatments for cGvHD. This international patent could allow the development of an industrial biomarker analysis kit which could generate a turnover of 30 to 40 million euros globally.In June 2023  BioSenic put Phase 2b ALLOB trial on hold. This decision follows negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in the exploratory Phase 2b trial (ALLOB 2b)  which focused on safety and treatment timing efficacy.In August 2023  BioSenic received a Chinese patent protecting the combined use of metal ions and arsenic salts. This patent (ZL202080040613.1) covers the use of its ATO platform in combination with metal ions like copper  which has the potential to improve the treatment of autoimmune diseases.Financial highlightsIn February 2023  BioSenic received EUR 1 million from Pregene in accordance with terminated license agreement.In June 2023  BioSenic has obtained an official appointment of Yves Brulard to reach a negotiated agreement with certain main creditors to preserve the value of BioSenic for the benefit of all stakeholders.In June 2023  BioSenic entered into an agreement with the ABO Securities subsidiary  Global Tech Opportunities 15  to secure short term financing based on the existing convertible bond program. Subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement  BioSenic shall be entitled to draw down three tranches of each EUR 0.3 million in June  July  and August under the existing convertible bond program  for an aggregate principal amount of EUR 0.9 million.In July 2023  BioSenic has achieved a standstill agreement from the main historical creditors for a period of 3 to 4 months. Given this agreement with the main creditors and the one obtained on 30 June 2023 with Global Tech Opportunities 15 to secure short-term financing based on the existing convertible bond program  BioSenic anticipates having sufficient cash to carry out its business objectives until October 2023.During the first six months of 2023  total operating income amounted to EUR 0.37 million  a slight increase compared to the same period in 2022 (EUR 0.13 million).Operating loss for the period amounted to EUR 3.90 million  compared to EUR 3.96 million in H1 2022.BioSenic ended the first six months of 2023 with EUR 0.52 million in cash and cash equivalents. Net cash used for the period amounted to EUR 1.33 million  compared to EUR 0.39 million over the same period of 2022.Outlook for the remainder of 2023 and 2024In March 2023  BioSenic has obtained new statistical analysis results from the JTA-004 Phase 3 clinical trial data. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004  is seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis. Following disappointing Phase 3 clinical results  Biosenic terminated the agreement with the Walloon Region and Mr Bastianelli in 2022. The agreement with the Walloon Region has since been resumed  but there is still no agreement with Mr Enrico Bastianelli  which could give rise to co-ownership problems.The Medsenic Phase 2 clinical study with arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD has been completed and provided positive results. A Phase 3 study with oral arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD  for which Medsenic received positive pre-IND response from the FDA  is currently anticipated to start in 2024. A Phase 2a clinical trial for systemic lupus erythematosus (""SLE"") had previously established safety for the patient and efficacy on the course of the autoimmune disease. Positive preclinical work gives good grounds for a Phase 2 clinical trial on systemic sclerosis (""SSc""). Phase 2b clinical trials for SLE and SSc are in the planning stage with the protocols for both studies being ready.BioSenic is currently preparing a fundraising to be organized in Q3/Q4 2023. BioSenic Group expects for 2024 to use the proceeds of anticipated future fundraisings in priority for progressing the Phase 3 clinical trial in cGvHD. As a result  it will only be possible to start the SLE and SSc Phase 2b clinical trials if the BioSenic Group succeeds in concluding a strong partnership with a biopharmaceutical company or if it manages to successfully out-license some of its technology.

In 2024  the BioSenic Group expects to prioritize the use of the proceeds of anticipated future fundraising for the progression of the Phase 3 clinical trial in cGvHD.Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  7September 2023  7am CEST – BioSenic (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BIOS)  theclinical-stage company specializing in serious autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and cell therapy  today publishes its business update for the first half  ended 30 June 2023  prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union  and the outlook for the remainder of the year.""BioSenic has made the best of its efforts on restructuring and accomplishing important technical steps in implementing key features of its Arsenic salts (ATO) and its cell repair platforms after succeeding its reverse merger between Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics 10 months ago” said François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic “Successfully interpreting clinical and scientific complex data – and specifically those inherited from the former Bone Therapeutics – gives us now the essential basic elements to develop our activities on licensing opportunities and further Phase 2/3 clinical trials. Our immediate leading project is a Phase 3 confirmatory trial on the efficacy of an oral formulation of arsenic trioxide on chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease  an autoimmune rare condition following allogeneic hematopoietic cells used for treating several types of leukaemia. We now expect a productive end of 2023 for further developing the best values of BioSenic.""Operational and Corporate highlightsIn January 2023  BioSenic strengthened its scientific team with the appointment of Dr. Carole Nicco  as Chief Scientific Officer (CSO).In January 2023  BioSenic appointed Yves Sagot as a member of the Board of Directors and Independent Director.In March 2023  BioSenic re-evaluated the results of its Phase 3 trial of its enhanced viscosupplement JTA-004 targeting knee osteoarthritis (OA). The Company indeed announced that it has used the statistical analysis capabilities of Artialis to study the results of the Phase 3 JTA-004 trial in the subset of patients with the most painful and inflammatory form of knee osteoarthritis (OA). This allows BioSenic to distinguish a group of patients  representing about one third of the total patients  who show a pain-relieving effect of JTA-004 not only superior to placebo but also to the active comparator. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase 3 clinical study.In March 2023  BioSenic published new data on the mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide (ATO) to prevent autoimmune diseases has now been published in a peer-reviewed paper (Frontiers in Immunology). This new data shows that combination of ATO with copper salts can allow BioSenic to work towards reducing the dosage of ATO in future trials overall and maintain efficacy. This new formulation data has been completed following pre-clinical activities and does not constitute data validated through clinical trial.In April 2023  BioSenic appointed Lieven Huysse  MD  as permanent Chief Medical Officer (CMO).In April 2023  BioSenic received European patent from EPO  for further therapeutic development in cancer  infectious and immune diseases. The patent covers the therapeutic use of a new composite formulation of anti-inflammatory compounds with unique advantages. This new formulation lowers the dosage of arsenic trioxide by combining it with copper salts to maintain therapeutic efficacy  with the potential of administration through multiple routes  including intravenous  oral  and other novel routes of administration.In May 2023  BioSenic identified key biomarkers for cGvHD and submitted patent to EPO. The technology covered by the patent applies to a method and kit for diagnosing and monitoring cGvHD in an individual who has undergone an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patent describes biomarkers to be used to determine if the condition of a patient worsens or improves following standard or new treatments for cGvHD. This international patent could allow the development of an industrial biomarker analysis kit which could generate a turnover of 30 to 40 million euros globally.In June 2023  BioSenic put Phase 2b ALLOB trial on hold. This decision follows negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in the exploratory Phase 2b trial (ALLOB 2b)  which focused on safety and treatment timing efficacy.In August 2023  BioSenic received a Chinese patent protecting the combined use of metal ions and arsenic salts. This patent (ZL202080040613.1) covers the use of its ATO platform in combination with metal ions like copper  which has the potential to improve the treatment of autoimmune diseases.Financial highlightsIn February 2023  BioSenic received EUR 1 million from Pregene in accordance with terminated license agreement.In June 2023  BioSenic has obtained an official appointment of Yves Brulard to reach a negotiated agreement with certain main creditors to preserve the value of BioSenic for the benefit of all stakeholders.In June 2023  BioSenic entered into an agreement with the ABO Securities subsidiary  Global Tech Opportunities 15  to secure short term financing based on the existing convertible bond program. Subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement  BioSenic shall be entitled to draw down three tranches of each EUR 0.3 million in June  July  and August under the existing convertible bond program  for an aggregate principal amount of EUR 0.9 million.In July 2023  BioSenic has achieved a standstill agreement from the main historical creditors for a period of 3 to 4 months. Given this agreement with the main creditors and the one obtained on 30 June 2023 with Global Tech Opportunities 15 to secure short-term financing based on the existing convertible bond program  BioSenic anticipates having sufficient cash to carry out its business objectives until October 2023.During the first six months of 2023  total operating income amounted to EUR 0.37 million  a slight increase compared to the same period in 2022 (EUR 0.13 million).Operating loss for the period amounted to EUR 3.90 million  compared to EUR 3.96 million in H1 2022.BioSenic ended the first six months of 2023 with EUR 0.52 million in cash and cash equivalents. Net cash used for the period amounted to EUR 1.33 million  compared to EUR 0.39 million over the same period of 2022.Outlook for the remainder of 2023 and 2024In March 2023  BioSenic has obtained new statistical analysis results from the JTA-004 Phase 3 clinical trial data. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004  is seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis. Following disappointing Phase 3 clinical results  Biosenic terminated the agreement with the Walloon Region and Mr Bastianelli in 2022. The agreement with the Walloon Region has since been resumed  but there is still no agreement with Mr Enrico Bastianelli  which could give rise to co-ownership problems.The Medsenic Phase 2 clinical study with arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD has been completed and provided positive results. A Phase 3 study with oral arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD  for which Medsenic received positive pre-IND response from the FDA  is currently anticipated to start in 2024. A Phase 2a clinical trial for systemic lupus erythematosus (""SLE"") had previously established safety for the patient and efficacy on the course of the autoimmune disease. Positive preclinical work gives good grounds for a Phase 2 clinical trial on systemic sclerosis (""SSc""). Phase 2b clinical trials for SLE and SSc are in the planning stage with the protocols for both studies being ready.BioSenic is currently preparing a fundraising to be organized in Q3/Q4 2023. BioSenic Group expects for 2024 to use the proceeds of anticipated future fundraisings in priority for progressing the Phase 3 clinical trial in cGvHD. As a result  it will only be possible to start the SLE and SSc Phase 2b clinical trials if the BioSenic Group succeeds in concluding a strong partnership with a biopharmaceutical company or if it manages to successfully out-license some of its technology. The start of SLE and SSc Phase 2 clinical trials is therefore not envisioned before 2024.Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income(in thousands of euros)For the six-months period ended 30/06/2023 30/06/2022 Revenues 0 0 Other operating income 365 125 Total revenues and operating income 365 125 Research and development expenses (2 452) (267) General and administrative expenses (1 813) (336) Other operating expenses (1) 0 Operating profit/(loss) (3 900) (478) Financial Income 35 0 Interest income 30 0 Impairment expenses (16 094) 0 Financial expenses (1 136) (49) Exchange gains/(losses) 1 0 Result Profit/(loss) before taxes (21 063) (527) Income taxes (24) -

Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The ATO platform  which has been successfully developed  has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  Tand other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). cGvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. BioSenic has been successful in a Phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international Phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early Phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment.Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a Phase 2 clinical protocol.2) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform developed by BioSenic  with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. ALLOB has recently been evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2b study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late-delayed union. However  in June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in this exploratory Phase 2b clinical trial  interpreted as a failure of a too early cell injection  just after fracture. BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (choice between early or late treatment).Note: Biosenic has reevaluated a previous important and years-long clinical development program. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase 3 JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient subpopulation. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. This leads to a next generationof JTA  off-the-shelfenhanced viscosupplementto treat knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component.JTA or some derivatives are intended to provide effective lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic (OA) pain and inflammation.The company  will nevertheless focus its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:SeitoseiActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

BioSenic publishes its interim financial report in English. A French translation of the report will also be made available. In the event of differences between the English and the French version of the report  the original French version will prevail.The BioSenic Phase 2 clinical study with arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of chronic Graft versus Host disease (cGvHD) has been completed and provided positive results. In 2024  the BioSenic Group expects to prioritize the use of the proceeds of anticipated future fundraising for the progression of the Phase 3 clinical trial in cGvHD.Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  7 September 2023  7am CEST – BioSenic (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BIOS)  theclinical-stage company specializing in serious autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and cell therapy  today publishes its business update for the first half  ended 30 June 2023  prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union  and the outlook for the remainder of the year.""BioSenic has made the best of its efforts on restructuring and accomplishing important technical steps in implementing key features of its Arsenic salts (ATO) and its cell repair platforms after succeeding its reverse merger between Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics 10 months ago” said François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic “Successfully interpreting clinical and scientific complex data – and specifically those inherited from the former Bone Therapeutics – gives us now the essential basic elements to develop our activities on licensing opportunities and further Phase 2/3 clinical trials. Our immediate leading project is a Phase 3 confirmatory trial on the efficacy of an oral formulation of arsenic trioxide on chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease  an autoimmune rare condition following allogeneic hematopoietic cells used for treating several types of leukaemia. We now expect a productive end of 2023 for further developing the best values of BioSenic.""Operational and Corporate highlightsIn January 2023  BioSenic strengthened its scientific team with the appointment of Dr. Carole Nicco  as Chief Scientific Officer (CSO).In January 2023  BioSenic appointed Yves Sagot as a member of the Board of Directors and Independent Director.In March 2023  BioSenic re-evaluated the results of its Phase 3 trial of its enhanced viscosupplement JTA-004 targeting knee osteoarthritis (OA). The Company indeed announced that it has used the statistical analysis capabilities of Artialis to study the results of the Phase 3 JTA-004 trial in the subset of patients with the most painful and inflammatory form of knee osteoarthritis (OA). This allows BioSenic to distinguish a group of patients  representing about one third of the total patients  who show a pain-relieving effect of JTA-004 not only superior to placebo but also to the active comparator. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase 3 clinical study.In March 2023  BioSenic published new data on the mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide (ATO) to prevent autoimmune diseases has now been published in a peer-reviewed paper (Frontiers in Immunology). This new data shows that combination of ATO with copper salts can allow BioSenic to work towards reducing the dosage of ATO in future trials overall and maintain efficacy. This new formulation data has been completed following pre-clinical activities and does not constitute data validated through clinical trial.In April 2023  BioSenic appointed Lieven Huysse  MD  as permanent Chief Medical Officer (CMO).In April 2023  BioSenic received European patent from EPO  for further therapeutic development in cancer  infectious and immune diseases. The patent covers the therapeutic use of a new composite formulation of anti-inflammatory compounds with unique advantages. This new formulation lowers the dosage of arsenic trioxide by combining it with copper salts to maintain therapeutic efficacy  with the potential of administration through multiple routes  including intravenous  oral  and other novel routes of administration.In May 2023  BioSenic identified key biomarkers for cGvHD and submitted patent to EPO. The technology covered by the patent applies to a method and kit for diagnosing and monitoring cGvHD in an individual who has undergone an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patent describes biomarkers to be used to determine if the condition of a patient worsens or improves following standard or new treatments for cGvHD. This international patent could allow the development of an industrial biomarker analysis kit which could generate a turnover of 30 to 40 million euros globally.In June 2023  BioSenic put Phase 2b ALLOB trial on hold. This decision follows negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in the exploratory Phase 2b trial (ALLOB 2b)  which focused on safety and treatment timing efficacy.In August 2023  BioSenic received a Chinese patent protecting the combined use of metal ions and arsenic salts. This patent (ZL202080040613.1) covers the use of its ATO platform in combination with metal ions like copper  which has the potential to improve the treatment of autoimmune diseases.Financial highlightsIn February 2023  BioSenic received EUR 1 million from Pregene in accordance with terminated license agreement.In June 2023  BioSenic has obtained an official appointment of Yves Brulard to reach a negotiated agreement with certain main creditors to preserve the value of BioSenic for the benefit of all stakeholders.In June 2023  BioSenic entered into an agreement with the ABO Securities subsidiary  Global Tech Opportunities 15  to secure short term financing based on the existing convertible bond program. Subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement  BioSenic shall be entitled to draw down three tranches of each EUR 0.3 million in June  July  and August under the existing convertible bond program  for an aggregate principal amount of EUR 0.9 million.In July 2023  BioSenic has achieved a standstill agreement from the main historical creditors for a period of 3 to 4 months. Given this agreement with the main creditors and the one obtained on 30 June 2023 with Global Tech Opportunities 15 to secure short-term financing based on the existing convertible bond program  BioSenic anticipates having sufficient cash to carry out its business objectives until October 2023.During the first six months of 2023  total operating income amounted to EUR 0.37 million  a slight increase compared to the same period in 2022 (EUR 0.13 million).Operating loss for the period amounted to EUR 3.90 million  compared to EUR 3.96 million in H1 2022.BioSenic ended the first six months of 2023 with EUR 0.52 million in cash and cash equivalents. Net cash used for the period amounted to EUR 1.33 million  compared to EUR 0.39 million over the same period of 2022.Outlook for the remainder of 2023 and 2024In March 2023  BioSenic has obtained new statistical analysis results from the JTA-004 Phase 3 clinical trial data. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004  is seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis. Following disappointing Phase 3 clinical results  Biosenic terminated the agreement with the Walloon Region and Mr Bastianelli in 2022. The agreement with the Walloon Region has since been resumed  but there is still no agreement with Mr Enrico Bastianelli  which could give rise to co-ownership problems.The Medsenic Phase 2 clinical study with arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD has been completed and provided positive results. A Phase 3 study with oral arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD  for which Medsenic received positive pre-IND response from the FDA  is currently anticipated to start in 2024. A Phase 2a clinical trial for systemic lupus erythematosus (""SLE"") had previously established safety for the patient and efficacy on the course of the autoimmune disease. Positive preclinical work gives good grounds for a Phase 2 clinical trial on systemic sclerosis (""SSc""). Phase 2b clinical trials for SLE and SSc are in the planning stage with the protocols for both studies being ready.BioSenic is currently preparing a fundraising to be organized in Q3/Q4 2023. BioSenic Group expects for 2024 to use the proceeds of anticipated future fundraisings in priority for progressing the Phase 3 clinical trial in cGvHD. As a result  it will only be possible to start the SLE and SSc Phase 2b clinical trials if the BioSenic Group succeeds in concluding a strong partnership with a biopharmaceutical company or if it manages to successfully out-license some of its technology. The start of SLE and SSc Phase 2 clinical trials is therefore not envisioned before 2024.Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income(in thousands of euros) For the six-months period ended 30/06/2023 30/06/2022 Revenues 0 0 Other operating income 365 125 Total revenues and operating income 365 125 Research and development expenses (2 452) (267) General and administrative expenses (1 813) (336) Other operating expenses (1) 0 Operating profit/(loss) (3 900) (478) Financial Income 35 0 Interest income 30 0 Impairment expenses (16 094) 0 Financial expenses (1 136) (49) Exchange gains/(losses) 1 0 Result Profit/(loss) before taxes (21 063) (527) Income taxes (24) -

Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The ATO platform  which has been successfully developed  has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T and other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). cGvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. BioSenic has been successful in a Phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international Phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early Phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a Phase 2 clinical protocol.2) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform developed by BioSenic  with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. ALLOB has recently been evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2b study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late-delayed union. However  in June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in this exploratory Phase 2b clinical trial  interpreted as a failure of a too early cell injection  just after fracture. BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (choice between early or late treatment).Note: Biosenic has reevaluated a previous important and years-long clinical development program. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase 3 JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient subpopulation. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. This leads to a next generation of JTA  off-the-shelf enhanced viscosupplement to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives are intended to provide effective lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic (OA) pain and inflammation.The company  will nevertheless focus its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced financial results for the six-month period ended June 30  2023  and provided an update on its corporate progress. The report is available on the Company's website https://www.vivoryon.com/investors-news/financial-information/“We enter into the second half of 2023 with key milestones achieved and a strong cash position bringing us beyond the VIVIAD Phase 2b study read-out  an exceptionally talented  passionate team  encouraging safety results at 600 mg twice daily in the VIVIAD study of varoglutamstat and a precision recruitment strategy applied to successfully identify the right patients for VIVIAD ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon. “Our achievements from the first half of this year include a successful fundraise significantly extending our cash runway and supportive independent Data Safety Monitoring Board decisions for VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND. We are laser focused on delivering VIVIAD study results in the first quarter of 2024 and monitor study progress as well as blinded safety and efficacy outcome parameters continuously. With varoglutamstat’s favorable safety profile  ease of administration  and strong signs of efficacy and synaptic improvement  we believe we are uniquely positioned to bring a highly differentiated  potentially first-in-class therapeutic option to patients with Alzheimer’s disease.“H1 2023 and Post-Period Portfolio HighlightsVaroglutamstat Clinical Program:Varoglutamstat is a differentiated investigational small-molecule medicine in development to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It is currently being investigated in two large Phase 2 studies  VIVIAD (NCT04498650) in Europe and VIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) in the U.S.  where it continues to show evidence of a favorable safety profile at the therapeutic dose of 600 mg twice daily (BID)  a dose demonstrated to result in a target occupancy of nearly 90%.Varoglutamstat is designed to prevent N3pE-Abeta formation  rather than aiming to clear existing plaques  making it an intervention upstream of other approaches such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Through a second mode of action  varoglutamstat also modulates neuroinflammation via the CCL2 pathway  which  in turn  has an impact on tau pathology.VIVIADVIVIAD (NCT04498650) is a state-of-the-art Phase 2b study being conducted in Europe and designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of varoglutamstat in 259 (final number of randomized participants) subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD.In March 2023  Vivoryon announced an update on the clinical development of varoglutamstat  including the VIVIAD trial  at the International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases and related neurological disorders (AD/PD) in Gothenburg  Sweden. As of the data cut-off date of January 5  2023  over 100 of the 259 participants randomized into the VIVIAD study had been treated for at least 48 weeks. Varoglutamstat showed  to date  no on-target toxicity and no clinical signs of brain swelling or hemorrhages (ARIA)  which are a limiting class side effect of Abeta antibodies. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events in VIVIAD was considerably lower in the completed Phase 2a SAPHIR study at comparable timepoints  while retaining a similar level of target inhibition (around 90%) at the dosing in both studies.In July 2023  Vivoryon presented a poster titled  “VIVIAD  a Phase 2b Study Investigating Varoglutamstat in Patients with MCI or Mild AD: Analysis of Baseline Cognition Data” at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC)  in Amsterdam  the Netherlands. These data demonstrated that Vivoryon’s strategy of precisely recruiting individuals with evidence of at least minimal baseline deficits on the WAIS-IV Coding test  a well-known measure of cognitive function  successfully identifies patients with MCI  enabling a reliable assessment of potential cognitive improvement after treatment.In July 2023  Vivoryon announced a safety update based on data from all 259 randomized patients which showed no clinical signs of varoglutamstat associated ARIA`s at the cutoff date of June 14  2023. After carefully reviewing the updated safety data  the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) decided in its recent meeting on June 22  2023  that the study should continue as planned and that no additional DSMB meeting will be required until study completion.In July 2023  Vivoryon announced that it commenced preparations for an open-label extension (OLE) study to provide a long-term treatment option to patients after completion of treatment under the VIVIAD or VIVA-MIND protocol. The launch of the OLE study is contingent on the outcome of VIVIAD.Vivoryon remains on track to report the final data readout from the VIVIAD study in the first quarter of 2024.VIVA-MINDVIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) is a complementary Phase 2 study for varoglutamstat being conducted in the U.S. which seeks to enroll 180 patients with early AD into the Phase 2a adaptive dose finding portion and to enroll a further 234 patients in the Phase 2b portion of the study.In July 2023  Vivoryon announced that the first cohort was fully randomized into the study as planned and the study is now recruiting participants into the second cohort  with 19 sites open across the U.S. In June 2023  the study’s independent DSMB recommended to continue the study without modification  supporting the rationale for accelerated uptitration to 600 mg BID dosing.The Company intends to provide a study update in the fourth quarter of 2023.Corporate Development HighlightsIn May 2023  Vivoryon announced the successful raise of EUR 25 million in an accelerated bookbuild offering through a private placement of 1 785 715 ordinary shares  with a nominal value of EUR 1.00 each  in the issued share capital of the Company at an issue price of EUR 14.00 per share (such shares the “New Shares”). The New Shares from the capital increase represented approximately 7.4% of Vivoryon’s existing issued share capital and were issued from the Company’s authorized capital under exclusion of the existing shareholders’ pre-emptive rights. Consequently  the Company’s issued share capital increased to EUR 25 890 993.00.In June 2023  Vivoryon announced the appointment of Kugan Sathiyanandarajah and Professor Dr. Morten Asser Karsdal as Non-Executive members to its Board of Directors  strengthening the Board with their extensive scientific knowledge and business acumen. Both appointments were approved during Vivoryon’s Annual General Meeting which took place on June 21  2023. All voting items were passed with a majority.In August 2023  Vivoryon announced that the Board identified long-standing member of Vivoryon’s management team and Chief Medical Officer (CMO)  Frank Weber  MD  as the optimal candidate to assume the responsibilities of CEO  effective August 14  2023. Additionally  the Board proposed a newly created position  Chief Strategy & Investor Relations Officer (CS&IRO)  which was assumed by Head of Investor Relations  Anne Doering  CFA. Vivoryon will hold an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on Friday  September 15  2023  related to their appointments as new members of Vivoryon’s Board of Directors. The appointments follow the decision of Chief Executive Officer (CEO)  Ulrich Dauer  PhD  to step down from his position following his notification to the Board to not renew his contract  previously announced on June 15  2023. Dr. Dauer will support the Company through the transition period in an advisory role through the end of 2023.In August 2023  Vivoryon and Scenic Biotech B.V. (“Scenic”) reached an agreement regarding the settlement of their patent dispute. In 2019  Vivoryon had initiated proceedings on the merits with the District Court of The Hague against Scenic  Stichting Het Nederlands Kanker Instituut-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Ziekenhuis and Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden h.o.d.n LUMC  in connection with certain of Vivoryon´s patents related to varoglutamstat (PQ912) and certain other QPCT inhibitors. As part of the settlement  Scenic’s affiliate  Scenic Immunology B.V.  and Vivoryon have entered into a patent license agreement  under which Scenic Immunology B.V. granted to Vivoryon certain rights to certain patents controlled by Scenic Immunology B.V. in the field of oncology.Financial Results for the First Half Year 2023No revenues were generated in the first half year of 2023 or the first half year of 2022.Research and development expenses of EUR 6.3 million in the six months ended June 30  2023  decreased by EUR 4.8 million compared to the six months ended June 30  2022. This decrease is primarily attributable to EUR 2.5 million lower expenses related to our clinical trial VIVIAD and EUR 2.2 lower manufacturing cost for study drug production.General and administrative expenses of EUR 4.4 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  increased by EUR 2.1 million from EUR 2.3 million in the six months ended June 30  2022. EUR 1.3 million of the increase is attributable to higher costs for the Non-Executive Board members  including share-based payments and compensation of EUR 0.9 million and one-time severance payments of EUR 0.4 million. Furthermore  an increase of EUR 0.8 million was largely due to higher consulting and personnel costs.Net loss of EUR 10.7 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compares to EUR 12.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2022.The Company held EUR 29.6 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30  2023  compared to EUR 26.6 million as of December 31  2022. Additionally  in the six months ended June 30  2023  the Company entered into Euro term deposits of EUR 9.0 million resulting in a reclassification of these funds in the balance sheet into financial assets.Cash flows used in operating activities were EUR 20.3 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to EUR 10.2 million in the six months ended June 30  2022. The change in operating cash flow by EUR (10.0) million mainly results from the reclassification of new term deposits with a term of more than three months of EUR (9.0) million that are disclosed in the Company`s financial assets and not in cash equivalents as well as other changes in working capital.Cash flows provided from financing activities were EUR 23.4 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to EUR 19.6 million in the six months ended June 30  2022. The cash flows from financing mainly result from a private placement on May 26  2023  placing 1 785 715 registered shares at an offering price of EUR 14.00 per share with gross proceeds of EUR 25 million. The Company’s issued share capital has increased to EUR 25 961 892  including the exercise of share options.Financial GuidanceIncluding the proceeds from the capital raise completed in May 2023  according to current planning and estimates  Vivoryon expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its research and development expenses  as well the general and administrative expenses and cash flows from investing and financing activities into the second half of 2024. This guidance does not include potential milestone payments from development partnerships  potential payments from licensing agreements and/or additional financing measures  as exercise of the options granted in connection with the private placement announced September 30  2022 (see note 8.11 of the Company’s annual financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022).Upcoming Investor and Analyst EventsVivoryon will hold an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) Friday  September 15  2023  at 1:00 p.m. (CEST) related to the appointments of Frank Weber  MD  and Anne Doering  CFA  as new members of Vivoryon’s Board of Directors.

The highest dose investigated in the study (600 mg twice daily) was selected by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) as final dose after the dose-escalation portion of the study. Enrollment was completed with a total of 259 participants and the study was adapted in 2022 to enable an average treatment duration of ~82 weeks. The primary endpoint is a composite of the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) focusing on changes in working memory and attention with secondary endpoints including multiple cognitive  safety and biomarker assessments.About VIVA-MINDVIVA-MIND is a complementary Phase 2 study being conducted in the U.S.  coordinated by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA)  part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with a USD 15 million grant (NIA award number R01AG061146). The study seeks to enroll 180 patients into the Phase 2a adaptive dose-finding portion with the Phase 2b portion  enrolling an additional 234 patients treated at the selected dose for at least 72 weeks  with a total of 414 patients being treated on stable doses of varoglutamstat for 18 months. The VIVA-MIND design was adapted in 2022 to enable all 180 patients in the Phase 2a portion to be treated for at least 72 weeks  allowing for the opportunity to progress seamlessly to a potential Phase 3 study. The flexible study design is aimed at increasing the probability of success by broadening option space for adjustments in clinical development based on learnings from VIVIAD and other developments in the field. The primary endpoint for this study is clinical dementia rating scale - sum of boxes (CDR-SB)  an established approvable endpoint measuring a combination of cognitive abilities and activities of daily living. Secondary efficacy endpoints include quantitative EEG theta power  ADAS-Cog 13 and others. Exploratory endpoints include Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)  Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)  quantitative EEG alpha power  relative QPCT activity in CSF and others.About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced financial results for the six-month period ended June 30  2023  and provided an update on its corporate progress. The report is available on the Company's website https://www.vivoryon.com/investors-news/financial-information/“We enter into the second half of 2023 with key milestones achieved and a strong cash position bringing us beyond the VIVIAD Phase 2b study read-out  an exceptionally talented  passionate team  encouraging safety results at 600 mg twice daily in the VIVIAD study of varoglutamstat and a precision recruitment strategy applied to successfully identify the right patients for VIVIAD ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon. “Our achievements from the first half of this year include a successful fundraise significantly extending our cash runway and supportive independent Data Safety Monitoring Board decisions for VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND. We are laser focused on delivering VIVIAD study results in the first quarter of 2024 and monitor study progress as well as blinded safety and efficacy outcome parameters continuously. With varoglutamstat’s favorable safety profile  ease of administration  and strong signs of efficacy and synaptic improvement  we believe we are uniquely positioned to bring a highly differentiated  potentially first-in-class therapeutic option to patients with Alzheimer’s disease.“H1 2023 and Post-Period Portfolio HighlightsVaroglutamstat Clinical Program:Varoglutamstat is a differentiated investigational small-molecule medicine in development to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It is currently being investigated in two large Phase 2 studies  VIVIAD (NCT04498650) in Europe and VIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) in the U.S.  where it continues to show evidence of a favorable safety profile at the therapeutic dose of 600 mg twice daily (BID)  a dose demonstrated to result in a target occupancy of nearly 90%.Varoglutamstat is designed to prevent N3pE-Abeta formation  rather than aiming to clear existing plaques  making it an intervention upstream of other approaches such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Through a second mode of action  varoglutamstat also modulates neuroinflammation via the CCL2 pathway  which  in turn  has an impact on tau pathology.VIVIADVIVIAD (NCT04498650) is a state-of-the-art Phase 2b study being conducted in Europe and designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of varoglutamstat in 259 (final number of randomized participants) subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD.In March 2023  Vivoryon announced an update on the clinical development of varoglutamstat  including the VIVIAD trial  at the International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases and related neurological disorders (AD/PD) in Gothenburg  Sweden. As of the data cut-off date of January 5  2023  over 100 of the 259 participants randomized into the VIVIAD study had been treated for at least 48 weeks. Varoglutamstat showed  to date  no on-target toxicity and no clinical signs of brain swelling or hemorrhages (ARIA)  which are a limiting class side effect of Abeta antibodies. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events in VIVIAD was considerably lower in the completed Phase 2a SAPHIR study at comparable timepoints  while retaining a similar level of target inhibition (around 90%) at the dosing in both studies.In July 2023  Vivoryon presented a poster titled  “VIVIAD  a Phase 2b Study Investigating Varoglutamstat in Patients with MCI or Mild AD: Analysis of Baseline Cognition Data” at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC)  in Amsterdam  the Netherlands. These data demonstrated that Vivoryon’s strategy of precisely recruiting individuals with evidence of at least minimal baseline deficits on the WAIS-IV Coding test  a well-known measure of cognitive function  successfully identifies patients with MCI  enabling a reliable assessment of potential cognitive improvement after treatment.In July 2023  Vivoryon announced a safety update based on data from all 259 randomized patients which showed no clinical signs of varoglutamstat associated ARIA`s at the cutoff date of June 14  2023. After carefully reviewing the updated safety data  the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) decided in its recent meeting on June 22  2023  that the study should continue as planned and that no additional DSMB meeting will be required until study completion.In July 2023  Vivoryon announced that it commenced preparations for an open-label extension (OLE) study to provide a long-term treatment option to patients after completion of treatment under the VIVIAD or VIVA-MIND protocol. The launch of the OLE study is contingent on the outcome of VIVIAD.Vivoryon remains on track to report the final data readout from the VIVIAD study in the first quarter of 2024.VIVA-MINDVIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) is a complementary Phase 2 study for varoglutamstat being conducted in the U.S. which seeks to enroll 180 patients with early AD into the Phase 2a adaptive dose finding portion and to enroll a further 234 patients in the Phase 2b portion of the study.In July 2023  Vivoryon announced that the first cohort was fully randomized into the study as planned and the study is now recruiting participants into the second cohort  with 19 sites open across the U.S. In June 2023  the study’s independent DSMB recommended to continue the study without modification  supporting the rationale for accelerated uptitration to 600 mg BID dosing.The Company intends to provide a study update in the fourth quarter of 2023.Corporate Development HighlightsIn May 2023  Vivoryon announced the successful raise of EUR 25 million in an accelerated bookbuild offering through a private placement of 1 785 715 ordinary shares  with a nominal value of EUR 1.00 each  in the issued share capital of the Company at an issue price of EUR 14.00 per share (such shares the “New Shares”). The New Shares from the capital increase represented approximately 7.4% of Vivoryon’s existing issued share capital and were issued from the Company’s authorized capital under exclusion of the existing shareholders’ pre-emptive rights. Consequently  the Company’s issued share capital increased to EUR 25 890 993.00.In June 2023  Vivoryon announced the appointment of Kugan Sathiyanandarajah and Professor Dr. Morten Asser Karsdal as Non-Executive members to its Board of Directors  strengthening the Board with their extensive scientific knowledge and business acumen. Both appointments were approved during Vivoryon’s Annual General Meeting which took place on June 21  2023. All voting items were passed with a majority.In August 2023  Vivoryon announced that the Board identified long-standing member of Vivoryon’s management team and Chief Medical Officer (CMO)  Frank Weber  MD  as the optimal candidate to assume the responsibilities of CEO  effective August 14  2023. Additionally  the Board proposed a newly created position  Chief Strategy & Investor Relations Officer (CS&IRO)  which was assumed by Head of Investor Relations  Anne Doering  CFA. Vivoryon will hold an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on Friday  September 15  2023  related to their appointments as new members of Vivoryon’s Board of Directors. The appointments follow the decision of Chief Executive Officer (CEO)  Ulrich Dauer  PhD  to step down from his position following his notification to the Board to not renew his contract  previously announced on June 15  2023. Dr. Dauer will support the Company through the transition period in an advisory role through the end of 2023.In August 2023  Vivoryon and Scenic Biotech B.V. (“Scenic”) reached an agreement regarding the settlement of their patent dispute. In 2019  Vivoryon had initiated proceedings on the merits with the District Court of The Hague against Scenic  Stichting Het Nederlands Kanker Instituut-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Ziekenhuis and Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden h.o.d.n LUMC  in connection with certain of Vivoryon´s patents related to varoglutamstat (PQ912) and certain other QPCT inhibitors. As part of the settlement  Scenic’s affiliate  Scenic Immunology B.V.  and Vivoryon have entered into a patent license agreement  under which Scenic Immunology B.V. granted to Vivoryon certain rights to certain patents controlled by Scenic Immunology B.V. in the field of oncology.Financial Results for the First Half Year 2023No revenues were generated in the first half year of 2023 or the first half year of 2022.Research and development expenses of EUR 6.3 million in the six months ended June 30  2023  decreased by EUR 4.8 million compared to the six months ended June 30  2022. This decrease is primarily attributable to EUR 2.5 million lower expenses related to our clinical trial VIVIAD and EUR 2.2 lower manufacturing cost for study drug production.General and administrative expenses of EUR 4.4 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  increased by EUR 2.1 million from EUR 2.3 million in the six months ended June 30  2022. EUR 1.3 million of the increase is attributable to higher costs for the Non-Executive Board members  including share-based payments and compensation of EUR 0.9 million and one-time severance payments of EUR 0.4 million. Furthermore  an increase of EUR 0.8 million was largely due to higher consulting and personnel costs.Net loss of EUR 10.7 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compares to EUR 12.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2022.The Company held EUR 29.6 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30  2023  compared to EUR 26.6 million as of December 31  2022. Additionally  in the six months ended June 30  2023  the Company entered into Euro term deposits of EUR 9.0 million resulting in a reclassification of these funds in the balance sheet into financial assets.Cash flows used in operating activities were EUR 20.3 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to EUR 10.2 million in the six months ended June 30  2022. The change in operating cash flow by EUR (10.0) million mainly results from the reclassification of new term deposits with a term of more than three months of EUR (9.0) million that are disclosed in the Company`s financial assets and not in cash equivalents as well as other changes in working capital.Cash flows provided from financing activities were EUR 23.4 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  compared to EUR 19.6 million in the six months ended June 30  2022. The cash flows from financing mainly result from a private placement on May 26  2023  placing 1 785 715 registered shares at an offering price of EUR 14.00 per share with gross proceeds of EUR 25 million. The Company’s issued share capital has increased to EUR 25 961 892  including the exercise of share options.Financial GuidanceIncluding the proceeds from the capital raise completed in May 2023  according to current planning and estimates  Vivoryon expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its research and development expenses  as well the general and administrative expenses and cash flows from investing and financing activities into the second half of 2024. This guidance does not include potential milestone payments from development partnerships  potential payments from licensing agreements and/or additional financing measures  as exercise of the options granted in connection with the private placement announced September 30  2022 (see note 8.11 of the Company’s annual financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022).Upcoming Investor and Analyst EventsVivoryon will hold an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) Friday  September 15  2023  at 1:00 p.m. (CEST) related to the appointments of Frank Weber  MD  and Anne Doering  CFA  as new members of Vivoryon’s Board of Directors.

The highest dose investigated in the study (600 mg twice daily) was selected by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) as final dose after the dose-escalation portion of the study. Enrollment was completed with a total of 259 participants and the study was adapted in 2022 to enable an average treatment duration of ~82 weeks. The primary endpoint is a composite of the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) focusing on changes in working memory and attention with secondary endpoints including multiple cognitive  safety and biomarker assessments.About VIVA-MINDVIVA-MIND is a complementary Phase 2 study being conducted in the U.S.  coordinated by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA)  part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with a USD 15 million grant (NIA award number R01AG061146). The study seeks to enroll 180 patients into the Phase 2a adaptive dose-finding portion with the Phase 2b portion  enrolling an additional 234 patients treated at the selected dose for at least 72 weeks  with a total of 414 patients being treated on stable doses of varoglutamstat for 18 months. The VIVA-MIND design was adapted in 2022 to enable all 180 patients in the Phase 2a portion to be treated for at least 72 weeks  allowing for the opportunity to progress seamlessly to a potential Phase 3 study. The flexible study design is aimed at increasing the probability of success by broadening option space for adjustments in clinical development based on learnings from VIVIAD and other developments in the field. The primary endpoint for this study is clinical dementia rating scale - sum of boxes (CDR-SB)  an established approvable endpoint measuring a combination of cognitive abilities and activities of daily living. Secondary efficacy endpoints include quantitative EEG theta power  ADAS-Cog 13 and others. Exploratory endpoints include Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)  Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)  quantitative EEG alpha power  relative QPCT activity in CSF and others.About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines.
