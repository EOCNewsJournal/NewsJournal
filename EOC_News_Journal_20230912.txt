But rising crude prices are a “prominent risk ” he added.He sees India’s benchmark 10-year yield climbing to 7.25% to 7.35% if oil prices jump to $92 to $95 per barrel. The benchmark yield climbed three basis points to 7.23% on Monday.Brent crude’s surge above $90 a barrel last week due to extended OPEC+ supply cuts is threatening to fan inflation in India  which is a net importer of energy. That’s after the nation moved to ease food prices by curbing exports of rice and sugar  and imposed taxes on onion shipments after those prices pushed inflation to a 15-month high in July.“I am not too worried about food or the headline inflation as government policies would get the food inflation lower ” Shah said. “I’m more worried about crude oil.”The Reserve Bank of India left its key interest rate unchanged for a third straight meeting in August. However  Governor Shaktikanta Das said last week the central bank will remain on guard on the second round effects of inflation. Even Bank of Korea has signaled it’s open to further rate hikes  and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas indicated it would be ready to adjust monetary policy to prevent a further broadening of inflation.“If oil stays around $95 per barrel  it would make sense to cut some duration ” said Puneet Pal  head of fixed income at PGIM India Mutual Fund. “If crude goes above $90 to $95 per barrel and stays there  it can add to the higher for longer rate theme.” He sees 10-year yields heading to as high as 7.40% if oil touches the upper end of that range.Story continuesInflation data due Tuesday is likely to be watched closely  with CPI inflation seen slowing to 7.1% in August  according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.Markets are also monitoring other factors like any news on India’s bond index inclusion  the impact of monsoon rains on inflation and the trajectory of US yields to determine where bond yields are headed  according to Suyash Choudhary  head of fixed income at Bandhan Mutual Fund. He expects yields to stay rangebound and is overweight on three-to-six-year maturities.India’s 10-year yield slumped as much as six basis points on Thursday as a report on the RBI seeking feedback from banks for settling rupee notes via Euroclear strengthened hopes that the nation’s bonds will be included in global indexes. The yield pared the move as traders waited for more concrete steps from the central bank.“There is no real chance of inclusion in global bond indices as we are not open to removing investment limits for foreign portfolio investors and are not allowing bond settlements on Euroclear ” said Sandeep Bagla  chief executive officer at Trust Mutual Fund.“Given that the inflation expectations are in the range of 5.25% to 5.50%  the 10-year yield should ideally trade closer to 7.50%. Higher oil prices could act as a catalyst for bond yields to trend higher ” Bagla said.--With assistance from Marcus Wong.(Updates with bond prices in third para and inflation estimate in 8th.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2023 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.16,0.83,0.02,negative,0.02,0.15,0.83,True,English,"['India Bond Optimism', 'Oil Prices', 'Investors', 'smaller government debt issuance size', 'Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas', 'Axis Mutual Fund Co.', 'extended OPEC+ supply cuts', 'PGIM India Mutual Fund', 'Bandhan Mutual Fund', 'Trust Mutual Fund', 'Governor Shaktikanta Das', 'chief executive officer', 'key interest rate', 'longer rate theme', 'third straight meeting', 'second round effects', 'The Reserve Bank', 'foreign portfolio investors', 'global bond indices', 'Indian sovereign bonds', 'Bloomberg L.P.', 'rising crude prices', 'bond index inclusion', 'Higher oil prices', 'debt supply', 'benchmark 10-year yield', 'government policies', 'rate hikes', 'bond prices', 'second half', 'global indexes', 'third para', 'bond settlements', 'central bank', 'Even Bank', 'Brent crude', 'bond yields', '10-year yields', 'fixed income', 'latter half', 'prominent risk', 'net importer', 'onion shipments', 'crude oil', 'monetary policy', 'Puneet Pal', 'upper end', 'other factors', 'monsoon rains', 'Suyash Choudhary', 'six-year maturities', 'six basis', 'rupee notes', 'concrete steps', 'real chance', 'investment limits', 'Marcus Wong.', 'food prices', 'US yields', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'inflation concerns', 'headline inflation', 'Inflation data', 'CPI inflation', 'inflation expectations', 'inflation estimate', 'Devang Shah', 'fiscal year', 'three basis', 'Sandeep Bagla', 'food inflation', 'barrel', 'Monday', 'surge', 'energy', 'nation', 'exports', 'sugar', 'taxes', 'July', 'August', 'guard', 'Korea', 'broadening', 'sense', 'duration', 'range', 'Story', 'economists', 'Markets', 'news', 'impact', 'trajectory', 'Thursday', 'report', 'RBI', 'feedback', 'banks', 'Euroclear', 'hopes', 'move', 'traders', 'catalyst', 'assistance', 'Updates', '8th']",2023-09-11,2023-09-12,finance.yahoo.com

However  value investors will care about much more than just this.,Investors interested in stocks from the Securities and Exchanges sector have probably already heard of Deutsche Boerse AG (DBOEY) and CBOE Global (CBOE). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Deutsche Boerse AG has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy)  while CBOE Global has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that DBOEY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than CBOE has recently. However  value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio  P/S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.DBOEY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.43  while CBOE has a forward P/E of 21.24. We also note that DBOEY has a PEG ratio of 1.43. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. CBOE currently has a PEG ratio of 3.25.Another notable valuation metric for DBOEY is its P/B ratio of 3.50. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison  CBOE has a P/B of 4.45.Story continuesThese metrics  and several others  help DBOEY earn a Value grade of B  while CBOE has been given a Value grade of F.DBOEY sticks out from CBOE in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that DBOEY is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Although 5 MW are currently under construction for third-party clients  few milestones were reached over the period  making it possible to generate a portion of revenue  recorded using the project progress method.Concerning business on behalf of third parties  the first half of 2023 was characterized by new operational advances:Start of construction on a hygienization unit  combined with a biomass boiler for a methanation biomass production site operated by a group including a municipality and 15 farms in Normandy [2] :[2] Start of construction on a biomass boiler combined with a heating network  on behalf of a large-scale poultry farm in the Sarthe region 2 ;Start of construction following the April signing of the order 2   for a biomass boiler on behalf of a large-scale poultry farm in Mayenne;Other major projects are in the advanced discussion stage and should be announced soon.To date  the Group has recorded secured orders [3] on behalf of third parties totalling €3.7 million  deliverable and billable over 2023 and 2024. Furthermore  business is characterized by a pipeline that is still solid[4]  reflecting the steady sales dynamic.Concerning business on its own behalf  the initial business plan continues with 5 plants under development as of June 30  2023.Once those plants under development are commissioned and fully operational  they will allow to generate ARR[5]  derived from energy sales  of nearly €7.7M.Furthermore  to date  17 other plant projects are under discussion  representing a potential ARR of €58 million.Confirmation of 2027 ambitionsBenefitting from favorable structural and contextual factors  which represent powerful accelerators for its development in France but also internationally  Charwood Energy confirms its 2027 ambitions  namely:€100 million in revenue  60% of which derived from business on its own behalf;50 plants owned outright under operation and under construction  representing an estimated ARR of approximately €90 million.Next publication: 2023 semi-annual results  scheduled for October 23  2023  after market close.About Charwood EnergyConvinced that biomass is a key response to the challenges of the energy transition  Charwood Energy designs  installs and maintains tailored solutions for the production of biomass renewable energy.Charwood Energy has a wealth of technical know-how and expertise in all biomass recovery technologies - heating and heating networks  methanisation and pyrogasification.Positioned since 2019 in the promising area of pyrogasification technology  Charwood Energy is now also involved in the development and operation of proprietary pyrogasification units aiming to produce and sell green gas (syngaz)  biochar and carbon credits to industrial customers under direct purchasing contracts.The company is listed on Euronext Growth® Paris (ISIN: FR001400AJ60  ticker: ALCWE) - Eligible for PEA PME equity savings plans - Certified as an ""Innovative Company"" by bpifrance.For more information  visit https://charwood.energy/investisseurs/Contacts",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.46,0.29,0.25,True,English,"['Charwood Energy', 'H1 2023 revenue', '11', '48', 'PEA PME equity savings plans', 'custom biomass energy recovery solutions', 'methanation biomass production site', 'biomass recovery technologies', 'steady sale dynamic', 'project progress method', 'new operational advances', 'large-scale poultry farm', 'Other major projects', '17 other plant projects', 'direct purchasing contracts', 'Euronext Growth® Paris', 'current sales dynamic', 'steady sales dynamic', 'advanced discussion stage', 'proprietary pyrogasification units', 'initial business plan', 'mid-year revenue figure', 'solid business volume', 'custom solutions', 'tailored solutions', 'energy sales', 'biomass boiler', 'energy transition', 'renewable energy', 'Press release', 'ISIN code', 'third parties', 'installation services', 'external clients', 'industrial operations', 'third-party clients', 'first half', 'hygienization unit', 'Sarthe region', 'April signing', 'favorable structural', 'contextual factors', 'powerful accelerators', 'Next publication', '2023 semi-annual results', 'key response', 'technical know-how', 'promising area', 'pyrogasification technology', 'green gas', 'carbon credits', 'industrial customers', 'Charwood Energy', 'French company', 'heating network', 'Innovative Company', 'potential ARR', 'H1 2023 revenue', 'Saint-Nolff', 'September', 'ticker', 'ALCWE', 'behalf', 'design', 'construction', 'agricultural', 'communities', 'period', '5 MW', 'milestones', 'portion', 'Start', 'group', 'municipality', '15 farms', 'Normandy', 'order', 'Mayenne', 'date', 'pipeline', '5 plants', 'development', 'June', 'Confirmation', '2027 ambitions', 'France', '50 plants', 'October', 'market', 'challenges', 'wealth', 'expertise', 'methanisation', 'syngaz', 'biochar', 'information', 'investisseurs', 'Contacts']",2023-09-11,2023-09-12,marketscreener.com

capital's old town.Thanks to the new ""Belgian Beer World""  they did not go thirsty.Belgian beer culture is listed by UNESCO as part of the ""Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity"".It is a source of pride for many locals and a big draw for tourists from around the world.But  even though beer is ubiquitous here  the Brussels scene lacked a focal point for visitors or -- if you're a jaded glass-half-full drinker -- a promotional vehicle for Belgium's vast global booze industry.Traders moved out of the 1868 neo-classical Palace de la Bourse or Beurspaleis in 2014  and the Belgian exchange has now merged with former competitors in Paris and Amsterdam to form Euronext.So  when the city refurbished the historic building  the brewers were on hand to stand their round and sponsor a fitting modern beer museum and roof top bar for their star export.Trappist monksOn Saturday  when the refurbished Bourse reopened to the public  11 000 people passed through to see the trading hall  and 566 -- including a tourist from as far away as Singapore -- stopped by Beer World.""A lot of interesting interactions  features that involve the participants  all the visitors "" said the tourist  who gave his name as Su.""I believe that all the beer drinkers  if they wish to have a good understanding about the whole process  about the history of the beer  it's definitely a place for them to visit.""Opening the centre this week  Brussels mayor Philippe Close acknowledged that  beyond the culture of beer  the museum is ""a way to support a huge economic sector.""Belgium has at least 430 brewers  from mighty AB Inbev -- which pours a third of the planet's pints -- to tiny Trappist monasteries that sells one eagerly sought-after batch of ale per year to patient punters on a waiting list.Beer tourists can study the draft of brewing through interactive displays and exhibits of historical techniques at Belgium's new beer museum © JOHN THYS / AFPThe rade federation  Belgian Brewers  estimates that its members employ 6 900 people directly and support 50 000 more jobs in a country of only 11.5 million.Some 70 percent of Belgian beer is exported  not just to neighbours in Europe's beer-drinking north  but around the world.Tickets for the Beer World are a hefty 17 euros -- but it does get you your first drink in the rooftop bar -- with its vast selection drawn from the 1 600 types of beer the country has to offer.Belgian brewers are not as conservative as their German and Dutch neighbours.The sour  bubbly lambic and gueuze styles -- ""Brussels Champagne"" -- are Belgium's own  but many beers including the big brands like Jupiler or Stella Artois are based on the Czech and German Pilsner style.There are even Scotch ales in thistle-shaped glasses  allegedly introduced to entertain General Montgomery's British Second Army when it arrived in September 1944.And of course younger small-scale brewers have begun making hoppy Belgian pale ales to rival the best of the US craft beer explosion.Great complexityBeer World administrator Charles Leclef -- a 30-year veteran Flemish brewery operator -- told AFP that the city wanted to capture the ""playful"" side of the everyday tipple  not to incite heavy drinking.Racks of beers have replaced the trading floor the Palais de la Bourse in Brussels  the former Belgian stock exchange © JOHN THYS / AFP""We're not the

virtual fermentation tank  with immersive screens taking them inside the process of turning hops  malt  yeast and water into national pride.In Germany  the law forbids any but these four ingredients  but Belgian brewmasters are free to experiment with spices and infusions and even fruits like cherry or raspberry.Museum visitors can pull taps to signal their favourite flavours and ""virtual

In addition  we finalized the Digital Shelf System (DSS) program  an innovation which allowed us to enter into a historical contract with Walmart. We also experienced positive cash flow and improvements in our operating performance.As previously announced  the strong growth delivered in H1 2023 drove significant improvement in our financial results. Economic performance improved across all ESL and VAS[1] business lines and ESL margins increased  thanks to the already perceived trend towards normalized electronic components and manufacturing costs at the end of last year. The improvement in the mix of VAS activities also contributed to our margin improvement. During the first half of the year  we also strengthened our portfolio of VAS solutions with the acquisitions of Belive and Memory  two companies providing cutting edge solutions in data analytics and AI.Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment  we note with satisfaction that many retailers in the world continue to invest in the digital transformation of their main assets: physical stores. Innovation at the service of this transformation is the engine of our growth.For the second half of the year  we anticipate ongoing strong growth in line with our objective of achieving full-year revenue of €800m and continued improvement in our profitability.”Strong revenue growthTotal revenue in H1 2023 grew +33% versus the previous year  for a total of €380m  in line with the annual target. Order entries during the first half of the year grew +35% versus H1 2022 to €518m  driven notably by wins in the United States.This performance was achieved despite a challenging environment for retailers  with high inflation  lower consumption in volume terms  and strong downward pressure on margins.Sales momentum by regionRevenue in the EMEA region (Europe  Middle East  Africa) reached €318m  representing strong growth of +44% versus H1 2022. The first half of the year saw the continuation of large deployments in Europe  as well as the recent signing of several large contracts.Top line in the Americas and Asia-Pacific region totaled €63m in the first half of the year  a slight decrease versus the period one year ago  but still delivering strong growth of +27% on a like-for-like basis.[2] This growth was fueled principally by North America  where the company registered a number of successes in the first half of the year  including a large contract with Walmart  and several new deployment contracts across food retail  non-food retail and convenience store chains.Software  Services and Non-ESL Solutions (VAS)In H1 2023  VAS revenue totaled €53m  a +18% growth rate compared to H1 2022  and equivalent to 14% of the company's total revenue for the period.Within the context of the challenging macroeconomic environment  some retailers slowed down or postponed implementing new projects thus resulting in slower VAS sales growth.Nevertheless  the recurring portion of VAS sales – although still a small proportion of total VAS top-line -- has continued to grow strongly  thus improving the average profitability of the VAS offer.Strong profitability growthIn €m H1 2023 H1 2022 % Change Sales 380.7 285.9 +33% Variable Cost Margin (VCM) 92.2 61.1 +51% % of sales 24.2% 21.4% +2.8pts Operating expenses (48.7) (35.7) +36% % of sales -12.8% -12.5% +0.3pts EBITDA 43.5 25.3 +72% % of sales 11.4% 8.9% +2.5pts Depreciation and amortization (15.5) (13.0) +19% Non-recurring or non-cash items (5.3) (3.9) +35% Operating income 22.7 8.4 +171% % of sales 6.0% 2.9% +3.1pts Net financial income / expense (0.5) (1.1) -54% Tax (7.1) (2.4) +193% Economic net income[3] 15.1 4.9 +209% % of sales 4.0% 1.7% +2.3pts Fair value revaluation of warrants 76.4 Net income 91.5 4.9 +1 771% % of sales 24.0% 1.7% +22.3ptsAudit procedures currently being finalizedThe variable cost margin (VCM) was the main driver of profitability growth. VCM totaled €92.2m in H1 2023  compared to €61.1m in H1 2022  or +51% growth and a margin rate of 24.2% compared to 21.4% in H1 2022 (+2.8 points).This improvement in the VCM ratio was driven primarily by:ESL margin improvement  resulting from a normalized electronic component cost environment following two years of increases related to the COVID pandemic  optimized procurement  and higher volumes. This momentum should continue into the second half of 2023.The margin on VAS business lines has also improved due to a more favorable mix driven by higher growth of subscription services and other recurring revenue streams.The growth in the VCM rate should continue through the coming semesters and will be the main driver of the improvement in the EBITDA margin.Operating expenses increased from 12.5% of revenue in H1 2022 to 12.8% in H1 2023.This slight growth in the operating expense ratio is due to the acquisition of the companies Memory and Belive which were completed during the first half of 2023. The revenue models of the acquired companies are typical of software companies  with higher margins and higher operating expenses. However  these acquisitions are accretive to SES-imagotag's EBITDA margin.Excluding the impact of these acquisitions  the operating expense ratio continued to improve and totaled 11.7%  or a -0.8 point reduction compared to H1 2022.EBITDA totaled €43.5m in H1 2023  compared to €25.3m in the first half of 2022.The EBITDA margin grew to 11.4% in H1 2023  compared to 8.9% in H1 2022  or an increase of +2.5 points over the 12-month period. This improvement  in both absolute and percentage terms  is due primarily to the improvement in the VCM ratio  which in turn was driven by margin improvement in both the ESL and VAS business lines.Depreciation and amortization expense increased by +19% between H1 2022 and H1 2023  from -€13.0m to -€15.5m. This increase reflects the significantly higher level of R&D and innovation investment (Cloud  Engage  Captana  IoT  new color e-Paper range)  industrial projects  IT and process digitalization (Salesforce  Microsoft)  and performance improvement (SAP project).Non-recurring and non-cash items totaled -€5.3m in H1 2023  made up of the cost of the employee performance share plans (IFRS 2) totaling -€4.4m (with no cash impact) and the expenses related to the acquisition of Belive and Memory for a total of -€0.9m.Operating incomeThe Operating Income (EBIT) totaled €22.7m in H1 2023 vs. €8.4m in H1 2022 an increase of +171%Net financial expenseThe net financial expense in H1 2023 was -€0.5m  compared to a net financial expense of -€1.1m in the first half of 2022. It was accounted for mainly by:- debt-related financial expense of -€4.6m;- net impact of exchange gains and losses totaling +€4.7m; and- IFRS 16 restatement of -€0.1m.Pre-tax income totaled +€22.2m in H1 2023  compared to +€7.3m in H1 2022. The tax charge in H1 2023 was -€7.1m compared to a charge of -€2.4m during the first six months of 2022.Economic net incomeEconomic net income (net income excluding the impact of the Walmart warrants) in H1 2023 is a positive €15.1m  of which -€0.1m is allocated to minority interests  compared to a net profit of €4.9m in H1 2022.Impact of the fair value revaluation of warrantsOn June 2  2023  the Shareholders' Meeting approved the grant of 1 761 200 stock warrants to Walmart. Under IFRS standards the fair value of such warrants must be assessed. The fair value was calculated and estimated at a total of €163m as of June 2  2023. A contract asset and a financial debt totaling this amount were booked in the consolidated financial statements. The contract asset will not be revalued and will be amortized on a prorated basis  in line with the revenues generated by Walmart during the roll-out phase of the Vusion platform in the Walmart stores. The financial debt will be revalued at every closing of accounts  based notably  on the number of warrants still to be vested and the share price of SES-imagotag. Any change in the valuation of the warrants to be vested will impact the financial income in the consolidated financial statements. As of June 30  2023  the share price of SES-imagotag decreased vs. June 2  2023 which also decreased the fair value of the warrants granted to Walmart. The new valuation generated €76m of financial income which was booked in SES-imagotag's consolidated financial statements. The Group will disclose the impact of such IFRS restatements on the revenues and the net income at every closing.Net incomeNet income is a positive €91.5m of which -€0.1m is allocated to minority interests compared to net profit of €4.9m in H1 2022.Strong cash flow improvement  in spite of strategic investments in R&D and external growthIn H1 2023  SES-imagotag generated positive free cash flow of €34.5m  compared to a net cash burn of €13.7m in H1 2022.This positive free cash flow generation primarily reflects improvements in profitability and working capital  which should continue into the second half of the year driven by:Growth in the company's EBITDA before IFRS16 which increased by €17.8m (+73%) from €24.2m in H1 2022 to €42.0m in H1 2023;The optimization of operating working capital (accounts receivable  inventory  supplier debt) which decreased by almost €10m between year-end 2022 and June 30  2023  despite the strong growth in operating activity. This improvement was driven primarily by the optimization of inventory levels (-€5m between year-end 2022 and June 30  2023) and customer receivables that represented 47 days of revenue compared to 60 days of revenue at year-end 2022.Consolidated cash-flow statementIn €m H1 2023 H1 2022 EBITDA (before IFRS16) 42.0 24.2 Capex (48.0) (15.8) R&D 39.6 9.0 Of which Digital Shelf System (DSS) 31.9 3.3 IT 5.3 3.8 Industrial 1.6 1.4 Other 1.6 1.7 Change in Working Capital 128.8 (21.6) Operational Cash-Flow 122.7 (13.2) Net financial expense (1.1) (0.8) Tax (0.9) (0.3) Others 0.6 2.4 Financial Investments (91.5) (1.7) Impact of the changes in consolidation scope 4.7 FY 2022 Change in Net Debt (before IFRS16 and IFRS9) 34.5 (13.7) (48.8) Net Cash / (Debt) before IFRS16 and IFRS9 (6.0) (5.4) (40.5) Cash 193.4 75.7 33.9 Debt (before impact of IFRS16 and IFRS9) (199.4) (81.1) (74.4)During the first half of the year  SES-imagotag made several strategic investments:The acquisitions of Memory and Belive have been valued on an EBITDA multiple that is lower than SES-imagotag's  for close to €90m.R&D and industrial investments grew as compared to H1 2022  marking the final development phase of the latest generation Digital Shelf System (DSS)  including large-scale operating tests of prototypes and pilot manufacturing lines. It is this revolutionary platform -- in terms of materials (hardware)  software and radio – that led to the signing of the large ESL roll-out contract with Walmart in the US in H1 2023  and that should strengthen SES-imagotag's competitiveness and capacity for profitable growth in the years to come. The intensive investment phase of this program has been finalized.IT investments enabled the extension of SAP coverage to a larger number of affiliates and also focused on cybersecurity. Concerning the latter  SES-imagotag received ISO 27001 certification in H1 2023.Investment totaled €48.0m in H1 2023  compared to €15.8m in H1 2022. As the DSS program winds down  investments will decrease sharply in H2 2023 to end the year at around 8% to 9% of revenue and are expected to decrease to a target range of 5% to 7% of revenue from 2024 onwards.In addition to the structural improvement in working capital  SES-imagotag has benefited from growth in client down payments  in line with the high level of order entries which totaled €0.5 bn in H1 2023.Excluding the H1 2023 extraordinary and non-recurring items discussed (Walmart down payment  the acquisition of Belive and Memory  and investments in the DSS program) SES-imagotag generated free cash flow of €20m in the first half of the year.Improved capital structureAt the end of June  the company had cash of €193m.Financial debt (before IFRS 16 and IFRS 9) totaled €199m  for net financial debt of €6m and a net debt/12-month EBITDA ratio of 0.1x  compared to 0.7x at year-end 2022.OutlookFor the second half of 2023  SES-imagotag anticipates revenue in line with the annual target of €800m  with a strong Q4 both in terms of sales and order entries  as well as continued profitability growth driven by ongoing improvements in manufacturing costs.For 2024  the company anticipates ongoing strong growth  driven in particular by an acceleration of sales in the United States  and growing profitability.About SES-imagotag and the VUSION Retail IoT platformSES-imagotag is a world leader in smart digital labels and IoT solutions for physical retail  serving over 350 large retailer groups around the world in Europe  Asia and North America.SES-imagotag has developed the VUSION Retail IOT technology platform to help retailers transform their physical stores into high value digital assets  more automated  data-driven  and connected in real-time to suppliers and consumers.

It also represents a good approximation of the cash flow generated by operating activities before taking into account investments and changes in working capital. Consequently  restatements include significant non-recurring items or items that will never lead to a cash disbursement.Net Financial Debt / Net CashThese indicators define  respectively  the Group's net financial debt or net cash position  calculated based on the following consolidated balance sheet items: (-) Loans (-) Current and non-current lease liabilities (IFRS16) (+) Cash and cash equivalents.If the result is negative  the level of Loans exceeds the level of Cash and Cash equivalents  and is therefore considered net debt or net financial debt. If  however  the result is positive  then the level of Loans is lower than the level of Cash and Cash equivalents and is considered Net Cash.Change in Net Financial Debt / Net CashIt is the change between the Net Financial Debt / Net Cash between 2 periods.

The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. =---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Press release 2CRSi signed a contract to deploy Cloud Edge solutions in India Strasbourg (France)  12 September 2023 - 2CRSi (ISIN: FR0013341781)  designer and manufacturer of high-performance energy-efficient IT servers  announces its collaboration with a subsidiary of the Indian conglomerate Larsen & Toubro  for the deployment of 2CRSi AtlantisT 1SR servers and VRunaT ""Edge Datacenters"". Following the signing of a technology and commercial agreement between 2CRSi and Larsen & Toubro  two sites in India will host a micro-computing centre  also known as an ""Edge Datacenter"". These sites will host AtlantisT 1SR servers  equipped with the latest 4th generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors. This French-origin computer infrastructure solution stands out for its ability to provide exceptional performance even in challenging environments  such as those characterized by high humidity  high temperatures  and significant dust presence. Furthermore  it reduces the ecological footprint by over 45%! These first two sites are part of the development of ""Edge Cloud "" an approach aimed at deploying servers near data sources  reducing response times compared to traditional Cloud solutions. By bringing computing capabilities closer to these locations  Edge Computing enables users to enjoy faster and more reliable services while facilitating the use and distribution of shared resources across multiple sites. The VRunaT solution  which will be installed in India  has been specially designed to meet the most demanding operational standards. It is capable of withstanding significant water rises  such as those occurring during the monsoon season  and can be completely submerged by ""greywater"" while resisting pressures of over 120 bars. Moreover  it is also entirely dustproof and operates autonomously without the need for additional thermal dissipation systems. The validation phase of these first two sites is expected to lead to a joint proposal from ""L&T + 2CRSi"" for an Indian telecom operator that aims to deploy 1200 Edge Datacenters. This deployment intends to accelerate the roll out of services that require server proximity to reduce network latency.

Photo: Jason Clarke PhotographyThe incoming chief financial officer (CFO) of Smurfit WestRock  if the packing mega-merger goes ahead  has downplayed the implications of a sharp drop in the acquirer’s shareprice after terms of the deal were announced.The Irish shares fell after detailed terms of a proposed merger with US packaging giant WestRock were announced.Ken Bowles  Smurfit Kappa’s chief financial officer  said the share price drop of as much as 9pc was a “normal” reaction reflecting a number of factors  including hedge fund positions and some shareholders selling off shares due to the proposed US re-listing.“I think what we’ll find  over time  is it will settle back down and come back a bit. There is no sense of whether this is a reaction – positive or negative – to the deal. I think it is a normal kind of market-based reaction that you would generally see in large-scale acquisitions and mergers like this ” he said.“Clearly there are a few moving parts to it ” Mr Bowles told the Irish Independent over the phone.While that US listing looks like another blow to the Irish stock market  Smurfit Kappa is and will remain “a proud Irish company”  he said.Read more Smurfit Kappa confirms merger with US firm WestRockThe merged business – to be known as Smurfit WestRock – will be incorporated and tax resident in Ireland  with global headquarters in Dublin.However  its stock market listing will be in the US  the latest in a slew of big names exiting Euronext Dublin  the former Irish Stock Exchange.“The (listing) move to the US is more around a company this scale and size being in the most liquid and deep capital markets in the world  and equally it’s where our peer set is in terms of paper and packaging. So it’s a more logical home for the Smurfit WestRock assets than any European exchange.“The reality is that Smurfit Kappa is a proud Irish company and we remain a proud Irish company  and so the headquarters and the global headquarters and the domicile being in Ireland is very much important in this transaction.”Smurfit Kappa’s Irish leadership  led by third generation CEO Tony Smurfit and MrBowes himself  will take the helm of the soon-to-be-merged group and it will be chaired by the current Smurfit Kappa chair.If the deal comes off  the merged business will be a packaging giant that had combined revenues for the last 12 months of $34bn (€31.7bn)  while combined adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation were $5.5bn (€5.13bn).Smurfit WestRock will seek a primary listing in New York and retain a secondary listing in London.Smurfit shares fell more than 9pc in UK trading after the merger announcement yesterday morning.The merger is slated to create “the largest listed global packaging partner by revenue”  the two companies said  with a global staff of around 100 000.Mr Bowles said the transaction – which will see Smurfit Kappa shareholders owning 50.4pc of the new company and WestRock shareholders taking 49.6pc – reflected the “natural mechanics of the exchange rate” and share counts of both companies.Under the deal  WestRock shareholders will get one new share of Smurfit WestRock and $5 in cash for each share they currently have  which Mr Bowles said was partly reflective of the Smurfit leadership team remaining in place.“The five dollars is kind of the small amount of incremental capital which actually  in this deal  just aligned the relative multiples. We’re merging on the same multiple  which is about seven times.“In terms of the roles and responsibilities  clearly part of the $5 goes to that  but I think you would also look at industry expertise and time in the industry.“I think it’s fair to say you’ve got a more experienced management team on this side of the house than maybe on the WestRock side of the house.”Mr Bowles said it was too early to say whether there would be job losses once the merger goes through  which is not expected until the second quarter next year  subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.The businesses for the most part are complementary rather than overlapping – with WestRock’s US market presence something Europe focused Smurfit Kappa has lacked.Still  the companies expect “synergies” of more than $400m by the end of the first full year following the merger  but it will require one-off cash costs of around $235m.Packaging firms saw a pandemic boost as online shopping took off  but that premium has pared back as inflation and higher costs bit  with Smurfit Kappa’s half-year results showing a drop in revenue and profit.But Mr Bowles said that the industry could be “through that tougher part” of the cycle  with inflation slowing and interest rate hikes nearing a peak.“As we move through the fourth quarter of this year and into next year  I think the demand profile is much better. So I’m not worried about the bottom line of either entity on its own  or the combined entity next year.”,neutral,0.02,0.88,0.09,mixed,0.23,0.38,0.4,True,English,"['Ken Bowles', 'share price', 'merger terms', 'Smurfit', 'WestRock', 'Smurfit Kappa Chairman Irial Finan', 'third generation CEO Tony Smurfit', 'Company Secretary Gillian Carson-Callan', 'incoming chief financial officer', 'current Smurfit Kappa chair', 'former Irish Stock Exchange', 'US packaging giant WestRock', 'Irish stock market', 'Jason Clarke Photography', 'hedge fund positions', 'experienced management team', 'stock market listing', 'deep capital markets', 'proud Irish company', 'US market presence', 'Smurfit leadership team', 'first full year', 'The Irish shares', 'Smurfit WestRock assets', 'global packaging partner', 'one new share', 'interest rate hikes', 'share price drop', 'Smurfit Kappa shareholders', 'CFO Ken Bowles', 'Irish leadership', 'exchange rate', 'Irish Independent', 'new company', 'European exchange', 'Smurfit shares', 'incremental capital', 'Packaging firms', 'US listing', 'New York', 'global staff', 'share counts', 'listing) move', 'primary listing', 'secondary listing', 'US re-listing', 'Mr Bowles', 'WestRock shareholders', 'packing mega-merger', 'sharp drop', 'normal kind', 'large-scale acquisitions', 'moving parts', 'big names', 'logical home', 'last 12 months', 'UK trading', 'natural mechanics', 'five dollars', 'small amount', 'relative multiples', 'same multiple', 'job losses', 'second quarter', 'regulatory approvals', 'pandemic boost', 'online shopping', 'higher costs', 'half-year results', 'fourth quarter', 'next year', 'demand profile', 'global headquarters', 'normal” reaction', 'market-based reaction', 'most part', 'tougher part', 'US firm', 'WestRock side', 'Euronext Dublin', 'cash costs', 'two companies', 'industry expertise', 'detailed terms', 'merger announcement', '2022 AGM', 'implications', 'acquirer', 'shareprice', 'deal', '9pc', 'number', 'factors', 'time', 'sense', 'mergers', 'phone', 'blow', 'business', 'Ireland', 'slew', 'size', 'liquid', 'world', 'peer', 'paper', 'reality', 'domicile', 'transaction', 'MrBowes', 'group', 'revenues', 'earnings', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'London', 'largest', '50.4pc', '49.6pc', 'place', 'roles', 'house', 'synergies', 'one-off', 'premium', 'inflation', 'profit', 'cycle', 'peak']",2023-09-12,2023-09-12,independent.ie

JP Morgan said most investors it had spoken to had assumed a 15%-20% premium.Smurfit Kappa CEO Tony Smurfit  who will assume the same role in the new company alongside his CFO Ken Bowles and chair Irial Finan  called the deal “a defining moment within the global packaging industry.”Smurfit Kappa shareholders will receive one new Smurfit WestRock share for each share they hold. They are expected to own around 50.4% of the new company following completion of the deal  expected in the second quarter of 2024.Packaging firms benefited from a boom in demand for goods and e-commerce during COVID-19 lockdowns but have struggled to match those volumes since consumers resumed spending on services and producers started cutting back packaged stocks.Smurfit  which operates in 22 European countries and 13 in South  Central and North America  reported a fall in first-half core profit last month as it struggled to offset the decline in volumes.However  it said that the first increase in shipments of its boxes in Europe in a year suggested inventory reductions by customers were coming to an end and that there will be scope to increase box prices again as demand recovers.While WestRock beat Wall Street expectations for third-quarter profit  it said it remained focused on streamlining its portfolio and further reducing costs.JP Morgan estimated the combined entity would have market shares of around 20% in the corrugated packaging market in Europe and North America  where WestRock is the second-largest player.The companies’ had a combined adjusted core profit of $5.5 billion and revenue of about $34 billion for the year ended June 30  which would make Smurfit WestRock the largest listed global packaging group by revenue  the companies’ statement said.The combined entity will target pre-tax cost savings of more than $400 million at the end of the first full year following completion at a one-off cash cost of around $235 million.That could make the deal more than 20% accretive to Smurfit Kappa’s earnings per share  the statement added.Smurfit WestRock will be domiciled in low tax Ireland with its global headquarters in Dublin. It will be listed in New York and also have a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange.Smurfit Kappa will de-list from Euronext Dublin  the latest blow for the Irish bourse as building materials giant CRH prepares to leave later this month._____Our earlier story published on Sept. 7.DUBLIN — Smurfit Kappa is in discussions to merge with U.S. rival WestRock  the Irish firm said on Thursday  in a tie-up of two of the world’s largest paper and packaging producers.The combined entity would be named Smurfit WestRock and domiciled in Ireland with its global headquarters in Dublin  Smurfit said in a statement. It would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.It did not disclose the possible financial terms of a deal and said definitive terms would be set out in a further announcement. Any deal would be subject to shareholder approval  due diligence and regulatory approval  it said.WestRock shareholders would receive shares in the combined group  Smurfit Kappa said.Smurfit  which operates in 22 European countries and 13 in South  Central and North America  is Europe’s largest paper and packaging producer. WestRock is the second largest packaging company in the U.S. with multiple locations in the St. Louis area  including a container plant on North Broadway.At current market prices  the combined market capital of the two firms would be around $19 billion. They had combined revenue of $34 billion in the 12 months to the end of June.Research analysts at Credit Suisse said the proposed combination had significant strategic and operational merits and strengthens the company’s Americas presence  especially in faster-growing Central America.The merger would be “a good cultural fit” with a strong focus on an innovation-driven expansion of the group’s sustainable packaging business  they said in a research note.The combined entity  which would have around 100 000 employees  could log pre-tax cost savings of more than $400 million on an annual run-rate basis at the end of the first year following the completion of the deal  said Smurfit.The tie-up would require one-off cash costs of approximately $235 million  it added.The deal would offer “complementary portfolios with unique product diversity and innovative sustainability capabilities  with breadth and depth across renewable  recyclable and biodegradable packaging solutions ” the Smurfit statement said.COVID hangoverThe Irish firm has benefited from a boom in demand for packaging goods and e-commerce during COVID-19 lockdowns  but suffered a setback when economies reopened and producers started cutting back packaging stocks.Last month it reported a fall in first-half core profit as it struggled to offset a year-on-year decline in volumes.WestRock beat Wall Street expectations for third-quarter profit and said it remained focused on streamlining its portfolio and further reducing costs.The merger  which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal  would be effected though an Irish scheme of arrangement involving Smurfit Kappa and a merger of a subsidiary with WestRock  Smurfit said.Smurfit would de-list from Euronext Dublin and cancel its premium listing on the London Stock Exchange under the deal  the statement said. Its North and South American operations would be headquartered in Atlanta  Georgia.($1 = 0.9326 euros)Updated at 4:52 a.m. Tuesday  Sept. 12.,neutral,0.23,0.75,0.02,negative,0.01,0.14,0.85,True,English,"['$20 billion packaging giant', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'WestRock', 'merger', 'Smurfit Kappa CEO Tony Smurfit', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'one new Smurfit WestRock share', 'U.S. rival WestRock', 'second largest packaging company', 'London Stock Exchange', 'CFO Ken Bowles', 'Wall Street expectations', 'building materials giant', 'St. Louis area', 'good cultural fit', 'annual run-rate basis', 'pre-tax cost savings', 'sustainable packaging business', 'possible financial terms', 'corrugated packaging market', 'global packaging industry', 'Sept. 6 closing price', 'combined market capital', 'first-half core profit', 'current market prices', 'low tax Ireland', 'largest listed paper', 'Smurfit Kappa shareholders', 'growing Central America', 'global packaging group', 'first full year', 'Smurfit Kappa shares', 'one-off cash costs', 'one share', 'new company', 'second quarter', 'market shares', 'packaging firm', 'packaging producer', 'largest paper', 'global headquarters', 'definitive terms', 'WestRock shareholders', 'first increase', 'third-quarter profit', 'largest player', 'biggest paper', 'North America', 'combined entity', 'combined group', 'first year', 'pre-market trade', 'JP Morgan', 'same role', 'Irial Finan', 'COVID-19 lockdowns', '22 European countries', 'inventory reductions', 'standard listing', 'latest blow', 'Irish bourse', 'earlier story', 'Irish firm', 'shareholder approval', 'due diligence', 'regulatory approval', 'multiple locations', 'container plant', 'North Broadway', 'two firms', 'Credit Suisse', 'significant strategic', 'operational merits', 'strong focus', 'innovation-driven expansion', 'research note', 'WestRock stockholders', 'most investors', 'South, Central', 'Research analysts', 'Euronext Dublin', 'companies’ statement', 'producers', 'Tuesday', 'world', 'premium', 'Jefferies', 'talks', 'chair', 'deal', 'completion', 'boom', 'demand', 'goods', 'e-commerce', 'volumes', 'consumers', 'spending', 'services', 'stocks', 'fall', 'decline', 'shipments', 'boxes', 'customers', 'scope', 'portfolio', 'revenue', 'June', 'earnings', 'CRH', 'discussions', 'Thursday', 'tie-up', 'announcement', '12 months', 'combination', 'Americas', 'presence', 'merger', '100,000 employees', 'complementary']",2023-09-12,2023-09-12,stltoday.com
