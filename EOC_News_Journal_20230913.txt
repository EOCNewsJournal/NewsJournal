It should not be done like this – we’re talking about finance and the economy  why should it be used for other purposes than this. It should be free from political and geopolitical risks. That’s the only reason [for de-dollarization] ” he stated.To illustrate his point  the banker quoted a famous phrase from ‘The Godfather Part III’ movie  “finance is a gun  politics is knowing when to pull the trigger.”“And that is what we saw – the politicians in the West pulled the trigger and it’s been used against Russia  and not only Russia but other countries ” he explained.Kostin noted that while a decade ago nobody wanted to use local currencies in cross-border transactions and were content with using the dollar  now more and more countries are reevaluating this stance.“We raised the question of using local currencies ten years ago but nobody wanted it at the time – why  they said  we can use the dollar  it’s good – and it was good until we faced the situation when America started to threaten us  threaten other countries  saying ‘if you don’t do this  if you don’t do that we’ll cut you off from the dollar.’ If they had not behaved like this we would never have raised this question ” Kostin said.Kostin said that it is high time for countries in the Global South to create their own financial system based on national currencies.“It is the right time for the Global South to start to build up this system because though the Global South removed the colonial system politically after World War 2  the colonial system in the financial sector still exists  the empire built by the US with the help of its allies still works ” he stated. Kostin added that it is now “very clear to most of the world that if we continue like this there will be a threat of the [US] using the financial system as a weapon.”The banker noted  however  that the idea is not to fight the Western financial system but to build a parallel system that will work to the benefit of the Global South.“We see big changes in the balance of economic power in the world with such countries as China  Arab countries  and that allows us to create a different system which would be based on different principles – principles of independence  sovereignty  the use of currencies other than the dollar and euro.”Kostin first outlined his idea for a new financial system at the Financial Congress organized by the Russian central bank in July. His proposal included four primary principles: replacing SWIFT with a new messaging system; replacing US-linked correspondent relationships among banks with horizontal links among local banks based on blockchain technology; creating an international depository settlement hub in the Persian Gulf to replace EU-based Euroclear and Clearstream; and creating new instruments for raising capital instead of using foreign currency bonds that are linked to the West.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.03,0.61,0.35,negative,0.05,0.25,0.7,True,English,"['top Russian banker', 'Dollar', 'weapon', 'RT', 'The Godfather Part III’ movie', 'international depository settlement hub', 'entire Western financial system', 'US-linked correspondent relationships', 'foreign currency bonds', 'Eastern Economic Forum', 'Russian central bank', 'The Global South', 'new messaging system', 'four primary principles', 'new financial system', 'VTB Andrey Kostin', 'new instruments', 'financial sector', 'Financial Congress', 'largest bank', 'economic power', 'colonial system', 'parallel system', 'different system', 'targeted attempt', 'other purposes', 'famous phrase', 'cross-border transactions', 'big changes', 'different principles', 'horizontal links', 'blockchain technology', 'Persian Gulf', 'EU-based Euroclear', 'business section', 'national currencies', 'local currencies', 'high time', 'right time', 'geopolitical risks', 'other countries', 'Arab countries', 'local banks', 'World War', 'head', 'dollar', 'sanctions', 'CEO', 'sidelines', 'Tuesday', 'push', 'trade', 'necessity', 'greenback', 'weapon', 'finance', 'economy', 'reason', 'point', 'banker', 'gun', 'politics', 'trigger', 'politicians', 'stance', 'question', 'situation', 'America', 'empire', 'help', 'allies', 'threat', 'idea', 'benefit', 'balance', 'China', 'independence', 'sovereignty', 'use', 'July', 'proposal', 'SWIFT', 'Clearstream', 'capital', 'stories']",2023-09-12,2023-09-13,rt.com

The Company’s first wrapped tokens feature a mix of underlyings from the top crypto assets by market capitalization  across multiple blockchain networks. Wrapped tokens present the opportunity to increase cross-chain liquidity and utility regardless of blockchain ecosystem  and address the security challenges of cross-chain bridging. 21.co is uniquely positioned to deliver institutional grade security and liquidity at scale through the suite  bolstered by Onyx  21.co’s proprietary product management system  which has created and redeemed over $3.3B in crypto-backed assets.Effective cross-chain interoperability and liquidity allow members of the DeFi community to tap into a larger liquidity pool of assets without being limited to a single blockchain ecosystem. Greater accessibility leads to a greater ability to scale DeFi as a whole. Historically  cross-chain interoperability has been a technical hurdle for the DeFi community. Solutions like cross-chain bridge protocols have proven to be vulnerable to security hacks  posing a significant threat not only to assets but to trust in blockchain technology.The new 21.co Wrapped Tokens introduce cross-chain liquidity for the most popular alt-layer one protocol tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem  securely. Onyx  developed by 21.co  ensures minting and burning processes are executed swiftly and securely. 21.co Wrapped Tokens are 100% physically collateralized  and underlying assets are held in cold storage by institutional-grade custody.“DeFi needs cross-chain interoperability to be successful  but up until this point existing solutions have been plagued by serious security vulnerabilities ” said Hany Rashwan  co-founder and CEO at 21.co. “We firmly believe DeFi is the future  and have long been committed to bridging traditional finance and decentralized finance with our experience and our products. With the launch of centralized wrapped assets  we are thrilled to be offering a much-needed technology to the DeFi community that will help DeFi continue to win.”The Index Coop will be the first organization to offer a multiple-blockchain index token - Index Coop Large Cap Index (IC21) powered by 21.co Wrapped Tokens. With 21.co’s technology  the IC21 Token brings a number of non-EVM blockchain tokens to the Ethereum network.21.co Wrapped Tokens include:21BTC - 21.co Wrapped Bitcoin21BNB - 21.co Wrapped BNB21XRP - 21.co Wrapped XRP21ADA - 21.co Wrapped Cardano21SOL - 21.co Wrapped Solana21LTC - 21.co Wrapped Litecoin21DOT - 21.co Wrapped Polkadot21BCH - 21.co Wrapped BitcoinCashTo learn more about 21.co Wrapped Tokens  please visit https://21.co/tokensAbout 21.co21.co is the world’s leader in providing access to crypto through TradFi and DeFi. 21.co offers cryptocurrency exchange traded products (ETPs) via its 21Shares affiliate  as well as blockchain infrastructure technology. 21.co’s products are built on its proprietary operating system  Onyx  which is also distributed to third parties.

This partnership will enable UPS to develop its network of UPS Access Points throughout France  contributing to the reduction of their last mile impact.UPS and Quadient today announced their strategic partnership  giving UPS access to Quadient's parcel locker open network throughout France. This collaboration will enable UPS to complement its French pickup points network  currently the logistic company’s largest in Europe  comprising more than 6 150 UPS Access Points. Quadient  whose parcel locker business already boasts over 1 000 units in France  is continuing to roll out its open network available to the various parcel logistic players.The development of this new locker solution ensures greater flexibility for customers: no constraints on time or location  thanks to a large presence throughout France’s both urban and regional areas. Together  the two players are actively working to identify the best locations for UPS  based on existing parcel delivery volumes and constraints.While parcel returns have a real impact on the environment  this solution allows UPS to manage them more effectively by limiting the number of collection points. The development of smart locker networks also addresses the logistical challenges related to environmental issues. Automated lockers enhance delivery efficiency by reducing the driver’s trips and consolidating at a single delivery point. Moreover  they offer consumers the advantage of collecting their parcels at their convenience  eliminating waiting times. Ultimately  these lockers assist UPS in achieving its objectives  notably the goal of reducing CO2 emissions per delivered package by 50% in its global small package business (with 2020 as a base year).""We are thrilled about our partnership with Quadient. The smart locker solution addresses the increasing demand for flexibility in our customer deliveries  all while aligning with a more responsible approach"" - Franck Edeline  Director of UPS France Operations.""At Quadient  we are excited about our partnership with UPS  which supports their efforts to innovate and reduce the ecological footprint of parcel delivery in France. Our network of intelligent Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers provides carriers with visibility and control over their delivery operations  ensuring a connected  secure and user-friendly delivery experience for UPS customers "" explains Katia Bourgeais Crémel  Director of Parcel Locker Solutions Europe at Quadient. ""We are actively forging strong partnerships with carriers like UPS  as well as retail players  to place our lockers as close to consumers as possible. This approach delivers a convenient  sustainable  and cost-effective service  creating new opportunities for the future of parcel delivery"".About QuadientQuadient creates the most meaningful customer experiences.

After having faced and brilliantly overcome the negative effects deriving first from the Covid epidemic and then from the increases in the costs of raw materials and energy  despite the uncertainties generated by the persistence of geopolitical tensions and strong fears about the performance of the economy  TIP's investee companies further improved in the first half of 2023 the already excellent results of the first half of 2022. In particular  it is worth mentioning the notable performance of Alpitour  a rapidly growing group  which in the period achieved  for the first time in its history  a positive first half of the year in terms of Ebitda. Beyond the seasonality of Alpitour's business  the economic results achieved so far and the level of order collection are such as to allow the forecast of an extremely positive result for the current year and  even more importantly  a change that seems structural positively thanks also to the huge investments made - on the group's economic accounts. The usual pro forma income statement for the period 1 January - 30 June 2023  determined by considering the realized gains and losses and write-downs on equity investments  is shown below. As known  this system  in force until a few years ago  is considered to be much more significant in representing the reality of TIP's business. 1Reclassification to Reclassification to income statement income statement IFRS of capital gain of adjustments to Consolidated income statement 30/6/2023 (loss) realised financial assets (in Euro) Total revenues 679 949 Purchases  service and other costs (1 800 052) Personnel expenses (13 875 638) Amortisation (184 379) Operating profit/(loss) (15 180 120) 0 0 Financial income 9 721 279 45 401 858 Financial charges (10 139 795) Share of profit/(loss) of associates measured under the equity method 34 362 944 Adjustments to financial assets (373 025) Profit / (loss) before taxes 18 764 308 45 401 858 (373 025) Current and deferred taxes 1 071 988 (210 058) 0 Profit / (loss) of the period 19 836 296 45 191 800 (373 025) Profit/(loss) of the period attributable to the shareholders of the parent 19 541 420 45 191 800 (373 025) Profit/(loss) of the period attributable to the minority interest 294 876 0 0 PRO FORMA 30/6/2023 679 949 (1 800 052) (13 875 638) (184 379) (15 180 120) 55 123 137 (10 139 795) 34 362 944 (373 025) 63 793 141 861 930 64 655 070 64 360 195 294 876 PRO FORMA 30/6/2022 923 105 (1 349 214) (7 724 481) (176 573) (8 327 163) 16 529 844 (8 071 870) 25 285 435 (243 200) 25 173 046 (970 137) 24 202 909 20 829 951 3 372 958 The IFRS 9 income statement does not include capital gains realized in the period on equity investments and securities  equal to 45.4 million euros. Revenues from advisory activities in the period were approximately 0.7 million. Personnel costs are  as always  significantly influenced by the variable remuneration component of executive directors which  as is known  are linked to results. In addition to capital gains  financial income also includes dividends of 8.3 million  interest income of 0.8 million and other income of 0.6 million. Financial charges mainly refer to interest accrued on the bond for approximately 4 million  capital losses on bonds investments for 2.3 million  other interest on loans for 2.2 million and negative changes in the value of derivative instruments for 1.5 million. The consolidated net financial position of the TIP Group as of 30 June 2023  without the financial assets considered from a management perspective to be liquidity usable in the short term  was negative by approximately 480.2 million  compared to approximately 419.3 million as of 31 December 2022. In the same period  total assets  at book value  went from approximately 1.67 billion to approximately 1.9 billion. The change in the net financial position for the period is essentially attributable to the use of liquidity in the half-year to finalize investments in shareholdings  the distribution of dividends and the purchase of treasury shares  net of proceeds from the disposals and of dividends. During the first half of 2023  investment and dinvestment activity continued with the usual dynamism; overall  in the half-year the TIP group made equity investments for 72.9 million  purchases of treasury shares for 9.7 million and direct disinvestments for 85.4 million. In January 2023  through the subscription of a capital increase with an investment of 10 million  it was finalized the acquisition of approximately 30% of Simbiosi S.r.l.  the parent of some companies that develop technologies  solutions 2and patents that can be used in many applications aimed at saving natural resources (air  water  materials and soil) and energy. In May TIP reached an agreement to acquire 50.69% of Investindesign S.p.A. (""ID"")  a company that currently holds 46.960% of the capital of Italian Design Brands S.p.A. (""IDB"")  the execution of which was conditional on the listing of IDB shares on the stock market by June 30  2023. The listing process was completed on May 18  2023. TIP  for the purchase of 50.69% of Investindesign has committed to invest 72 million  of which 60 million already paid in the first half of 2023 and 12 million to be paid in November 2023  attributing to IDB an economic capital value (so-called equity value) of 220 million. IDB is the operating parent company of an Italian furniture and design hub active - through numerous investments in companies operating in these sectors - in the production of high-end items  with prestigious brands including AXOLight  Binova  Dandy Home  Davide Groppi  Flexalighting  Gamma Arredamenti  Gervasoni  Meridiani  Miton  Saba and Very Wood. The group also includes two companies - Cenacchi International and Modar - specialized in the luxury contract for the shops and showrooms of some of the most prestigious international fashion maison. The products manufactured by IDB investee companies are distributed and sold by third parties. In 2022 the IDB group achieved a pro forma turnover (including for the entire financial year also the total operating turnover of the companies acquired during the year) of approximately 266 million  with an Ebitda of over 49 million; the first half of 2023 is showing further growth in turnover and profitability. IDB has created an aggregation platform in the fragmented Made in Italy furniture and lighting production sector and has developed essentially through acquisitions. It currently has 650 people and in 2022 it exported around 75%. TIP had the possibility of acquiring a further 20% of Investindesign's capital by 15 July 2023 under the same conditions as the acquisition of 50.69%. In July a club deal with some important Italian family offices was organized; on this occasion TIP made a further investment of 5.7 million. In April TIP S.p.A. purchased from Asset Italia S.p.A. n. 59 676 shares of Amplifon S.p.A. for a consideration of approximately 2 million. In April a new program for the purchase of treasury shares was launched for up to a maximum of further no. 5 000 000 shares  to be carried out by 27 October 2024. In June TIP sold a 3.98% stake in its stake in Azimut/Benetti  realizing a significant capital gain. The operation took place in the context of a reorganization of the shareholding structure of the Azimut/Benetti Group following which the Public Investment Fund (PIF)  the sovereign fund of Saudi Arabia  entered the company  acquiring a 33% of the capital. Through the opening of the capital to PIF a long-term strategic partnership was launched to support the next phase of development of the Azimut/Benetti Group  with the aim of leveraging the synergies that the new investor will be able to stimulate to support growth both dimensional and technological. TIP remains a shareholder of Azimut/Benetti with a share of 8.09%. 3In June TIP reached an agreement with the Mercati family (Aboca Group) to jointly invest in the development of Apoteca Natura  the first international network of benefit pharmacies  promoters of a conscious health concept and integration into the healthcare supply chain. The agreement provides that the investment will be made through a capital increase in the newly established Apoteca Natura Investment  a holding company that will hold the entire capital of Apoteca Natura S.p.A. The agreements provide for TIP to acquire a 28.57% share. The investment  finalized in July  represents the first step in a long-term industrial partnership in the retail sector in which the deep knowledge of the sector and the industrial experiences of the Mercati family will find synergistic expression with the industrial relations and skills of TIP. Following further purchases on the market  the share in Elica rose to 21.381% of the capital  while the investments in Prysmian and Fagerhult were lightened and the Ferrari shares were sold. In the half year period TIP also received dividends from associated companies for approximately 8.3 million which  not accounted for in the income statement  were recognized in the accounts as a reduction of the investment made. The usual active management of liquidity also continued. 12 5 10 5 8 5 6 5 4 5 2 5 0 5 + 372  9% asdaq +2 7 1 9% IT Star +2 1 0 0% S&P 500 +1 6 7 0% D OW JONES + 1 2 9 5% F TSE Small Cap +9 3  3% F TSE MIB +6 3  7% MSC I Eur +4 5  9% TIP elaborations based on data collected on 8 September 2023 at 6.53 pm source Bloomberg.

These sites will host Atlantis™ 1SR servers  equipped with the latest 4th generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors.This French-origin computer infrastructure solution stands out for its ability to provide exceptional performance even in challenging environments  such as those characterized by high humidity  high temperatures  and significant dust presence. Furthermore  it reduces the ecological footprint by over 45%!These first two sites are part of the development of ""Edge Cloud "" an approach aimed at deploying servers near data sources  reducing response times compared to traditional Cloud solutions. By bringing computing capabilities closer to these locations  Edge Computing enables users to enjoy faster and more reliable services while facilitating the use and distribution of shared resources across multiple sites.The VRuna™ solution  which will be installed in India  has been specially designed to meet the most demanding operational standards. It is capable of withstanding significant water rises  such as those occurring during the monsoon season  and can be completely submerged by ""greywater"" while resisting pressures of over 120 bars. Moreover  it is also entirely dustproof and operates autonomously without the need for additional thermal dissipation systems.The validation phase of these first two sites is expected to lead to a joint proposal from ""L&T + 2CRSi"" for an Indian telecom operator that aims to deploy 1200 Edge Datacenters. This deployment intends to accelerate the roll out of services that require server proximity to reduce network latency.About 2CRSiFounded in Strasbourg in 2005  the 2CRSi group designs  produces and markets bespoke  ecoresponsible high-performance IT servers. 2CRSi has been listed since June 2018 on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0013341781) and its shares were transferred to the Euronext Growth regulated market on 25 November 2022.For further information : 2crsi.comAbout Larsen & ToubroLarsen & Toubro (L&T) is an Indian conglomerate founded in 1938.

This partnership will enable UPS to develop its network of UPS Access Points throughout France  contributing to the reduction of their last mile impact.UPS and Quadient today announced their strategic partnership  giving UPS access to Quadient's parcel locker open network throughout France. This collaboration will enable UPS to complement its French pickup points network  currently the logistic company’s largest in Europe  comprising more than 6 150 UPS Access Points. Quadient  whose parcel locker business already boasts over 1 000 units in France  is continuing to roll out its open network available to the various parcel logistic players.The development of this new locker solution ensures greater flexibility for customers: no constraints on time or location  thanks to a large presence throughout France’s both urban and regional areas. Together  the two players are actively working to identify the best locations for UPS  based on existing parcel delivery volumes and constraints.While parcel returns have a real impact on the environment  this solution allows UPS to manage them more effectively by limiting the number of collection points. The development of smart locker networks also addresses the logistical challenges related to environmental issues. Automated lockers enhance delivery efficiency by reducing the driver’s trips and consolidating at a single delivery point. Moreover  they offer consumers the advantage of collecting their parcels at their convenience  eliminating waiting times. Ultimately  these lockers assist UPS in achieving its objectives  notably the goal of reducing CO2 emissions per delivered package by 50% in its global small package business (with 2020 as a base year).""We are thrilled about our partnership with Quadient. The smart locker solution addresses the increasing demand for flexibility in our customer deliveries  all while aligning with a more responsible approach"" - Franck Edeline  Director of UPS France Operations.""At Quadient  we are excited about our partnership with UPS  which supports their efforts to innovate and reduce the ecological footprint of parcel delivery in France.

JP Morgan said most investors it had spoken to had assumed a 15%-20% premium.The deal represents a 28% premium to Monday's closing price and Smurfit Kappa finance chief Ken Bowles  who will take the same role in the new company  told Reuters that was a fairly normal market rate but was not the important part of the deal.""The two companies are coming together at the same multiple  when you add in the $5  of about seven times. That's much less than any transaction that has been done in this sector in the last number of years  most have been double-digit "" Bowles said.""We're not putting this together at the top of the cycle  we're not putting it together at the bottom either. It's in that sweet spot where we feel there are much better times ahead.""Smurfit Kappa CEO Tony Smurfit and chair Irial Finan will also keep their roles in the new company after talks Bowles said kicked off over the last eight months.Smurfit Kappa shareholders will receive one new Smurfit WestRock share for each share they hold. They are expected to own around 50.4% of the new company following completion of the deal  expected in the second quarter of 2024.Smurfit said he did not see any antitrust issues given the limited overlap of Smurfit Kappa's European  South and Central America-dominated operations and WestRock U.S. footprint  except for in Mexico which the companies would work to overcome.COVID HANGOVERPackaging (NYSE: ) firms benefited from a boom in demand for goods and e-commerce during COVID-19 lockdowns  but have struggled to match those volumes since consumers resumed spending on services and producers started cutting back packaged stocks.Smurfit Kappa reported a fall in first-half core profit last month as it struggled to offset the decline in volumes but predicted inventory reductions by customers were coming to an end with scope to increase box prices again as demand recovers.While WestRock beat Wall Street expectations for third-quarter profit  it said it remained focused on streamlining its portfolio and further reducing costs.JP Morgan estimated the combined entity would have market shares of around 20% in the corrugated packaging market in Europe and North America.The companies' combined adjusted core profit of $5.5 billion and revenue of about $34 billion for the year ended June 30 would put it clear of nearest rivals International Paper and Ball Corporation (NYSE: )Smurfit Kappa rejected a takeover proposal worth $9.5 billion in 2018 from International Paper.The combined entity will target pretax cost savings of more than $400 million at the end of the first full year following completion at a one-off cash cost of around $235 million.That could make the deal more than 20% accretive to Smurfit Kappa's earnings per share  it said. Bowles said he was confident the synergies would ultimately go beyond that figure.Smurfit WestRock will be domiciled in low tax Ireland with its global headquarters in Dublin. It will be listed in New York and also have a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange.Smurfit Kappa will de-list from Euronext Dublin  the latest blow for the Irish bourse as building materials giant CRH (NYSE: ) prepares to leave later this month.",neutral,0.05,0.93,0.02,mixed,0.18,0.29,0.53,True,English,"['billion WestRock deal', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'packaging leader', 'Reuters', 'Smurfit Kappa finance chief Ken Bowles', 'Smurfit Kappa CEO Tony Smurfit', '2020 U.S. presidential election', 'U.S. rival WestRock', 'WestRock U.S. footprint', 'one new Smurfit WestRock share', 'Central America-dominated operations', 'Wall Street expectations', 'pretax cost savings', 'London Stock Exchange', 'building materials giant', 'Smurfit Kappa shareholders', 'normal market rate', 'second largest player', 'last eight months', 'Smurfit Kappa shares', 'Lucy Nicholson/File Photo', 'Sept. 6 closing price', 'first full year', 'one-off cash cost', 'low tax Ireland', 'first-half core profit', 'corrugated packaging market', 'one share', 'market shares', 'WestRock stockholders', 'last number', 'second quarter', 'New York', 'new company', 'third-quarter profit', 'cardboard box', 'Los Angeles', 'Padraic Halpin', 'Yadarisa Shabong', 'biggest paper', 'weak economies', 'packaging producer', 'United States', 'pre-market trade', 'JP Morgan', 'same role', 'important part', 'same multiple', 'sweet spot', 'Irial Finan', 'antitrust issues', 'limited overlap', 'European, South', 'COVID HANGOVER', 'COVID-19 lockdowns', 'inventory reductions', 'box prices', 'combined entity', 'North America', 'nearest rivals', 'International Paper', 'Ball Corporation', 'takeover proposal', 'global headquarters', 'standard listing', 'latest blow', 'Irish bourse', 'packaging company', 'Irish company', 'Watchlist WRK', 'Watchlist PKG', 'most investors', 'seven times', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Watchlist SKG', 'two companies', 'Reuters', 'person', 'cart', 'Downey', 'California', 'NYSE', 'world', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'deal', 'Tuesday', 'analysts', 'premium', 'statement', 'Jefferies', 'talks', 'Monday', 'transaction', 'sector', 'years', 'top', 'cycle', 'bottom', 'chair', 'roles', 'completion', 'Mexico', 'firms', 'boom', 'demand', 'goods', 'e-commerce', 'volumes', 'consumers', 'spending', 'services', 'producers', 'stocks', 'fall', 'decline', 'customers', 'scope', 'portfolio', 'costs', 'revenue', 'June', 'earnings', 'synergies', 'figure', 'CRH', '©']",2023-09-12,2023-09-13,investing.com

A recent survey sponsored by Invistics  acquired by Wolters Kluwer Health earlier this year  found that despite 98% of healthcare executives agreeing that drug diversion occurs in hospitals  nearly four in five healthcare executives surveyed (79%) believe that most drug diversion goes undetected.The International Health Facility Diversion Association estimates that at least 37 000 diversion incidents occur in U.S. facilities each year  and this number is likely underreported.1 According to the Wolters Kluwer Invistics survey  “The State of Drug Diversion 2023 Report ” only 40% of executives are very confident in the efficacy of their drug diversion detection programs  with a majority (67%) of executives planning to strengthen their drug diversion efforts in 2023.Improving inconsistent drug diversion processesDrug diversion detection has historically been a manual and time intensive process  with 71% of respondents reporting that their team spends eight or more hours on each investigation. Hospitals and ambulatory settings also struggle with consistency when it comes to managing detection programs. When questioned about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their drug diversion programs  69% of respondents pointed to the increased presence of floating staff or contract workers as the primary factor that made drug diversion detection more challenging.“With staff shortages and use of contract workers at an all-time high  hospitals may see inconsistency in their drug diversion detection efforts ” said Karen Kobelski  Vice President and General Manager of Clinical Surveillance Compliance & Data Solutions  Wolters Kluwer  Health. “Given the risks to patient safety and clinical teams  as well as the potential reputational and financial impact on the hospital itself  hospital leadership should consider how sophisticated technology can keep these programs running smoothly. As one of our respondents commented  ‘If you do not have any drug diversion  then you are not looking hard enough.’”Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a significant opportunity to improve drug diversion detection efforts across a hospital or health system. By monitoring patterns in data over time and across multiple hospital systems  programs incorporating advanced technologies can support increased hospital detection of diversion and improved patient safety.Embracing AI for drug diversion detectionRecognizing the significant benefits of AI in diversion detection  more organizations have taken the next step forward in leveraging the latest cutting-edge technology to tackle their institutions’ diversion detection gaps. Since the initial survey in 2019  hospitals that report using machine learning to detect patterns of diversion and automatically flag potential cases have nearly doubled (29% to 56%). These facilities are also more confident in their drug diversion programs  with more than half of executives who use AI tools (53%) reporting they are very confident in the efficacy of their diversion detection efforts.“Hospitals don’t always have the staff to dedicate to an ongoing diversion detection program as they balance more acute patient needs. AI-powered tools continually running in the background enable healthcare providers and leaders to feel more confident they are able to keep their patients and staff safe from diversion ” Ms. Kobelski continued. “AI-based diversion detection programs can do the hard work of sifting through mountains of data to find suspect cases so resource-strapped hospitals can run an effective program and ensure diversion is detected.”About the drug diversion survey100 healthcare employees participated in “The State of Drug Diversion 2023 Report ” facilitated by Eliciting Insights  a healthcare market research company. Survey participants included directors of pharmacy (42%)  nursing executives (10%)  executives (9%)  and drug diversion specialists (34%). The 2023 edition is the fourth of its kind and compares historical findings against current results while gathering additional perspectives.Wolters Kluwer Health provides trusted clinical technology and evidence-based solutions that engage clinicians  patients  researchers and students in effective decision-making and outcomes across healthcare.

30098,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/09/12/kingspan-shows-ambitions-with-carlisle-offer/,Kingspan shows ambitions with Carlisle offer,Cavan-based insulation business hunting ‘transformative’ deal,Kingspan chief executive Gene Murtagh’s ambitions appear to continue to grow.The Cavan-based insulation firm spent more than €1 billion on acquisitions in 2022  according to its annual report  but now would seem to have greater plans. The company informally approached US peer Carlisle about a possible merger. That deal would have cost several billion – Carlisle had a market capitalisation of €11.6 billion before news of the approach was made public.While the talks are said to be essentially dormant for now  according to a person familiar with the matter  there is nothing to stop Kingspan seeking to revive the deal. Carlisle  meanwhile  has indicated it could be open to an improved offer.Whether it’s Carlisle or not  Murtagh is clearly on the hunt for a deal that would transform the company  most likely that will be in the US.READ MOREThe US offers the chance of big growth to Kingspan. The Americas accounted for about 22 per cent of its revenue last year  compared with about 72 per cent from Europe. There is the added attraction of access to green subsidies from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act  which offers companies state aid in a way that is next to impossible in Europe.A deal would also likely lead to Kingspan listing in some form on a US exchange. That would give it greater access to US investors but could also lead to it becoming the latest big firm to give up it’s listing on Euronext Dublin  as the Irish stock exchange is now known.Kingspan’s interest in a big deal also shows that the company’s ambitions have not been shrunk by the ongoing fallout from the Grenfell Tower inquiry.Kingspan’s K15 insulation was used on the tower in which a fire killed 72 people in 2017. However  the Irish business maintains the product was “misused” and it did not know it was supplied to the company that fitted the material to the building. Still  it has been pilloried in the UK after evidence given to the inquiry in 2020.The company is clearly following generations of fortune seekers  and going west.,neutral,0.32,0.67,0.01,negative,0.05,0.21,0.74,True,English,"['Carlisle offer', 'Kingspan', 'ambitions', 'The Cavan-based insulation firm', 'Inflation Reduction Act', 'latest big firm', 'Irish stock exchange', 'Kingspan chief executive', 'Grenfell Tower inquiry', 'US peer Carlisle', 'K15 insulation', 'The US', 'The Americas', 'US exchange', 'Irish business', 'big growth', 'annual report', 'greater plans', 'possible merger', 'market capitalisation', '22 per cent', '72 per cent', 'green subsidies', 'Biden administration', 'state aid', 'US investors', 'Euronext Dublin', 'ongoing fallout', 'fortune seekers', 'big deal', 'Gene Murtagh', 'greater access', 'Kingspan listing', 'ambitions', 'acquisitions', 'company', 'news', 'approach', 'talks', 'person', 'matter', 'offer', 'hunt', 'READ', 'chance', 'revenue', 'Europe', 'attraction', 'companies', 'way', 'form', 'interest', 'fire', '72 people', 'product', 'material', 'building', 'UK', 'evidence', 'generations']",2023-09-12,2023-09-13,irishtimes.com

The orderbook is diversified across multiple clients  challenge agents and geographies  allowing the management team to effectively optimise its resources and enhance its adaptability and flexibility in managing its revenue pipeline. Coupled with its track record of excellent operational delivery  this provides a strong foundation for future growth.The Group recently announced its plan to move to a new state-of-the-art facility which is due to open in H1 2024. The move will enable the Group to increase its revenue potential by increasing its number of quarantine beds  improving its ability to conduct larger studies faster  enable multiple concurrent trials improving utilisation levels and support the development of new CRO service revenue streams. Additionally  consolidating hVIVO's clinical and laboratory operations into a single location will lead to improved operational efficiencies  further enhancing long term margins. Its current quarantine facilities will remain open until the new facility is fully operational  however by availing of break clauses in its current leases  the Group has ensured an orderly transition to its new and improved facility and as such  will not incur lease costs on any of its legacy quarantine facilities beyond Q3 2024. The Group has minimised the impact from delays in UK clinical trial approvals by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) by working closely with its clients and the MHRA in recent months and has received all outstanding approvals. hVIVO continues to monitor the situation closely  working with its clients to ensure the timely delivery of its studies. hVIVO increases its revenue guidance to £55 million (excluding other income) for 2023 and increases its EBITDA margin guidance for 2023 to c.19%. Dividend The Company intends to pay a nominal annual dividend going forward  details of which will be announced alongside publication of the Group's audited results for FY23. Yamin 'Mo' Khan  Chief Executive Officer of hVIVO  said: ""The first half of 2023 has delivered another period of excellent growth and progress towards our goal of establishing along-termsustainable growth model. The increasing number of trials  as well as the growing volunteer cohorts and expanding use cases  highlights that the human challenge market is experiencing a strong growth trend that we strongly believe will continue over the long term. The outlook for the business is extremely positive  as our newstate-of-the-artfacility sets us up to accelerate our growth over the long term. We are delighted to increase our revenue guidance and EBITDA margin guidance for 2023. Finally  I would like to thank our staff for their continued dedication and boundless enthusiasm as we progress towards our vision to transform global healthcare.""

The Group provides end-to-end early clinical development services to its large  established and growing repeat client base  which includes four of the top 10 largest global biopharma companies. The Group's fast-growing services business includes a unique portfolio of 11 human challenge models  with a number of new models under development  to test a broad range of infectious and respiratory disease products. The Group has world class challenge agent manufacturing capabilities  specialist drug development and clinical consultancy services via its Venn Life Sciences brand  and a lab offering via its hLAB brand  which includes virology  immunology biomarker and molecular testing. The Group offers additional clinical field trial services such as patient recruitment and clinical trial site services. hVIVO runs challenge studies in London from its Whitechapel quarantine clinic  its state-of-the-art QMB clinic with its highly specialised on-site virology and immunology laboratory  and its clinic in Plumbers Row. To recruit volunteers / patients for its studies  the Group leverages its unique clinical trial recruitment capability via its FluCampvolunteer screening facilities in London and Manchester.CEOStatement Forthesixmonthsended30June2023 Establishing a long-term sustainable growth model The first half of 2023 has seen further excellent progress towards our goal of establishing a long-term sustainable growth model. I strongly believe that human challenge trials (HCTs) remain an underutilised means of developing vaccines and antivirals  and over the past 18 months we have seen a significant increase in both the number and size of trials as a greater number of big pharma and biotech companies realise the time and cost savings of HCTs over traditional field trials. The rise in demand for HCTs was reflected in the substantial growth in first half revenues  driven by the delivery of a higher number of challenge trials and the continued growth in our orderbook  which is diversified across clients  challenge agents and geographies. The robust orderbook underpins the sustainable growth trajectory of the Group providing revenue visibility into late 2024. This has enabled management to effectively plan and strategise into the long term. We continued to deliver improved profit margins in the period which translated to robust cash generation. The efficiency initiatives implemented to maximise quarantine bed occupancy and improve volunteer conversion rates are now beginning to deliver sustainable improvements in performance. This is the result of conducting multiple challenge model trials concurrently  with volunteers delivered by our revamped FluCamp volunteer recruitment platform. I believe there are still greater opportunities to drive efficiencies across the Group  and our recently announced move to a larger state-of-the-art facility is a clear indicator that we are committed to further improvement in this regard over the long term. I am very proud of what the team has achieved in H1 2023 and I am inspired by their continued drive and commitment to achieve our shared mission of delivering today's healthcare by empowering tomorrow's innovation. Optimised business model delivers record financial performance hVIVO delivered record revenue of £27.3 million in H1 2023 (H1 2022: £18.0 million)  a 52% increase on H1 2022. The Group recorded exceptional EBITDA growth of 129% to £5.2 million (H1 2022: £2.3 million)  with EBITDA margin increasing to 19.1% (H1 2022: 12.6%). This is the result of our continued focus on optimising hVIVO's business model  driving operational improvements and efficiencies combined with disciplined capital allocation to deliver improved profitability. The focus on operational excellence has enhanced cash generation with net cash of £31.3 million as at 30 June 2023 (H1 2022: £15.9 million). The Group is debt free  has a robust net working capital  and has structured its contracts to be cash flow positive for hVIVO. All of our challenge trial contracts include a non-refundable quarantine booking fee  with milestone payments that are set to forward fund the next phase of the challenge trial. Seeing the benefits of human challenge trials (""HCTs"") The significant uptake in the use of HCTs over the past 18 months has been fuelled by increasing real-world examples of their benefits over traditional field trials. These include expedited development and regulatory review timelines  and early proof of concept data with the potential to increase the valuation of biotech companies and their assets. A few recent examples that have underlined the value proposition of HCTs include: Pfizer's ABRYSVO™  one of the first RSV vaccines to receive FDA approval in May 2023 having received Break- through designationCidara received FDA Fast Track designation for its influenza antiviral candidate in June 2023SAB Biotherapeutics received FDA Breakthrough and Fast Track designation for its influenza antiviral candidate in April 2023 The growth in demand for HCTs is reflected in the increasing scope of the contracts we have signed. Our clients want to collect more information than just whether the drug is effective or not; this additional information may include determining the optimal dose  exploring various primary and secondary endpoints  defining timepoints for late-stage trials and/or comparing products developed through different technologies.

The following matters are on the agenda: Opening of the extraordinary general meeting and registration of attending shareholders and proxies Election of chairman of the meeting and person to co-sign the minutes Approval of the notice and the agenda Reduction of the share capitalThe board of directors of the Company proposes that the general meeting adopts a share capital reduction by passing the following resolution: ""(a) The share capital is reduced from NOK 53 533 395 with NOK 26 766 697.50 to NOK 26 766 697.50. The share capital reduction is done by a reduction of the nominal value of the shares from NOK 1 to NOK 0.5 per share. The reduction amount of NOK 26 766 697.50 shall be used for coverage of loss that cannot be covered otherwise  cf. the Companies Act Section 12-1 first paragraph no. 1. The reduction shall be effective without a creditor notice upon the registration of a notice to the Business Register  cf. the Companies Act Section 12-5 first paragraph . In connection with the capital reduction  the articles of association § 4 is amended from: ""Selskapets aksjekapital er NOK 53 533 395 fordelt på 53 533 395 aksjer  hver pålydende NOK 1."" to «Selskapets aksjekapital er NOK 26 766 697.50 fordelt på 53 533 395 aksjer  hver pålydende NOK 0.5». English translation: ""The Company's share capital is NOK 26 766 697.50 divided on 53 533 395 shares  each with a nominal value of NOK 0.5."" 1DocuSign Envelope ID: 4BA57E92-600C-4538-9965-840B1E12E21A The calculation of the Company's loss is based on the balance sheet of the Company's most recently approved annual financial statements  the financial statements for 2022. The financial statement with the auditor's report is available at the company's office for inspection. The reason for the proposal is that the Company  in the financial statements for 2022  has an uncovered loss that cannot be covered in any other way than by reducing the share capital. Furthermore  it is necessary to reduce the share capital to satisfy equity requirements for conversion of the Company to a public limited liability company  cf. the proposal in item 5 below. Since the capital reduction is carried out without creditor notice  a distribution of dividends cannot be resolved by the Company until three years have passed from the registration in the Business Register  unless the share capital subsequently has been increased by an amount at least equal to the reduction. No events of significant importance to the company have occurred after the last balance sheet date. 5. Conversion into a public limited liability company (ASA) As previously announced to the market  the Company contemplates to move the shares of the Company from Euronext Growth to the main list of Oslo Børs. In this process the Company will need to be converted from a private limited liability company (AS) to a public limited liability company (ASA). The most significant legal effects of a transformation as described include inter alia the following: -The Company will fall under the scope of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act The corporate identity of the Company remains unchanged  with the exception that the company designation ""AS"" must be changed to ""ASA"" or public limited company. -The required share capital in a public limited company must be at least NOK 1 000 000. The company shall have a board of at least three directors and with the necessary gender representationIt will be required for the company to be registered with a central securities depositoryThe shares of a public limited company are freely transferableThe Company may offer its shares to the publicStricter requirements will apply with respect to contributions in kind  transactions with related parties  as well as to mergers and demergers; andThe Company must comply with the accounting rules for large enterprises  cf. section 1-5 of the Norwegian Accounting Act. A Statement from an independent auditor in connection with the conversion is attached to these minutes as Appendix 1. The Company satisfies the minimum required share capital and already has a general manager. The Company's share are freely transferable  and are registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS). The requirement of gender representation on the Board will be fulfilled as a consequence of the proposal in agenda item 5 below  regarding changes to the Board. The Board cannot see that a conversion from AS to ASA will have any negative economic consequences for the share holders  and proposes that the extraordinary general meeting passes the following resolution: The company shall be converted into a public limited company (ASA). Section 1 of the company's Articls of Association is amended to have the following wording: ""§ 1 Selskapets foretaksnavn er Capsol Technologies ASA. Selskapet er et allmennaksjeselskap."" 2DocuSign Envelope ID: 4BA57E92-600C-4538-9965-840B1E12E21A English translation: ""§ 1 The company's name is Capsol Technologies ASA. The company is a public limited liability company."" Changes to the Board of DirectorsTo satisfy the legal requirements to a board of a public limited liability company  as well as the rules related inter alia to independency that will apply for listed companies  the Board proposes that the extraordinary general meeting makes certain changes in the Board composition.On this basis  the Board proposes to the extraordinary general meeting the following resolution:Wendy Lam and Ellen Merete Hanetho are elected as new board members. The election of Wendy Lam shall be effective from 30 September 2023.Additionally  Claes Oskar Nygren shall resign from the Board  and the Board shall hereafter consist of the following members: Endre Ording Sund (chairman)Einar Christen Lange (director)John Arne Ulvan (director)Monika Inde Zsak (director)Wayne Gordon Thomson (director)Wendy Lam (director) (effective as of 30 September 2023)Ellen Merete Hanetho (director) Share option programThe Board proposes that the EGM adopts that Wendy Lam and Ellen Merete Hanetho are included in the Company's existing share option program  on the following key terms:Wendy Lam; 112 500 options  strike price equal to the closing price of the day of the EGM. The options shall have a vesting period of three years  with 1/3 vesting each year.Ellen Merete Hanetho: 112 500 options  strike price equal to the closing price of the day of the EGM. The options shall have a vesting period of three years  with 1/3 vesting each year. 8. Amendments to the Company's Articles of Association The Board proposes to amend the Company's Articles of Association to ensure that there is always a minimum of three Board members. It is proposed that the Articles of Association § 6 hereafter reads as follows: ""§ 6 Styret i selskapet skal bestå av 3 til 9 medlemmer. Selskapet tegnes av to styremedlemmer i fellesskap."" English translation: ""§ 6 The company's Board of Directors shall consist of 3 to 9 members. The signatory rights of the company lie with two board members jointly."" The Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act has been amended with effect from 1 July 2023 by inclusion of a provision in § 5-2 (1) on compulsory record date for shareholders' right to attend and vote at general meetings. As from the same date  amendments to the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act § 5-3 was implemented  entailing that the registration deadline for participation at general meetings cannot be set earlier than two business days prior to the meeting. In order to comply with these regulations  the Board proposes a new § 7 to the Articles of Association  which shall read as follows: 3DocuSign Envelope ID: 4BA57E92-600C-4538-9965-840B1E12E21A ""§ 7 Generalforsamlingen innkalles ved skriftlig henvendelse til alle aksjonærer med kjent adresse. Innkalling skal være sendt senest 14 dager før møtet skal holdes. Aksjonærer eller fullmektiger for disse som ønsker å møte på generalforsamlingen må melde dette til selskapet innen to virkedager før generalforsamlingen. Styret kan bestemme at aksjonærene skal kunne avgi sin stemme skriftlig  herunder ved bruk av elektronisk kommunikasjon  i en periode før generalforsamlingen. For slik stemmegivning skal det benyttes en betryggende metode for å autentisere avsenderen. Når dokumenter som gjelder saker som skal behandles på generalforsamlingen  er gjort tilgjengelige for aksjonærene på selskapets internettsider  gjelder ikke lovens krav om at dokumentene skal sendes til aksjonærene. Dette gjelder også dokumenter som etter lov skal inntas i eller vedlegges innkallingen til generalforsamlingen. En aksjonær kan likevel kreve å få tilsendt dokumenter som gjelder saker som skal behandles på generalforsamlingen. "" English translation: ""§ 7 The general meeting is convened by written notice to all shareholders with a known address. The notice shall be sent no later than 14 days before the date of the meeting. Shareholders or their representatives wishing to attend a general meeting must inform the company of this no later than two business days prior to the general meeting. The Board of Directors may determine that the shareholders shall be able to cast their votes in writing  including by electronic means  during a period preceding the general meeting.

Furthermore  the following new § 8 is proposed to the Articles of Association: ""§ 8 Følgende saker skal behandles og avgjøres i den ordinære generalforsamlingen: Godkjennelse av årsregnskap og årsberetning  herunder utdeling av utbytte.Valg av medlemmer til styret og fastsettelse av godtgjørelse til medlemmer av styret.Godkjennelse av revisors honorar.Andre saker som etter lov eller vedtektene hører under generalforsamlingen.» English translation:""§ 8 The following matters shall be considered and decided by the annual general meeting:""§ 8 The following matters shall be considered and decided by the annual general meeting: Approval of the annual accounts and the annual report  including distribution of dividends.Election of members of the Board of Directors and determination of their remuneration.Approval of the auditor's fee.Other issues which  pursuant to law or the Articles of Association  are to be decided by the general meeting.""

Meanwhile  Vallourec will also detail its significant ambitions in the New Energies sphere and unveil its vertical hydrogen storage concept to the investment community for the first time. Vallourec has set a target for its New Energies business to comprise 10-15% of Group EBITDA by 2030. Vallourec aspires to be one of the most shareholder-friendly companies within its peer group  with cash distribution potentially starting in 2025. The Group is dedicated to creating the circumstances for Vallourec to be able to distribute dividends potentially starting in 2025 and aspires to reach an 80% - 100% cash return ratio based on the Group’s total cash generationa  in line with some of the highest payout ratios in the market. This assumes that Vallourec will have made substantial progress towards its goal of reaching zero net debt in 2025 at the latest. As an illustration  putting together the robust market outlook and the meaningful changes underway at Vallourec  management will present a simulation of the New Vallourec’s midcycleb Group EBITDA  which would be approximately €850 million. Together with the Vallourec midcycle performance simulation assumptions detailed below  this would translate to total cash generation of €450 million.Philippe Guillemot  Chairman of the Board of Directors  and Chief Executive Officer  declared:“We are pleased to spend today reintroducing the New Vallourec to our shareholders  analysts and the broader financial community. Since I joined Vallourec in 2022  we have made significant progress towards our goals of delivering best-in-class profitability and cycle-proofing our business. Together  these will result in a recurring €230 millionc EBITDA uplift  but we are not finished. Today  we will detail the essential nature of our products and services  and why we are optimistic about the demand outlook for these now and years into the future. We remain committed to deleveraging our balance sheet towards zero net debt  and today  for the first time  we have indicated our aspiration to return a significant  peer-leading amount of our total cash generation to shareholders as we accomplish this goal  potentially starting in 2025.”FULL YEAR 2023 OUTLOOKAs part of today’s presentation  Vallourec reiterates its full-year outlook for 2023:Group EBITDA is expected to range between €950 million and €1.1 billion . This includes the following key assumptions: In the US market  Vallourec assumes sales volumes bottom in the third quarter as distributor inventories normalize. Market pricing d is assumed to decrease moderately from the Q2 level. Second half iron ore production sold is expected to be approximately 3.6 million tonnes. The Platts 62% Fe CFR China Index is now assumed to be around $110 per tonne in the second half of 2023 e .This includes the following key assumptions: T otal cash generation is expected to be positive in the second half of the year   excluding any potential benefit from asset sales.  excluding any potential benefit from asset sales. Net debt is expected to decline further in the second half of 2023 versus the second quarter 2023 level.MINE AND FOREST MID-TERM ASSUMPTIONSThe Mine and Forest segment is expected to remain on its expected second half 2023 EBITDA trajectory of around €100 million per year for the near-term. In late 2024  Vallourec anticipates that the Phase 1 mine extension project will be finalized and will lead to an EBITDA increase for the Mine & Forest business of €20 – €25 million per year  assuming iron ore prices broadly consistent with today’s levels. In 2027  Vallourec anticipates a more significant capital project  the Phase 2 mine extension  to be completed. This should lead to further incremental Mine & Forest EBITDA of €50 to €75 million per year. Total capital expenditures for both projects are expected to be less than €150 million and are expected to be spent over the next several years. Vallourec management is currently engaging with state and national regulators to obtain the required production and environmental permits for both extensions.VALLOUREC MIDCYCLE PERFORMANCE SIMULATION ASSUMPTIONSThe midcycle simulated EBITDA would be approximately €850 million. This Group EBITDA would be comprised of Tubes EBITDA at €750 million  Mine and Forest EBITDA at €125 million  and net Holding & Other costs of (€25) million. Assumed capital expenditures for the Group would amount to €175 million  including project capex for the Pau Branco iron ore mine  financial cash out of €50 million and cash taxes of €175 million.Live Broadcast of Vallourec’s Capital Markets DayThe slides and live broadcast of Vallourec’s Capital Markets Day will be available at: https://www.vallourec.com/en/investorsInformation and Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release includes forward-looking statements.

This performance was all the more remarkable for two reasons. On the one hand  it was achieved in a market environment of cautious major contractors. On the other  it followed a demanding base effect with record bookings for Sidetrade in H1 2022. Our ambitious investment policy is now paying off  with the goal of 1/ accelerating our development in North America  2/ expandingour AI-based product offering to provide the most comprehensive Order-to-Cash software suite on the market  and 3/ targeting multinational companies with revenue over $1 billion. By simultaneously implementing all three of these strategic decisions  we have increased our credibility  boosted our appeal to major customers  and ultimately  won multiple contracts internationally.To date  the United States represents a robust growth driver  with revenue up 45% for the period. What's more  our newly launched CashApp solution helped us win tenders the world over. Lastly  the share of subscriptions with companies generating $1 billion-plus revenue now accounts for 76% of Sidetrade's total subscriptions. In the months ahead  we must continue our efforts while staying focused on our development model that combines growth with profitability.""Record first half in 2023 with nearly €6 million in bookings in new Annual Contract Value  up 21%Sidetrade(€m) H1 2023 H1 2022 Change New SaaS subscriptions (New ARR) 3.30 3.04 +9% Services bookings 2.54 1.77 +44% New Annual Contract Value (ACV) 5.84 4.81 +21%2023 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.In H1 2023  Sidetrade delivered its best-ever performance in bookings with new Annual Contract Value (ACV) of €5.84 million  up 21% versus H1 2022 despite a challenging base effect since the latter period already set an historic record for the Group with €4.81 millionin ACV.New SaaS bookings totaled €3.30 million  mainly driven by an exceptional Q2 2023 when Sidetrade achieved the best quarterly performance in its history with €2.41 million in New Annual Recurring Revenue (""New ARR"") signed in one quarter. Parallel to this  services bookings (with almost all invoiced within twelve months of their signing) totaled €2.54 million  up 44% compared to H1 2022. This performance is largely due to the growing number of deployment projects signed worldwide.In H1 2023  the initial contract period for new customers (excluding renewals) rose to 44.8 months versus 43.2 months a year earlier  demonstrating new customers' confidence in Sidetrade. This extended contract period increases the economic model's strong predictability. Attrition remained extremely low for the industry (generally around 10%) with a churn rate of 2.51% at the end of the first half.Sidetrade's winning strategy: Ramp-up in new global contractsThe commercial successes in recent months validate Sidetrade's strategic decision to target companies generating revenue in excess of $1 billion. As such  this first-half performance is largely attributable to the ramp-up in new global contracts with multinationals including Bayer AG  BIC  NIELSENIQ and Dassault Systèmes. Sidetrade benefits from 1/ a technological edge in artificial intelligence  2/ increased credibility with a significant foothold on both sides of the Atlantic to implement and support international contracts  and 3/ an effective salesforce that fosters collaboration between teams in Europe and North America.Sidetrade also cemented its market position following Gartner's recognition for the second year in a row as one of the global Leaders for Integrated Invoice-to-Cash applications.Expansion of Sidetrade's offering: a complete suite for Order-to-Cash cycle and the success of CashAppAnother crucial factor behind this first-half performance is the expanded AI offering which aims to transform Sidetrade's platform into the most comprehensive Order-to-Cash software suite on the market. It includes paperless order processing  real time credit risk management  electronic invoicing  dunning and dispute resolution as well as reconciliation of payments. With respect to the latter  Sidetrade secured its first contracts thanks to its all-new CashApp solution which automates the reconciliation of customers' banked payments with open invoices by leveraging the capabilities of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. CashApp was a resounding success among major customers such as Bayer AG and BIC who both opted to deploy the application worldwide.In H1 2023  bookings by new customers (""New Business"") accounted for 62% of the total new bookings while Cross-selling represented 13% of total new bookings  with the remaining 25% of bookings driven by Upselling of additional modules to existing customers.Robust growth in revenue  up 17%  with SaaS subscriptions up 21%In H1 2023  revenue for 'Order-to-Cash' SaaS subscriptions continued its brisk growth  up 21%.Sidetrade's revenue topped the €20 million mark for the first time in a half year  totaling €20.9 million  an increase of 17% compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. This growth is attributable to two factors:Expansion in the United StatesIn H1 2023  the United States was a growth driver for Sidetrade  posting revenues up 45%. As a result of this successful expansion  international markets now represent 57% of the Company's total revenue  including 27% in North America. Going forward  the United States will continue to be pivotal for Sidetrade's growth.Increasing demand from multinational corporationsAnalysis of customer profiles for 'Order-to-Cash' activities is underpinned by impressive growth of 46% in subscriptions with multinational corporations on annual contracts in excess of €250 000. These subscriptions now account for 42% of Sidetrade's total subscriptions and are expected to remain an important growth driver in the months ahead.In H1 2023  the impact of exchange rates on Sidetrade was not material.Strong results in a context of accelerating investmentRecord gross margin at 81% of revenueSidetrade achieved a record gross margin in H1 2023  representing 81% of total revenue  with an impressive rate of 93% in SaaS subscriptions. This remarkable performance results from Sidetrade's strategy to promote its technological edge  coupled with strict cost control in an inflationary environment.Sidetrade continues to illustrate the robustness of its SaaS model  which generates significant incremental gross margin  year after year.Double-digit profitability at 12%  despite investment of €3.8 million in North AmericaOperating profit for H1 2023 totaled €2.5 million (vs. €2.4 million in H1 2022)  representing 12% of revenue. Profitability slightly increased  remaining in double digits under the combined impact of vigorous revenue growth  an excellent gross margin and efficient cost control.Bolstered by its robust economic model  Sidetrade stepped up investment in North America  which amounted to €3.8 million in H1 2023  up €1.1 million compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. This investment mainly focused on building a regional team of more than 50 colleagues.Operating profit for H1 2023 includes a French Research Tax Credit of €1.3 million  equivalent to that of H1 2022  as well as activation of €0.2 million in marginal R&D costs. It should be noted that H1 2022 included an innovation subsidy (EuroFirmo project) of €0.5 million. Restated for this exceptional item  operating profit would have increased by €0.6 million  up 25%.Corporate income tax for H1 2023 totaled €0.3 million  versus €0.2 million a year earlier.All told  Sidetrade's net profit for H1 2023 was almost stable at €2.2 million  demonstrating that continued growth and profitability are achievable while strategically investing.Note that the acquisition of CreditPoint Software on June 30  2023  will be consolidated into the Group's financial statements from July 1  2023.Solid financial positionOn June 30  2023  Sidetrade reported €24.2 million in gross cash (vs. €20.4 million on December 31  2022). As of June 30  2023  the Company also holds 86 000 of its own shares with a value of €12.1 million.Sidetrade's financial debt stands at €11.4 million (fixed rate at 1.1%)  giving the Group significant investment capacity to accelerate its expansion.Reinforced commitment to responsible growth with a full CSR assessmentIn addition to its robust financial results  Sidetrade is committed to a CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) approach. The latter centers on integrating ESG (Environmental  Social  Governance) challenges into its company strategy.While Sidetrade is not yet bound by regulatory requirements  as an industry-recognized leader  the Company understands the significant role it has in shaping a more responsible and sustainable future. Against this background  Sidetrade has already performed a comprehensive Carbon Assessment (scopes 1  2 and 3) for FY 2022  which applies to activities and regions across the board. This assessment helped the Group to pinpoint the main greenhouse gas emission sources and identify concrete actions to regulate them.On top of this  Sidetrade published its first-ever CSR report (in compliance with the European Union's new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive – CSRD)  showcasing its commitment towards corporate sustainability (see press release of July 26  2023 ). Through this approach  the Company is convinced that it will further cement its industry-leading position.Next financial announcementThird Quarter Revenue for 2023: October 17  2023  after the stock market closes.Investor relationsChristelle Dhrif 00 33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comMedia relationsBecca Parlby 00 44 7824 5055 84 bparlby@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

Revenues In the first half of 2023  the Group's reference market confirmed its great dynamism in continuation of the best performance of 2022. The consolidated turnover thus reached a record value of Euro 48.5 million  an increase of 29.8% compared to the value for the first half of 2022 when it stood at Euro 37.39 million. In particular  the achieved turnover level is due to both a significant volume growth (+12% compared to the same period in 2022) and the achievement of a better sales mix. The group achieved revenue growth in almost all its reference markets  largely driven by European and Asian customers  although the excellent performance of the South American market should not be forgotten  which has finally become dynamic again after the pandemic crisis. Below is the complete breakdown by geographical area for the first six months of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022 (all values are in Euro): Geographical Area 1st half 2023 % 1st half 2023 % Change Change % Latin America 3 946 663 8.1% 1 967 116 5.3% 1 979 547 101% Europe 23 128 674 47.6% 16 613 429 44.4% 6 515 245 39% Italy 3 513 022 7.2% 2 243 381 6.0% 1 269 641 57% North America 8 913 217 18.4% 9 039 968 24.2% (126 751) -1% Middle East & Africa 836 642 1.7% 1 901 412 5.1% (1 064 770) -56% Asia & Pacific 8 203 644 16.9% 5 624 204 15.0% 2 579 440 46% Total 48 541 862 100.0% 37 389 509 100.0% 11 152 352 29.83%Cost of sales During the first six months of 2023  cost of sales showed an improvement in its incidence on revenues compared to the same period of 2022  from 65.7% to 62.7%. This improvement was due to a return of transport costs to pre-pandemic levels and  although to a lesser extent  to an increase in the efficiency of direct personnel costs despite its increase in absolute value (+ 21% compared to H1 2022)  determined by the need to support increased production volumes. Indirect personnel The cost for indirect personnel decreased as a percentage of revenues from 5.8% to 5.1% in the first half of 2022. In absolute terms  the figure for the first half of 2023 was slightly greater in value  following the hiring of some resources at the technical and production structure. Commercial expenses Commercial expenses remained essentially unchanged compared to the first half of 2022. General and administrative General and administrative expenses rose compared to the corresponding figure for 2022  increasing their incidence from 5.4% to 6.6%. The rise in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the increment in external consultancy costs  amounting to €524 000  related to the company acquisition described in the section on events occurred after 30 June 2023 of this press release  and partly to the increase in energy costs. EBITDA and EBITDA Margin As a consequence of the dynamics described above  EBITDA for the first six months of 2023 amounted to Euro 12.1 million  showing an increase of Euro 3.76 million (+45.3%) compared to the same period in 2022. An improvement is also observed in terms of EBITDA margin  with the figure reaching 24.9% of revenue (22.2% in the first six months of the previous year). As recently announced  on 8th September  B&C Speakers took over Eminence Speakers (a historic professional audio brand with production sites in the US and China). BC incurred a large part of the preparatory expenses for the settlement of this transaction during the first half of 2023. The effect of these non-recurring costs  amounting to about EUR 524 thousands  caused the EBITDA margin to decrease by about 1 percentage point. EBITDA and EBITDA margin gross and net of this effect are shown in the table below: (€ thousands) 1 half 2023 Incidence 1 half 2022 Incidence Ebitda 12 059 24.84% 8 298 22.19% Costs for business aggregation 524 1.08% - 0.00% Ebitda adjusted 12 583 25.92% 8 298 22.19% Amortisation and depreciation Amortisation and depreciation of tangible and intangible assets and utilisation rights were substantially in line with the first half of the previous year and amounted to €1 035 thousand (€996 thousand in the corresponding period of 2022).EBIT and EBIT Margin EBIT for the first six months of 2023 amounted to Euro 11.02 million  an increase of 52.2% compared to the same period of 2022 (Euro 7.24 million). The EBIT margin is 22.7% of revenue (19.4% in the same period of 2022). Group Net Profit The Group Net Profit  at the end of the first six months of 2023  amounted to Euro 8.11 million and represented 16.7% of consolidated revenue  with an overall increase of 85.1% compared to the corresponding period of 2022. The overall Net Financial Position was negative and amounted to Euro 7.8 million  compared to a value of Euro 9.4 million at year-end 2022. The excellent generation of operating cash flow for the period (core business generated cash of EUR 9.1 million in the first half of 2023) had a positive impact on the Net Financial Position. This allowed the payment of a dividend of Euro 6.5 million and the fulfilment of the maturities of existing loans  without negatively affecting the total net financial debt.

As already announced to the market in a press release of 8 September 2023  the Parent Company B&C Speakers S.p.A acquired 100% of the share capital of Eminence Speaker LLC (a company incorporated under US law) from Eminence Holdings LLC and  simultaneously  committed itself to purchase from Eminence Dongguan Enterprise Co. Ltd  (also owned by of Eminence Holdings LLC)  a significant portion of its assets through a NewCo (whose establishment is an essential condition for the accomplishment of the agreement) entirely owned by B&C. The two transactions described above represent a significant step forward in the internationalisation strategy of B&C Speakers. The Group will now benefit from two additional production facilities (one in the USA and one in China) where Eminence brand products are manufactured. Eminence is an historic brand in professional audio and very strong in sectors where the B&C Group's presence is historically smaller. Business outlook The mood of the reference market is very positive towards the current year and confirms that the year can close on better production and sales levels than in 2022. The Group's management  given the return to normality of logistics costs and the current stability of input costs  believes that the conditions are in place to work on progressively improving production and structural efficiency. The acquisition of Eminence Speaker will guarantee greater visibility to the entire Group and  reasonably  we believe we will be able to observe the first positive effects as early as the current financial year.,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,mixed,0.33,0.35,0.32,True,English,"['B&C Speakers S', 'Interim Report', 'Board', 'Directors', 'Operations', '30 September', '10:06', 'PRESS RELEASE B&C Speakers S.p.A.', 'Euronext STAR Milan segment', 'historic professional audio brand', 'net financial position', 'leading international players', 'Italian Stock Exchange', 'first six months', 'South American market', 'significant volume growth', 'external consultancy costs', 'Interim Management Report', 'direct personnel costs', 'Group Comprehensive Income', 'Eminence Speakers', 'professional use', 'Interim Report', 'reference market', 'first half', 'clear growth', 'Indirect personnel', 'transport costs', 'energy costs', 'non-recurring costs', 'electroacoustic transducers', 'great dynamism', 'best performance', 'same period', 'revenue growth', 'Asian customers', 'excellent performance', 'pandemic crisis', 'complete breakdown', 'geographical area', 'Latin America', 'North America', 'Middle East', 'pandemic levels', 'lesser extent', 'Commercial expenses', 'company acquisition', 'previous year', '8th September', 'large part', 'preparatory expenses', 'business aggregation', 'intangible assets', 'utilisation rights', '1st half', 'production volumes', 'production structure', 'production sites', 'Consolidated revenue', 'administrative expenses', 'Consolidated EBITDA', 'EBITDA Margin', 'turnover level', 'absolute terms', '1 percentage point', 'record value', 'absolute value', 'sales mix', 'corresponding figure', 'Incidence Ebitda', 'Board', 'Directors', 'June', 'trend', 'revenues', 'margins', 'profits', 'Bagno', 'Ripoli', 'field', 'design', 'distribution', 'marketing', 'accordance', 'IFRS', 'continuation', 'increase', 'achievement', 'European', 'values', 'Italy', 'Africa', 'Pacific', 'improvement', 'return', 'efficiency', 'H1', 'need', 'hiring', 'resources', 'technical', 'General', 'rise', 'increment', 'section', 'events', 'consequence', 'dynamics', 'China', 'BC', 'settlement', 'transaction', 'effect', 'thousands', 'table', 'Amortisation', 'depreciation', 'line', '2023']",2023-09-12,2023-09-13,marketscreener.com

Our Property Investment division reported strong operating and sales momentum in advance of deliveries to Mayotte  which will contribute to the expansion of the Group's portfolio and rental income in the coming months. Due to the island nature of our territory  our residential Property development division remains robust. Most of the numerous programs launched last year and presently under development have been commercialized. In addition  we are preparing to initiate the sale of new retail and block programs to bolster our portfolio against a backdrop of widely divergent interest rates. According to Géraldine Neyret  Chief Executive Officer of CBo Territoria  “We are confidently pursuing our growth strategy thanks to our agile  expert team  which is committed to the responsible growth of our region.”The Board of Directors of CBo Territoria (ISIN: FR0010193979 - CBOT)  a leading real estate player in La Réunion for nearly two decades  met on Monday  September 11  2023  to ratify the interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30  2023. The Statutory Auditors' review report on the half-year financial information was issued today without reservation.CHANGES IN ECONOMIC PORTFOLIOCBo Territoria is pursuing its strategy of real estate development in the commercial sector and  as of June 30  2023  held a diversified portfolio of commercial properties[5] with solid underlying performances:Valuation of €300.8 million (81% of total assets[6]) for 133 000 m 2   stable over six months   stable over six months  Occupancy rate of 97%  (vs. 98% as of December 31  2022)  confirming the quality of assets held Gross annualized rental income of €24.5 million (including equity affiliates) vs. €23.8 million at year-end 2022) Gross yield of 7.7% including transfer taxes (vs. 7.4% at year-end 2022).At the end of June 2023  the Group also owned 214 housing units  which will be sold in the medium term.The Group's total economic assets6 are valued at €372.9 million excluding transfer duties  stable compared with year-end 2022 (€373.0 million). Commercial properties account for 81% of this total. The portfolio's aggregate value  excluding transfer taxes (including ongoing commercial projects)  stood at €395.1 million as of June 30  2023 (vs. €388.1 million at year-end 2022).HALF-YEAR 2023 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEProperty Investment: Net Recurring Revenues (€6.0 million  +21%)At the end of June 2023  gross rental revenues from commercial property rose by 9.5% to €12.9 million (including €1.8 million share of equity affiliates)  and gross rental income from commercial property excluding equity affiliates by 8.9%. The net commercial rental revenues rose by +7.4% to €12.1 million (+6.7% excluding equity affiliates of €1.7 million). The increase breaks down into +1.3% scope effect  +4.5% indexation  +1.6% other effects (variable rents).Because of disposals during the period  residential and agricultural assets generated €1.4 million in gross rental income in the first half of 2023  compared to €1.6 million as of June 30  2022.The Property Investment division's net recurring revenues increased by 21.0% year-over-year to €6.0 million.Property Development: Development margin (€4.7 million  -8.9%)In the first half of 2023  CBo Territoria recorded reservations (order book) of €19.0 million for residential programs only (compared to €35.4 million in H1 2022  which included €5.3 million for commercial programs)  of which €7.6 million (31 lots) were reserved by individuals and €11.0 million (65 lots) were reserved for building plots. After the high level of investment in 2022  demand remains robust pending the launch of new programs presently on the market (Pinel  Bloc  approximately 200 building plots). Thus  the supply of residential units at the end of June was €22.2 million (compared to €29 million as of June 30  2022)  and visibility remains high with a backlog of €46.2 million in residential units at the end of June 2023 (compared to €33.9 million as of June 30  2022).As of June 2023  Property Development revenues reached €28.5 million  an increase of 36.7% year-over-year. Residential sales accounted for 88% of the total  with an increase of 36.8% to €25.0 million  propelled by a doubling of block sales (€10.6 million) and Pinel programs (€8.0 million) compared to H1 2022. Thus  the product mix has changed considerably over the past year. For the record  46% of H1 2022 sales were made up of plot sales in the western tourist zone  generating particularly high margins.Revenues from commercial property development  an opportunistic activity  increased by 36% to €3.5 million during the first semester  reflecting the progress made on the ESPMR premises  which were delivered in March  and the sale of the last available commercial lot in the Portail economic zone.Overall  the margin rate remains high given the change in product mix  at 16.6% (vs. 24.9% in H1 2022)  with a development margin of €4.7 million (-8.9%).Earnings from operations €12.6 million (+8.6%) and net income Group share €9.8 million (+17.1%)As a result  operating income  of which 70% consists of net rental income from the Property Investment division  increased by 8.6% to €12.6 million as of June 30  2023.Net income Group share increased by +17.1% year-over-year to €9.8 million  or €0.27/share (vs. €0.23 as of June 30  2022) after taking into account a change in fair value of €1.0 million related to the progress of the Combani project in Mayotte (compared with €-0.3 million as of June 30  2022)  and a one-off reduction in the cost of net debt of €0.9m at €2.0m (compared with €2.9m at 30 June 2022). This decline was mainly due to the increase in financial costs capitalised (expense transfer) in connection with the Combani projects  amounting to €1.1m (compared with €0.4m at 30 June 2022).Restated net assets: €238.6 million (+0.5% vs. year-end 2022 and +4.6% over 12 months)As of June 30  2023  restated net assets totaled €238.6 million  up from €228.2 million as of June 30  2022 (+4.6%) and €237.5 million as of December 31  2022 (+0.5%). Half-year earnings counterbalance the distribution of the €8.6 million dividend in 2022. On a per-share basis  the restated net asset value rose by +4.6% over 12 months to €6.66 (vs. €6.37 as of June 30  2022).Solid financial structure and cash position - Diversified  secure debt profileCBo Territoria issued again an Ornane[7]maturing in June 2028 via private placement in June 2023 for €15.1 million  replacing the Ornane issued in 2018 (for €30 million) and maturing in July 2024. This transaction allows the Group to diversify its sources of financing and confirms the confidence of institutional investors (the majority of whom had already subscribed to the previous issue) in its development model in a more challenging economic climate for publicly traded real estate stocks.The Group repaid roughly €32.1 million in loans during the first semester  including €22.6 million in Ornane 2018. The Group's gross financial debt thus decreased to €180.4 million as of June 30  2023  from €195.4 million at the end of December 2022. Approximately 85% of the Group's gross financial debt consisted of mortgage financing  while the remaining 15% consisted of outstanding Ornane stock and the PGE (state-guaranteed loan)  which is presently being amortized. After these transactions  CBo Territoria's cash position remains solid at €21.0 million.After accounting for hedging instruments  84% of financial debt is at a fixed interest rate. The average cost of debt is 3.4% (compared to 2.9% as of December 31  2022)  with a maturity of 8 years and 5 months (+4 months compared to year-end 2022).The loan-to-value ratio (LTV) excluding transfer taxes was 36.3% at the end of June  compared to 36.8% at the end of 2022 and 41.5% at the end of June 2022.

Photo: Jason Clarke PhotographyThe incoming chief financial officer (CFO) of Smurfit WestRock  if the packing mega-merger goes ahead  has downplayed the implications of a sharp drop in the acquirer’s shareprice after terms of the deal were announced.The Irish shares fell after detailed terms of a proposed merger with US packaging giant WestRock were announced.Ken Bowles  Smurfit Kappa’s chief financial officer  said the share price drop of as much as 9pc was a “normal” reaction reflecting a number of factors  including hedge fund positions and some shareholders selling off shares due to the proposed US re-listing.“I think what we’ll find  over time  is it will settle back down and come back a bit. There is no sense of whether this is a reaction – positive or negative – to the deal. I think it is a normal kind of market-based reaction that you would generally see in large-scale acquisitions and mergers like this ” he said.“Clearly there are a few moving parts to it ” Mr Bowles told the Irish Independent over the phone.While that US listing looks like another blow to the Irish stock market  Smurfit Kappa is and will remain “a proud Irish company”  he said.Read more Smurfit Kappa confirms merger with US firm WestRockThe merged business – to be known as Smurfit WestRock – will be incorporated and tax resident in Ireland  with global headquarters in Dublin.However  its stock market listing will be in the US  the latest in a slew of big names exiting Euronext Dublin  the former Irish Stock Exchange.“The (listing) move to the US is more around a company this scale and size being in the most liquid and deep capital markets in the world  and equally it’s where our peer set is in terms of paper and packaging. So it’s a more logical home for the Smurfit WestRock assets than any European exchange.“The reality is that Smurfit Kappa is a proud Irish company and we remain a proud Irish company  and so the headquarters and the global headquarters and the domicile being in Ireland is very much important in this transaction.”Smurfit Kappa’s Irish leadership  led by third generation CEO Tony Smurfit and MrBowes himself  will take the helm of the soon-to-be-merged group and it will be chaired by the current Smurfit Kappa chair.If the deal comes off  the merged business will be a packaging giant that had combined revenues for the last 12 months of $34bn (€31.7bn)  while combined adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation were $5.5bn (€5.13bn).Smurfit WestRock will seek a primary listing in New York and retain a secondary listing in London.Smurfit shares fell more than 9pc in UK trading after the merger announcement yesterday morning.The merger is slated to create “the largest listed global packaging partner by revenue”  the two companies said  with a global staff of around 100 000.Mr Bowles said the transaction – which will see Smurfit Kappa shareholders owning 50.4pc of the new company and WestRock shareholders taking 49.6pc – reflected the “natural mechanics of the exchange rate” and share counts of both companies.Under the deal  WestRock shareholders will get one new share of Smurfit WestRock and $5 in cash for each share they currently have  which Mr Bowles said was partly reflective of the Smurfit leadership team remaining in place.“The five dollars is kind of the small amount of incremental capital which actually  in this deal  just aligned the relative multiples. We’re merging on the same multiple  which is about seven times.“In terms of the roles and responsibilities  clearly part of the $5 goes to that  but I think you would also look at industry expertise and time in the industry.“I think it’s fair to say you’ve got a more experienced management team on this side of the house than maybe on the WestRock side of the house.”Mr Bowles said it was too early to say whether there would be job losses once the merger goes through  which is not expected until the second quarter next year  subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.The businesses for the most part are complementary rather than overlapping – with WestRock’s US market presence something Europe focused Smurfit Kappa has lacked.Still  the companies expect “synergies” of more than $400m by the end of the first full year following the merger  but it will require one-off cash costs of around $235m.Packaging firms saw a pandemic boost as online shopping took off  but that premium has pared back as inflation and higher costs bit  with Smurfit Kappa’s half-year results showing a drop in revenue and profit.But Mr Bowles said that the industry could be “through that tougher part” of the cycle  with inflation slowing and interest rate hikes nearing a peak.“As we move through the fourth quarter of this year and into next year  I think the demand profile is much better. So I’m not worried about the bottom line of either entity on its own  or the combined entity next year.”,neutral,0.02,0.88,0.09,mixed,0.23,0.38,0.4,True,English,"['Ken Bowles', 'share price', 'merger terms', 'Smurfit', 'WestRock', 'Smurfit Kappa Chairman Irial Finan', 'third generation CEO Tony Smurfit', 'Company Secretary Gillian Carson-Callan', 'incoming chief financial officer', 'current Smurfit Kappa chair', 'former Irish Stock Exchange', 'US packaging giant WestRock', 'Irish stock market', 'Jason Clarke Photography', 'hedge fund positions', 'experienced management team', 'stock market listing', 'deep capital markets', 'proud Irish company', 'US market presence', 'Smurfit leadership team', 'first full year', 'The Irish shares', 'Smurfit WestRock assets', 'global packaging partner', 'one new share', 'interest rate hikes', 'share price drop', 'Smurfit Kappa shareholders', 'CFO Ken Bowles', 'Irish leadership', 'exchange rate', 'Irish Independent', 'new company', 'European exchange', 'Smurfit shares', 'incremental capital', 'Packaging firms', 'US listing', 'New York', 'global staff', 'share counts', 'listing) move', 'primary listing', 'secondary listing', 'US re-listing', 'Mr Bowles', 'WestRock shareholders', 'packing mega-merger', 'sharp drop', 'normal kind', 'large-scale acquisitions', 'moving parts', 'big names', 'logical home', 'last 12 months', 'UK trading', 'natural mechanics', 'five dollars', 'small amount', 'relative multiples', 'same multiple', 'job losses', 'second quarter', 'regulatory approvals', 'pandemic boost', 'online shopping', 'higher costs', 'half-year results', 'fourth quarter', 'next year', 'demand profile', 'global headquarters', 'normal” reaction', 'market-based reaction', 'most part', 'tougher part', 'US firm', 'WestRock side', 'Euronext Dublin', 'cash costs', 'two companies', 'industry expertise', 'detailed terms', 'merger announcement', '2022 AGM', 'implications', 'acquirer', 'shareprice', 'deal', '9pc', 'number', 'factors', 'time', 'sense', 'mergers', 'phone', 'blow', 'business', 'Ireland', 'slew', 'size', 'liquid', 'world', 'peer', 'paper', 'reality', 'domicile', 'transaction', 'MrBowes', 'group', 'revenues', 'earnings', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'London', 'largest', '50.4pc', '49.6pc', 'place', 'roles', 'house', 'synergies', 'one-off', 'premium', 'inflation', 'profit', 'cycle', 'peak']",2023-09-12,2023-09-13,independent.ie
