This surge in activity is expected to directly translate into a substantial boost in our revenue.(See: https://www.artprice.com )Artprice by Artmarket now offers a completely new website that was redesigned in collaboration with the Vahumana team (TRSb Group) of high-level external consultants closely involved in the audit  development  and complete overhaul of Artprice since 2018  using a solid UI/UX approach. UX and UI (User Experience and User Interface) both rely on user-centric approaches to website design.This new intuitive and user-friendly website  with simplified access  has brought together the numerous high value-added data banks of Artprice.com  its subsidiaries  and its numerous departments  thus allowing easy and direct access to the most important  most relevant  and most exhaustive information on the art market.Particular attention has been paid to the development of our mobile version. It's not merely a scaled-down ""app"" version  which might struggle to capture the full richness of the desktop experience and would remain reliant on operating systems with their continuous cycle of upgrades and fixes.The feedback from customers and members is unanimous: “The new site is so much more pleasant to use and allows you to navigate through rich and varied content.”Customers and users are discovering information they never knew existed. The change is so dramatic that some users think Artprice has been involved in a merger or an acquisition! For its financial partners and shareholders  this new version represents a real “game changer”.The new intuitive search bar  in a central position  offers instant access to a comprehensive tree structure around the subject of the search  which ultimately generates an increase in the time spent on Artprice.com .Our new search engine instantly connects to information on 821 500 artists  16 261 100 auction results  and price-index data (including 1 087 500 auction lots referenced over the last 12 months from 7 200 auction houses around the globe) and to all the art market data in our databanks stretching back to the 4th century.Artprice by Artmarket thus offers the world's most elaborate and exhaustive search engine on the art market and solidly confirms its reputation as the World Leader in Art Market Information for the past 25 years.Test it and you will see! The universal search bar shows all the possible information available around the element searched: artists  works in future and past auctions  art market indices  works available on our standardized Artprice.com Marketplace  relevant articles in our ArtMarketInsight® archive  art market reports (annual  semestrial  segment-focused  etc.) and of course  all the relevant data and images in our databases (including signatures and monograms  catalogs raisonnés  archived historical data  etc.) that has been selected  checked and digitally recorded from the colossal archives that Artprice has purchased around the world over the past 25 years (see Artmarket.com's Universal Registration Document as filed with the AMF – France's Financial Markets Authority).Artprice.com by Artmarket's use of algorithmic AI for its own Intuitive Artmarket ® AI also allows access to very relevant and highly personalized recommendations concerning artists  works  sales  and even art history – allowing users to go infinitely further in their discovery and knowledge of the art market.Artprice Images® allows unlimited access to the largest collection of art market images in the world  with its collection of manuscripts and sales catalogs forming a physical and digital library made up of 180 million images or engravings of artworks from 1700 to the present day  all commented by our art historians.In this highly specific economic sector  no art market-related company in the world has such a massive volume of ultra-qualified and proprietary data  with the original paper archives representing a very important asset and an almost impregnable barrier to entry.It's worth noting that Artprice by Artmarket has achieved the prestigious distinction of receiving France's state-endorsed 'Innovative Company' label for two consecutive years—an accomplishment that is quite rare among companies listed on regulated markets. This esteemed recognition is bestowed following rigorous eligibility criteria and is conferred by the Banque Publique d'Investissement (bpifrance).Artprice's new online architecture integrates new communication spaces for advertisers  with a back-office for the completely autonomous management of their advertisements. The 2023/2024 target for Artprice by Artmarket is to double its turnover.According to thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice: “More than ever  the Art Market reflects the world we live in: a world that cherishes all that is beautiful and rare  most of which is finite. We must therefore constantly reinvent by creating new ways to enrich our souls.”We are seeing a new phase of market acceleration  driven by a growing number of new collectors  particularly in Greater Asia  eager to participate in the exchange of artworks  a commerce that is an integral part of our humanity.With the 2023/2024 dedicated advertising spaces our customers will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will be privileged players within a human and informative approach.After several months of consultations with users  we have refined the user interface of our Standardized Marketplace to streamline the process of accessing artworks available for sale  whether through fixed pricing or auctions  as well as facilitating the seamless posting of online advertisements. The target is to substantially increase the flow of transactions in a market where roughly 70 000 artworks are available every day.As planned in its 2023/2024 calendar  Artprice has therefore opened its paid spaces (in compliance with IAB standards) to the art market. This historic opening implies a radical change in our economic model  with paying advertisers fully integrated into its databases and services  its Artists pages  and its Web 3.0. However  every effort will be made to ensure the discretion of the advertising in terms of design and ergonomics for its clients and subscribing members.The new digital modules available to its advertisers offer a multitude of locations  with choices of language  media  duration  and prices  while harmoniously respecting the primary raison d'être of providing access to Artprice's databases  which remains our company's fundamental DNA.The significant and highly successful rollout of Artprice's IT infrastructure will generate new turnover from paid new subscriptions and new revenue from advertising that will be fully integrated into the Artprice by Artmarket databases and services  allowing advertisers complete control over their digital campaigns. Together  these new sources of income should double our company's turnover within 12 months.As regards the advertising revenue  our principal targets are of course the 7 200 auction houses around the world  the vast majority of whom have been affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and 98% of whom now announce their physical or digital sales on the Internet (including their post-Covid “online sales”).The second group of potential advertisers are organizers of Art World events such as fairs and exhibitions which are mushrooming on all five continents of the globe. In the Contemporary and Modern Art segments alone  Artprice counts nearly 400 such events.And who will their advertising be aimed at? The 18 000 fine art valuers and appraisers  the art insurers  the 32 000 galleries  and the 4 500 art museums and institutions around the world  all will benefit from highly targeted digital communication.All these potential advertisers and their targets are customers who have subscribed to Artprice's databases for a very long time.The 7 200 global auction houses affiliated with Artprice can now highlight their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  in paid advertiser mode  according to very specific search criteria  while strictly respecting European (GDPR) and American laws on personal data of Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members.Remember  for over 70 years now the standard economic model of an auction house includes an advertising budget to announce details of public sales that represents 34% of its overall costs  regardless of the country or the size of the operator. With the advent of digital advertising making it possible to respond instantly to advertisers  this budget can only grow.In practice  auction houses hosting meticulously cataloged sales  regardless of their scale  gain insight into artworks that may potentially remain unsold due to a lack of buyers or unmet reserve prices. This information is typically conveyed through purchase orders or ATPs (Advance Payment Terms)  which they receive approximately 3 to 4 days prior to each auction.In such cases  the auction house is ready to deploy ultra-targeted digital campaigns in a few hours to make the most of its upcoming sale. Only Artprice  with its data centers  it's engineering  and its processes can respond to this type of request  24 hours a day  and on a global scale.In summary  the new online version of Artprice.com by Artmarket is a real paradigm shift  but it remains 100% faithful to the historical DNA of Artprice and to the primordial postulate of its founder  thierry Ehrmann – to make art market information as accessible and transparent to the widest possible population.

30116,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/five-stocks-for-investors-who-want-to-broaden-their-growth-horizons-beyond-the-s-p-500-e24977cf,Five stocks for investors who want to broaden their growth horizons beyond the S&P 500,Regardless of political risks  investors can be well served by participating in large economies with a rapidly growing middle class.,U.S. investors know how successful a strategy of investing in the S&P 500 through an index fund has been  especially as large technology companies have led such strong growth over the past decade. But markets change  as is being proven by the rise in U.S. interest rates. And tech isn’t always the leading choice for investing.Below are five stocks described by two money managers who specialize in markets outside the U.S. for investors who wish to ride along with long-term growth trends.First  to make the case that U.S. technology firms aren’t always in the lead  here is a comparison of average annual returns over the past 10 years for the S&P 500 SPX and its sectors through Sept. 13  with the same calculations for the previous 10-year period:Index or sector Average annual return – past 10 years Average annual return – previous 10-year period S&P 500 12.3% 7.4% Information Technology 20.9% 6.7% Consumer Discretionary 12.5% 9.4% Healthcare 11.9% 7.9% Industrials 10.4% 8.3% Financials 10.0% 0.0% Utilities 9.3% 9.8% Consumer Staples 9.1% 10.0% Materials 9.1% 8.9% Real Estate 7.6% 9.0% Communication Services 7.4% 8.5% Energy 5.1% 14.0% Source: FactSetThe technology sector has been the runaway leader over the past decade  but the previous 10-year period told a different story.In addition to looking beyond tech  which has such a high concentration within the S&P 500  investors might want to add exposure outside the U.S. to take advantage of growing middle classes in emerging markets and innovation in other developed markets.Priyanka Agnihotri of Brown Advisory is based in London and manages the Brown Advisory Sustainable International Leaders Fund BISLX  which was established Feb. 28  2022. Brown Advisory tends to hold 25 to 35 stocks of companies based in any market outside the U.S. During an interview  she discussed three of the fund’s holdings  including HDFC Bank HDB  +1.04%   which is the largest private bank in India  where government-owned banks have traditionally dominated financial services. The fund’s benchmark is the MSCI ACWI ex-U.S. Index.James Thom  Abrdn’s senior director of Asian equities  also named three examples of non-U.S. stocks during an interview  including HDFC. He is based in Singapore and works on various portfolios for the firm’s private and institutional clients. HDFC is held within the India Fund IFN  a closed-end fund established in 1994 that is available to U.S. investors  and for which Abdrn Asia Ltd. serves as adviser. IFN’s benchmark is the MSCI India Index.Here are three-year compound annual growth rates (CAGR) for the five companies’ revenue and earnings per share through 2022  along with estimated two-year CAGR for these items from 2023 through 2025. For comparison  the same growth numbers and estimates are shown for exchange-traded funds that track the above-mentioned funds’ benchmarks and the S&P 500:Company Ticker Country Three-year sales per share CAGR through 2022 Two-year estimated sales CAGR through 2025 Three-year EPS CAGR through 2022 Two-year estimated EPS CAGR through 2025 HDFC Bank Limited ADR HDB  +1.04% India 6.0% 21.7% 13.6% 17.6% Deutsche Boerse AG DB1  -0.03% Germany 18.0% 3.4% 14.1% 4.0% LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE MC  +1.78% France 13.9% 8.0% 25.3% 8.9% Budweiser Brewing Co.

She said she was comfortable with HDFC because the bank had taken a careful approach during multiple credit cycles. Now it has become a leader in making consumer loans easily available through smartphone apps.Both Agnihotri and Thom pointed to a new growth opportunity for the bank through mortgage lending  which has been expanded after a complex transaction with its former holding company resulted in its taking on mortgage and life insurance subsidiaries.Thom said HDFC has had a “fantastic track record  delivering consistent growth” along with that of the financial industry in India. He also pointed to the bank’s scale as a driver of efficiency  as it has about a 70% market share among nongovernment banks in India.He described an evolution of the country’s banking market  with an accelerating transition to digital services as the government develops its Open Network Credit Enablement system. This system “helps to aggregate personal data and credit histories on the digital network ” to make credit easier to access for people in all socioeconomic groups ” Thom said. The identification will be done with a thumbprint. Thom called this development “interesting and exciting ” because it can open more forms of credit to large groups of people  rather than limiting the banks strictly to collateralized loans.Deutsche Boerse AGDeutsche Boerse AG DB1  -0.03% is expected by analysts working for brokerage firms to show the slowest increases in revenue and earnings per share over the next two years among the five companies in the table  above. However  Agnihotri believes the company is reasonably valued  especially when taking cash flow into account.She said that as the owner of the largest derivatives trading exchange in Europe  Deutsche Boerse has a special advantage because of high barriers for potential competitors and because it is also a major player in securities trading  custody and settlement services. The company has also been expanding its data and analytics business  she said  through bolt-on acquisitions.“The business model is very attractive — 80% of the cost is fixed ” she said “You can grow with little incremental cost.”LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SEIt is easy to expect the popularity of luxury brands to continue to increase as the world’s middle class expands. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE MC  +1.78% has no shortage of luxury brands  including the ones that are part of its name  as well as Tiffany  Christian Dior  Fendi  TAG Heuer  Bulgari and many others.Agnihotri said she admires the company’s “incredibly long-term” approach to managing the “balance between desirability and exclusivity” for its brands.The conglomerate’s last major acquisition was Tiffany in 2020  and according to Agnihotri  it has already doubled the unit’s profits by increasing investments in marketing for what was already a strong brand. She said LVMH had done the same after acquiring Bulgari in 2011 and Dior in 2017.“Dior is growing 20% annually. They have been able to raise prices [for a brand that is] potentially under-monetized ” she said.Budweiser Brewing Co. APAC Ltd.Budweiser Brewing Co. APAC Ltd. 1876  +0.48% is based in Hong Kong and majority owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA BUD  +1.48% . So this is  essentially  a U.S. company  although most of its beer sales are in China.Thom said that no matter where this subsidiary is based or its stock listed  he believes in the company’s growth potential in China’s premium beer market. You can see in the table that analysts expect rapid earnings growth through 2025.He described the segmentation of the beer market in China  with local brands taking the less expensive segment. As the middle class grows  there is more opportunity for the company beyond its flagship Budweiser brand  especially in the country’s wealthier coastal cities  he noted.At the “super-premium level ” Budweiser Brewing Co. is set to compete well with brands such as Corona  Hoegaarden and Stella Artois  he said.The stock has fallen 30% this year  with dividends reinvested  as concerns over China’s slowing economic growth have taken their toll. But Thom said he still believes the company is well-positioned as middle-class household formation continues its long-term upward path in the country.Taiwan SemiconductorInvestors may be concerned over the prospect of China making an aggressive move to take over Taiwan. But no matter how the political situation develops  Thom said he is confident about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM  +0.81% because “it is almost as if it is too important to fail.”“Irrespective of whether it is in Taiwanese or Chinese control  the world needs what they produce. They have an effective monopoly on advance chip manufacturing ” he said.Don’t miss: 20 stocks of aerospace and defense companies expected to grow sales most quickly through 2025,neutral,0.18,0.81,0.01,positive,0.59,0.4,0.01,True,English,"['Five stocks', 'growth horizons', 'S&P 500', 'investors', 'LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE MC', 'Brown Advisory Sustainable International Leaders Fund BISLX', 'SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY', 'Open Network Credit Enablement system', 'Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

It was not easy to establish a business combination for commercial real estate in the past period. Nevertheless  we succeeded to start with an outstanding portfolio in the UK and US  expanding further already in the second month after the business combination clearly showing the strength of our proposition.That being said  2023 is a transitional year for New Amsterdam Invest. As a result of different regulatory requirement around the transition from SPAC to operational company we have to take significant non-cash one-off costs making 2023 overall loss-making. Going forward we expect to be profitable and well on track in 2024 to realize the financial objectives we have set out at listing.""Summary results for the first six months of 2023The greater part of the first half of 2023 was devoted to management efforts to realize a business combination for the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) New Amsterdam Invest. It turned out not to be easy to identify one or more operating companies in the real estate industry  which would meet most of the Company's financial and quantitative parameters. On that basis  the Company decided to look for multiple operating companies that could be grouped together in a business combination meeting the required parameters and factors.On 2 June 2023  the Company shareholders' approved the incorporation of Somerset Park B.V. (""Somerset Park"") as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company with the intention to maintain a group of commercial investments under Somerset Park. Subsequently  the status of the Company as a SPAC ended (""de-SPAC""). Somerset Park  along with management and operating companies in relevant jurisdictions  form a group of international companies in the commercial real estate industry.As a result  the Company operated for most of the first half year as a SPAC and only for the last four weeks in HY 2023 as an international operating company for commercial real estate. This implies that the results for the first half year are not characteristic for the Company's regular operational results going forward. Showing a net income of €0.1 million the real estate operations over this period where profitable.Build up result from real estate operations to result according to interim financial report [3] (* €1 000) 2023HYRental income 544Direct related costs (108)Net Rental income 436Operating expenses (308)Result from real estate operations (2 - 30 June) 128SPAC operational costs (310)De-SPAC one-off costs (2 849)Operating result (2 990)Financial income 402Result before tax (2 588)Taxation (9)Result for the period (2 597)The reported result for the first half year 2023 amounts to €2.6 million loss.This result is mainly attributable to a number of mainly non-cash one-offs to realize the transition from SPAC to a group of operating companies in commercial real estate like €0.5 million on the required documentation (Circular) as well as a required revaluation under IFRS of investment property of €2.3 million. A positive contributor was €0.5 million in interest received on the Escrow account. The running costs prior to the Business Combination came at €0.3 million.The results from group companies have been included and consolidated within The Company's Accounts results for periods from 2 June 2023 to 30 June 2023.Number of shares issued per 30 June 2023In addition  the Company has issued a total of 4 910 250 Warrants (IPO and BC) that will automatically and mandatorily convert when the closing price of the Ordinary Shares on Euronext Amsterdam reaches the Share Price Hurdle being €11 50 per share  without any further action being required from the Warrant Holder. The Share Price Hurdle will be met when the share closing price for available shares on Euronext is at the target price for at least 15 out of 30 consecutive trading days. If the hurdle is reached the Warrants will be converted into Ordinary Shares corresponding with the Warrant Conversion Ratio of 0.15  or 6.67 Warrants per Ordinary Share.OutlookAs a result of different regulatory requirement in connection with the transition from SPAC to operational company  one-off costs where required as a result of which 2023 overall is expected to be loss-making. Going forward we expect to be profitable and well on track in 2024 to realize the financial objectives we have set out at listing. More specific we expect to realize a 2024 net rental income of approximately €6.6 million and a result before tax of€2.6 million[4].Relevant events after 30 June 2023As announced on 19 July  the Company purchased Forthstone  a unique commercial property located in Edinburgh  with a long-term lease agreement with its tenant. With this purchase  the Company will add a sixth property to its portfolio and in line with the Company's business objectives and strategy for growth.The owner of the property will be a newly incorporated operating company; Forthstone Land and Property Ltd  a 100% indirect subsidiary of New Amsterdam Invest N.V. The total consideration for Forthstone  including transaction costs  amounts to GBP 9.5 million and has been financed with a combination of equity (available in cash) and debt (LTV loan).

It is a source of pride for many locals and a big draw for tourists from around the world.But  even though beer is ubiquitous here  the Brussels scene lacked a focal point for visitors or - if you're a jaded glass-half-full drinker - a promotional vehicle for Belgium's vast global booze industry.Traders moved out of the 1868 neo-classical Palace de la Bourse or Beurspaleis in 2014  and the Belgian exchange has now merged with former competitors in Paris and Amsterdam to form Euronext.So  when the city refurbished the historic building  the brewers were on hand to stand their round and sponsor a fitting modern beer museum and roof top bar for their star export.On Sept. 9  when the refurbished Bourse reopened to the public  11 000 people passed through to see the trading hall  and 566  including a tourist from as far away as Singapore  stopped by Beer World.""A lot of interesting interactions  features that involve the participants  all the visitors "" said the tourist  who gave his name as Su.""I believe that all the beer drinkers  if they wish to have a good understanding about the whole process  about the history of the beer  it's definitely a place for them to visit.""Opening the center this week  Brussels mayor Philippe Close acknowledged that  beyond the culture of beer  the museum is ""a way to support a huge economic sector.""Belgium has at least 430 brewers  from mighty AB Inbev  which pours a third of the planet's pints  to tiny Trappist monasteries that sells one eagerly sought-after batch of ale per year to patient punters on a waiting list.The rade federation  Belgian Brewers  estimates that its members employ 6 900 people directly and support 50 000 more jobs in a country of only 11.5 million.Some 70 percent of Belgian beer is exported  not just to neighbors in Europe's beer-drinking north  but around the world.Tickets for the Beer World are a hefty 17 euros - but it does get you your first drink in the rooftop bar - with its vast selection drawn from the 1 600 types of beer the country has to offer.Belgian brewers are not as conservative as their German and Dutch neighbors.The sour  bubbly lambic and gueuze styles - ""Brussels Champagne"" - are Belgium's own  but many beers including the big brands like Jupiler or Stella Artois are based on the Czech and German Pilsner style.There are even Scotch ales in thistle-shaped glasses  allegedly introduced to entertain General Montgomery's British Second Army when it arrived in September 1944.And of course younger small-scale brewers have begun making hoppy Belgian pale ales to rival the best of the US craft beer explosion.Great complexityBeer World administrator Charles Leclef  a 30-year veteran Flemish brewery operator  told AFP that the city wanted to capture the ""playful"" side of the everyday tipple  not to incite heavy drinking.""We're not the biggest producer in the world  far from it  but we're perhaps the most creative  with beer of great diversity of flavour  great complexity "" Leclef boasted.In the museum  visitors can wander inside a virtual fermentation tank  with immersive screens taking them inside the process of turning hops  malt  yeast and water into national pride.In Germany  the law forbids any but these four ingredients  but Belgian brew masters are free to experiment with spices and infusions and even fruits like cherry or raspberry.Museum visitors can pull taps to signal their favorite flavors and ""virtual waiters"" will print out a suggestion on a beermat to be ordered later at guests' leisure.",neutral,0.06,0.74,0.19,positive,0.73,0.25,0.02,True,English,"['beer museum', 'thirsty visitors', 'Brussels', '30-year veteran Flemish brewery operator', 'vast global booze industry', 'Brussels mayor Philippe Close', 'US craft beer explosion', 'hoppy Belgian pale ales', 'Brussels stock exchange building', 'fitting modern beer museum', 'new ""Belgian Beer World', 'Intangible Cultural Heritage', 'jaded glass-half-full drinker', 'huge economic sector', 'mighty AB Inbev', 'tiny Trappist monasteries', 'British Second Army', 'Belgian brew masters', 'virtual fermentation tank', 'roof top bar', 'German Pilsner style', 'younger small-scale brewers', 'Beer World administrator', 'Belgian beer culture', 'Belgian exchange', 'historic building', 'vast selection', 'Scotch ales', 'Belgian Brewers', 'top tipple', 'rooftop bar', 'virtual waiters', 'Brussels scene', 'Brussels Champagne', 'beer drinkers', 'grand reopening', 'side order', '90-million-euro makeover', 'cafe bars', 'old town', 'many locals', 'big draw', 'focal point', 'promotional vehicle', '1868 neo-classical Palace', 'former competitors', 'star export', 'trading hall', 'interesting interactions', 'good understanding', 'patient punters', 'waiting list', 'rade federation', 'first drink', 'gueuze styles', 'many beers', 'big brands', 'Stella Artois', 'General Montgomery', 'Great complexity', 'playful"" side', 'everyday tipple', 'heavy drinking', 'biggest producer', 'great diversity', 'immersive screens', 'four ingredients', 'favorite flavors', 'Dutch neighbors', 'Charles Leclef', 'national pride', 'thirsty visitors', 'Museum visitors', 'la Bourse', '430 brewers', 'Sightseers', 'Belgium', 'temple', 'capitalism', 'passers', 'UNESCO', 'part', 'Humanity', 'source', 'tourists', 'Traders', 'Beurspaleis', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'Euronext', 'city', 'hand', 'round', 'Sept.', 'public', '11,000 people', 'Singapore', 'lot', 'features', 'name', 'Su.', 'process', 'history', 'place', 'center', 'way', 'third', 'planet', 'pints', 'after', 'batch', 'members', '6,900 people', 'jobs', 'country', '70 percent', 'Europe', 'beer-drinking', 'Tickets', '17 euros', '1,600 types', 'lambic', 'Jupiler', 'Czech', 'September', 'course', 'AFP', 'flavour', 'hops', 'malt', 'yeast', 'water', 'Germany', 'law', 'spices', 'infusions', 'fruits', 'cherry', 'raspberry', 'taps', 'suggestion', 'beermat', 'leisure', '50,000']",2023-09-13,2023-09-14,hurriyetdailynews.com

The data  provided by HowGood's in-depth  ingredient-level insights ranging from greenhouse gas emissions to water usage to labor risk  will help consumers make more informed and conscious choices. The digital displays will be available globally this fall.Through HowGood's sustainability attributes  consumers can select products that use less water than average in their production (Water Smart)  have lower greenhouse gas emissions than average (Climate Friendly)  have a simple formula with seven or fewer ingredients (Clean Label)  made with ingredients that are not dependent on commercial or industrial processing (Minimally Processed)  contain ingredients that minimize the use of petroleum-based herbicides  fertilizers and other chemicals (Low Synthetic Inputs)  or respect workers' rights and dignity (Fair Labor). These labels  among others  will be displayed in stores on electronic shelf labels  TVs  shelf-edge video displays  etc. along with product price and other key information.Today  consumers prioritize sustainable products and seek greater transparency across the board. According to NielsenIQ  72% of consumers are willing to pay a premium for products claiming to be sustainable. Research suggests that consumers feel empowered to shop sustainably and respond positively to brands that demonstrate healthy products for both the consumer and the environment.This innovative solution will benefit retailers and brands that are committed to sustainability by driving revenue and loyalty from consumers who care about the environmental and social impact of their purchases. The solution will also help retailers and brands promote their sustainability performance with data-backed product claims.The collaboration between SES-imagotag and HowGood has already demonstrated success in their pilot store in the UK at Kavanagh's Budgens Belsize Park. Using integrated SES Pulse analytics software  the store measured an average increase of 25.8% across all products labeled with HowGood attributes. While all attributes contributed to upsells  products labeled with ""Fair Labor"" showed the most significant increases of 45.1% on average. The positive impact goes beyond initial results for individual products  promoting the image of Kavanagh's as a sustainable and ethically-conscious store that meets the growing demands of consumers for sustainability.Alexander Gillett  CEO and co-founder of HowGood  said: ""We are delighted to partner with SES-imagotag to incorporate our sustainability data into a modern solution for retailers looking to capture the quickly emerging market of eco-conscious consumers. The global retail landscape is changing  and this partnership will enable forward-thinking retailers to clearly communicate their value to customers  remain dynamic in their in-store marketing  and drive revenue while having a very significant and meaningful impact on the planet.""Roy Horgan  SEVP Strategy  Marketing & Communications of SES-imagotag  concluded: ""We are very excited to partner with HowGood  a pioneer and leader in sustainability intelligence for food companies.

This is OCI's first upstream RNG production facility and production is slated to start in Q1 2025. As well as reducing carbon dioxide emissions  obtaining biogas from landfill has the benefit of using methane - which over a 20-year period  has a global warming potential that is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide - that would otherwise escape and accelerate global warming.A critical manufacturing building block  green methanol can effectively decarbonize traditionally hard-to-abate sectors by significantly reducing the carbon footprint and emissions across a range of key value chains to power cleaner industries.OCI currently has capacity to produce up to 200 thousand metric tons of green methanol. Offtakers include the road fuels market  where it is used as a fuel-blend to reduce emissions from petrol; as a building block in a range of industrial applications; and most recently  as a fuel for shipping.OCI has projected growth in the green methanol market of incremental demand of more than 6 million tonnes by 2028  due to the adoption of green methanol as a shipping fuel  based on the 225 dual-fuelled methanol vessels now on order.This summer  the first ever green methanol container vessel  owned by AP Moller Maersk  was fueled with OCI HyFuels green methanol on its maiden voyage from Korea to Copenhagen. The company also announced last month a new agreement with Xpress Feeder Lines to supply their green methanol ships at the Port of Rotterdam from 2025.Ahmed El-Hoshy  CEO  OCI Global said:""Today's announcement cements OCI's position as the leading green methanol producer globally. It also represents another milestone in our decarbonization journey as a business  and our commitment to driving the energy transition.It's positive that we are starting to see industry make that commitment too. We are seeing encouraging signs with regulatory support for both ammonia and methanol in shipping  such as the EU's FuelEU maritime regulation and the latest IMO strategy bolstering the value of low carbon and green methanol and ammonia relative to fossil fuels. It is clear that both fuels will need to play an integral role to reach the IMO's revised targets and OCI Global stands ready to supply them. However  these targets must be supported by practical mechanisms to continue to maintain momentum towards meeting global greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.""Bashir Lebada  CEO  OCI Methanol/HyFuels said:""We continue to see more and more realization that methanol is the transportation sector's most viable solution and the easiest way to transport and use renewable hydrogen today. It is a solution that is available now and our focus is on continuing to scale technologies whether through our projects or our supply partners  to ensure that our capacities continue to grow alongside demand. We are seeing increasing pull from road fuel markets due to the delay in EV adoption and charging station build-out and while marine demand has been growing at a very fast pace  we have yet to see the impact of retrofits which should end up being a larger segment than new-builds.E-methanol will also be a new product for us  and with the RFNBO mandates in the coming years  will quickly become the blendstock of choice with gasoline to ensure compliance. We are also very excited to announce the expansion of our 13-year partnership with the City of Beaumont  this landfill will bolster our product portfolio with additional green fuels right in our backyard and add to our existing supply portfolio of RNG.""Roy West  Mayor of Beaumont  said:We're pleased to partner with OCI on this exciting project  which further develops our long-term relationship with OCI as an industrial employer in Beaumont. This joint project will create societal and environmental benefits  including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and reduction in other air emissions resulting from landfill operations. This agreement is considered a win-win agreement for the city and OCI  as it allows the City to generate an additional revenue stream from its landfill operations while OCI will be able to use the renewable natural gas for its business.""",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.63,0.25,0.13,True,English,"['green methanol capacity', 'OCI N', 'United States', 'September', '04:57', 'up to 200 thousand metric tons', 'global greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets', 'first upstream RNG production facility', 'numerous high emissions industries', 'critical manufacturing building block', 'green methanol container vessel', 'leading green methanol producer', 'OCI HyFuels green methanol', 'green methanol production capacity', 'power cleaner industries', 'renewable natural gas', 'fence feedstock partnerships', 'AP Moller Maersk', 'Xpress Feeder Lines', 'FuelEU maritime regulation', 'charging station build', 'other air emissions', 'additional revenue stream', '225 dual-fuelled methanol vessels', 'global warming potential', 'green methanol market', 'green methanol ships', 'key value chains', 'latest IMO strategy', 'additional green fuels', 'road fuels market', 'carbon dioxide emissions', 'green hydrogen-based e-methanol', 'existing supply portfolio', 'road fuel markets', '400,000 metric tons', 'production portfolio', 'revised targets', 'first time', 'biggest producer', 'largest producer', 'road transport', 'renewable feedstocks', 'renewable hydrogen', 'supply agreements', 'supply partners', 'product portfolio', 'carbon footprint', 'low carbon', 'fossil fuels', 'OCI Global', 'development rights', '20-year period', '6 million tonnes', 'maiden voyage', 'Ahmed El-Hoshy', 'decarbonization journey', 'energy transition', 'encouraging signs', 'regulatory support', 'integral role', 'practical mechanisms', 'Bashir Lebada', 'transportation sector', 'easiest way', 'increasing pull', 'fast pace', 'larger segment', 'new product', 'RFNBO mandates', 'coming years', '13-year partnership', 'Roy West', 'exciting project', 'long-term relationship', 'joint project', 'environmental benefits', 'growing demand', 'incremental demand', 'marine demand', 'industrial applications', 'new agreement', 'industrial employer', 'win agreement', 'scale-up plans', 'viable solution', 'EV adoption', 'landfill operations', 'OCI Methanol/HyFuels', 'shipping fuel', '200,000 tons', 'Beaumont', 'Texas', 'mix', 'move', 'position', 'world', 'supplier', 'Euronext', 'response', '15,000 mmbtu', 'day', 'waste', 'Q1', 'biogas', 'methane', 'sectors', 'range', 'Offtakers', 'fuel-blend', 'petrol', 'growth', 'order', 'Korea', 'Copenhagen', 'company', 'Rotterdam', 'CEO', 'announcement', 'milestone', 'business', 'commitment', 'industry', 'ammonia', 'momentum', 'realization', 'focus', 'technologies', 'projects', 'capacities', 'delay', 'impact', 'retrofits', 'new-builds', 'blendstock', 'choice', 'gasoline', 'compliance', 'expansion', 'backyard', 'Mayor', 'societal']",2023-09-13,2023-09-14,marketscreener.com

(Nasdaq: SCNI) a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing  manufacturing  and commercializing innovative inflammation and immunology (I&I) biological products primarily for the treatment of autoimmune and infectious diseases  today announces encouraging results in a preclinical study of Scinai’s anti‑interleukin 17 (IL‑17) NanoAbs as a treatment for plaque psoriasis.Scinai’s NanoAbs are alpaca‑derived recombinant variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies and are also known as nanobodies or VHH antibodies. The NanoAbs were tested in a 3D biologic skin model constructed out of a scaffold mounted with various skin cells to generate layers that mimic the structure of human skin and induced to express plaque psoriasis. Upon introduction of NanoAbs into the model (either topically or subcutaneously)  standard molecular markers for psoriasis that are overexpressed in the disease (S100A7  CXCL1  and CCL20) were downregulated and outer skin layers (stratum corneum) regained normal appearance. These results suggest NanoAbs’ therapeutic potential to relieve symptoms of plaque psoriasis. In earlier laboratory tests the NanoAbs showed not only high affinity to all three IL-17 isoforms relevant for psoriasis (A  F and AF complex)  but also significant neutralization of these isoforms in tissue cultures.IL-17 plays a major role in the development of plaque psoriasis and is the molecular target of several recently launched biological treatments  mainly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)  such as Cosentyx (Novartis  NYSE: NVS) and Taltz (Lilly  NYSE: LLY)  both of which target IL-17A. Research shows that targeting IL-17F isoform in addition to IL-17A provides higher efficacy in treating plaque psoriasis. The recently launched Bimzelx (UCB  Euronext Brussels: UCB) was the first mAb targeting both IL-17A and F to be approved by the by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). MoonLake Immunotherapeutics (Nasdaq: MLTX  Market Cap $3.1B) is also developing a nanobody targeting both IL-17A and F. Last year  MoonLake reported superior results vs. Cosentyx in a phase 2 plaque psoriasis clinical trial. All the above-mentioned antibodies  indicated only for moderate to severe psoriasis patients  are administered by subcutaneous injection for systemic drug distribution and carry risk of considerable side effects. These drugs are also expensive as they require chronic  life long  bi-weekly injections  each at a cost of several thousand dollars. Mild psoriasis  which accounts for 50% of plaque psoriatic patients  unfortunately has no safe and affordable biological drug available. Experience shows that even the 28% of patients with moderate plaque psoriasis tend to avoid or delay onset of these biological treatments due to the associated risks.Conversely  Scinai’s NanoAbs are designed to be administered locally to the dermis and are engineered to degrade in a way that should prevent systemic side effects. Results of this recent study suggest the potential for a highly efficacious  specific  yet safer and more convenient treatment for the large and underserved population of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis patients.The NanoAb  exclusively licensed to Scinai   was discovered by Professor Dirk Görlich  Director at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences and was tested for neutralization at the laboratory of Professor Matthias Dobbelstein at University Medical Center Göttingen (UMG). Görlich and Dobbelstein are Scinai’s lead collaborators for development of a pipeline of NanoAb-based inflammation and immunology (I&I) biological therapeutics for the treatment of autoimmune and infectious diseases such as psoriasis  psoriatic arthritis  asthma  wet AMD and COVID-19.Scinai recently started to evaluate the anti-IL-17 NanoAbs in a full human skin model induced for plaque psoriasis to evaluate the effective dose and schedule of treatment  with in-vivo animal studies anticipated in early 2024.About Scinai Immunotherapeutics Ltd.Scinai Immunotherapeutics Ltd.

Kingspan was already the biggest shareholder in the company. It now has to submit an offer within 30 days under Swedish law. Kingspan’s move is in contrast to most acquisitions  which are agreed in private before both companies announce the deal.Kingspan intends to make an offer at a 13.8 per cent premium to Nordic Waterproofing closing shareprice on Wednesday. That would suggest an overall bid of about €323 million.The move comes on the same day Kingspan said the North American roofing area  in which Carlisle specialises  “remains a key area of interest” for the business despite it not being actively engaged in a bid for the US firm.READ MORE“Kingspan has admired Carlisle for many years and  recognising the clear strategic fit  had recent and informal discussions on a potential transaction ” said Kingspan  which is led by chief executive Gene Murtagh. “At present  there is no active engagement. The North American roofing space remains a key area of interest for Kingspan.”Shares in Arizona-based Carlisle soared as much as 11 per cent on Wall Street on Monday as investors digested reports over the weekend that it had rebuffed overtures from Kingspan about a potential tie-up. However  the US company’s shares ended that session well off their highs to close 0.8 per cent higher  giving it a market value of $14 billion (€13 billion).Kingspan’s shares have fallen by 7.2 per cent since the start of trading on Monday to €63.30  reducing the group’s market capitalisation to €12.4 billion  as investors speculated on whether the group would make another attempt at securing a deal – or find another US target.Bloomberg  which first reported on the talks on Sunday  said that Carlisle had signalled to Kingspan that it would be open to reviewing a more attractive offer.The Americas accounted for about 22 per cent of Kingspan’s revenue last year  compared with about 72 per cent from Europe.“These types of talks are always ongoing between companies  particularly those looking to grow through acquisitions. The only difference in this case is that the existence of such discussions was leaked ” said Cantor Fitzgerald analysts in a note to clients on Wednesday. “As such  whether or not there was going to be a deal is immaterial to Kingspan’s underlying business and the value of that business. Indeed  it may demonstrate management’s fiscal prudence that they did not chase a deal if they believed Carlisle were looking for too high a price.”Kingspan reported last month that its revenue for the first months of the year fell 2 per cent to €4.1 billion on the same period last year  but that results were “relatively pleasing” given the somewhat “challenging environment we were confronted with”.A deal of the nature Kingspan proposed would have likely led to the group seeking a primary stock listing in the US  which would deal another blow to Euronext Dublin  as the Irish Stock Exchange is now known.Building materials giant CRH  the largest company on Dublin’s Iseq  is set to quit the Irish market later this month as part of a listings rejig that will see it move its main quotation from London to New York.

The financial statements have been reviewed by the company's Statutory Auditors who will shortly issue their reports.Aubay posted good results in the first half of 2023  driven by organic growth of 6.3% despite a demanding basis for comparison.Half-year operating margin from ordinary activities of 8.9%Operating margin from ordinary activities remained at a healthy 8.9%  compared with 10.3% in the first half of 2022. This expected change was attributable to a utilization rate of 92.3% versus 95.2%  and to an unfavorable calendar effect in terms of working days. Aubay has demonstrated resilience in the face of inflation  always maintaining a good ratio between the evolution of its sales prices and its average salary.Operating profit of €22.7 millionOperating profit was down 8.4%  after taking into account the cost of performance shares for €0.7 million and a net expense of €1.1 million under ""Other operating income and expenses""  primarily comprising restructuring expenses.Slight decrease in net income attributable to owners of the parent (6.2% of net margin)Net income attributable to owners of the parent was virtually stable at €17.0 million  compared with €17.3 million in the first half of 2022. The tax expense of €6.1 million resulted in an average tax rate of 26%  compared with 29% for the same period of the previous year.Net cash (excluding rental liabilities) stable at €83.5 million  after dividend paymentCash flow stood at €28.1 million or 10.2% of revenue  compared with €29.1 million in 2022. The change in WCR amounted to a negative €6.6 million compared to a negative €17.5 million for the same period of the previous year. After taking the €9.3 million dividend payout in May into account  net cash was stable at €83.5 million at June 30  2023  and should significantly increase during the second half of the year  as is the case each year.Proposed interim dividend of €0.50In light of the good level of net income and the Group's excellent financial position  the Board of Directors has decided to pay an interim dividend of €0.50 per share in respect of 2023. The interim dividend will be paid on November 10  2023.Outlook for 2023Although customer demand remains strong  it is lower than last year's record levels. This return to normality is taking place uniformly across all countries and sectors. Customers are showing restraint and caution in their investments  given the uncertain macroeconomic context. While this wait-and-see attitude was particularly noticeable over the summer months  sales performance in early September seems to be showing encouraging signs of improvement.In light of this  Aubay expects its full-year results to be in the lower end of the range of its annual targets  which are:organic growth of between 5% and 7%  i.e.  annual revenue of between €540 million and €550 million ;; operating margin from ordinary activities between 9.5% and 10.5%.Aubay will publish its 2023 third-quarter revenue on Wednesday October 18  2023 after the close of trading.GlossaryOrganic revenue growth: This refers to growth calculated for a constant scope of activity for a given period  excluding revenues from companies that were acquired or sold during the period. As Aubay conducts most of its business in the euro zone  any impact from changes in exchange rates is minimal.2023 Organic growth +6.3% Impact of changes in scope 0 Growth as reported +6.3%Operating profit from ordinary activities: this indicator corresponds to operating profit before the cost of free shares and other income and expenses that are unusual  abnormal or infrequent and that are booked separately in order to facilitate understanding of an entity's recurring operating performance.Operating margin from ordinary activities: this indicator  which is expressed as a percentage  is the ratio of operating income from ordinary activities to revenue.Net debt or net cash (excluding rental liabilities): this indicator represents the difference between an entity's cash and debt. If the result is negative  it is referred to as net debt. If it is positive  it is referred to as net cash.About AubayAubay is a digital services company working alongside some of the biggest names in the Banking  Finance  Insurance  Manufacturing  Energy  Transport and Telecoms sectors.

30159,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/09/13/kingspan-plots-swedish-bid-hours-after-confirming-carlisle-approach/,Kingspan plots Swedish bid hours after confirming Carlisle approach,Insulation maker to make offer for Nordic Waterproofing after confirming ‘informal approach” for US frm Carlisle,Gene Murtagh  chief executive of Kingspan  which said on Wednesday that the North American roofing area 'remains a key area of interest' for the business.Kingspan  the Irish insulation maker  said it will make an offer to buy a Swedish maker of waterproofing products hours after confirming it held “informal discussions” with US construction materials manufacturer Carlisle Companies.The Cavan-based firm will submit an offer for the remaining shares in Nordic Waterproofing after its holding increased above 30 per cent. Kingspan was already the biggest shareholder in the company. It now has to submit an offer within 30 days under Swedish law. Kingspan’s move is in contrast to most acquisitions  which are agreed in private before both companies announce the deal.Kingspan intends to make an offer at a 13.8 per cent premium to Nordic Waterproofing closing shareprice on Wednesday. That would suggest an overall bid of about €323 million.The move comes on the same day Kingspan said the North American roofing area  in which Carlisle specialises  “remains a key area of interest” for the business despite it not being actively engaged in a bid for the US firm.READ MORE“Kingspan has admired Carlisle for many years and  recognising the clear strategic fit  had recent and informal discussions on a potential transaction ” said Kingspan  which is led by chief executive Gene Murtagh. “At present  there is no active engagement. The North American roofing space remains a key area of interest for Kingspan.”Shares in Arizona-based Carlisle soared as much as 11 per cent on Wall Street on Monday as investors digested reports over the weekend that it had rebuffed overtures from Kingspan about a potential tie-up. However  the US company’s shares ended that session well off their highs to close 0.8 per cent higher  giving it a market value of $14 billion (€13 billion).Kingspan’s shares have fallen by 7.2 per cent since the start of trading on Monday to €63.30  reducing the group’s market capitalisation to €12.4 billion  as investors speculated on whether the group would make another attempt at securing a deal – or find another US target.Bloomberg  which first reported on the talks on Sunday  said that Carlisle had signalled to Kingspan that it would be open to reviewing a more attractive offer.The Americas accounted for about 22 per cent of Kingspan’s revenue last year  compared with about 72 per cent from Europe.“These types of talks are always ongoing between companies  particularly those looking to grow through acquisitions. The only difference in this case is that the existence of such discussions was leaked ” said Cantor Fitzgerald analysts in a note to clients on Wednesday. “As such  whether or not there was going to be a deal is immaterial to Kingspan’s underlying business and the value of that business. Indeed  it may demonstrate management’s fiscal prudence that they did not chase a deal if they believed Carlisle were looking for too high a price.”Kingspan reported last month that its revenue for the first months of the year fell 2 per cent to €4.1 billion on the same period last year  but that results were “relatively pleasing” given the somewhat “challenging environment we were confronted with”.A deal of the nature Kingspan proposed would have likely led to the group seeking a primary stock listing in the US  which would deal another blow to Euronext Dublin  as the Irish Stock Exchange is now known.Building materials giant CRH  the largest company on Dublin’s Iseq  is set to quit the Irish market later this month as part of a listings rejig that will see it move its main quotation from London to New York. Smurfit Kappa confirmed on Tuesday it plans to delist in Dublin as part of a $19 billion merger to acquire US paper packaging peer WestRock.Meanwhile  Flutter Entertainment  the parent of Paddy Power  is widely expected to decide on a similar move soon  after securing shareholder approval earlier this year for a secondary US listing.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,negative,0.02,0.3,0.68,True,English,"['Swedish bid', 'Carlisle approach', 'Kingspan', 'The North American roofing space', 'Building materials giant CRH', 'North American roofing area', 'US construction materials manufacturer', 'US paper packaging peer', 'Nordic Waterproofing closing shareprice', 'chief executive Gene Murtagh', 'clear strategic fit', 'Cantor Fitzgerald analysts', 'primary stock listing', 'The Cavan-based firm', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'secondary US listing', 'Irish insulation maker', '13.8 per cent premium', 'The Americas', 'US firm', 'key area', 'waterproofing products', 'Irish market', 'US target', 'Swedish maker', 'US company', '30 per cent', '7.2 per cent', '22 per cent', '72 per cent', 'biggest shareholder', 'Swedish law', 'same day', 'many years', 'potential transaction', 'active engagement', 'Wall Street', 'potential tie-up', 'market capitalisation', 'fiscal prudence', 'first months', 'same period', 'challenging environment', 'main quotation', 'New York', 'Smurfit Kappa', '$19 billion merger', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Paddy Power', 'shareholder approval', 'informal discussions', 'largest company', 'most acquisitions', 'overall bid', 'market value', 'Arizona-based Carlisle', 'Euronext Dublin', 'similar move', 'remaining shares', 'underlying business', 'attractive offer', 'Carlisle Companies', '11 per', 'Kingspan', 'Wednesday', 'interest', 'holding', '30 days', 'contrast', 'deal', 'READ', 'recent', 'present', 'Monday', 'investors', 'reports', 'weekend', 'overtures', 'session', 'highs', 'start', 'trading', 'group', 'attempt', 'Bloomberg', 'talks', 'Sunday', 'revenue', 'Europe', 'types', 'difference', 'case', 'existence', 'note', 'clients', 'management', 'results', 'nature', 'blow', 'Iseq', 'part', 'listings', 'London', 'Tuesday', 'WestRock', 'parent']",2023-09-13,2023-09-14,irishtimes.com

This surge in activity is expected to directly translate into a substantial boost in our revenue.(See: https://www.artprice.com )Artprice by Artmarket now offers a completely new website that was redesigned in collaboration with the Vahumana team (TRSb Group) of high-level external consultants closely involved in the audit  development  and complete overhaul of Artprice since 2018  using a solid UI/UX approach. UX and UI (User Experience and User Interface) both rely on user-centric approaches to website design.This new intuitive and user-friendly website  with simplified access  has brought together the numerous high value-added data banks of Artprice.com  its subsidiaries  and its numerous departments  thus allowing easy and direct access to the most important  most relevant  and most exhaustive information on the art market.Particular attention has been paid to the development of our mobile version. It's not merely a scaled-down ""app"" version  which might struggle to capture the full richness of the desktop experience and would remain reliant on operating systems with their continuous cycle of upgrades and fixes.The feedback from customers and members is unanimous: “The new site is so much more pleasant to use and allows you to navigate through rich and varied content.”Customers and users are discovering information they never knew existed. The change is so dramatic that some users think Artprice has been involved in a merger or an acquisition! For its financial partners and shareholders  this new version represents a real “game changer”.The new intuitive search bar  in a central position  offers instant access to a comprehensive tree structure around the subject of the search  which ultimately generates an increase in the time spent on Artprice.com .Our new search engine instantly connects to information on 821 500 artists  16 261 100 auction results  and price-index data (including 1 087 500 auction lots referenced over the last 12 months from 7 200 auction houses around the globe) and to all the art market data in our databanks stretching back to the 4th century.Artprice by Artmarket thus offers the world's most elaborate and exhaustive search engine on the art market and solidly confirms its reputation as the World Leader in Art Market Information for the past 25 years.Test it and you will see! The universal search bar shows all the possible information available around the element searched: artists  works in future and past auctions  art market indices  works available on our standardized Artprice.com Marketplace  relevant articles in our ArtMarketInsight® archive  art market reports (annual  semestrial  segment-focused  etc.) and of course  all the relevant data and images in our databases (including signatures and monograms  catalogs raisonnés  archived historical data  etc.) that has been selected  checked and digitally recorded from the colossal archives that Artprice has purchased around the world over the past 25 years (see Artmarket.com's Universal Registration Document as filed with the AMF – France's Financial Markets Authority).Artprice.com by Artmarket's use of algorithmic AI for its own Intuitive Artmarket ® AI also allows access to very relevant and highly personalized recommendations concerning artists  works  sales  and even art history – allowing users to go infinitely further in their discovery and knowledge of the art market.Artprice Images® allows unlimited access to the largest collection of art market images in the world  with its collection of manuscripts and sales catalogs forming a physical and digital library made up of 180 million images or engravings of artworks from 1700 to the present day  all commented by our art historians.In this highly specific economic sector  no art market-related company in the world has such a massive volume of ultra-qualified and proprietary data  with the original paper archives representing a very important asset and an almost impregnable barrier to entry.It's worth noting that Artprice by Artmarket has achieved the prestigious distinction of receiving France's state-endorsed 'Innovative Company' label for two consecutive years—an accomplishment that is quite rare among companies listed on regulated markets. This esteemed recognition is bestowed following rigorous eligibility criteria and is conferred by the Banque Publique d'Investissement (bpifrance).Artprice's new online architecture integrates new communication spaces for advertisers  with a back-office for the completely autonomous management of their advertisements. The 2023/2024 target for Artprice by Artmarket is to double its turnover.According to thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice: “More than ever  the Art Market reflects the world we live in: a world that cherishes all that is beautiful and rare  most of which is finite. We must therefore constantly reinvent by creating new ways to enrich our souls.”We are seeing a new phase of market acceleration  driven by a growing number of new collectors  particularly in Greater Asia  eager to participate in the exchange of artworks  a commerce that is an integral part of our humanity.With the 2023/2024 dedicated advertising spaces our customers will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will be privileged players within a human and informative approach.After several months of consultations with users  we have refined the user interface of our Standardized Marketplace to streamline the process of accessing artworks available for sale  whether through fixed pricing or auctions  as well as facilitating the seamless posting of online advertisements. The target is to substantially increase the flow of transactions in a market where roughly 70 000 artworks are available every day.As planned in its 2023/2024 calendar  Artprice has therefore opened its paid spaces (in compliance with IAB standards) to the art market. This historic opening implies a radical change in our economic model  with paying advertisers fully integrated into its databases and services  its Artists pages  and its Web 3.0. However  every effort will be made to ensure the discretion of the advertising in terms of design and ergonomics for its clients and subscribing members.The new digital modules available to its advertisers offer a multitude of locations  with choices of language  media  duration  and prices  while harmoniously respecting the primary raison d'être of providing access to Artprice's databases  which remains our company's fundamental DNA.The significant and highly successful rollout of Artprice's IT infrastructure will generate new turnover from paid new subscriptions and new revenue from advertising that will be fully integrated into the Artprice by Artmarket databases and services  allowing advertisers complete control over their digital campaigns. Together  these new sources of income should double our company's turnover within 12 months.As regards the advertising revenue  our principal targets are of course the 7 200 auction houses around the world  the vast majority of whom have been affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and 98% of whom now announce their physical or digital sales on the Internet (including their post-Covid “online sales”).The second group of potential advertisers are organizers of Art World events such as fairs and exhibitions which are mushrooming on all five continents of the globe. In the Contemporary and Modern Art segments alone  Artprice counts nearly 400 such events.And who will their advertising be aimed at? The 18 000 fine art valuers and appraisers  the art insurers  the 32 000 galleries  and the 4 500 art museums and institutions around the world  all will benefit from highly targeted digital communication.All these potential advertisers and their targets are customers who have subscribed to Artprice's databases for a very long time.The 7 200 global auction houses affiliated with Artprice can now highlight their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  in paid advertiser mode  according to very specific search criteria  while strictly respecting European (GDPR) and American laws on personal data of Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members.Remember  for over 70 years now the standard economic model of an auction house includes an advertising budget to announce details of public sales that represents 34% of its overall costs  regardless of the country or the size of the operator. With the advent of digital advertising making it possible to respond instantly to advertisers  this budget can only grow.In practice  auction houses hosting meticulously cataloged sales  regardless of their scale  gain insight into artworks that may potentially remain unsold due to a lack of buyers or unmet reserve prices. This information is typically conveyed through purchase orders or ATPs (Advance Payment Terms)  which they receive approximately 3 to 4 days prior to each auction.In such cases  the auction house is ready to deploy ultra-targeted digital campaigns in a few hours to make the most of its upcoming sale. Only Artprice  with its data centers  it's engineering  and its processes can respond to this type of request  24 hours a day  and on a global scale.In summary  the new online version of Artprice.com by Artmarket is a real paradigm shift  but it remains 100% faithful to the historical DNA of Artprice and to the primordial postulate of its founder  thierry Ehrmann – to make art market information as accessible and transparent to the widest possible population. Artprice's historic alliance with the first global press agency dedicated to art market news and information  Cision PR Newswire (reaching 119 countries in 18 different languages) is an integral part of this strategy.https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-artprice-and-cision-extend-their-alliance-to-119-countries-to-become-the-worlds-leading-press-agency-dedicated-to-the-art-market-nfts-and-the-metaverse-301431845.htmlCopyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Timely investments in quality logistics assets on long-term leases and the mix of different segments in which we operate are boosting recurring revenues. Through two refinancing transactions  we have also extended the maturity of Touax SCA's debt to mid-2027  enabling us to develop our investment strategy in support of sustainable transport "" say Fabrice and Raphaël Walewski  Touax SCA's managing partners.Restated revenue from Group activities (at €79.1 million  i.e. +0.9%) and consolidated EBITDA (at €28.9 million  i.e. -1.9%) were broadly stable compared with the end of June 2022. This performance was achieved in a largely anticipated context of normalisation in the Containers business after exceptionally favourable years in 2021 and 2022 for the industry as a whole.The Group share of net profit was €5.1 million at 30 June 2023  compared with €7.6 million at end-June 2022 and €7.5 million for the full year 2022. This profit includes net exceptional income of €2.6 million (exceptional income of €3.5 million on the purchase of the minority stake in the Modular Buildings business; exceptional provision of €0.9 million due to a dispute).Touax SCA has improved its debt profile by extending the maturity of its financing:In June  the Group repaid €10.0 million of the €15.0 million Euro-PP loan maturing in July 2023 in cash  and the balance by issuing €5.0 million new tranche on the 2022 sustainable-linked Euro-PP bond maturing in June 2027;Refinancing in July of the disintermediated loan of €40.0 million from a debt fund maturing in June 2024 by a bank loan for the same amount maturing in May 2027  in the form of a club deal with a syndicate of five banks.These transactions follow the redemption in full of the TSSDI hybrid capital on 01 August 2022  which had already simplified the financing structure and optimised the cost of long-term resources against a backdrop of rising interest rates in the eurozone.SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSKey figures June 2023June 2022Dec. 2022(in € million) Restated Revenue (*) fromactivities 79.1 78.3 161.5 Of which Freight Railcars 27.9 26.4 56.1 Of which River barges 7.5 7.6 17.5 Of which Containers 35.1 41.3 81.4 Of which Miscellaneous and eliminations 8.6 3.0 6.4 EBITDA 28.9 29.5 57.9 Current operating income 14.7 16.6 31.1 Other financial income and expenses 2.6 0.0 0.0 Operating income 17.3 16.6 31.1 Financial result -9.8 -6.8 -15.4 Profit before taxes 7.6 9.8 15.7 Corporate tax -1.4 -1.5 -6.3 Consolidated net profit (Group's share) 5.1 7.6 7.5 Earnings per share (€) 0.72 1.08 1.07 Total non-current assets 381.2 353.2 394.6 Total assets 564.3 585.0 571.7 Total shareholders' equity 153.5 170.2 153.7 Net financial debt (a) 275.2 242.2 280.8 Operating cash flow (b) 17.4 11.0 -1.5 Loan to Value ratio (c) 57.4% 56.0% 59.5% (a) including € 226.7m non recourse debt at 30 June 2023 (b) including €20.7m net equipment acquisitions (vs €16.3m end of June 2022) (c) LTV : Consolidated gross financial debt / Total assets less goodwill and intangible fixed assets(*)To provide a clearer understanding of business performance  the key indicators in the Group's activity report are presented differently from the IFRS income statement. For this reason  no distinction is made between management on behalf of third parties  which is presented exclusively as an agent.This presentation has no impact on EBITDA  operating income or net income. The accounting presentation of revenue from activities is given in the appendix to this press release.STABLE BUSINESS IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2023For the first half of the 2023 financial year  restated revenues from activities came to €79.1 million (€78.9 million on a like-for-like basis)  a slight increase of 0.9% compared with the same period of 2022 (+0.7% on a like-for-like basis).Owned activity totalled €73.9 million at 30 June 2023  up by €1.8 million compared with the end of June 2022. It benefited from the favourable trend in leasing revenue (+€0.9 million). Utilisation rates for freight railcars (89%)  river barges (100%) and containers (95%) were high at 30 June 2023. Sales of owned equipment also increased by €0.8 million.Management activity was down by €1.0 million in the first half  due to a €2.0 million reduction in syndication fees. However  sales fees rose by €0.9 million  reflecting the higher level of second-hand containers available for sale in 2023 in a market that is normalising.ANALYSIS OF CONTRIBUTION BY DIVISIONRestated revenues for the Freight Railcars division amounted to €27.9 million at 30 June 2023  an increase of €1.5 million.This change is attributable to the €1.9 million increase in leasing activity (+7.7%). The average utilisation rate of the owned wagon fleet was 88.5% in the first half of 2023  compared with 87% in the first half of 2022. The absence of syndication to investors in the first half of the year explains the €0.3 million reduction in management activity.Restated revenues for the River Barges division were down slightly by €0.1 million at the end of June 2023. Leasing revenue rose by €0.4 million  benefiting from a fleet utilisation rate of 100% throughout the half-year and the latest investments made. Ancillary services fell by €0.5 million: chartering activity on the Rhine basin had been very buoyant over the same period in 2022.Restated revenues for the Containers division amounted to €35.1 million at end-June 2023  down €6.2 million against a backdrop of normalisation across the industry in 2023  after exceptional years in 2021 and 2022.Nevertheless  leasing revenue rose by 11.2% over the half year (+€0.8 million). Ownership activity was slowed by a less buoyant market for new containers  resulting in a €4.6 million fall in sales of owned equipment and a €1.7 million fall in ancillary services (pick-up charges).With fewer transactions carried out  syndication fees also fell by €1.5 million. However  given the higher volume of used containers available for sale  sales fees rose by €0.9 million.Lastly  revenues from the Modular Buildings business  reported under ""Other""  rose sharply to €8.6 million (up €5.6 million over the first half). Touax produced and delivered a large number of orders at the start of the year  after a low point in 2022 when the pandemic ended.RECURRING PROFITABILITYEBITDA for the first half was down slightly by €0.6 million (-1.9%) at €28.9 million.EBITDA for the Freight Railcars division came to €14.9 million  down slightly by €0.3 million  following a €1.6 million increase in operating expenses relating to the maintenance and repair cycle.The River Barges division recorded EBITDA of €2.5 million  up by €0.4 million (+19%)  due to lower chartering costs  while leasing revenues performed well over the half-year.EBITDA for the Containers division fell by €3.7 million to €8.8 million at 30 June 2023  due to lower half-year revenues (74% of the €6.2 million fall was attributable to the normalisation of container sales prices). Conversely  the cost of equipment sales improved by €2.7 million.The Modular Buildings business  on the other hand  saw its EBITDA rise by €3.3 million  well above breakeven thanks to a significant increase in equipment deliveries.The Group's depreciation  amortisation and provisions increased by €1.3 million  due to the gradual increase in investments in Touax's balance sheet over the last three years. Currentoperating income therefore came to €14.7 million  €1.8 million lower than at end-June 2022.Touax recorded net exceptional income of €2.6 million in the first half of 2023  linked on the one hand to accounting income (non-cash) of €3.5 million relating to the purchase in January of minority interests in the Modular Buildings business in Africa  and on the other hand to a provision of $1.0 million following the conviction in the United States of the former subsidiary of Modular Buildings in that country for an old dispute.The net financial expense was €9.8 million  compared with €6.8 million at end-June 2022. The €3.0 million increase in net financial expense is mainly due to the full effect on 2023 of the rise in interest rates  which accelerated from the end of the first quarter of 2022  impacting the Freight Railcars and Containers divisions.Net profit attributable to the Group was €5.1 million (compared with €7.6 million at 30 June 2022)  representing 6.4% of restated revenue from activities.A BALANCED FINANCIAL STRUCTURETouax's balance sheet strength is reflected in a lower loan-to-value ratio of 57.4% at 30 June (compared with 59.5% at 31 December 2022 and 56.0% at 30 June 2022). The financial structure has been reinforced by the recent debt refinancing carried out by the parent company Touax SCA  providing greater certainty over the debt profile until mid-2027.Shareholders' equity was stable at 153.5 million euros  compared with 153.7 million euros at the end of December 2022. The allocation of the half-year profit was offset by distributions (dividend 2022 and payment to general partners) totalling €1.5 million  by a negative change in reserves of €1.5 million mainly due to translation adjustments  and by a €2.3 million reduction in minority interests in the Freight Railcars business.Consolidated cash position fell by €10.8 million compared with the end of December  with €10.0 million used in June to repay part of the Euro-PP debt. The level of cash on the balance sheet at 30 June 2023 remains comfortable  at 45.2 million euros  and includes a temporary working capital surplus of 11 million euros on the container management business.OUTLOOKThe Touax Group confirms its strategy of making recurring investments in quality assets leased over a long period  while remaining cautious in the face of current market conditions.Touax's activities should continue to benefit from the growing awareness of the need to decarbonise the economy and transport and the need to renew infrastructure.Touax  which enjoys a unique position in sustainable transport  is increasingly committed to respecting the environment and good practices in terms of social responsibility and governance. Touax's extra-financial ESG rating (by EcoVadis) is among the best in its industry2  and the Group is building on this strength by working on a continuous improvement plan.Touax's aim is to provide its customers with an ever-better service in the field of sustainable transport. Our various asset classes benefit from the development of infrastructure  e-commerce and intermodal logistics  corresponding to the expectations of consumers  manufacturers  public authorities  lenders and investors.UPCOMING DATES13 September 2023: Videoconference presentation of half-year results in French14 September 2023: Videoconference presentation of half-year results in English 14 November 2023: Revenue for the 3 rd quarter 2023The TOUAX Group leases tangible assets (freight railcars  river barges and containers) every day throughout the world  both for its own account and on behalf of investors.

Sanofi's two higher-dose influenza vaccines  Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccin…,"The Season is part of a national flu vaccination campaign from Sanofi and the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists (ASCP)  an organization that represents healthcare professionals who are focused on the medication needs of older adults. The campaign encourages older adults  particularly those with one or more underlying health conditions  to speak with their healthcare provider about flu vaccine options that may be right for them  which may include Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine) or Flublok® Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine).Michael Greenberg  MD  MPHNorth America Medical Head of Vaccines at Sanofi""The flu can be a serious public health threat and lead to complications such as heart attack  stroke  and pneumonia. These can be especially dangerous for older adults  ethnic and racial minority groups who are at an increased risk for being hospitalized from the flu  and those living with chronic conditions  like asthma  diabetes and heart disease. Our hope is that  as a part of our annual commitment to educating the public about the flu  this campaign will increase awareness of the importance of flu vaccination and remind older adults and at-risk populations that there are vaccines available to them that may provide better protection for their specific needs  such as Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent or Flublok Quadrivalent.""The United States may face a resurgence of flu this year. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  preliminary results for the 2022-2023 season indicate approximately 70 per 100 000 people aged 18 and older were hospitalized for flu in the United States. The rate was more than double in adults aged 65 and older.Chad Worz  PharmD  BCGP  FASPExecutive Director and Chief Executive Officer of ASCP""Flu is unpredictable. Most of us already know that getting an annual flu shot is important  but it is also critical for people to understand which flu shots are most appropriate for them  especially older adults. As a pharmacist  I see many people coming in to get vaccinated who don't know which flu shot options are available to them  and I want more people to feel empowered to talk to their doctors or pharmacists about their options.""It's important for those who bear the greatest burden of the flu – people age 65 years and older – to get vaccinated. Since 2010  the CDC estimates that between 50% and 70% of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations occurred in this age group.Ice-TRapper/Actor""As a rapper  actor  husband and father  I don't get a lot of sick days  so it's critical for me to get my flu shot every year. Now that I'm 65  I've learned that the flu can potentially cause more complications for me  and that higher-dose flu shots may give me better protection. This is why I am so excited to be partnering with Sanofi so that I can help deliver this important public health message.""Visit SanofiFluShots.com to learn more about the potential complications associated with the flu  including heart attack  stroke and pneumonia  and to learn more about Sanofi's Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine) and Flublok Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine).

This surge in activity is expected to directly translate into a substantial boost in our revenue.(See: https://www.artprice.com)Artprice by Artmarket now offers a completely new website that was redesigned in collaboration with the Vahumana team (TRSb Group) of high-level external consultants closely involved in the audit  development  and complete overhaul of Artprice since 2018  using a solid UI/UX approach. UX and UI (User Experience and User Interface) both rely on user-centric approaches to website design.This new intuitive and user-friendly website  with simplified access  has brought together the numerous high value-added data banks of Artprice.com  its subsidiaries  and its numerous departments  thus allowing easy and direct access to the most important  most relevant  and most exhaustive information on the art market.Particular attention has been paid to the development of our mobile version. It's not merely a scaled-down ""app"" version  which might struggle to capture the full richness of the desktop experience and would remain reliant on operating systems with their continuous cycle of upgrades and fixes.The feedback from customers and members is unanimous: ""The new site is so much more pleasant to use and allows you to navigate through rich and varied content.""Customers and users are discovering information they never knew existed. The change is so dramatic that some users think Artprice has been involved in a merger or an acquisition! For its financial partners and shareholders  this new version represents a real ""game changer"".The new intuitive search bar  in a central position  offers instant access to a comprehensive tree structure around the subject of the search  which ultimately generates an increase in the time spent on Artprice.com.Our new search engine instantly connects to information on 821 500 artists  16 261 100 auction results  and price-index data (including 1 087 500 auction lots referenced over the last 12 months from 7 200 auction houses around the globe) and to all the art market data in our databanks stretching back to the 4th century.Artprice by Artmarket thus offers the world's most elaborate and exhaustive search engine on the art market and solidly confirms its reputation as the World Leader in Art Market Information for the past 25 years.Test it and you will see! The universal search bar shows all the possible information available around the element searched: artists  works in future and past auctions  art market indices  works available on our standardized Artprice.com Marketplace  relevant articles in our ArtMarketInsight® archive  art market reports (annual  semestrial  segment-focused  etc.) and of course  all the relevant data and images in our databases (including signatures and monograms  catalogs raisonnés  archived historical data  etc.) that has been selected  checked and digitally recorded from the colossal archives that Artprice has purchased around the world over the past 25 years (see Artmarket.com's Universal Registration Document as filed with the AMF – France's Financial Markets Authority).Artprice.com by Artmarket's use of algorithmic AI for its own Intuitive Artmarket ® AI also allows access to very relevant and highly personalized recommendations concerning artists  works  sales  and even art history – allowing users to go infinitely further in their discovery and knowledge of the art market.Artprice Images® allows unlimited access to the largest collection of art market images in the world  with its collection of manuscripts and sales catalogs forming a physical and digital library made up of 180 million images or engravings of artworks from 1700 to the present day  all commented by our art historians.In this highly specific economic sector  no art market-related company in the world has such a massive volume of ultra-qualified and proprietary data  with the original paper archives representing a very important asset and an almost impregnable barrier to entry.It's worth noting that Artprice by Artmarket has achieved the prestigious distinction of receiving France's state-endorsed 'Innovative Company' label for two consecutive years—an accomplishment that is quite rare among companies listed on regulated markets. This esteemed recognition is bestowed following rigorous eligibility criteria and is conferred by the Banque Publique d'Investissement (bpifrance).Artprice's new online architecture integrates new communication spaces for advertisers  with a back-office for the completely autonomous management of their advertisements. The 2023/2024 target for Artprice by Artmarket is to double its turnover.According to thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice: ""More than ever  the Art Market reflects the world we live in: a world that cherishes all that is beautiful and rare  most of which is finite. We must therefore constantly reinvent by creating new ways to enrich our souls.""We are seeing a new phase of market acceleration  driven by a growing number of new collectors  particularly in Greater Asia  eager to participate in the exchange of artworks  a commerce that is an integral part of our humanity.With the 2023/2024 dedicated advertising spaces our customers will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will be privileged players within a human and informative approach.After several months of consultations with users  we have refined the user interface of our Standardized Marketplace to streamline the process of accessing artworks available for sale  whether through fixed pricing or auctions  as well as facilitating the seamless posting of online advertisements. The target is to substantially increase the flow of transactions in a market where roughly 70 000 artworks are available every day.As planned in its 2023/2024 calendar  Artprice has therefore opened its paid spaces (in compliance with IAB standards) to the art market. This historic opening implies a radical change in our economic model  with paying advertisers fully integrated into its databases and services  its Artists pages  and its Web 3.0. However  every effort will be made to ensure the discretion of the advertising in terms of design and ergonomics for its clients and subscribing members.The new digital modules available to its advertisers offer a multitude of locations  with choices of language  media  duration  and prices  while harmoniously respecting the primary raison d'être of providing access to Artprice's databases  which remains our company's fundamental DNA.The significant and highly successful rollout of Artprice's IT infrastructure will generate new turnover from paid new subscriptions and new revenue from advertising that will be fully integrated into the Artprice by Artmarket databases and services  allowing advertisers complete control over their digital campaigns. Together  these new sources of income should double our company's turnover within 12 months.As regards the advertising revenue  our principal targets are of course the 7 200 auction houses around the world  the vast majority of whom have been affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and 98% of whom now announce their physical or digital sales on the Internet (including their post-Covid ""online sales"").The second group of potential advertisers are organizers of Art World events such as fairs and exhibitions which are mushrooming on all five continents of the globe. In the Contemporary and Modern Art segments alone  Artprice counts nearly 400 such events.And who will their advertising be aimed at? The 18 000 fine art valuers and appraisers  the art insurers  the 32 000 galleries  and the 4 500 art museums and institutions around the world  all will benefit from highly targeted digital communication.All these potential advertisers and their targets are customers who have subscribed to Artprice's databases for a very long time.The 7 200 global auction houses affiliated with Artprice can now highlight their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  in paid advertiser mode  according to very specific search criteria  while strictly respecting European (GDPR) and American laws on personal data of Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members.Remember  for over 70 years now the standard economic model of an auction house includes an advertising budget to announce details of public sales that represents 34% of its overall costs  regardless of the country or the size of the operator. With the advent of digital advertising making it possible to respond instantly to advertisers  this budget can only grow.In practice  auction houses hosting meticulously cataloged sales  regardless of their scale  gain insight into artworks that may potentially remain unsold due to a lack of buyers or unmet reserve prices. This information is typically conveyed through purchase orders or ATPs (Advance Payment Terms)  which they receive approximately 3 to 4 days prior to each auction.In such cases  the auction house is ready to deploy ultra-targeted digital campaigns in a few hours to make the most of its upcoming sale. Only Artprice  with its data centers  it's engineering  and its processes can respond to this type of request  24 hours a day  and on a global scale.In summary  the new online version of Artprice.com by Artmarket is a real paradigm shift  but it remains 100% faithful to the historical DNA of Artprice and to the primordial postulate of its founder  thierry Ehrmann – to make art market information as accessible and transparent to the widest possible population. Artprice's historic alliance with the first global press agency dedicated to art market news and information  Cision PR Newswire (reaching 119 countries in 18 different languages) is an integral part of this strategy.https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-artprice-and-cision-extend-their-alliance-to-119-countries-to-become-the-worlds-leading-press-agency-dedicated-to-the-art-market-nfts-and-the-metaverse-301431845.htmlCopyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. =---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Press release Exaion and 2CRSi strengthen their collaboration to reduce the carbon impact of digital technology Strasbourg (France)  Neuilly-sur-Seine (France) 14 September 2023 As the number of data centers is increasing in line with the growth in digital uses  Exaion and 2CRSi reinforce their collaboration to limit the environmental impact of this type of equipment and deploy high-performance and low-carbon servers[1]. In France  the flagship initiative of this collaboration is the implementation of an ""immersive tank"" solution  an innovative system that immerses servers in large modular tanks filled with a non-conductive  biodegradable liquid[2]  reducing electricity and water consumption compared to tradition cooling methods. This system  along with new immersion technologies  is currently integrated into Exaion's infrastructures  specifically in the EDF Group's data centers located in Normandy  France. They are undergoing in-depth testing and analysis by the 2CRSi team  with the aim of adapting these technologies to existing servers and assessing the potential benefits  in terms of both performance and energy consumption  compared to current installations. If these tests and analyses meet the rigorous quality criteria set by all the parties involved  it may be possible to extend the deployment of these technologies to other Exaion installations. ""Exaion is already considering various use cases for this solution:"" . the provision for the EDF Group  in the form of a private cloud  of product and service samples via the immersion tank to test future technologies such as next-generation CPUs (central processing units) and motherboards. . the establishment of a technology innovation laboratory in partnership with various hardware manufacturers to provide early access to the latest generations of processors  GPUs (graphics processing units)  and more. In Canada  2CRSi officially joins Exaion's ""Energy Transition Hub"" with the deployment of an efficient computing cluster in the Quantum Innovation Zone in Sherbrooke  specifically within the new Bellevue Data Center in the Humano District  designed and operated by Exaion. This high-performance computing infrastructure will consist of immersion tanks with GPU servers sourced from the circular economy. The primary objective of this technological partnership  between the Canadian subsidiaries of the two French groups  will be the development of hybrid solutions in HPC/Quantum and 3D Cloud (digital twins  Artificial Intelligence  etc.). Emphasis will be placed on reusing waste heat  tracking the carbon footprint of digital uses  and  for energy companies  the development of use cases and ready-to-use quantum algorithms to facilitate the energy transition. 2CRSi brings all its technological expertise in low-carbon infrastructure  while Exaion contributes its expertise in Cloud services  cybersecurity  and the development of hybrid/Quantum software solutions. « The strengthening of our collaboration with 2CRSi will allow us to further reduce the carbon footprint of our infrastructure  which is already among the lowest in the market  and to offer our clients solutions tailored to their needs and challenges. We are committed to accelerating the transition of data centers toward a more sustainable model. The 10 years of expertise that 2CRSi brings in cooling and immersion  combined with Exaion's expertise in web infrastructure management  will enable us to take a decisive step forward in this regard. »  says Fatih BALYELI  CEO and co-founder of Exaion. « The realization of this collaboration contract with Exaion highlights the recognition of the unique characteristics of 2CRSi's products and solutions: our expertise in high-performance servers and our environmentally friendly cooling system expertise are particularly emphasized. Furthermore  we are extremely proud to deploy our solutions in partnership with a leading player like Exaion in EDF's data centers. »  states Alain Wilmouth  CEO and co-founder of 2CRSi.
