But markets change  as is being proven by the rise in U.S. interest rates. And tech isn’t always the leading choice for investing.Below are five stocks described by two money managers who specialize in markets outside the U.S. for investors who wish to ride along with long-term growth trends.First  to make the case that U.S. technology firms aren’t always in the lead  here is a comparison of average annual returns over the past 10 years for the S&P 500 SPX and its sectors through Sept. 13  with the same calculations for the previous 10-year period:Index or sector Average annual return – past 10 years Average annual return – previous 10-year period S&P 500 12.3% 7.4% Information Technology 20.9% 6.7% Consumer Discretionary 12.5% 9.4% Healthcare 11.9% 7.9% Industrials 10.4% 8.3% Financials 10.0% 0.0% Utilities 9.3% 9.8% Consumer Staples 9.1% 10.0% Materials 9.1% 8.9% Real Estate 7.6% 9.0% Communication Services 7.4% 8.5% Energy 5.1% 14.0% Source: FactSetThe technology sector has been the runaway leader over the past decade  but the previous 10-year period told a different story.In addition to looking beyond tech  which has such a high concentration within the S&P 500  investors might want to add exposure outside the U.S. to take advantage of growing middle classes in emerging markets and innovation in other developed markets.Priyanka Agnihotri of Brown Advisory is based in London and manages the Brown Advisory Sustainable International Leaders Fund BISLX  which was established Feb. 28  2022. Brown Advisory tends to hold 25 to 35 stocks of companies based in any market outside the U.S. During an interview  she discussed three of the fund’s holdings  including HDFC Bank HDB  -1.78%   which is the largest private bank in India  where government-owned banks have traditionally dominated financial services. The fund’s benchmark is the MSCI ACWI ex-U.S. Index.James Thom  Abrdn’s senior director of Asian equities  also named three examples of non-U.S. stocks during an interview  including HDFC Bank. He is based in Singapore and works on various portfolios for the firm’s private and institutional clients. HDFC Bank is held within the India Fund IFN  a closed-end fund established in 1994 that is available to U.S. investors  and for which Abdrn Asia Ltd. serves as adviser. IFN’s benchmark is the MSCI India Index.Here are three-year compound annual growth rates (CAGR) for the five companies’ revenue and earnings per share through 2022  along with estimated two-year CAGR for these items from 2023 through 2025.

She said she was comfortable with HDFC because the bank had taken a careful approach during multiple credit cycles. Now it has become a leader in making consumer loans easily available through smartphone apps.Both Agnihotri and Thom pointed to a new growth opportunity for the bank through mortgage lending  which has been expanded after a complex transaction with its former holding company resulted in its taking on mortgage and life insurance subsidiaries.Thom said HDFC has had a “fantastic track record  delivering consistent growth” along with that of the financial industry in India. He also pointed to the bank’s scale as a driver of efficiency.He described an evolution of the country’s banking market  with an accelerating transition to digital services as the government develops its Open Network Credit Enablement system. This system “helps to aggregate personal data and credit histories on the digital network ” to make credit easier to access for people in all socioeconomic groups ” Thom said. The identification will be done with a thumbprint. Thom called this development “interesting and exciting ” because it can open more forms of credit to large groups of people  rather than limiting the banks strictly to collateralized loans.Deutsche Boerse AGDeutsche Boerse AG DB1  +1.13% is expected by analysts working for brokerage firms to show the slowest increases in revenue and earnings per share over the next two years among the five companies in the table  above. However  Agnihotri believes the company is reasonably valued  especially when taking cash flow into account.She said that as the owner of the largest derivatives trading exchange in Europe  Deutsche Boerse has a special advantage because of high barriers for potential competitors and because it is also a major player in securities trading  custody and settlement services. The company has also been expanding its data and analytics business  she said  through bolt-on acquisitions.“The business model is very attractive — 80% of the cost is fixed ” she said “You can grow with little incremental cost.”LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SEIt is easy to expect the popularity of luxury brands to continue to increase as the world’s middle class expands. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE MC  +2.50% has no shortage of luxury brands  including the ones that are part of its name  as well as Tiffany  Christian Dior  Fendi  TAG Heuer  Bulgari and many others.Agnihotri said she admires the company’s “incredibly long-term” approach to managing the “balance between desirability and exclusivity” for its brands.The conglomerate’s last major acquisition was Tiffany in 2020  and according to Agnihotri  it has already doubled the unit’s profits by increasing investments in marketing for what was already a strong brand. She said LVMH had done the same after acquiring Bulgari in 2011 and Dior in 2017.“Dior is growing 20% annually. They have been able to raise prices [for a brand that is] potentially under-monetized ” she said.Budweiser Brewing Co. APAC Ltd.Budweiser Brewing Co. APAC Ltd. 1876  +1.07% is based in Hong Kong and majority owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA BUD  +0.04% . So this is  essentially  a U.S. company  although most of its beer sales are in China.Thom said that no matter where this subsidiary is based or its stock listed  he believes in the company’s growth potential in China’s premium beer market. You can see in the table that analysts expect rapid earnings growth through 2025.He described the segmentation of the beer market in China  with local brands taking the less expensive segment. As the middle class grows  there is more opportunity for the company beyond its flagship Budweiser brand  especially in the country’s wealthier coastal cities  he noted.At the “super-premium level ” Budweiser Brewing Co. is set to compete well with brands such as Corona  Hoegaarden and Stella Artois  he said.The stock has fallen 30% this year  with dividends reinvested  as concerns over China’s slowing economic growth have taken their toll. But Thom said he still believes the company is well-positioned as middle-class household formation continues its long-term upward path in the country.Taiwan SemiconductorInvestors may be concerned over the prospect of China making an aggressive move to take over Taiwan. But no matter how the political situation develops  Thom said he is confident about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM  -2.43% because “it is almost as if it is too important to fail.”“Irrespective of whether it is in Taiwanese or Chinese control  the world needs what they produce. They have an effective monopoly on advance chip manufacturing ” he said.Don’t miss: 20 stocks of aerospace and defense companies expected to grow sales most quickly through 2025,neutral,0.07,0.93,0.01,positive,0.62,0.37,0.01,True,English,"['Deep Dive', 'Five stocks', 'growth horizons', 'S&P 500', 'investors', 'LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE MC', 'Brown Advisory Sustainable International Leaders Fund BISLX', 'SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY', 'Open Network Credit Enablement system', 'Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

They are undergoing in-depth testing and analysis by the 2CRSi team  with the aim of adapting these technologies to existing servers and assessing the potential benefits  in terms of both performance and energy consumption  compared to current installations. If these tests and analyses meet the rigorous quality criteria set by all the parties involved  it may be possible to extend the deployment of these technologies to other Exaion installations.""Exaion is already considering various use cases for this solution:""the provision for the EDF Group  in the form of a private cloud  of product and service samples via the immersion tank to test future technologies such as next-generation CPUs (central processing units) and motherboards.the establishment of a technology innovation laboratory in partnership with various hardware manufacturers to provide early access to the latest generations of processors  GPUs (graphics processing units)  and more.In Canada  2CRSi officially joins Exaion's “Energy Transition Hub"" with the deployment of an efficient computing cluster in the Quantum Innovation Zone in Sherbrooke  specifically within the new Bellevue Data Center in the Humano District  designed and operated by Exaion. This high-performance computing infrastructure will consist of immersion tanks with GPU servers sourced from the circular economy.The primary objective of this technological partnership  between the Canadian subsidiaries of the two French groups  will be the development of hybrid solutions in HPC/Quantum and 3D Cloud (digital twins  Artificial Intelligence  etc.). Emphasis will be placed on reusing waste heat  tracking the carbon footprint of digital uses  and  for energy companies  the development of use cases and ready-to-use quantum algorithms to facilitate the energy transition.2CRSi brings all its technological expertise in low-carbon infrastructure  while Exaion contributes its expertise in Cloud services  cybersecurity  and the development of hybrid/Quantum software solutions.« The strengthening of our collaboration with 2CRSi will allow us to further reduce the carbon footprint of our infrastructure  which is already among the lowest in the market  and to offer our clients solutions tailored to their needs and challenges. We are committed to accelerating the transition of data centers toward a more sustainable model. The 10 years of expertise that 2CRSi brings in cooling and immersion  combined with Exaion's expertise in web infrastructure management  will enable us to take a decisive step forward in this regard. »  says Fatih BALYELI  CEO and co-founder of Exaion.« The realization of this collaboration contract with Exaion highlights the recognition of the unique characteristics of 2CRSi's products and solutions: our expertise in high-performance servers and our environmentally friendly cooling system expertise are particularly emphasized. Furthermore  we are extremely proud to deploy our solutions in partnership with a leading player like Exaion in EDF's data centers. »  states Alain Wilmouth  CEO and co-founder of 2CRSi.About 2CRSiFounded in Strasbourg in 2005  the 2CRSi Group designs  manufactures  and markets customized high-performance and eco-friendly computer servers. 2CRSi has been listed on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris since June 2018 (ISIN Code: FR0013341781)  and its shares were transferred to Euronext Growth in November 2022.For further information: www.2crsi.comAbout ExaionExaion  a subsidiary of the EDF Group  was co-founded in 2020 by Fatih Balyeli and Laurent Bernou-Mazars  who became respectively its CEO and CTO.

The Group now expects organic growth between 3% to 4%  compared to “around 5%” at the start of the year.,"Paris  September 14  2023 - Ipsos experiences continued growth but at slower pace than forecasted for 2023. The Group now expects organic growth between 3% to 4%  compared to “around 5%” at the start of the year.This revision is mainly due to the persistence of headwinds already mentioned in previous financial releases:In particular  the activity of major Tech customers did not improve during the summer. After an exceptional growth during the pandemic  these clients have been experiencing a period of uncertainty since autumn 2022. Despite a return to pre pandemic growth path  they remain major clients for Ipsos. In addition  new opportunities related to generative artificial intelligence arise.While our activity in North America will be impacted by the Tech sector and below our expectations  we anticipate a positive revenue growth in this region for 2023.In China  the activity remained stable in July and August and is below our expectations  reflecting the more general difficulties of the Chinese economy.The revision of the 2023 growth target is hence the result of temporary and identified adverse factors.Our revenue organic growth will strongly improve in the third quarter and will be significantly above 5% in the second half.This revenue growth acceleration combined with the full effect of the efforts we have made since the beginning of 2022 in controlling operating costs will lead to a very significant improvement in the operating margin in the second half compared to the first half.

The Group now expects organic growth between 3% to 4%  compared to “around 5%” at the start of the year.This revision is mainly due to the persistence of headwinds already mentioned in previous financial releases:In particular  the activity of major Tech customers did not improve during the summer. After an exceptional growth during the pandemic  these clients have been experiencing a period of uncertainty since autumn 2022. Despite a return to pre pandemic growth path  they remain major clients for Ipsos. In addition  new opportunities related to generative artificial intelligence arise.While our activity in North America will be impacted by the Tech sector and below our expectations  we anticipate a positive revenue growth in this region for 2023.In China  the activity remained stable in July and August and is below our expectations  reflecting the more general difficulties of the Chinese economy.The revision of the 2023 growth target is hence the result of temporary and identified adverse factors.Our revenue organic growth will strongly improve in the third quarter and will be significantly above 5% in the second half.This revenue growth acceleration combined with the full effect of the efforts we have made since the beginning of 2022 in controlling operating costs will lead to a very significant improvement in the operating margin in the second half compared to the first half.

This partnership paves the way for a new type of ecosystem and vast markets for green and renewable hydrogen.STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPThe partnership includes a commercial agreement to identify potential customers across Europe. Both organisations will promote their respective products and services to the benefit of clients seeking to unlock operating synergies from integrated decarbonisation solutions.There is growing demand by multinationals and industrial clusters targeting operating synergies from combining thermal and mobility solutions powered by green hydrogen. The mobility applications are aimed at hydrogen refilling stations for forklifts  vans  delivery trucks and cars. Thermal solutions include industrial steam  large buildings and district heating applications.Steam production is a core component of many industrial processes with a highly valuable  continuous demand profile. Industries with a large process steam demand include pulp and paper  food and beverages  pharmaceuticals  industrial chemicals  and the oil and gas industry. Large buildings thermal applications include airports  hospitals  commercial centres  and campus heating facilities.ON-SITE SYNERGIESZero emissions: Exogen offers a pioneering Hydrogen Steam Plant  the HSP 3000  featuring boiler technology by Jericho Energy Ventures  (TSXV:JEV)  (OTC PINK:JROOF)  (FRA:JLM). This breakthrough  zero-emissions steam plant for industrial and district heating applications is a turn-key solution. The hydrogen-powered installation is produced and serviced by industry leader Sofinter Group  and comes pre-assembled in container-sized units  shipped by road transport. It has no smokestack and eliminates all NOx and CO2 emissions from industrial steam and district heating.The only exhaust is clean water  which is ready for circular use with Lhyfe's green hydrogen production system  further enhancing the positive environmental impact. Indeed  Lhyfe – as one of the world's pioneers in the production of green and renewable hydrogen - uses water and renewable energies to produce its hydrogen via water electrolysis.Demand enabler: Because of its base-load hydrogen demand profile  the Exogen HSP 3000 has become a key enabler for other hydrogen applications. Once green hydrogen becomes available on-site and in industrial quantities  other applications  such as mobility  transport and logistics  become natural extensions to further decarbonise the value chain. As a result  the combined applications can unlock material operating synergies and cost advantages thanks to scale effects.This is where the leading expertise of Lhyfe comes in. Lhyfe inaugurated its first green hydrogen production site in 2021. With five additional sites under construction throughout Europe  it aims to achieve 55 MW of installed capacity of hydrogen production by end 2024  200 MW by end 2026 and more than 3 GW by end 2030. Through its production sites and its portfolio of projects  Lhyfe intends to provide access to green and renewable hydrogen in industrial quantities to significantly decarbonise sectors such as transport and industry (chemicals  steel  glass  etc).Two avenues for growth: First  the partnership with Exogen can lead to significant capacity growth for the existing pipeline of projects at Lhyfe  servicing a large new end-market in industrial steam. Second  with district heating and process steam  Lhyfe is entering into two entirely new market segments  which are expected to lead to additional growth opportunities in green hydrogen production.MANAGEMENT COMMENTSPhilippe Desorme  VP of Sales & Business Development at Lhyfe said: “Green hydrogen has become highly relevant for decarbonising industrial steam  district heating and logistics. By partnering with Exogen we expect a significant expansion of our green hydrogen production output over time  while also opening a completely new market segment for us. Therefore  we are very excited to work with Exogen and our clients to help unlock operating synergies and address new hydrogen demand.”Saverio Costanzo  CRO at Exogen said: “Decarbonising heat is the single biggest challenge in energy markets. The Exogen Hydrogen Steam Plant is a great solution for many businesses because it will permanently eliminate CO2 and NOx emissions from their incumbent production process. As a result  our clients can deliver meaningfully decarbonised products and services to their customers  unlocking new growth opportunities. In our mission to decarbonise energy applications  Lhyfe is an ideal partner; together we can serve customers across Europe with comprehensive solutions. I am very excited about the early feedback from multinationals and district heating providers for our combined offering. The future of energy applications is green  and we are right in the middle of it.”For an interview with the spokespersons above  please contact the press department.Click to access the Lhyfe Media Kit (press kit and visuals)About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

As the 2018 ESOP reaches its term at the end of the year  this tenth plan will help maintain employee shareholding at around 8% of Capgemini SE’s share capital.As in 2022  the Board of Directors of Capgemini SE at its meeting of June 14 and 15  2023 decided to authorize a dedicated share buyback envelope. This envelope could be used within the next 12 months1 to neutralize all or part of the dilutive effect of this share capital increase.According to the planned schedule  the reservation period will be opened from September 15 to October 4  2023 (inclusive) and will be followed by a subscription/revocation period from November 13 to November 15  2023 (inclusive). The subscription price of the new shares will be set on November 10  2023 and the share capital increase will be completed on December 19  2023.Employees will be able to subscribe to Capgemini shares within the framework of subscription leveraged and guaranteed formulas.

The voting rights will be exercised by the holders who – depending on the formula and the context – will be an FCPE (Fonds Commun de Placement d’Entreprise)  the employees via direct shareholding and/or the financial institution structuring the offer or its counterparties.The implementation of the leveraged guaranteed offering implies hedging transactions entered into by the financial institution structuring the offer (Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank)  on market or off- market  through purchases and/or sales of shares  purchase of call options and/or any other transactions  at any time  including during the Reference Price2 fixing period  i.e. from October 13 to November 9  2023  and over the entire course of the plan  i.e. until December 19  2028.DisclaimerThis press release may contain forward-looking statements.

Each vessel will be equipped with 12 megawatts (MW) of TECO 2030 fuel cells for main propulsion onboard.The TECO 2030 delivery scope is a green package approx. worth EUR 23 million per vessel. The delivery for TECO 2030 includes a complete system of fuel cells installed on a skid solution as well as power and automation equipment and is estimated to start shipment to shipyard by early-2026  with delivery in mid-2026. The fuel cell system will go into production at our Innovation Center in Narvik  Norway at the end of 2024.Pherousa Green Shipping 63.000 dwt Ultramax. Design DeltamarinA 12 MW fuel cell system will be utilized for full propulsion onboard each of the six vessels  enabling 100% emission-free operations. Each vessel will be about 63.000-deadweight tons and the first vessel is targeted for delivery Q1 2027.The TECO 2030 fuel cell system will be installed in combination with a Pherousa Green Technologies AS’ (PGT) ammonia to hydrogen cracker. Bunkering ammonia and cracking to hydrogen on board the vessel will solve the present storage and infrastructure challenges of hydrogen as a marine fuel and thus paving the way for zero-emission deep-sea shipping.Opting for hydrogen fuel cells in combination with an ammonia cracker allows shipowners to commence with ammonia and transition to hydrogen whenever desired  minimizing the investment risks. This approach does not only position ammonia as a viable hydrogen carrier but also enables its economic trade as a preferred fuel in shipping and complementing its traditional role in the chemical and fertilizer sector.The total supply agreement is subject to financing of PGS’ newbuild vessels and reaching a final contract of supply  including closing price negotiations  according to industry standards.”We are excited to team up with TECO 2030 and incorporate their Fuel Cell solution together with our own Cracking technology  permitting the Pherousa newbuildings to be the first ever fully electric deep-sea vessels on water ” said Hans Bredrup  Chairman of the Pherousa group. He further commented: “The technology combination between TECO 2030 and Pherousa doesn’t only reduce the ammonia consumption versus the ammonia fueled Internal Combustion Engines currently being developed  it also avoids burning Ammonia together with Carbon based pilot fuels” and adds: “Truly Zero-Emission by Choice.”“We are proud to sign a firm supply agreement for six vessels with Pherousa Green Shipping  they are a young forward-thinking shipowner who wants to realize zero emissions deep-sea shipping. Pherousa is an exciting company  with a clear vision of proving that hydrogen and ammonia can be utilized to fuel tomorrow’s deep-sea vessels ” said enthusiastically Tore Enger  Group CEO  TECO 2030.Contact TECO 2030:Tore Enger  Group CEO  +47 92083800  tore.enger@teco2030.noAbout TECO 2030:TECO 2030 is building up Europe's first Giga production facility of hydrogen PEM fuel cell stacks and modules in Narvik  Norway.

This modification of the primary endpoint  reducing the size of the study to 400 patients compared to 1 000 initially planned  will enable clinical results to be obtained as early as in the second quarter of 2024.Amending ACTISAVE study protocol should enable:a quicker confirmation of the efficacy and safety results obtained in February 2022 in the ACTIMIS study (and recently confirmed by the Brainomix study); a simplification of the evaluation  replacing the interim futility analyses planned by a final analysis; an opportunity to evaluate additional endpoints and several subpopulations  optimally supporting the best possible design and making it possible to identify those patients who should draw the best benefit from glenzocimab.To date  the ACTISAVE study deployed in the United States  Europe  Israel  and the United Kingdom  has recruited more than 380 patients  35% of whom have undergone a mechanical thrombectomy. Comparison of the patient populations included in ACTISAVE and ACTIMIS studies suggests that ACTISAVE patients will be more representative  in terms of severity at inclusion  of the general population of patients treated in hospital for a stroke.Regarding the pharmaceutical development plan  Acticor received the opinion from EMA and FDA during the summer. The authorities confirmed the relevance of the registration strategy in terms of production process validation and glenzocimab characterization. Recommendations have been proposed and will be implemented in the roadmap  without impacting the registration plan.Based on the results of the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 study and on recommendations from world leading stroke experts  Acticor plans to consult the EMA and FDA again during 2024 to confirm that the phase 3 design will support registration in both Europe and the United States  projected no later than 2028.Gilles Avenard  Chief Executive Officer of Acticor Biotech  commented: ""We are very pleased with this strategic decision  which will enable us to obtain clinical results as early as mid-2024. We will then have two independent studies showing the efficacy of our drug and we will be able to define  in consultation with the FDA and the EMA  the design of phase 3 for the registration of this promising drug in the treatment of the acute phase of stroke. This evolution of our clinical strategy also has the advantage of reducing our current costs and consequently our financing requirements for 2024”About ACTICOR BIOTECHActicor Biotech is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  a spin-off from INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research)  which is aiming to develop an innovative treatment for cardiovascular emergencies  including ischemic stroke.The positive results from its Phase 1b/2a study  ACTIMIS  confirmed the safety profile and showed a reduction in mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage in the glenzocimab-treated group in patients with stroke. The efficacy of glenzocimab is now being evaluated in an international Phase 2/3 study  ACTISAVE. In July 2022  Acticor Biotech was granted ""PRIME"" status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for glenzocimab in the treatment of stroke. This designation will allow the company to strengthen its interactions and obtain early dialogues with regulatory authorities.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Mediolanum farmaceutici  Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Anaxago  and the Armesa foundation).

(NYSE: VOYA)  a leading health  wealth and investment company  is releasing new findings from a consumer research survey highlighting trends and consumer interest areas for the 2023 benefits open enrollment season. Among many findings  Voya’s research revealed that as the rising costs of goods and services associated with inflation is leveling out for many  a majority (79%) of working Americans strongly or somewhat agree that they are worried their workplace benefits will cost them more this open enrollment season because of inflation. This is an increase from 66% recorded in June 2022 when inflation was at its peak. Voya’s research also found that 7 in 10 (72%) of employed Americans strongly or somewhat agree that  because of inflation  they will spend more time reviewing their benefit elections during open enrollment to help them make the most of their benefit dollars.“As the economy continues to work to recover from the financial impacts of both the pandemic and the added layer of inflationary costs  it’s clear that many individuals are still feeling the financial strains ” said Rob Grubka  CEO of Workplace Solutions for Voya Financial. “With our research also revealing that 88% of individuals feel like their money does not go as far as it used to  when it comes to enrolling in their workplace benefits this fall  understandably  many have concerns about the impacts to their paycheck.”Finances and mental health go hand in handVoya’s research also revealed that more than half (57%) of Americans strongly or somewhat agree that their financial stability has a direct impact on their mental health. As finances remain top of mind for many as they enter this year’s open enrollment season  benefits  including those with a focus on mental health  are being considered more than before. What’s more  the “ask” from today’s workforce is also becoming increasingly apparent as more than half (55%) of employed individuals strongly or somewhat agree their employer has a responsibility in ensuring they are mentally healthy and emotionally well. This has proven even more important as nearly half (48%) said they would select a workplace benefit offered by their employer that provides more mental health support and resources even if it costs them more.“While traditional benefits like medical and dental insurance remain top of mind for many employers and employees  it’s clear that both financial and mental health needs are now equally important components of a comprehensive benefits package ” added Grubka. “And this can have implications for both employers and employees — not only did our research find that 63% of employees somewhat or strongly agree that their mental health has a direct impact on their ability to perform their job effectively  but half of employed Americans also agreed that they are more likely to stay with current employer if offered mental health benefits and resources. As a result  it’s clear that employers have an opportunity to provide the mental health and well-being resources and support that their workforce has come to expect.”While benefit selection confidence remains high  support and guidance remain criticalWhen it comes time to selecting benefits during open enrollment  Voya has seen that inertia can often play a big role for employees in making benefits changes  where many individuals have the tendency to select the benefits they enrolled in previously. The good news is that today’s environment is encouraging employees to take a more thoughtful approach  particularly given the overall financial concerns impacting consumers. As a result  a majority (79%) of employed individuals are interested in receiving support to maximize their workplace benefit dollars across their retirement savings  health savings accounts (HSAs)  health care insurance and voluntary benefits at work.In response — and to help employers and employees gain more holistic views into their workplace benefits and savings — Voya recently launched myVoyage  a new and first-of-its-kind personalized financial-guidance and connected workplace-benefits digital platform. In addition to a focus on digital resources  and to support the growing employee expectations that employers provide mental health resources  Voya has also recently expanded its critical illness and accident insurance solutions  offering new benefits and coverage to focus on mental health.As an industry leader focused on the delivery of health  wealth and investment solutions to and through the workplace  Voya Financial is committed to delivering on its mission to make a secure financial future possible for all — one person  one family  one institution at a time.All data based on the results of a Voya Financial Consumer Insights & Research survey conducted June 12-13  2023  on the Ipsos eNation omnibus online platform among 1 004 adults aged 18+ in the U.S.  featuring 483 Americans working full-time or part-time.About Voya Financial®Voya Financial  Inc.

For Cofinimmo  this transaction  which is in line with the agreements signed at the end of 2020  represents an investment of approximately 13 million EUR. This corresponds to a stake of just over 11%  to be added to the 39% already acquired in December 2020. The Cofinimmo group's stake now amounts to 50% plus one share of the capital of the company  making it the majority shareholder. This stake increase generates the consolidation of SCI Foncière CRF in Cofinimmo's accounts. Jean-PierreHanin  CEO of Cofinimmo:""This transaction enables us to strengthen the partnership entered into with the French Red Cross in 2018 with the acquisition of an aftercare and rehabilitation hospital (SSR) under construction in Chalon-sur-Saône. This partnership was already extended in December 2020 with our entry into the capital of the property company SCI Foncière CRF  created by the French Red Cross  in which we are further increasing our stake today."" 1 2 See also the press release dated 24.12.2020 on www.cofinimmo.com. Corresponds to the French 'Société civile immobilière'. 1PRESS RELEASE Brussels  14.09.2023  5:40 PM CET 1. The sites SCI Foncière CRF owns six high-end sites spread throughout France: six aftercare and rehabilitation clinics (cliniques de soins de suite et de réadaptation - 'SSR')  two of which are also active in medicine  surgery and obstetrics (médecine  chirurgie et obstétrique - 'MCO'). With the exception of a few extensions built before 1998  the six sites comprise around thirty buildings (excluding extensions)  all of which were built or renovated between 1998 and 2019 (and most of them from 2010 onwards). All the sites are leased to the French Red Cross. 2. The transaction Following its entry  in December 2020  into the capital of SCI Foncière CRF  the Cofinimmo group has increased its stake in the capital of the company. For the Cofinimmo group  this investment amounts to approximately 13 million EUR  which corresponds to a stake of just over 11%  to be added to the 39% already acquired in December 2020. The amount of this investment was included in the investment estimate for 2023  as published in section 11.1 of the press release dated 17.02.2023  and confirmed in section 11.1 of the press release dated 28.07.2023. As the Cofinimmo group now owns 50% plus one share of the capital of the company  the latter will be included in Cofinimmo's consolidation scope (previously recognised under the equity method). The change in the consolidation method will have no impact on the net result - group share  but will impact the presentation of the income statement (in particular due to the recognition of around 10 million EUR of rental income on yearly basis). The balance sheet of SCI Foncière CRF that will be consolidated  mainly consists of approximately 180 million EUR of investment properties and approximately 70 million EUR of financial debts. 3.

Data from our landmark POSEIDON study was presented at the prestigious international EASL liver congress and reaffirms alfapump's strong clinical profile - virtually eliminating the need for needle paracentesis and significantly improving patients' quality of life. Although not powered for survival  the study's one-year survival probability of 70% is encouraging in a patient population where 50% survival after one year is typically reported. We are pleased to see the progress of TCET[1]in the US and applaud CMS[2]intent to support patient care and innovation by providing a new national coverage pathway for promising FDA-designated breakthrough devices such as the alfapump.""We are excited to have the MOJAVE study of our second-generation DSR product in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients underway in the US  with first patients enrolled. In this Phase 1/2a randomized controlled study  we are seeking to build upon the strong results of our SAHARA study where we demonstrated DSR's disease-modifying profile - safe  effective and rapid elimination of persistent congestion  important improvements in cardiovascular and renal health  and the restoration of diuretic response of the kidney. We look forward to reporting initial safety and efficacy data from the non-randomized cohort by year end  and are planning for enrollment of up to 30 patients into the randomized cohort next year.""Despite challenging market conditions  we've secured additional financing  extending our cash runway into the first quarter of 2024.

Data from our landmark POSEIDON study was presented at the prestigious international EASL liver congress and reaffirms alfapump’s strong clinical profile – virtually eliminating the need for needle paracentesis and significantly improving patients' quality of life. Although not powered for survival  the study's one-year survival probability of 70% is encouraging in a patient population where 50% survival after one year is typically reported. We are pleased to see the progress of TCET1 in the US and applaud CMS2 intent to support patient care and innovation by providing a new national coverage pathway for promising FDA-designated breakthrough devices such as the alfapump.“We are excited to have the MOJAVE study of our second-generation DSR product in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients underway in the US  with first patients enrolled. In this Phase 1/2a randomized controlled study  we are seeking to build upon the strong results of our SAHARA study where we demonstrated DSR’s disease-modifying profile – safe  effective and rapid elimination of persistent congestion  important improvements in cardiovascular and renal health  and the restoration of diuretic response of the kidney. We look forward to reporting initial safety and efficacy data from the non-randomized cohort by year end  and are planning for enrollment of up to 30 patients into the randomized cohort next year.“Despite challenging market conditions  we've secured additional financing  extending our cash runway into the first quarter of 2024. We're delighted to welcome Ken Macleod to our Board  whose wealth of experience in healthcare companies and life science fund management will be invaluable to our journey.”Highlights from year 2023 to dateNorth American alfapump liver programPOSEIDON – data presented by Principal Investigator Prof. Wong at EASL 2023 Congress from successful pivotal study in patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  supports strong clinical profile of alfa pump Effective control of ascites  virtually eliminating needle paracentesis Safety in line with expectations Clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in patients’ quality of life at six months post-implantation compared to baseline One year survival of 70% compares favorably to literature citing 50% in this patient population 3pump On track to file PMA application to the US FDA in Q4 2023DSR heart failure programSuccessful completion of IND 4 -enabling pre-clinical and Phase 1 studies of second-generation DSR product (DSR 2.0) Data from GLP 5 studies in mice and sheep showed there was no difference in systemic and local toxic effects in animals treated repeatedly with DSR 2.0 compared to animals in the control group  concluding that DSR 2.0 had consistent safety with the standard peritoneal dialysis solution used in the control group. Data from the Phase 1 CHIHUAHUA study in stable peritoneal dialysis patients demonstrated that a single dose of DSR 2.0 was safe and well-tolerated and indicated a compelling dosing profile.-enabling pre-clinical and Phase 1 studies of second-generation DSR product (DSR 2.0) MOJAVE – US randomized controlled Phase 1/2a study of DSR 2.0 for treatment of congestive heart failure underway First patients enrolled in non-randomized cohort of three patients.

These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for Q4 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company has commenced MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0  with initial data expected in Q4 2023.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The convertible bonds will not be secured and will have a maturity date at the horizon of December 31  2030  which can be further extended by BioSenic for up to 24 months depending on its cash balance  end of 2032. BioSenic has also negotiated a lower interest rate of 5% per year  payable annually  with an additional non-compounding interest of 3% per year that will be added to the principal amount upon conversion or (p)repayment of a convertible bond. The convertible bonds will only become convertible as from 10 trading days after the announcement of the official remittance to the Regulatory Agency of the Final Clinical Report following the final results of BioSenic’s phase 3 clinical trial of its lead Oral ATO therapeutic candidate targeting chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). The conversion price will be equal to 95% of the 30-calendar day VWAP immediately preceding the date of the conversion notice. The outstanding warrants of Patronale are being cancelled.The outstanding loan from the European Investment Bank (""EIB"") for a principal outstanding amount of EUR 8 million should as well be extended to 2030  with the same 24-month extension possibility as for the new convertible bonds. The interest rate will also be aligned with the new convertible bonds. The outstanding warrants of the EIB should also cancelled  and EIB should receive a similar return as Monument and Patronale if the new convertible bonds are effectively converted into shares. The completion of the restructuring is still subject to EIB approval.Completion of the refinancing of the loans granted by Patronale  Monument and the EIB will be subject to BioSenic raising sufficient new equity for BioSenic to continue its operations including the initiation in Q2 2024 of a Phase 3 clinical trial of its lead Oral ATO therapeutic candidate targeting cGvHD.These voluntary agreements  which will be submitted to the competent Belgian Enterprise Court for homologation as part of a freely accepted settlement procedure  increase BioSenic’s financial stability to continue to develop critical therapies for patients with none or few alternative options  and demonstrate the trust of BioSenic’s main creditors. The pending stated confidence of the Chairman of the Enterprise Court will establish that BioSenic has a sound prospect of business development and viability and that the agreements are feasible without prejudicing the rights of third parties over the assets of BioSenic. This will bring Yves Brulard's mandate to reach a negotiated agreement with the main historic creditors of Bone Therapeutics to an end.These agreements give also the opportunity to BioSenic to participate intensively in the ongoing development of the regional network and should meet the requirements of the Walloon Region's multiannual research programs. BioSenic also obtained an agreement with the ABO Securities subsidiary  Global Tech Opportunities 15  to secure short term financing on the basis of its existing convertible bond program.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic said: ""BioSenic has achieved ongoing financial stability to continue its development programs with theoptimal restructuring of the debts inherited from Bone Therapeutics. Since the reverse merger operated last October 2022  the main financial organizations involved in the past programs of the company that became BioSenic were evaluating the chances to reorganize and renew both the structure and the programs of the company. This has been successfully recognized by the present term sheets  and gives long term financial stability to BioSenic. We can now concentrate on clinical accomplishment and innovation  for the full benefit of patients that are expecting new therapies for inflammatory  degenerative or autoimmune diseases  for which our ATO or cell repair platforms will provide decisive progress.”About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in orthopedics.Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined a strategic positionings and strengths to use  separately and combined  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com .About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:The ATO platform  which has been successfully developed  has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T and other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). cGvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. BioSenic has been successful in a Phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international Phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early Phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a Phase 2 clinical protocol. The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform developed by BioSenic  with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. ALLOB has recently been evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2b study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late-delayed union. However  in June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in this exploratory Phase 2b clinical trial  interpreted as a failure of a too early cell injection  just after fracture. BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (choice between early or late treatment).Note: Biosenic has reevaluated a previous important and years-long clinical development program. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase 3 JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient subpopulation. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. This leads to a next generation of JTA  off-the-shelf enhanced viscosupplement to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives are intended to provide effective lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic (OA) pain and inflammation.The company  will nevertheless focus its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

Results confirm clinical activity and favorable safety profile of lacutamab. Results showed that lacutamab produced an increased global objective response rate (ORR) of 42.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]  24.5-63.5) in patients with KIR3DL2 ≥ 1% MF (cohort 2  n=21)  including 2 complete responses and 7 partial responses.Initial PTCL data are expected in H2 2023. Two parallel clinical trials to study lacutamab in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing  relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) are ongoing.ANKET® (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics):ANKET® is Innate’s proprietary platform for developing next-generation  multi-specific NK cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer. Innate’s pipeline includes four public drug candidates born from the ANKET® platform: SAR’579 / IPH6101 (CD123-targeted)  SAR’514 / IPH6401 (BCMA-targeted)  IPH62 (B7-H3-targeted) and tetra-specific IPH65 (CD20-targeted). Several other undisclosed proprietary preclinical targets are being explored.SAR’579 / IPH6101  SAR’514 / IPH6401 and IPH62 (partnered with Sanofi)SAR’579 / IPH6101The Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi is progressing well  evaluating SAR’579 / IPH6101   a trifunctional anti-CD123 NKp46×CD16 NK cell engager and ANKET ® platform lead asset  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). Phase 1/2 dose escalation safety and preliminary efficacy of SAR'579 / IPH6101 in R/R AML  B-ALL and HR-MDS were presented during an oral presentation at the ASCO (American Society for Clinical Oncology) 2023 Annual Meeting in June. Preliminary data showed SAR’579 / IPH6101 was well tolerated and induced 3 complete responses in the 8 patients at 1 mg/kg as highest dose. In June  SAR’579 / IPH6101 received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Fast Track Designation for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Preclinical data showing the control of AML cells by a trifunctional NKp46-CD16a-NK cell engager targeting CD123 were published in Nature Biotechnology in January 2023.  a trifunctional anti-CD123 NKp46×CD16 NK cell engager and ANKET platform lead asset  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).SAR’514 / IPH6401In July 2023  partner Sanofi advanced SAR’514 / IPH6401   a trifunctional anti-BCMA Nkp46xCD16 NK cell engager  to first-in-human clinical trial in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM) and Relapsed/Refractory Light-chain Amyloidosis (RRLCA) Our partner presented preclinical data showing SAR’514 / IPH6401 has potent in-vitro  in-vivo and ex-vivo anti-myeloma effect through dual NK cell engagement in a poster at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2023 in April.  a trifunctional anti-BCMA Nkp46xCD16 NK cell engager  to first-in-human clinical trial in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM) and Relapsed/Refractory Light-chain Amyloidosis (RRLCA)IPH62As announced on December 19  2022  Sanofi licensed IPH62  a NK cell engager program targeting B7-H3 from Innate’s ANKET® platform  and the company has the option to add up to two additional ANKET® targets. Upon candidate selection  Sanofi will be responsible for all development  manufacturing and commercialization. Under the terms of the agreement  Innate received a €25m upfront payment and is eligible for up to €1.35bn total in preclinical  clinical  regulatory and commercial milestones plus royalties on potential net sales.IPH65 (proprietary)Following approval of the IND-filing by the FDA in July 2023  IPH65  Innate’s proprietary CD20 targeted tetra-specific ANKET ® continues toward a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2023. Updated preclinical data on IPH65 were presented at the European Hematology Association (EHA) 2023 congress in June.continues toward a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2023.Monalizumab (anti-NKG2A antibody)  partnered with AstraZeneca:Innate continues to see progress for monalizumab in the early non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) setting  with the ongoing Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 study run by AstraZeneca. The study is evaluating durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab or AstraZeneca’s oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT). Monalizumab was highlighted in two “Trial in progress” posters at the ASCO 2023 Annual Meeting in June: Phase 3 study of durvalumab combined with oleclumab or monalizumab in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC (PACIFIC-9). NeoCOAST-2: A Phase 2 study of neoadjuvant durvalumab plus novel immunotherapies (IO) and chemotherapy (CT) or MEDI5752 (volrustomig) plus CT  followed by surgery and adjuvant durvalumab plus novel IO or volrustomig alone in patients with resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).IPH5201 (anti-CD39)  partnered with AstraZeneca:In June 2023  the first patient was dosed in the MATISSE Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by Innate in neoadjuvant lung cancer for IPH5201  an anti-CD39 blocking monoclonal antibody developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca.IPH5301 (anti-CD73):The investigator-sponsored CHANCES Phase 1 trial of IPH5301 with Institut Paoli-Calmettes is ongoing.Antibody Drug Conjugates:Fueling its R&D engine  the Company continues to develop different approaches for the treatment of cancer utilizing its antibody engineering capabilities to deliver novel assets  with its innovative ANKET® platform and continuing to explore Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADC) formats.Takeda license agreement:In April 2023  Innate announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target  with a primary focus in Celiac disease. Under the terms of the license agreement  Innate received a $5m upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to $410m in future development  regulatory and commercial milestones if all milestones are achieved during the term of the agreement  plus royalties on potential net sales of any commercial product resulting from the license.IPH45 (nectin-4 ADC):Innate’s proprietary nectin-4 targeted antibody drug conjugate  IPH45 continues toward a Phase 1 clinical trial.Corporate Update:On April 26  Innate announced the establishment of a new At-The-Market (ATM) program  pursuant to which it may  from time to time  offer and sell to eligible investors a total gross amount of up to $75 million American Depositary Shares (“ADS”). Each ADS representing one ordinary share of Innate.Dr. Sonia Quaratino  MD  PhD  will join Innate Pharma as Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer  effective October 2023. Dr. Sonia Quaratino succeeds to Dr. Karakunnel who is leaving the Company to pursue other challenges. Dr. Quaratino brings over 25 years of experience in basic research  clinical development  and translational medicine  having worked in academia  global large pharmaceuticals  and biotechs. Recently  Dr. Quaratino was Chief Medical Officer at Georgiamune INC.(USA) and prior to that she was Chief Medical Officer at Kymab (UK)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a focus on immune-mediated diseases and immuno-oncology  acquired by Sanofi in 2021. Previously  she held roles at Novartis (Switzerland) and Merck Serono (Germany)  and was Professor of Immunology in UK at the University of Southampton. Her research has been published in high impact scientific journals.Financial highlights for the first half of 2023:The key elements of Innate’s financial position and financial results as of and for the six-month period ended June 30  2023 are as follows:Cash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets amounting to €124.7 million (€m) as of June 30  2023 (€136.6m as of December 31  2022).Revenue and other income from continuing operations amounted to €40.2m in the first half of 2023 (€45.6m in the first half of 2022) and mainly comprise of: Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements  which mainly resulted from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca  Sanofi and Takeda. They results from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca  Sanofi and Takeda. They are recognized when the entity's performance obligation is met. Their accounting is made at a point in time or spread over time according to the percentage of completion of the work that the Company is committed to carry out under these agreements: (i) Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements for monalizumab decreased by €6.9m to €9.5m in the first half of 2023 (€16.4m in the first half of 2022). This change mainly results from the transaction price increase of €13.4 million ($14.0 million) in the first half of 2022  triggered by the launch of the “PACIFIC-9” Phase 3 trial on April 28  2022. As a reminder  this increase in the transaction price led to the recognition of an additional revenue of €12.5 million for the first half of 2022. However  this decrease is partially offset by an increase in monalizumab-related revenues for the first half of 2023  in line with the progress of Phase 1/2 trials over the period. (ii) Revenue related to the license and collaboration agreement signed with Sanofi in 2016 decreased by €1.0m  to €2.0m for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to €3.0m for the six months ended June 30  2022. The Company announced that  in June 2023  the first patient was dosed in a Sanofi-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating SAR'514/IPH6401 in relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma. As provided by the licensing agreement signed in 2016  Sanofi made a milestone payment of €2.0 million  fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. This amount was received by the Company on July 21  2023. As a reminder  the revenue recognized in the first half of 2022 resulted from Sanofi's decision to advance SAR'514/IPH6401 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. As such  Sanofi had selected a second multispecific antibody engaging NK cells as a drug candidate. This selection triggered a €3.0 million milestone payment from Sanofi to the Company  fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2022. (iii) Revenue of €18.7 million related to the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed with Sanofi in 2022. On January 25  2023  the Company announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the effectiveness of the licensing agreement as of January 24  2023. Consequently  the Company received an upfront payment of €25.0 million in March 2023  including €18.5 million for the exclusive license  €1.5 million for the research work and €5.0 million for the two additional targets options. The €18.5 million upfront payment relating to the exclusive license has been fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. The €1.5 million upfront payment will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the research work that the Company has agreed to carry out. The €5.0 million initial payment relating to the options is recognized in deferred revenue—non-current portion as of June 30  2023. The Company will recognize the related revenues either at the reporting date or three years after the effective date. (iv) Revenue of €4.6m related to the licensing agreement signed with Takeda in 2023. On April 3  2023  the Company announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target  with a primary focus in Celiac disease. Takeda will be responsible for the future development  manufacture and commercialization of any potential products developed using the licensed antibodies. As such  the Company considers that the license granted is a right to use the intellectual property  which is granted fully and perpetually to Takeda. The agreement does not stipulate that Innate's activities will significantly affect the intellectual property granted during the life of the agreement. Consequently  the $5.0 million (or €4.6 million) initial payment  received by the Company in May 2023  was fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. Government funding for research expenditures of €4.9m in the first half of 2023 (€4.3m in the first half of 2022).Operating expenses from continuing operations are €40.6m in the first half of 2023 (€37.1m in the first half of 2022)  of which 77.5% (€31.5m) are related to R&D. R&D expenses from continuing operations increased by €6.5m to €31.5m in the first half of 2023 (€25.0m in the first half of 2022). This change mainly results from (i) a €4.9m increase in direct R&D expenses relating to €4.8m non-clinical program in the Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADC) field and a slight increase of clinical programs of €0.1m; (ii) Personnel expenses and other R&D expenses increased by €1.6m (12.9%) to reach €14.2m in the first half 2023 compared to €12.6m in the first half 2022. This increase is mainly explained by €2.0m amortization for the rights relating to IPH5201 following the first patient dosed in the Phase 2 MATISSE clinical trial. The amortization of rights related to the monalizumab decreased by €0.3m. General and administrative (G&A) expenses from continuing operations decreased by €3.0m to €9.1m in the first half of 2023 (€12.1m in the first half of 2022) mainly resulting from ((i) a €1.4m decrease of personnel expenses mainly due to a reduction of administrative workforce  (ii) a €0.6m decrease on non-scientific advisory and consulting fees (limited use of recruitment agencies and strategic consulting)  and finally (iii) a decrease on other expenses for €1.0m mainly related to a decrease on leasing and maintenance for €0.5m to the benefit of research and development enabling a more consistent allocation of support expenses to the company's research laboratory as well as a reduction of 0.2 million following more limited use of external communication and investor relations service providers.Net income from discontinued operations related to Lumoxiti are nil compared to a net loss of €0.1 million for the first half of 2022 corresponding to residual costs associated with the transfer of activities to AstraZeneca. This transfer has now been completed.A net financial gain of €2.1m in the first half of 2023 (net financial loss of €2.1m in the first half of 2022)  principally as a result of the increase in fair value of certain of our financial instruments and net foreign exchange gain over the period.A net income of €1.7m for the first half of 2023 (net income of €6.3m for the first half of 2022).The table below summarizes the IFRS consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30  2023  including 2022 comparative information.In thousands of euros  except for data per share June 30  2023 June 30  2022 Revenue and other income 40 198 45 589 Research and development expenses (31 453) (24 956) General and administrative expenses (9 144) (12 140) Operating expenses (40 597) (37 096) Operating income (loss) (398) 8 494 Net financial income (loss) 2 116 (2 118) Income tax expense — — Net income (loss) from continuing operations 1 718 6 376 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations — (73) Net income (loss) 1 718 6 303 Weighted average number of shares ( in thousands) : 80 320 79 754 - Basic income (loss) per share 0.02 0.08 - Diluted income (loss) per share 0.02 0.08 - Basic income (loss) per share from continuing operations 0.02 0.08 - Diluted income (loss) per share from continuing operations 0.02 0.08 - Basic income (loss) per share from discontinued operations — — - Diluted income (loss) per share from discontinued operations — —June 30  2023 December 31  2022 Cash  cash equivalents and financial assets 124 679 136 604 Total assets 199 049 207 863 Total shareholders’ equity 57 863 54 151 Total financial debt 40 658 42 251About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.

These revenues mainly result from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca  Sanofi and Takeda. They are recognized when the entity's performance obligation is met. Their accounting is made at a point in time or spread over time according to the percentage of completion of the work that the Company is committed to carry out under these agreements.The evolution for the first half of 2023 is mainly due to:A €6.9 million decrease in revenue related to monalizumab  to €9.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to €16.4 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. This change mainly results from the transaction price increase of €13.4 million ($14.0 million) in the first half of 2022  triggered by the launch of the “PACIFIC-9” Phase 3 trial on April 28  2022. As a reminder  this increase in the transaction price led to the recognition of an additional revenue of €12.5 million for the first half of 2022. However  this decrease is partially offset by an increase in monalizumab-related revenues for the first half of 2023  in line with the progress of Phase 1/2 trials over the period. As of June 30  2023  the deferred revenue related to monalizumab is €4.7 million entirely classified as “Deferred revenue—Current portion” in connection with the maturity of Phase 1/2 trials.A €4.8 million decrease in revenue related to IPH5201 which are nil for the six months ended June 30  2023 . The revenue for the first half of 2022 resulted from the entire recognition in revenue of the $5.0 million milestone payment received from AstraZeneca following the signature on June 1  2022 of an amendment to the initial contract signed in October 2018. As a reminder  this amendment sets the terms of the collaboration following AstraZeneca’s decision to advance IPH5201 to a Phase 2 study. The Company conducts the study. Both parties share the external cost related to the study and incurred by the Company and AstraZeneca provides products necessary to conduct the clinical trial.As a reminder  during the first half of 2022  AstraZeneca informed the Company that it will not exercise its option to license the four preclinical programs covered in the ""Future Programs Option Agreement"". This option agreement was part of the 2018 multi-term agreement between AstraZeneca and the Company under which the Company received an upfront payment of $20.0 million (€17.4 million). Innate has regained full rights to further develop the four preclinical molecules. Consequently  the entire initial payment of $20.0 million  or €17.4 million was recognized as revenue as of June 30  2022.The recognition of €18.7 million in revenue as of June 30  2023  relating to the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed with Sanofi in 2022. On January 25  2023  the Company announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the effectiveness of the licensing agreement as of January 24  2023. Consequently  the Company received an upfront payment of €25.0 million in March 2023  including €18.5 million for the exclusive license  €1.5 million for the research work and €5.0 million for the two additional targets options. The Company considers that the license to the B7-H3 technology is a right to use the intellectual property granted exclusively to Sanofi from the effective date of the agreement. As such  the €18.5 million upfront payment relating to the exclusive license has been fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. The Company will provide collaborative research services to Sanofi for a three years period from the effective date of the collaboration  i.e. January 24  2023. Consequently  the corresponding upfront payment of €1.5 million will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the research work that the Company has agreed to carry out. As a result  a €0.2 million has been recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023  and amounts not recognized in revenue are classified as deferred revenue—current portion for €0.4 million and deferred revenue—non-current portion for €0.9 million. Under the terms of this agreement  the Company has also granted two exclusive options  exercisable no later than three years after the effective date  for exclusive licenses to Innate's intellectual property for the research  development  manufacture and commercialization of NKCEs specifically targeting two preclinical molecules. The Company considers that the option to acquire an exclusive license provide a material right to Sanofi that it would not receive without entering into this agreement. The Company will recognize the related revenues either at the reporting date or three years after the effective date. Consequently  the €5.0 million initial payment relating to these options is recognized in deferred revenue—non-current portion as of June 30  2023.The recognition of €4.6 million in revenue from licensing agreement signed with Takeda in 2023. On April 3  2023  the Company announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target  with a primary focus in Celiac disease. Takeda will be responsible for the future development  manufacture and commercialization of any potential products developed using the licensed antibodies. As such  the Company considers that the license granted is a right to use the intellectual property  which is granted fully and perpetually to Takeda. The agreement does not stipulate that Innate's activities will significantly affect the intellectual property granted during the life of the agreement. Consequently  the $5.0 million (or €4.6 million) initial payment  received by the Company in May 2023  was fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023.A €1.0 million decrease in revenue from collaboration and research license agreement signed with Sanofi in 2016  to €2.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to €3.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The Company announced that  in June 2023  the first patient was dosed in a Sanofi-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating SAR'514/IPH6401 in relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma. As provided by the licensing agreement signed in 2016  Sanofi made a milestone payment of €2.0 million  fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. This amount was received by the Company on July 21  2023. As a reminder  the revenue recognized in the first half of 2022 resulted from Sanofi's decision to advance SAR'514/IPH6401 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. As such  Sanofi had selected a second multispecific antibody engaging NK cells as a drug candidate. This selection triggered a €3.0 million milestone payment from Sanofi to the Company  fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2022. This amount was received by the Company on September 9  2022.A €0.6 million increase in revenue from invoicing of research and development costs. The change between the two periods is mainly explained by the increase in research and development costs incurred by the Company under these agreements during the first half of 2023 in line with the clinical trial progress.Government funding for research expendituresGovernment financing for research expenditures increased by €0.5 million  or 12.4%  to €4.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2023 as compared to €4.3 million the six months ended June 30  2022. This change is primarily a result of a increase in the research tax credit of €0.6 million  which is mainly due to (i) the increase in depreciation on IPH5201 rights following the full amortization of the additional payment of €2.0 million due to Orega Biotech following the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 2 MATISSE clinical trial  and (ii) the absence of grants recognized during the first half of 2023 as compared to the remaining Force financing of €0 7 million received in the first half of 2022 from BPI following the technical and commercial failure of the project based on the results of the Phase 2 ""Force"" trial evaluating avdoralimab in COVID-19. However  these decreases are partially offset by a decrease in public and private R&D subcontracting expenses eligible due to the maturity of clinical trials and the non-inclusion  as a precautionary measure  of subcontracting expenses with a supplier whose agreement is in the process of being renewed as of June 30  2023. In addition  this decrease is also explained by the decrease in amortization of the monalizumab intangible asset due to the extension of the amortization period  as well as for certain tangible assets which had reached the end of their amortization period  and also by lower R&D personnel costsThe Company met again the SME status under European Union criteria since December 31  2020. As such  it was eligible for the early repayment by the French treasury of the 2021 Research Tax Credit for an amount of €10.3 million in 2022 and also the 2022 Research Tax Credit for an amount of €9.2 million. These amounts was received by the Company on November 16 2022 and July 21  2023  respectively.Operating expensesThe table below presents our operating expenses from continuing operations for the six months periods ended June 30  2023 and 2022:In thousands of euros June 30  2023 June 30  2022 Research and development expenses (31 453 ) (24 956 ) General and administrative expenses (9 144 ) (12 140 ) Operating expenses (40 597 ) (37 096 )Research and development expensesResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses from continuing operations increased by €6.5 million  or 26.0%  to €31.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to €25.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2022  representing a total of 77.5% and 67.3% of the total operating expenses  respectively. R&D expenses include direct R&D expenses (subcontracting costs and consumables)  depreciation and amortization  and personnel expenses.Direct R&D expenses increased by €4.9 million  or 39.4%  to €17.3 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to €12.4 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. This increase is mainly explained by €4.8 million non-clinical program in the Antibody Drug Conjugates – ADC field and a slight increase of clinical programs of €0.1 million. The increase of €0.9 million on IPH5201 is linked to startup costs of Phase 2 MATISSE clinical trial and is partly offset by the decrease expenses related to lacutamab program for €0.2 million as well as avdoralimab and monalizumab programs for respectively 0.2 million euros and 0.2 million euros. These decreases follow the decision taken by the Company at the end of the first half of 2020 to stop recruitment in trials evaluating avdoralimab in oncology and the maturity of Phase 1/2 clinical trials entering the scope of the collaboration with AstraZeneca regarding monalizumab.Also  as of June 30  2023  the collaboration liabilities relating to monalizumab and the agreements signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015  October 2018 and September 2020 amounted to €56.1 million  as compared to collaborations liabilities to €63.2 million as of December 31  2022. This decrease of €7.2 million mainly results from (i) the net reimbursement of €6.4 million made in the first half 2023 to AstraZeneca relating to the co-financing of the monalizumab program  mainly including the Phase 3 INTERLINK-1 trial launched in October 2020 and (ii) the decrease in the collaboration commitment for the amount of €1.1 million in connection with the observed exchange rate fluctuations over the period for the euro-dollar parity.Personnel and other expenses allocated to R&D increased by €1.6 million  or 12.9%  to €14.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to an amount of €12.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. This increase is mainly due to €2.0 million amortization for the rights relating to IPH5201 following the first patient dosed in the Phase 2 MATISSE clinical trial. The amortization of rights related to the monalizumab is decreasing by €0.3 million.General and administrative expensesGeneral and administrative expenses from continuing activities decreased by €3.0 million  or 24.7%  to €9.1 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to general and administrative expenses of €12.1 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. General and administrative expenses represented a total of 22.5% and 32.7% of the total operating expenses for the six months ended June 30  2023 and 2022  respectively.Personnel expense includes the compensation paid to our employees  and decreased by €1.4 million  to €4.4 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to €5.8 million for six months ended June 30  2022. This decrease of €1.4 million is mainly due to a reduction of administrative workforce.Non-scientific advisory and consulting expenses mostly consist of auditing  accounting  taxation and legal fees as well as consulting fees in relation to business strategy and operations and hiring services. Non-scientific advisory and consulting expenses decreased by €0.6 million  or 25.9%  to €1.7 million for the six months ended June 30  2023 as compared to €2.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. This decrease is mainly due to the decrease in fees in connection with a limited use of recruitment agencies and strategic consulting in first half 2023 compared to first half 2022.The fall in other expenses of €1.0 million mainly results from a decrease on leasing and maintenance for €0.5 million for the benefit of research and development enabling a more consistent allocation of support expenses to the company's research laboratory as well as a decrease of €0.2 million on external communication and investor relations service providers.Financial income (loss)  netWe recognized a net financial income of €2.1 million in the six months ended June 30  2023 as compared to a net financial loss of €2.1 million in the six months ended June 30  2022. This variance mainly results from the variance in fair value of our financial instruments (net gain of €1.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2023 as compared to a net loss of €2.3 million for the six months ended June 30  2022) and a net foreign exchange gain of €0.4 million for the first half of 2023 as compared to a net foreign exchange gain of €0.1 million for the first half of 2022.Net loss from discontinued operationsAs a reminder  a Termination and Transition Agreement was negotiated and executed  effective as of June 30  2021 further to the Company's decision to return the rights of Lumoxiti back to AstraZeneca. Consecutively  activities related to Lumoxiti are presented as discontinued operations since October 1  2021.Thus  the net income from discontinued operations related to Lumoxiti are nil compared to a net loss of €0.1 million for the first half of 2022 corresponding to residual costs associated with the transfer of activities to AstraZeneca. This transfer has now been completed.Balance sheet itemsCash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and non-current financial assets amounted to €124.7 million as of June 30  2023  as compared to €136.6 million as of December 31  2022. Net cash as of June 30  2023 amounted to €83.6 million (€99.4 million as of December 31  2022). Net cash is equal to cash  cash equivalents and short-term investments less current financial liabilities.The Company also has bank borrowings of €39.6m  including €28.7m of State Guaranteed Loans (“Prêts Garantis par l’Etat”) as of June 30  2023  and €1.1m of lease liabilities.The other key balance sheet items as of June 30  2023 are:Deferred revenue of €11.0 million (including €6.0 million booked as ‘Deferred revenue – non-current portion’) and collaboration liabilities of €56.1 million (including €49.5 million booked as ‘Collaboration liabilities - non-current portion’) relating to the remainder of the initial payment received from AstraZeneca not yet recognized as revenue or used as part of the co-financing of the monalizumab program with AstraZeneca;Receivables from the French government amounting to €43.9 million in relation to the research tax credit for 2019  2020  2022 and the six-month period ended June 30  2023;Shareholders’ equity of €57.9 million  including the net income of the period of €1.7 million.Cash-flow itemsAs of June 30  2023  cash and cash equivalents amounted to €71.4 million  compared to €84.2 million as of December 31  2022  corresponding in a decrease of €12.8 million.The net cash flow used during the period under review mainly results from the following:Net cash flow used by operations of €11.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2023 as compared to net cash flows generated by operations of €1.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The net cash flow used in operating activities includes (i) the €25.0 million upfront payment received from Sanofi in March 2023 following the effectiveness of the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed in December 2022 under which the Company granted Sanofi an exclusive license to Innate Pharma's B7-H3 ANKET® program and options on two additional targets  but also (ii) the €4.6 million ($5.0 million) upfront payment received from Takeda following the signing of an exclusive licensing agreement which the Company grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights for the research and development of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). As a reminder  net cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2022 included the collection of €47.7 million  in June 2022  following the treatment of the first patient in the second Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating monalizumab  “PACIFIC-9”  partially offset by the €5.9 million payment to AstraZeneca on April 20  2022 pursuant to the Lumoxiti termination and transition agreement. Restated for these transactions  net cash flow used in operating activities for the first half of 2023 increased by €0.5 million as compared to the first half of 2022. This change mainly results from the occurrence of exceptional cash flows in the first half of 2022  notably in connection with personnel costs and the BPI repayable advance. Net outflows in connection with the monalizumab and IPH5201 collaboration agreement were stable over the period. Net cash flow consumed by operating activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation are nil for the first half of 2023  as compared to €5.5 million for the first half of 2022. The amount consumed for the first half of 2022 mainly relates to the payment of €5.9 million ($6.2 million) made to AstraZeneca in April 2022 in accordance with the Lumoxiti termination and transition agreement effective as of June 30  2021.Net cash flow used in investing activities of €0.2 million  as compared to €0.4 million for the first half of 2022. The Company has not made any other investments in tangible  intangible or significant financial assets during the first half of 2023 and 2022. Net cash flows consumed by investing activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation were nil for the first half of 2023 and 2022.Net cash flows used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30  2023 were €1.2 million as compared to net cash flow used in financing activities of €1.0 million the six months ended June 30  2022. These consumptions are mainly related to repayments of financial liabilities. Net cash flows consumed by financing activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation were nil for the first half of 2023 and 2022.Post period eventsNone.NotaThe interim consolidated financial statements for the six-month period ended June 30  2023 have been subject to a limited review by our Statutory Auditors and were approved by the Executive Board of the Company on September 13  2023.

Results confirm clinical activity and favorable safety profile of lacutamab. Results showed that lacutamab produced an increased global objective response rate (ORR) of 42.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]  24.5-63.5) in patients with KIR3DL2 ≥ 1% MF (cohort 2  n=21)  including 2 complete responses and 7 partial responses.Initial PTCL data are expected in H2 2023. Two parallel clinical trials to study lacutamab in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing  relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) are ongoing.ANKET® (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics):ANKET® is Innate’s proprietary platform for developing next-generation  multi-specific NK cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer. Innate’s pipeline includes four public drug candidates born from the ANKET® platform: SAR’579 / IPH6101 (CD123-targeted)  SAR’514 / IPH6401 (BCMA-targeted)  IPH62 (B7-H3-targeted) and tetra-specific IPH65 (CD20-targeted). Several other undisclosed proprietary preclinical targets are being explored.SAR’579 / IPH6101  SAR’514 / IPH6401 and IPH62 (partnered with Sanofi)SAR’579 / IPH6101The Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi is progressing well  evaluating SAR’579 / IPH6101   a trifunctional anti-CD123 NKp46×CD16 NK cell engager and ANKET ® platform lead asset  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). Phase 1/2 dose escalation safety and preliminary efficacy of SAR'579 / IPH6101 in R/R AML  B-ALL and HR-MDS were presented during an oral presentation at the ASCO (American Society for Clinical Oncology) 2023 Annual Meeting in June. Preliminary data showed SAR’579 / IPH6101 was well tolerated and induced 3 complete responses in the 8 patients at 1 mg/kg as highest dose. In June  SAR’579 / IPH6101 received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Fast Track Designation for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Preclinical data showing the control of AML cells by a trifunctional NKp46-CD16a-NK cell engager targeting CD123 were published in Nature Biotechnology in January 2023.  a trifunctional anti-CD123 NKp46×CD16 NK cell engager and ANKET platform lead asset  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).SAR’514 / IPH6401In July 2023  partner Sanofi advanced SAR’514 / IPH6401   a trifunctional anti-BCMA Nkp46xCD16 NK cell engager  to first-in-human clinical trial in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM) and Relapsed/Refractory Light-chain Amyloidosis (RRLCA) Our partner presented preclinical data showing SAR’514 / IPH6401 has potent in-vitro  in-vivo and ex-vivo anti-myeloma effect through dual NK cell engagement in a poster at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2023 in April.  a trifunctional anti-BCMA Nkp46xCD16 NK cell engager  to first-in-human clinical trial in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM) and Relapsed/Refractory Light-chain Amyloidosis (RRLCA)IPH62As announced on December 19  2022  Sanofi licensed IPH62  a NK cell engager program targeting B7-H3 from Innate’s ANKET® platform  and the company has the option to add up to two additional ANKET® targets. Upon candidate selection  Sanofi will be responsible for all development  manufacturing and commercialization. Under the terms of the agreement  Innate received a €25m upfront payment and is eligible for up to €1.35bn total in preclinical  clinical  regulatory and commercial milestones plus royalties on potential net sales.IPH65 (proprietary)Following approval of the IND-filing by the FDA in July 2023  IPH65  Innate’s proprietary CD20 targeted tetra-specific ANKET ® continues toward a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2023. Updated preclinical data on IPH65 were presented at the European Hematology Association (EHA) 2023 congress in June.continues toward a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2023.Monalizumab (anti-NKG2A antibody)  partnered with AstraZeneca:Innate continues to see progress for monalizumab in the early non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) setting  with the ongoing Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 study run by AstraZeneca. The study is evaluating durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab or AstraZeneca’s oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT). Monalizumab was highlighted in two “Trial in progress” posters at the ASCO 2023 Annual Meeting in June: Phase 3 study of durvalumab combined with oleclumab or monalizumab in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC (PACIFIC-9). NeoCOAST-2: A Phase 2 study of neoadjuvant durvalumab plus novel immunotherapies (IO) and chemotherapy (CT) or MEDI5752 (volrustomig) plus CT  followed by surgery and adjuvant durvalumab plus novel IO or volrustomig alone in patients with resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).IPH5201 (anti-CD39)  partnered with AstraZeneca:In June 2023  the first patient was dosed in the MATISSE Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by Innate in neoadjuvant lung cancer for IPH5201  an anti-CD39 blocking monoclonal antibody developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca.IPH5301 (anti-CD73):The investigator-sponsored CHANCES Phase 1 trial of IPH5301 with Institut Paoli-Calmettes is ongoing.Antibody Drug Conjugates:Fueling its R&D engine  the Company continues to develop different approaches for the treatment of cancer utilizing its antibody engineering capabilities to deliver novel assets  with its innovative ANKET® platform and continuing to explore Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADC) formats.Takeda license agreement:In April 2023  Innate announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target  with a primary focus in Celiac disease. Under the terms of the license agreement  Innate received a $5m upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to $410m in future development  regulatory and commercial milestones if all milestones are achieved during the term of the agreement  plus royalties on potential net sales of any commercial product resulting from the license.IPH45 (nectin-4 ADC):Innate’s proprietary nectin-4 targeted antibody drug conjugate  IPH45 continues toward a Phase 1 clinical trial.Corporate Update:On April 26  Innate announced the establishment of a new At-The-Market (ATM) program  pursuant to which it may  from time to time  offer and sell to eligible investors a total gross amount of up to $75 million American Depositary Shares (“ADS”). Each ADS representing one ordinary share of Innate.Dr. Sonia Quaratino  MD  PhD  will join Innate Pharma as Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer  effective October 2023. Dr. Sonia Quaratino succeeds to Dr. Karakunnel who is leaving the Company to pursue other challenges. Dr. Quaratino brings over 25 years of experience in basic research  clinical development  and translational medicine  having worked in academia  global large pharmaceuticals  and biotechs. Recently  Dr. Quaratino was Chief Medical Officer at Georgiamune INC.(USA) and prior to that she was Chief Medical Officer at Kymab (UK)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a focus on immune-mediated diseases and immuno-oncology  acquired by Sanofi in 2021. Previously  she held roles at Novartis (Switzerland) and Merck Serono (Germany)  and was Professor of Immunology in UK at the University of Southampton. Her research has been published in high impact scientific journals.Financial highlights for the first half of 2023:The key elements of Innate’s financial position and financial results as of and for the six-month period ended June 30  2023 are as follows:Cash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets amounting to €124.7 million (€m) as of June 30  2023 (€136.6m as of December 31  2022).Revenue and other income from continuing operations amounted to €40.2m in the first half of 2023 (€45.6m in the first half of 2022) and mainly comprise of: Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements  which mainly resulted from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca  Sanofi and Takeda. They results from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca  Sanofi and Takeda. They are recognized when the entity's performance obligation is met. Their accounting is made at a point in time or spread over time according to the percentage of completion of the work that the Company is committed to carry out under these agreements: (i) Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements for monalizumab decreased by €6.9m to €9.5m in the first half of 2023 (€16.4m in the first half of 2022). This change mainly results from the transaction price increase of €13.4 million ($14.0 million) in the first half of 2022  triggered by the launch of the “PACIFIC-9” Phase 3 trial on April 28  2022. As a reminder  this increase in the transaction price led to the recognition of an additional revenue of €12.5 million for the first half of 2022. However  this decrease is partially offset by an increase in monalizumab-related revenues for the first half of 2023  in line with the progress of Phase 1/2 trials over the period. (ii) Revenue related to the license and collaboration agreement signed with Sanofi in 2016 decreased by €1.0m  to €2.0m for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to €3.0m for the six months ended June 30  2022. The Company announced that  in June 2023  the first patient was dosed in a Sanofi-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating SAR'514/IPH6401 in relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma. As provided by the licensing agreement signed in 2016  Sanofi made a milestone payment of €2.0 million  fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. This amount was received by the Company on July 21  2023. As a reminder  the revenue recognized in the first half of 2022 resulted from Sanofi's decision to advance SAR'514/IPH6401 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. As such  Sanofi had selected a second multispecific antibody engaging NK cells as a drug candidate. This selection triggered a €3.0 million milestone payment from Sanofi to the Company  fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2022. (iii) Revenue of €18.7 million related to the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed with Sanofi in 2022. On January 25  2023  the Company announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the effectiveness of the licensing agreement as of January 24  2023. Consequently  the Company received an upfront payment of €25.0 million in March 2023  including €18.5 million for the exclusive license  €1.5 million for the research work and €5.0 million for the two additional targets options. The €18.5 million upfront payment relating to the exclusive license has been fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. The €1.5 million upfront payment will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the research work that the Company has agreed to carry out. The €5.0 million initial payment relating to the options is recognized in deferred revenue—non-current portion as of June 30  2023. The Company will recognize the related revenues either at the reporting date or three years after the effective date. (iv) Revenue of €4.6m related to the licensing agreement signed with Takeda in 2023. On April 3  2023  the Company announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target  with a primary focus in Celiac disease. Takeda will be responsible for the future development  manufacture and commercialization of any potential products developed using the licensed antibodies. As such  the Company considers that the license granted is a right to use the intellectual property  which is granted fully and perpetually to Takeda. The agreement does not stipulate that Innate's activities will significantly affect the intellectual property granted during the life of the agreement. Consequently  the $5.0 million (or €4.6 million) initial payment  received by the Company in May 2023  was fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. Government funding for research expenditures of €4.9m in the first half of 2023 (€4.3m in the first half of 2022).Operating expenses from continuing operations are €40.6m in the first half of 2023 (€37.1m in the first half of 2022)  of which 77.5% (€31.5m) are related to R&D. R&D expenses from continuing operations increased by €6.5m to €31.5m in the first half of 2023 (€25.0m in the first half of 2022). This change mainly results from (i) a €4.9m increase in direct R&D expenses relating to €4.8m non-clinical program in the Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADC) field and a slight increase of clinical programs of €0.1m; (ii) Personnel expenses and other R&D expenses increased by €1.6m (12.9%) to reach €14.2m in the first half 2023 compared to €12.6m in the first half 2022. This increase is mainly explained by €2.0m amortization for the rights relating to IPH5201 following the first patient dosed in the Phase 2 MATISSE clinical trial. The amortization of rights related to the monalizumab decreased by €0.3m. General and administrative (G&A) expenses from continuing operations decreased by €3.0m to €9.1m in the first half of 2023 (€12.1m in the first half of 2022) mainly resulting from ((i) a €1.4m decrease of personnel expenses mainly due to a reduction of administrative workforce  (ii) a €0.6m decrease on non-scientific advisory and consulting fees (limited use of recruitment agencies and strategic consulting)  and finally (iii) a decrease on other expenses for €1.0m mainly related to a decrease on leasing and maintenance for €0.5m to the benefit of research and development enabling a more consistent allocation of support expenses to the company's research laboratory as well as a reduction of 0.2 million following more limited use of external communication and investor relations service providers.Net income from discontinued operations related to Lumoxiti are nil compared to a net loss of €0.1 million for the first half of 2022 corresponding to residual costs associated with the transfer of activities to AstraZeneca. This transfer has now been completed.A net financial gain of €2.1m in the first half of 2023 (net financial loss of €2.1m in the first half of 2022)  principally as a result of the increase in fair value of certain of our financial instruments and net foreign exchange gain over the period.A net income of €1.7m for the first half of 2023 (net income of €6.3m for the first half of 2022).The table below summarizes the IFRS consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30  2023  including 2022 comparative information.In thousands of euros  except for data per share June 30  2023 June 30  2022 Revenue and other income 40 198 45 589 Research and development expenses (31 453) (24 956) General and administrative expenses (9 144) (12 140) Operating expenses (40 597) (37 096) Operating income (loss) (398) 8 494 Net financial income (loss) 2 116 (2 118) Income tax expense — — Net income (loss) from continuing operations 1 718 6 376 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations — (73) Net income (loss) 1 718 6 303 Weighted average number of shares ( in thousands) : 80 320 79 754 - Basic income (loss) per share 0.02 0.08 - Diluted income (loss) per share 0.02 0.08 - Basic income (loss) per share from continuing operations 0.02 0.08 - Diluted income (loss) per share from continuing operations 0.02 0.08 - Basic income (loss) per share from discontinued operations — — - Diluted income (loss) per share from discontinued operations — —June 30  2023 December 31  2022 Cash  cash equivalents and financial assets 124 679 136 604 Total assets 199 049 207 863 Total shareholders’ equity 57 863 54 151 Total financial debt 40 658 42 251About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.

These revenues mainly result from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca  Sanofi and Takeda. They are recognized when the entity's performance obligation is met. Their accounting is made at a point in time or spread over time according to the percentage of completion of the work that the Company is committed to carry out under these agreements.The evolution for the first half of 2023 is mainly due to:A €6.9 million decrease in revenue related to monalizumab  to €9.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to €16.4 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. This change mainly results from the transaction price increase of €13.4 million ($14.0 million) in the first half of 2022  triggered by the launch of the “PACIFIC-9” Phase 3 trial on April 28  2022. As a reminder  this increase in the transaction price led to the recognition of an additional revenue of €12.5 million for the first half of 2022. However  this decrease is partially offset by an increase in monalizumab-related revenues for the first half of 2023  in line with the progress of Phase 1/2 trials over the period. As of June 30  2023  the deferred revenue related to monalizumab is €4.7 million entirely classified as “Deferred revenue—Current portion” in connection with the maturity of Phase 1/2 trials.A €4.8 million decrease in revenue related to IPH5201 which are nil for the six months ended June 30  2023 . The revenue for the first half of 2022 resulted from the entire recognition in revenue of the $5.0 million milestone payment received from AstraZeneca following the signature on June 1  2022 of an amendment to the initial contract signed in October 2018. As a reminder  this amendment sets the terms of the collaboration following AstraZeneca’s decision to advance IPH5201 to a Phase 2 study. The Company conducts the study. Both parties share the external cost related to the study and incurred by the Company and AstraZeneca provides products necessary to conduct the clinical trial.As a reminder  during the first half of 2022  AstraZeneca informed the Company that it will not exercise its option to license the four preclinical programs covered in the ""Future Programs Option Agreement"". This option agreement was part of the 2018 multi-term agreement between AstraZeneca and the Company under which the Company received an upfront payment of $20.0 million (€17.4 million). Innate has regained full rights to further develop the four preclinical molecules. Consequently  the entire initial payment of $20.0 million  or €17.4 million was recognized as revenue as of June 30  2022.The recognition of €18.7 million in revenue as of June 30  2023  relating to the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed with Sanofi in 2022. On January 25  2023  the Company announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the effectiveness of the licensing agreement as of January 24  2023. Consequently  the Company received an upfront payment of €25.0 million in March 2023  including €18.5 million for the exclusive license  €1.5 million for the research work and €5.0 million for the two additional targets options. The Company considers that the license to the B7-H3 technology is a right to use the intellectual property granted exclusively to Sanofi from the effective date of the agreement. As such  the €18.5 million upfront payment relating to the exclusive license has been fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. The Company will provide collaborative research services to Sanofi for a three years period from the effective date of the collaboration  i.e. January 24  2023. Consequently  the corresponding upfront payment of €1.5 million will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the research work that the Company has agreed to carry out. As a result  a €0.2 million has been recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023  and amounts not recognized in revenue are classified as deferred revenue—current portion for €0.4 million and deferred revenue—non-current portion for €0.9 million. Under the terms of this agreement  the Company has also granted two exclusive options  exercisable no later than three years after the effective date  for exclusive licenses to Innate's intellectual property for the research  development  manufacture and commercialization of NKCEs specifically targeting two preclinical molecules. The Company considers that the option to acquire an exclusive license provide a material right to Sanofi that it would not receive without entering into this agreement. The Company will recognize the related revenues either at the reporting date or three years after the effective date. Consequently  the €5.0 million initial payment relating to these options is recognized in deferred revenue—non-current portion as of June 30  2023.The recognition of €4.6 million in revenue from licensing agreement signed with Takeda in 2023. On April 3  2023  the Company announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target  with a primary focus in Celiac disease. Takeda will be responsible for the future development  manufacture and commercialization of any potential products developed using the licensed antibodies. As such  the Company considers that the license granted is a right to use the intellectual property  which is granted fully and perpetually to Takeda. The agreement does not stipulate that Innate's activities will significantly affect the intellectual property granted during the life of the agreement. Consequently  the $5.0 million (or €4.6 million) initial payment  received by the Company in May 2023  was fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023.A €1.0 million decrease in revenue from collaboration and research license agreement signed with Sanofi in 2016  to €2.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to €3.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The Company announced that  in June 2023  the first patient was dosed in a Sanofi-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating SAR'514/IPH6401 in relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma. As provided by the licensing agreement signed in 2016  Sanofi made a milestone payment of €2.0 million  fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. This amount was received by the Company on July 21  2023. As a reminder  the revenue recognized in the first half of 2022 resulted from Sanofi's decision to advance SAR'514/IPH6401 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. As such  Sanofi had selected a second multispecific antibody engaging NK cells as a drug candidate. This selection triggered a €3.0 million milestone payment from Sanofi to the Company  fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2022. This amount was received by the Company on September 9  2022.A €0.6 million increase in revenue from invoicing of research and development costs. The change between the two periods is mainly explained by the increase in research and development costs incurred by the Company under these agreements during the first half of 2023 in line with the clinical trial progress.Government funding for research expendituresGovernment financing for research expenditures increased by €0.5 million  or 12.4%  to €4.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2023 as compared to €4.3 million the six months ended June 30  2022. This change is primarily a result of a increase in the research tax credit of €0.6 million  which is mainly due to (i) the increase in depreciation on IPH5201 rights following the full amortization of the additional payment of €2.0 million due to Orega Biotech following the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 2 MATISSE clinical trial  and (ii) the absence of grants recognized during the first half of 2023 as compared to the remaining Force financing of €0 7 million received in the first half of 2022 from BPI following the technical and commercial failure of the project based on the results of the Phase 2 ""Force"" trial evaluating avdoralimab in COVID-19. However  these decreases are partially offset by a decrease in public and private R&D subcontracting expenses eligible due to the maturity of clinical trials and the non-inclusion  as a precautionary measure  of subcontracting expenses with a supplier whose agreement is in the process of being renewed as of June 30  2023. In addition  this decrease is also explained by the decrease in amortization of the monalizumab intangible asset due to the extension of the amortization period  as well as for certain tangible assets which had reached the end of their amortization period  and also by lower R&D personnel costsThe Company met again the SME status under European Union criteria since December 31  2020. As such  it was eligible for the early repayment by the French treasury of the 2021 Research Tax Credit for an amount of €10.3 million in 2022 and also the 2022 Research Tax Credit for an amount of €9.2 million. These amounts was received by the Company on November 16 2022 and July 21  2023  respectively.Operating expensesThe table below presents our operating expenses from continuing operations for the six months periods ended June 30  2023 and 2022:In thousands of euros June 30  2023 June 30  2022 Research and development expenses (31 453 ) (24 956 ) General and administrative expenses (9 144 ) (12 140 ) Operating expenses (40 597 ) (37 096 )Research and development expensesResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses from continuing operations increased by €6.5 million  or 26.0%  to €31.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to €25.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2022  representing a total of 77.5% and 67.3% of the total operating expenses  respectively. R&D expenses include direct R&D expenses (subcontracting costs and consumables)  depreciation and amortization  and personnel expenses.Direct R&D expenses increased by €4.9 million  or 39.4%  to €17.3 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to €12.4 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. This increase is mainly explained by €4.8 million non-clinical program in the Antibody Drug Conjugates – ADC field and a slight increase of clinical programs of €0.1 million. The increase of €0.9 million on IPH5201 is linked to startup costs of Phase 2 MATISSE clinical trial and is partly offset by the decrease expenses related to lacutamab program for €0.2 million as well as avdoralimab and monalizumab programs for respectively 0.2 million euros and 0.2 million euros. These decreases follow the decision taken by the Company at the end of the first half of 2020 to stop recruitment in trials evaluating avdoralimab in oncology and the maturity of Phase 1/2 clinical trials entering the scope of the collaboration with AstraZeneca regarding monalizumab.Also  as of June 30  2023  the collaboration liabilities relating to monalizumab and the agreements signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015  October 2018 and September 2020 amounted to €56.1 million  as compared to collaborations liabilities to €63.2 million as of December 31  2022. This decrease of €7.2 million mainly results from (i) the net reimbursement of €6.4 million made in the first half 2023 to AstraZeneca relating to the co-financing of the monalizumab program  mainly including the Phase 3 INTERLINK-1 trial launched in October 2020 and (ii) the decrease in the collaboration commitment for the amount of €1.1 million in connection with the observed exchange rate fluctuations over the period for the euro-dollar parity.Personnel and other expenses allocated to R&D increased by €1.6 million  or 12.9%  to €14.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to an amount of €12.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. This increase is mainly due to €2.0 million amortization for the rights relating to IPH5201 following the first patient dosed in the Phase 2 MATISSE clinical trial. The amortization of rights related to the monalizumab is decreasing by €0.3 million.General and administrative expensesGeneral and administrative expenses from continuing activities decreased by €3.0 million  or 24.7%  to €9.1 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to general and administrative expenses of €12.1 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. General and administrative expenses represented a total of 22.5% and 32.7% of the total operating expenses for the six months ended June 30  2023 and 2022  respectively.Personnel expense includes the compensation paid to our employees  and decreased by €1.4 million  to €4.4 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  as compared to €5.8 million for six months ended June 30  2022. This decrease of €1.4 million is mainly due to a reduction of administrative workforce.Non-scientific advisory and consulting expenses mostly consist of auditing  accounting  taxation and legal fees as well as consulting fees in relation to business strategy and operations and hiring services. Non-scientific advisory and consulting expenses decreased by €0.6 million  or 25.9%  to €1.7 million for the six months ended June 30  2023 as compared to €2.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. This decrease is mainly due to the decrease in fees in connection with a limited use of recruitment agencies and strategic consulting in first half 2023 compared to first half 2022.The fall in other expenses of €1.0 million mainly results from a decrease on leasing and maintenance for €0.5 million for the benefit of research and development enabling a more consistent allocation of support expenses to the company's research laboratory as well as a decrease of €0.2 million on external communication and investor relations service providers.Financial income (loss)  netWe recognized a net financial income of €2.1 million in the six months ended June 30  2023 as compared to a net financial loss of €2.1 million in the six months ended June 30  2022. This variance mainly results from the variance in fair value of our financial instruments (net gain of €1.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2023 as compared to a net loss of €2.3 million for the six months ended June 30  2022) and a net foreign exchange gain of €0.4 million for the first half of 2023 as compared to a net foreign exchange gain of €0.1 million for the first half of 2022.Net loss from discontinued operationsAs a reminder  a Termination and Transition Agreement was negotiated and executed  effective as of June 30  2021 further to the Company's decision to return the rights of Lumoxiti back to AstraZeneca. Consecutively  activities related to Lumoxiti are presented as discontinued operations since October 1  2021.Thus  the net income from discontinued operations related to Lumoxiti are nil compared to a net loss of €0.1 million for the first half of 2022 corresponding to residual costs associated with the transfer of activities to AstraZeneca. This transfer has now been completed.Balance sheet itemsCash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and non-current financial assets amounted to €124.7 million as of June 30  2023  as compared to €136.6 million as of December 31  2022. Net cash as of June 30  2023 amounted to €83.6 million (€99.4 million as of December 31  2022). Net cash is equal to cash  cash equivalents and short-term investments less current financial liabilities.The Company also has bank borrowings of €39.6m  including €28.7m of State Guaranteed Loans (“Prêts Garantis par l’Etat”) as of June 30  2023  and €1.1m of lease liabilities.The other key balance sheet items as of June 30  2023 are:Deferred revenue of €11.0 million (including €6.0 million booked as ‘Deferred revenue – non-current portion’) and collaboration liabilities of €56.1 million (including €49.5 million booked as ‘Collaboration liabilities - non-current portion’) relating to the remainder of the initial payment received from AstraZeneca not yet recognized as revenue or used as part of the co-financing of the monalizumab program with AstraZeneca;Receivables from the French government amounting to €43.9 million in relation to the research tax credit for 2019  2020  2022 and the six-month period ended June 30  2023;Shareholders’ equity of €57.9 million  including the net income of the period of €1.7 million.Cash-flow itemsAs of June 30  2023  cash and cash equivalents amounted to €71.4 million  compared to €84.2 million as of December 31  2022  corresponding in a decrease of €12.8 million.The net cash flow used during the period under review mainly results from the following:Net cash flow used by operations of €11.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2023 as compared to net cash flows generated by operations of €1.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. The net cash flow used in operating activities includes (i) the €25.0 million upfront payment received from Sanofi in March 2023 following the effectiveness of the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed in December 2022 under which the Company granted Sanofi an exclusive license to Innate Pharma's B7-H3 ANKET® program and options on two additional targets  but also (ii) the €4.6 million ($5.0 million) upfront payment received from Takeda following the signing of an exclusive licensing agreement which the Company grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights for the research and development of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). As a reminder  net cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2022 included the collection of €47.7 million  in June 2022  following the treatment of the first patient in the second Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating monalizumab  “PACIFIC-9”  partially offset by the €5.9 million payment to AstraZeneca on April 20  2022 pursuant to the Lumoxiti termination and transition agreement. Restated for these transactions  net cash flow used in operating activities for the first half of 2023 increased by €0.5 million as compared to the first half of 2022. This change mainly results from the occurrence of exceptional cash flows in the first half of 2022  notably in connection with personnel costs and the BPI repayable advance. Net outflows in connection with the monalizumab and IPH5201 collaboration agreement were stable over the period. Net cash flow consumed by operating activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation are nil for the first half of 2023  as compared to €5.5 million for the first half of 2022. The amount consumed for the first half of 2022 mainly relates to the payment of €5.9 million ($6.2 million) made to AstraZeneca in April 2022 in accordance with the Lumoxiti termination and transition agreement effective as of June 30  2021.Net cash flow used in investing activities of €0.2 million  as compared to €0.4 million for the first half of 2022.

The 2023 half-year financial statements were subject to a limited review by the Company’s statutory auditors and approved by the Board of Directors on September 14  2023. The full interim financial report will be available on September 19  2023  on the Company’s website in the Investors section.""We are heartened by our investors’ confidence  as reflected once again in the financing we have succeeded in securing in August "" commented Thomas Gidoin  Chief Financial Officer of GenSight Biologics. ""After navigating the challenges at the beginning of the year  we are now focused on manufacturing the LUMEVOQ GMP batches  which will enable us to resume early access programs and progress towards commercialization. Providing access to LUMEVOQ for all eligible LHON patients is a primary objective that continues to animate our activities.""2023 Half-Year Financial Results (IFRS)In million euros H1 2022 H1 2023 Revenues 3.1 1.6 Other income 1.2 1.2 Operating income 4.3 2.7 Research and development expenses (9.9) (12.0) Sales  medical and marketing expenses (4.0) (4.8) General and administrative expenses (2.3) (3.0) Operating profit (loss) (12.0) (17.1) Financial income (loss) 1.3 5.1 Net income (loss) (10.7) (12.0) EPS (in € per share) (0.23) (0.26) Net cash flows from operating activities (16.7) (16.2) Net cash flows from investment activities 0.1 0.2 Net cash flows from financing activities (3.3) 6.4 Net cash flows (19.9) (9.6) Cash and cash equivalents at closing 24.1 1.0The Company’s operating income decreased by 36.1% to €2.7 million from €4.3 million over the period. This decrease was essentially driven by a single quarter of revenues generated in 2022 by LUMEVOQ® in France through the supply of named patient Temporary Authorizations for Use (""ATU nominative""). Following manufacturing issues at the Company’s partner  all available vials were used up by March 2022 leading to no revenues being recognized in the subsequent reporting quarters. As a result  there was no revenue from ATUs in the first half of 2023. Revenues recognized in 2023 only relates to the change in valuation of the refund liability and the potential rebates obligations resulting from the current regulatory framework for ATUs  following the Company’s decision to withdraw its EMA application in April 2023. The Company expects to resume supply of AAC (Autorisation d’Accès Compassionnel  or Early Access Authorisation  formerly known as ATU) in France in Q1 2024 as soon as LUMEVOQ® becomes available.Story continuesThe Company also generated research tax credit (Crédit d’Impôt Recherche or CIR)  amounting to €1.2 million in the first half of 2023  stable over the same period in 2022.Research and development expenses increased by 21.0% amounting to €12.0 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €9.9 million a year earlier. This increase was essentially driven by the Company maintaining its efforts in Chemistry  Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) activities to ensure manufacturing readiness to commercialize under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and notably the production of validation batches.Sales  medical and marketing expenses increased by 19.4% to €4.8 million in the first half of 2023 from €4.0 million over the same period in 2022  reflecting the ramp up of key strategic marketing and market access activities in preparation for the commercial launch of LUMEVOQ® in Europe expected at that time. Given the Company's decision to withdraw its EMA application in April 2023  sales and marketing expenses are expected to decrease drastically from the second half of 2023 onwards.General and administrative expenses increased by 27.8% to €3.0 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €2.3 million over the same period in 2022. This increase was mainly driven by higher personnel expenses  due primarily to the decrease of the share-based income  resulting  in the first half of 2022 and 2023  from the cancellations of performance share plans whose conditions were unlikely to be met following manufacturing issues at the Company’s partner in the United States and subsequent EMA application withdrawal. Excluding this non-recurring and non-cash IFRS2 item  general and administrative expenses amounted to €3.4m  stable over the period.The Company’s operating loss increased by 41.9% in the first half of 2023  amounting to €(17.1) million compared to €(12.0) million over the same period in 2022  both driven by the reduction in revenues generated by ATUs of LUMEVOQ® in France due to lack of product availability  as well as the increase in CMC expenses and the ramp up of sales  medical and marketing expenses over the period to support the Marketing Authorisation and the subsequent commercial launch in Europe. Given the Company's decision to withdraw its EMA application in April 2023  operating expenses  and notably sales and marketing expenses  are expected to decrease significantly from the second half of 2023 onwards.The financial income in the first half of 2023 amounted to €5.1 million compared to €1.3 million over the same period in 2022. This increase was essentially explained by the change in derivative financial instrument fair value booked for an amount of €6.5 million as of June 30  2023  versus €2.0 million as of June 2022. These financial incomes are non-cash and represent primarily  in the first half of 2023  the change in the fair value of the convertible option of the bond financing with Heights Capital for €3.3 million and of share warrants attached to the bank financing with EIB for €3.2 million.The Company’s net loss for the first half of 2023 amounted to €(12.0) million compared to €(10.7) million in the first half of 2022. The loss per share (based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding over the period) amounted to €(0.26) and €(0.23) for the first halves of 2023 and 2022  respectively.Net cash flows from operating activities in the first halves of 2023 and 2022 were €(16.2) million and €(16.7) million  respectively. The limited variation in 2023 is mainly driven by the increase in operating expenses to support the Marketing Authorisation and the subsequent planned commercial launch of LUMEVOQ® in Europe  the decrease of revenues with no ATUs supplied in 2023  and the non-cash change in derivative financial instruments’ fair values related to Heights’ convertible bonds and the EIB’s warrants  offset by a decrease in non-cash expenses related to share-based payments due to performance shares plans cancelled in 2022 and a positive change in working capital over the period.Net cash flows from investment activities amounted to €0.2 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €0.1 million in 2022  mainly driven by the activity of the Company’s liquidity contract.Net cash flows from financing activities amounted to €6.4 million in the first half of 2023  compared to €(3.3) million in the same period of 2022  reflecting the proceeds from the €8.0 million Tranche A of the EIB financing received in February 2023  partly offset by the reimbursement of capital and payment of interests of the state-guaranteed loan for €(1.2) million and the €(0.5) million reimbursement related to finance leases and the application of the IFRS 16 standard.Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30  2023  amounted to €1.0 million.Financial UpdateFollowing the decision to withdraw its EMA application in April 2023  GenSight instituted cash preservation measures  including a 40% headcount reduction mainly in Commercial teams  leading to a significant reduction equalling approximately 40% of its initially planned 2023 operating expenses. The Company was also able to retrieve its 2022 Research Tax Credit amounting to €2.2 million in July 2023  much earlier than in normal operating conditions where this tax credit is usually received towards the end of the year.This significant reduction of cash burn will mostly benefit 2024 and the following years until the Company can reach European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval and launch LUMEVOQ® in Europe.In August 2023  GenSight signed a €10 million financing agreement with Sofinnova Partners  Invus and UPMC Enterprises1  and drew the first tranche of €6 million in the form of convertible bonds with a conversion price of 0.7122 euros. The second tranche is conditioned to either the successful production of at least two successive GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) batches of LUMEVOQ® or unanimous approval of the three investors  no later than October 30  2023As of today  the Company is financed through October 2023. The cash runway would be extended to December 2023 with the drawdown of the second tranche of the August financing for an amount of €4 million. GenSight expects to seek other sources of debt or equity financing to fund its operations beyond December 2023.In parallel  the Company is also advancing a number of discussions with potential partners on strategic opportunities  including a merger or acquisition  assessed as one of the options to move forward.Manufacturing UpdateGenSight has continued to work closely with its manufacturing partner in the United-States to improve documentation  training and supervision of operating teams ahead of the new manufacturing campaign launched in August 2023.Given the decision to withdraw its EMA application  there is no immediate need for a validation (PPQ) campaign until a new Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) is submitted. Consequently  the Company decided to manufacture 3 GMP batches as planned  using the commercial process but outside the context of a validation campaign2  to generate more batch data for a future MAA filing and provide more experience with the manufacturing process to operating teams  while fulfilling the immediate requirement of supplying product for a possible new clinical trial and for the resumption of an early access program for patients in Q1 2024.The manufacturing of these 3 GMP batches started as planned in August  and results are expected through September and October 2023. Assuming the 1st batch is successfully manufactured with a vg titer within the required range  full quality control tests would then be undertaken  leading to full release of the product for human use in Q1 2024.Regulatory UpdateAs planned  GenSight requested a Scientific Advice meeting with the EMA to discuss a new regulatory pathway for LUMEVOQ® in Europe  including the potential need for generating additional clinical data. A written response from EMA is now expected before end of September.In addition  GenSight is expecting to meet the UK MHRA in November 2023 to discuss a possible regulatory pathway for LUMEVOQ® in the United Kingdom.GenSight Biologics will report on October 26  2023  its cash position as of September 30  2023.About GenSight BiologicsGenSight Biologics S.A. is a clinical-stage biopharma company focused on developing and commercializing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders.
