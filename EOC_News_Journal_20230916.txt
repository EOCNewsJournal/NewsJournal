30215,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/global-bond-indices-inclusion-discussion-not-concession/articleshow/103681740.cms,Global bond indices inclusion: Discussion  not concession,Despite the high economic growth rate and position at the high table of most influential nations  India is an exception among major emerging markets in respect that it does not feature on the global bond indices.,Over the weekend  top leaders of the world's leading economies converged in New Delhi to discuss diverse issues ranging from global growth  trade and investment to climate change as part of the G-20 Summit. The timing could not have been better as India  which hosted the summit  remains the fastest-growing economy with the potential of 6-7% growth rate.Despite the high economic growth rate and position at the high table of most influential nations  India is an exception among major emerging markets in respect that it does not feature on the global bond indices.This partly explains the lower appetite for Indian debt among foreign investors. The government has pledged to invest in hard infrastructure as a tool to boost growth and create employment. In this context  the debate over the inclusion of Indian Bonds in global indices has again reignited  as such inclusion will lure in more investments in the Indian debt market.Reserve Bank of India’s inter-departmental group on the internationalisation of INR first made observations on this topic in July. Following this  foreign portfolio investors stepped up purchases of government bonds in August. Total foreign holding under the so-called ‘Fully Accessible Route (FAR)’ stood at ₹941 billion (as on 31st Aug '23)  a jump of 55% from 2022-end.To be sure  Indian authorities have been engaged with index providers such as JP Morgan  FTSE Russel and Bloomberg-Barclays. Significant market reforms in the areas such as hedging of interest rate and currency risks and the introduction of FAR have prompted foreign investors to push for the inclusion of Indian bonds on global indices.The biggest benefit of such inclusion will be the passive inflows of around $10 - $15 billion -- the assets under management of funds tracking the three major global bond indices are estimated to be over $5 trillion.Some of the long-only investors globally tend to prefer passive investing by following these indices. If included  India can expect some of these inflows  depending on its weightage in the index. Considering these are passive investments  they are usually stable in nature compared with other forms of inflows in the equity and debt market.This would be in line with RBI’s long-held preference for stable and long-term inflows. Countries that are not part of the index have to rely on second-order flows from active investors.Another benefit of inclusion will be in the form of diversifying the investor base. Currently  large government borrowings tend to crowd out private investments. With passive flows coming  pressure on domestic investors such as banks and insurance companies could ease. Their investment could possibly be channelled to the corporate bond market. This can reduce the cost of borrowings of the private sector. Not to forget that an increase in inflows could also help the Indian rupee.But there are risks too and one of them could be bulk outflows of funds. In uncertain times  these passive flows exit en masse  leading to a spike in yields and higher borrowing costs in the economy as well as exerting pressure on the Indian rupee. It could also expose India’s policy-making  both fiscal and monetary  to the perception of global investors in a more pronounced manner than now.The RBI’s inter-departmental group had noted that gains from the inclusion of Indian government bonds in global bond indices outweigh the risks. It said that risks generally materialize when concerns emerge about the fiscal health of the country with potential rating downgrades or de-platforming from the index. The improving macro-stability conditions of India provide comfort in this context  it said. It must be noted that the group's view may not reflect that of the RBI.Policymakers and authorities need to weigh pros and cons of such a move by widely engaging with market participants. As a first step  the issue of the settlement of Indian government bonds on global platforms needs to be sorted. Most listed bonds on the indices are settled on platforms such as Euroclear. Though settlement on a global platform is not a prerequisite for index inclusion  it would offer operational ease to foreign investors. Another issue that requires attention and detailed discussion is related to taxation as that would ultimately impact the interest of investors.So far  taxation on the capital gains made by foreign investors has been a key issue between the global settlement platforms and the Indian government. Previously  India was keen to be a part of global bond indices  which is not the case currently. Indication from the policymakers  based on the media reports  has been that India is unlikely to bend to ensure inclusion  and hence  any concession on taxation is not on the cards because it would put domestic investors at disadvantage.Over the years  India has turned the tables  with superior growth trends and stable exchange rate putting it in an advantageous position. Index providers need to take a hard look at these data points.Experience from countries that were included in such indices has also been positive mainly with regards to the balance of payments and lower cost of capital  but authorities need to also take into consideration the uniqueness as well as limitations of fiscal and monetary policy in India before the final call.The successful completion of the G-20 summit with consensus on the New Delhi declaration has earned India more respect in the comity of nations. Index providers need to take a hard look at this if they are serious about India.

The company earlier this year obtained a license to custody digital assets from German finance watchdog BaFin via its subsidiary Blocknox GmbH.Expanding its custody service with staking allows Boerse Stuttgart Digital and its clients to earn rewards on the assets stored with the firm.“We have noticed an increasing interest from institutional investors in the staking sector  eagerly anticipating the chance to participate  provided they have complete confidence in the security of the environment ” Dr. Oliver Vins  managing director of Boerse Stuttgart Digital  said in a statement.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,negative,0.0,0.04,0.95,True,English,"['Fully-Insured Crypto Staking Offering', 'German Finance Heavyweights', 'Plan 2024 Release', 'asset management giant Franklin Templeton', 'first spot bitcoin ETF', 'German finance watchdog BaFin', 'largest stock exchange group', 'Stuttgart Stock Exchange', 'digital asset industry', 'Boerse Stuttgart Group', 'digital asset custody', 'traditional investment services', 'global banking leader', 'Dr. Oliver Vins', 'Boerse Stuttgart Digital', 'global reinsurance company', 'cryptocurrency staking service', 'crypto custody firm', 'custody service', 'largest lender', 'crypto chops', 'digital assets', 'crypto-focused arm', 'company spokesperson', 'Munich Re', 'insurance product', 'press release', 'Slashing stands', 'stake blockchain', 'network rules', 'malicious activity', 'latest example', 'financial institutions', 'Deutsche Bank', 'U.S.', 'Blocknox GmbH', 'increasing interest', 'institutional investors', 'staking sector', 'complete confidence', 'managing director', 'CoinDesk', 'part', 'development', 'risks', 'companies', 'validators', 'proof', 'staked', 'tokens', 'intertwines', 'Germany', 'Taurus', 'tokenization', 'HSBC', 'Fireblocks', 'race', 'Europe', 'sixth', 'license', 'subsidiary', 'clients', 'rewards', 'chance', 'security', 'environment', 'statement']",2023-09-16,2023-09-16,uk.style.yahoo.com

Germany's Birkenstock plans to follow in Arm's footsteps  while companies including Ireland's Flutter Entertainment recently outlined plans to move their primary listings west. Here is a list of companies that have recently chosen New York as their trading turf:-- Arm Holdings saw its shares surge in its highly anticipated stock-market debut Thursday. Shares in the British chip designer closed at $63.59  up 25% from its initial-public-offering price of $51.-- German shoemaker Birkenstock on Tuesday filed for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said it plans to list shares on the New York Stock Exchange  but didn't say how many shares it would list or give an anticipated price range.-- CRH expects its main listing to switch to New York from London with effect from Sept. 25. The Irish building-materials supplier first said in March that it planned to pursue a primary listing in the U.S. and the proposal was overwhelmingly approved by shareholders in June.-- Flutter Entertainment  the FTSE 100 gambling and betting group that houses the FanDuel  PokerStars and Paddy Power brands  said in August it was working towards a primary U.S. listing around the turn of the year.-- Ferrovial in July said it plans to apply to list in the U.S. before the end of the year. The infrastructure company transferred its headquarters to the Netherlands from Spain and floated on Euronext Amsterdam in June  a move that it said would facilitate its planned U.S. listing.-- London-headquartered CNH Industrial in February said it would delist from Euronext Milan in early 2024 and retain a single listing on the New York Stock Exchange  abandoning the dual-listing structure the agricultural-machinery maker had in place since 2013.On top of these moves  industrial-gas company Linde in March delisted from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange to become solely listed on the NYSE. Ferguson  a U.K. supplier of plumbing and heating products first  made New York its primary listing in May last year  culminating a process launched when it began sounding out investors over a potential U.S. move in 2019. Meanwhile  recent media reports indicated London-listed online trading platform Plus500 and U.K. polling and data-analytics company YouGov are considering U.S. listings as well.Write to Barcelona editors at barcelonaeditors@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires09-15-23 0855ET,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,neutral,0.02,0.93,0.05,True,English,"['European Companies', 'Listing Venue', 'Arm', 'Ranks', 'US', 'Glance', 'The Irish building-materials supplier', 'London-listed online trading platform', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'potential U.S. move', 'primary U.S. listing', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'U.K. supplier', 'British chip designer', 'Paddy Power brands', 'London-headquartered CNH Industrial', 'recent media reports', 'Dow Jones Newswires', 'U.K. polling', 'U.S. Securities', 'U.S. listings', 'German shoemaker Birkenstock', 'Exchange Commission', 'primary listings', 'trading turf', 'main listing', 'single listing', 'domestic exchanges', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'stock-market debut', 'initial-public-offering price', 'price range', 'FTSE 100 gambling', 'betting group', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Euronext Milan', 'dual-listing structure', 'agricultural-machinery maker', 'heating products', 'Barcelona editors', 'infrastructure company', 'industrial-gas company', 'data-analytics company', 'Arm Holdings', 'growing list', 'European companies', 'many shares', 'Germany', 'footsteps', 'Ireland', 'plans', 'Tuesday', 'IPO', 'CRH', 'effect', 'Sept.', 'March', 'proposal', 'shareholders', 'June', 'FanDuel', 'PokerStars', 'August', 'turn', 'year', 'Ferrovial', 'July', 'end', 'headquarters', 'Netherlands', 'Spain', 'February', 'place', 'top', 'moves', 'Linde', 'NYSE', 'Ferguson', 'plumbing', 'May', 'process', 'investors', 'YouGov', 'barcelonaeditors']",2023-09-15,2023-09-16,marketscreener.com

SC efgartigimod is formulated with Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous delivery of biologics.“Generalized myasthenia gravis is a complex and devastating disease that is debilitating for people who live with it  making routine movements exhausting and challenging to perform ” said Prof. dr. Jan De Bleecker  Ghent University Hospital and Ghent University. “I’m pleased to learn of the CHMP’s positive opinion as it represents a significant advancement for the gMG community who would benefit from an additional  effective treatment option that can improve quality of life and better manage this chronic condition. In particular  SC efgartigimod has the potential to have a positive impact on treatment convenience  leading to a broader positive impact for patients and healthcare systems.”“The positive recommendation by the CHMP for the SC injectable formulation of efgartigimod brings us one step closer to broadening our treatment offering for people living with gMG in Europe ” said Anant Murthy  Ph.D.  General Manager  EMEA  argenx. “Our mission is to transform the treatment of severe autoimmune disease  and we remain committed to providing gMG patients a second innovation that could further address treatment burden. We are particularly pleased with the possibility for self-administration of the SC formulation  which may provide additional treatment flexibility for physicians and patients.”The CHMP recommendation is based on positive results from the Phase 3 ADAPT-SC study. The ADAPT-SC trial met its primary endpoint of noninferiority  where SC efgartigimod demonstrated a mean total IgG reduction of 66.4% from baseline at day 29  compared to 62.2% with the IV formulation. Additional key secondary endpoints were met  which were consistent with efficacy measures from the ADAPT IV study identifying the correlation between IgG reduction and clinical benefit in gMG.SC efgartigimod has a demonstrated safety profile  consistent with the ADAPT IV clinical trial with the exception of injection site reactions (ISRs)  which are commonly observed with biologics administered subcutaneously. ISRs were mild to moderate and did not lead to treatment discontinuation.The positive CHMP opinion is a scientific recommendation for marketing authorization  serving as a basis for the EC’s final decision on argenx’s application for SC efgartigimod. The EC is expected to make a decision within approximately 60 days following CHMP recommendation. The decision will apply to all 27 European Union Member States  and also to Iceland  Norway and Liechtenstein.About Phase 3 ADAPT-SC TrialThe Phase 3 ADAPT-SC trial was a multicenter  randomized  open-label  parallel-group study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SC efgartigimod compared with IV efgartigimod in adult patients with gMG. The PD effect was measured by percent change from baseline in autoantibody (AChR) levels at day 29. Safety  clinical efficacy  immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) were also assessed. A total of 110 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the ADAPT-SC trial. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SC efgartigimod for one treatment cycle consisting of four doses at once-weekly intervals. The total study duration was approximately 12 weeks  including seven weeks of follow-up after the treatment cycle. At the completion of ADAPT-SC  patients had the opportunity to roll-over to ADAPT-SC+  an open-label extension study.About EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases  in both an IV and SC formulation. SC efgartigimod is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug delivery technology. In August 2022  efgartigimod received approval from the EC for IV administration as an add on to standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with gMG who are AChR antibody positive.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

How big is the Securities Brokerages And Stock Exchanges Industry?Securities Brokerages And Stock Exchanges Report Coverage & Overview:Securities brokerages function as entities within the securities industry that assist individuals or businesses in executing transactions involving the acquisition  sale  or exchange of securities  typically in exchange for a fee  commission  or other forms of compensation. Within the realm of financial markets  securities encompass a wide array of financial instruments that possess significant value and can be traded among involved parties. This term serves as a comprehensive category encompassing various financial assets  including mutual funds  bonds  stocks  and exchange-traded investments or funds that can be bought or sold.Specifically  when it comes to stocks  they represent a particular type of security that  upon purchase  grants the buyer a stake in the ownership of a company or corporation. Stocks are also commonly referred to as equities. Stock exchanges  on the other hand  serve as platforms where numerous buyers and sellers converge to engage in the trading of financial instruments during specified hours on particular days of the week  typically from Monday to Friday.Examples of renowned and influential stock exchanges on a global scale include the New York Stock Exchange  Nasdaq  Shanghai Stock Exchange  London Stock Exchange  BSE  and various others.Get a Free Sample PDF of this Research Report for more Insights with a Table of Content  Research Methodology  and Graphs - https://www.zionmarketresearch.com/sample/securities-brokerages-and-stock-exchanges-market(A free sample of this report is available upon request; please contact us for more information.)Our Free Sample Report Consists of the Following:Introduction  Overview  and in-depth industry analysis are all included in the 2023 updated report.The COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak Impact Analysis is included in the packageAbout 218+ Pages Research Report (Including Recent Research)Provide detailed chapter-by-chapter guidance on RequestUpdated Regional Analysis with Graphical Representation of Size  Share  and Trends for the Year 2023Includes Tables and figures have been updatedThe most recent version of the report includes the Top Market Players  their Business Strategies  Sales Volume  and Revenue AnalysisZion Market Research research methodology(Please note that the sample of this report has been modified to include the COVID-19 impact study prior to delivery.)Global Securities Brokerages And Stock Exchanges Market: Growth DynamicsExpanding Knowledge of Diverse Investment Products Boosting Market DemandThe global securities brokerages and stock exchanges market is poised for growth due to the expertise and extensive knowledge these entities possess regarding a wide array of investment products. In an environment with billions of sellers and buyers within stock exchanges  navigating through the multitude of available products and making informed decisions can be challenging. Securities brokerages play a pivotal role by employing professionals who possess an in-depth understanding of the financial market. They provide valuable advice to individuals seeking their services  thereby enhancing the likelihood of improving profit margins.Escalating Volatility in Securities and Stock Exchanges Attracting More Clients to Brokerage FirmsAmidst ongoing geopolitical tensions  such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict  the securities and stock exchange transactions have experienced heightened levels of volatility and unpredictability. Notably  in February 2023  the Adani Group  one of India's largest conglomerates  canceled its USD 2.5 billion share sale due to the significant impact of a research report by Hindenburg that criticized the company's short-selling practices.

However  the rapid development of financial products and technology  combined with intense market competition  the emergence of new business models  and high investor expectations  have all exerted tremendous pressure on these frameworks during a period of rapid change  according to Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions in a newly published thought piece.“Assessment of (one’s) compliance program design and comprehensiveness occurs through a dynamic series of steps to determine the degree that a financial institution can accurately identify  assess  and define its conduct risk profile ” writes Thomas Grundy  regulatory compliance expert with Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions in his article  “Conduct Risk Management: Empowering Financial Institutions Through the DOJ’s Guidance for Compliance Programs ” published in ABA Risk & Compliance magazine.Ultimately  he notes  it is critical for banks to evaluate the degree to which their compliance program can detect and prevent particular types of misconduct through the deliberate application formal regulatory frameworks  such as those offered by the Department of Justice (DOJ)  to effectively manage conduct risk.Grundy points to recently updated U.S. Department of Justice “Evaluation of Corporate Compliance Programs” (ECCP) guidance  asking banks to consider whether their risk-based compliance programs focus appropriate resources on higher-risk areas of the institution and activities where misconduct or ethical breaches are most likely to occur.“With the present and future uncertainties and challenges facing financial institutions  having a strong compliance program that includes a robust conduct risk management program is essential. The DOJ’s ECCP provides guidance that serves as a useful and informative framework for financial institutions to apply in building an effective framework for managing conduct and ethics.”Ultimately  he concludes  encouraging organizations to prevent and detect misconduct  as facilitated by an effective compliance and ethics program  encourages ethical conduct and compliance with all applicable laws.ABA Risk & Compliance magazine  formerly ABA Bank Compliance magazine  has recently expanded its editorial focus beyond compliance to include risk-related topics and is a leading industry voice on U.S. bank legislation  regulation and case law.

The agreement…,"OCI Global (Euronext: OCI)  a world-leading producer of ammonia and methanol has today announced an agreement to offtake green hydrogen from New Fortress Energy Inc.'s (NFE) (NASDAQ: NFE) ZeroParks beginning in 2025  following a competitive bidding process. The agreement will allow OCI Global to significantly scale up green ammonia production capacity to approximately 160 000 tons per year in Beaumont  Texas.This agreement follows the 100-megawatt (MW) electrolyzer system order from Electric Hydrogen Co. (EH2) announced by New Fortress Energy on Tuesday. The green hydrogen will be produced by ZeroParks  NFE's hydrogen business  using proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology and delivered to OCI's facilities in Beaumont  Texas where it will then be converted into green ammonia. NFE's first green hydrogen project  ZeroPark I  will come online in two phases; the first phase in 2025  allowing OCI to produce approximately 80 000 tons per year of green ammonia and the second  in 2026  doubling OCI's production capacity to 160 000 tons per year.OCI produced its first tons of hydrogen-based green ammonia earlier this year at its Egypt Green facility  which is owned by Fertiglobe  a strategic partnership between OCI Global and ADNOC. Scaling its global green hydrogen-based production with capacity in the U.S. confirms OCI's leadership in low carbon and renewable ammonia to meet the coming demand from emerging applications including as a shipping fuel and for power generation  and to decarbonize existing end-markets including the agricultural and industrial space. Green hydrogen can also be used to produce green methanol  the fuel choice for the decarbonization of shipping and road fuels today.The new plans complement the company's large-scale blue ammonia project in Texas  in partnership with Linde plc (NYSE: LIN)  which is scheduled to begin production in 2025. The new ammonia site has been developed so it can use green hydrogen as a feedstock in the future to further increase OCI's green ammonia production capabilities.By leveraging its existing infrastructure  OCI can scale production to meet growing demand at pace and without significant capital expenditure  while leveraging the incentives offered under the Inflation Reduction Act's 45V program.Nassef Sawiris  Executive Chair  OCI Global said:""Today's announcement cements OCI's continued focus on the energy transition and hydrogen fuels  representing another milestone in our decarbonization journey as a business. Ammonia and methanol are the logical hydrogen carriers to drive this transition and the coming demand from the transportation sector provides the foundation for our scale-up in production and new technologies. NFE is an established energy player and developer and we are excited to start this partnership with them at our Beaumont complex  which is ideally located in the center of the Gulf Coast  allowing us to continue to increase and optimize our over-the-fence feedstock portfolio.""Wes Edens  Chairman and CEO  New Fortress Energy said:""OCI is a leading global producer and distributor of hydrogen-based products and today's announcement showcases our focus on developing green hydrogen projects of scale to successfully decarbonize hard-to-abate corners of the global economy such as agriculture  power  and marine fuels.

To add a new dimension to the flavor profile  a portion of these maturing whiskeys were recasked into tawny port casks for a number of years. All of the whiskeys were then skilfully blended and completed their maturation journey by marrying in freshly seasoned tawny port hogsheads for a final maturation period of 14-25 months.The inspiration for Redbreast Tawny Port Cask Edition started 12 years ago  when Leighton took a trip to the Douro Valley in Portugal to visit some of Midleton Distillery's partner cooperages and winemakers.""We were enjoying lunch with the late renowned winemaker Joaquim Anacleto and Gesprove Winemaker José Pinheiro overlooking the valley  discussing the various wines and spirits that had influenced our whiskeys "" says Leighton. ""And  being in the valley  we began to imagine how Tawny Port's intricate flavor profile could affect our whiskies. Curiosity took hold  and we decided to make this daydream a reality – and we are quite pleased with the impeccable result.""The result Leighton mentions is a rich  well-balanced whiskey with notes of praline  buttery baked goods  and dried cherries from the earlier tawny port influence  followed by a warming sweetness of toasted caramel and vanilla carried through from the bourbon and an added depth of dried fruits from the sherry. The final maturation period in newly procured tawny port casks elevates the nutty character further and provides a sweet finish for a rich  full-bodied whiskey.""Redbreast Tawny Port Edition's flavor profile is well within our flock's DNA  yet it provides an exciting twist from another part of the Iberian Peninsula "" McCabe adds. ""Each subsequent expression in the series will represent a new discovery from this rich region which to date has greatly influenced the Redbreast style over the course of its history.""Redbreast Tawny Port Cask Edition marks the third release of the brand's acclaimed Iberian Series. The series is inspired by Redbreast's long-standing connection to some of the Iberian Peninsula's most celebrated cooperages and winemakers  and combines the rich heritage and craft of the region with the excellence of Midleton Distillery's single pot still whiskeys  to create expressions that are truly extraordinary. Redbreast Tawny Port Cask Edition is the second limited edition to join the series  following the 2021 release Redbreast Pedro Ximénez Edition  and permanent expression and series anchor Redbreast Lustau Edition.Redbreast Tawny Port Cask Edition is bottled at 46% ABV and will be available in the USA for an SRP of $99.99. Link to purchase.Tasting Notes:Aroma: Sweet and warming confectionery notes of buttered pastry accompanied by aromas of caramelized almonds with subtle undertones of praline and dried cherry. Scented floral honey with whisperings of a delicate herbal character lingers in the background while the seasoned oak and pot still spices accentuate the sweet and full-bodied nature of this wonderfully balanced whiskey.Taste: Rich and nutty at first with notes of chocolate-coated hazelnut and salted caramel  quickly followed with fresh plums and dried fig. The tannins' soft presence works in harmony with the luscious and creamy texture  evoking notes of orange marmalade with delicate hints of toasted oak.Finish: Lingering finish which sees the pot still spices and fruits slowly fading  leaving the tawny seasoned oak to have the last word.About Irish DistillersIrish Distillers is Ireland's leading supplier of spirits and wines and producer of some of the world's most well-known and successful Irish whiskeys.
