In the first half of the year  the Belgium-based firm collected $1.7 billion in interest on $150 billion in Russian assets. It also incurred $22 million in costs related to the sanctions.Euroclear is in talks with the European Union to send some of that money to Ukraine by way of a windfall tax paid to the European Commission  sources told the WSJ  with one proposal allowing Euroclear to keep a portion of the funds.Euroclear did not immediately respond to Insider for comment and declined to comment to the WSJ.Meanwhile  Ukraine has also been receiving funds from Europe and the US. In addition  Kyiv has tapped its bond market  borrowing $10 billion via local sales this year as high yields of around 10% have attracted the country's private sector.AdvertisementAdvertisementLooking beyond the war  Ukraine needs $411 billion to rebuild itself  according to World Bank estimates.,neutral,0.06,0.49,0.45,mixed,0.12,0.27,0.61,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'wartime funds', 'Ukraine', 'interest', 'Russia', 'Kyiv', 'The Wall Street Journal', 'app Email address', 'other partner offers', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'World Bank estimates', 'frozen assets', 'first half', 'budget deficit', 'inside scoop', 'biggest stories', 'Silicon Valley', 'favorite topics', 'personalized feed', 'marketing emails', 'Privacy Policy', 'Russian assets', 'security spending', 'one source', 'Western institutions', 'gold deposits', 'legal doubts', 'Belgium-based firm', 'European Union', 'windfall tax', 'European Commission', 'one proposal', 'bond market', 'local sales', 'high yields', 'private sector', 'wartime funds', 'Russian funds', 'Ukraine', 'interest', 'clearinghouses', 'Euroclear', 'year', 'Kyiv', 'forces', 'counteroffensive', 'today', 'business', 'Something', 'Insider', 'Terms', 'Service', 'Advertisement', 'funding', 'Moscow', '2022 invasion', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'dollars', 'matter', 'costs', 'sanctions', 'talks', 'money', 'way', 'sources', 'WSJ', 'portion', 'comment', 'addition', 'country']",2023-09-18,2023-09-18,markets.businessinsider.com

30248,Euroclear,Bing API,https://english.almayadeen.net/news/Economy/ukraine-races-time-to-keep-cash-flowing-as-defense-expenses,Ukraine races time to keep cash flowing as defense expenses rise: WSJ,Hopes may also be crushed sooner than later  given that most of Ukraine's funds come from Europe and the US  and especially if a Republican wins the elections next year as the GOP is exacerbating efforts to stop excessive US aid to Ukraine.,"Hopes may also be crushed sooner than later  given that most of Ukraine's funds come from Europe and the US  especially if a Republican wins the elections next year as the GOP is exacerbating efforts to stop excessive US aid to Ukraine.Assault unit commander from 3rd Assault Brigade who goes by the call sign 'Fedia' speaks with Ukrainian servicemen in the frontline a few kilometers from Andriivka  Donetsk region  on Saturday  Sept. 16  2023 (AP Photo/Alex Babenko)Another year into the war and suffering a budget deficit in 2024 of more than $40 billion  finance officials in Ukraine are racing time to keep the cash flowing every which way  and to keep their head above water.Efforts to do so have included selling war bonds  lobbying for international aid  and repositioning existing debts  while others include taxing financial intermediaries like Euroclear which allegedly profit from Russian assets  and raising money by using complex structures from international bond investors.Head of macroeconomic research at Ukraine-based brokerage ICU  Vitaliy Vavryshchuk  said: ""If the government cannot cover its budgetary gaps  then the government will not be able to finance its military effort"".ICU is launching a program in consultation with the government this week intended to remotely sell government bonds to individuals residing abroad  namely in Western Europe  but still  that would likely be a drop in the bucket that Ukraine needs to fill.Read more: West encourages Kiev to switch from offense to defense in Oct: ReportsThis is also why Ukraine has been ramping up its efforts to get admitted into the European Union because it would give it access to hundreds of billions of euros.A GOP Threat?According to research by ICU  Ukraine’s government raised its 2023 growth expectation to 4% from 1% which has in turn led to a sharp rise in the prices of its international bonds since June.Still  the country's economic flow will likely end this year at about 25% below pre-war levels  and according to MarketAxess  international bonds traded around 29 cents on the dollar just this last week.Parliament is also due to vote on a third jump in defense outlays  as the country's forces continue to consume around 90 000 artillery shells a month - skyrocketing the expense this year to $40 billion from $30 billion. As a result  the finance ministry revealed plans last week to raise security spending to $45 billion next year.Those hopes may also be crushed sooner than later  given that most of Ukraine's funds come from Europe and the US  especially if a Republican wins the elections next year as the GOP is exacerbating efforts to stop excessive US aid to Ukraine.Yuriy Butsa  head of public debt management in Ukraine’s Finance Ministry  told WSJ  ""If we win the war within a year  Russia is still our biggest fear "" adding: ""How do you price the risk that Russia attacks again?""Even its domestic bond market is in trouble  as it borrowed $10 billion through local bond sales this year  surpassing the $8.5 billion allocated by the US.Read next: Money will eventually push EU to force Kiev into peace talks: OrbanTo put the cherry on top  the World Bank believes that Ukraine will need at least $411 billion to rebuild after the war is over.Red flags  fair gameInternational bondholders such as MFS Investment Management  BlackRock  and Fidelity Investments  agreed to give Ukraine a break last year for about $20 billion of debt until mid-2024. Yet  the Finance Ministry is still hoping to restructure the bonds next year  but it would still require asking investors already reluctant  to forgive part of the debt and swap the remaining into new securities.As mentioned earlier  one of the efforts is to harbor interest income collected by financial clearinghouses like Belgium-based Euroclear on almost $280 billion of frozen Russian assets. Analysts believe that giving those funds to Ukraine would raise legal and diplomatic red flags but would still be a fair game.In the first half of this year  Euroclear collected $1.7 billion of interest on $150 billion of Russian assets wound up in international sanctions as it is currently in talks with EU officials to relocate some money to Ukraine through a windfall tax paid to the European Commission.Some suggestions include permitting Euroclear to keep a significant amount from the $1.7 billion  according to sources familiar with the updates  and the company reported $22 million of costs tied to Russian sanctions from January to June.A spokesperson for the European Commission stated that it is prepared to present a legal proposal considering discussions with EU members regarding a windfall tax.",neutral,0.11,0.75,0.14,mixed,0.1,0.21,0.69,True,English,"['defense expenses', 'Ukraine', 'time', 'cash', 'WSJ', 'Assault unit commander', '3rd Assault Brigade', 'domestic bond market', 'local bond sales', 'MFS Investment Management', 'diplomatic red flags', 'Ukraine-based brokerage ICU', 'public debt management', 'excessive US aid', 'international bond investors', 'international aid', 'International bondholders', 'international sanctions', 'call sign', 'Ukrainian servicemen', 'Donetsk region', 'AP Photo', 'Alex Babenko', 'budget deficit', 'finance officials', 'existing debts', 'financial intermediaries', 'Russian assets', 'complex structures', 'Vitaliy Vavryshchuk', 'budgetary gaps', 'military effort', 'European Union', '2023 growth expectation', 'sharp rise', 'economic flow', 'pre-war levels', 'third jump', '90,000 artillery shells', 'finance ministry', 'security spending', 'Yuriy Butsa', 'biggest fear', 'World Bank', 'fair game', 'Fidelity Investments', 'new securities', 'financial clearinghouses', 'first half', 'windfall tax', 'European Commission', 'significant amount', 'Russian sanctions', 'international bonds', 'EU officials', 'EU members', 'macroeconomic research', 'defense outlays', 'peace talks', 'interest income', 'legal proposal', 'Western Europe', 'GOP Threat', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'war bonds', 'government bonds', 'Hopes', 'funds', 'Republican', 'elections', 'efforts', 'Fedia', 'frontline', 'Andriivka', 'Saturday', 'Sept.', 'time', 'cash', 'head', 'water', 'others', 'money', 'program', 'consultation', 'individuals', 'drop', 'bucket', 'Kiev', 'offense', 'Oct', 'Reports', 'access', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'euros', 'turn', 'prices', 'June', 'country', 'MarketAxess', '29 cents', 'dollar', 'Parliament', 'forces', 'expense', 'result', 'plans', 'WSJ', 'year', 'risk', 'trouble', 'Orban', 'cherry', 'top', 'BlackRock', 'break', 'mid', 'part', 'Analysts', 'suggestions', 'sources', 'updates', 'company', 'costs', 'January', 'spokesperson', 'discussions']",2023-09-18,2023-09-18,english.almayadeen.net

And while the content offer has grown massively  it can be challenging both for broadcasters to target new audiences  and for viewers to find new content. To meet this demand  Eutelsat developed Sat.tv  an electronic program guide for Free-to-Air TV channels.The Sat.tv service delivers a uni-directional flow of information about free TV channels via satellite  to set-top boxes containing a Sat.tv-compatible chipset  giving users a more visual display of available content  including logos  channel line-ups and programme information.To make this enhanced TV viewing experience available on some of the most cost-effective set-top boxes in the market  NationalChip has integrated the Sat.tv functional specifications defined by Eutelsat  into the GX6605S chip. With over 100 million units shipped worldwide  this is the most popular chipset used in set-top boxes in the Middle East and North Africa region.Vincent Huang  CEO of NationalChip  commented  ""As a market leader in the set-top box chipset industry  we believe that partnership and innovation are key to enhance the value proposition for our customers.

Starting as a small box-maker in Rathmines in the 1930s  it has grown to become one of the biggest packaging companies in the world.Earlier this week  it announced a mega-merger with WestRock  one of its US rivals. It means the label of ‘one of the biggest’ packaging companies in the world will no longer apply. It will become *the* biggest company in the world in its field. No qualifiers.While there are some concerns from investors that it’s overpaying  when you take a step back  the company’s growth has been nothing short of extraordinary.One might think its ascension to the very top of its field would be met with cheers in the world of corporate Ireland.Instead  the deal is likely to result in plenty of soul searching – particularly among those in charge of the Irish stock exchange.While its headquarters will stay in Dublin  the newly merged entity  Smurfit WestRock  will shift its primary listing to New York.It means Smurfit will end its association with the Irish exchange  which had stretched back to 1964.It marks the latest body blow in what has been a harrowing year for the exchange  renamed Euronext Dublin after being acquired in 2018.CRH and FlutterIn April building materials giant CRH announced it would quit the Dublin market  also moving its primary listing to New York. The measure is set to complete later this month and will mark the exit of the exchange’s single largest company.AdvertisementWidely tipped to follow it out the door is Flutter  the gambling giant behind Paddy Power. The firm got investor backing in April to seek a listing in the US  with executives giving no guarantees of maintaining even a secondary listing in Dublin.Between them  these three firms account for about half the trading on the Irish exchange.The main reason for the departures of each is scale. By listing in the US  they hope to expose themselves to a much bigger pool of investors  boosting interest in the business and giving themselves more opportunities to grow.Losing all three in short order was always going to be a bitter pill for Euronext Dublin to swallow. But it would be mitigated if there was a steady pipeline of new companies coming through.Unfortunately  that’s not the case. In the last four years  just three companies have pursued a new listing in Dublin.Just one  Unipar  had an initial public offering (IPO) worth more than €100 million  and that was more than four years ago.This matters for a few reasons. There’s a clear direct cost for the state. Stamp duty is paid when people buy and sell shares. Less trading means this income stream drops – the numbers vary  but some estimates have foregone tax revenue from lower trading potentially reaching €300 million.But the bigger problem is an existential one. Think of all the employment which a company like Smurfit Kappa has created. It’s important for indigenous companies to have a way to grow and scale – the exchange has provided that.It can also give Irish investors a greater stake in the domestic economy  whether that’s in hotels with Dalata  house building with Glenveagh or Cairn  and so on.It hardly needs repeating  but Ireland is still hugely reliant on multinationals. While some may be happy enough with that while the corporate taxes continue to roll in  building up home-grown businesses should still be a priority.If one day  for whatever reason  some of the multinationals did leave  Ireland would be exposed  with a hole blown in the state’s tax take.In terms of what can be done to address this  Euronext Dublin has made some suggestions. These include tax incentives for entrepreneurs who sell their own shares in companies as part of an IPO  or a tax credit scheme to make the IPO process cheaper for new businesses.Read Next Related Reads Growth at all costs? Row over Irish dairy farms targeting African nationsThe focus is at least where it should be. For the likes of CRH or Smurfit  the promise of major increases in valuations and investor pools is not one which can be easily matched here.Euronext Dublin’s niche could be building a home for up and coming businesses looking to scale quickly and which want a jumping off point into the wider European market.This appears to be what Euronext had in mind when it first acquired the exchange  referencing how it could take advantage of Ireland’s EU location post-Brexit.Euronext itself should also look again at its own approach to encouraging listings. Its ‘IPO Ready’ scheme  a six-month programme detailing the listing process for businesses  has run since 2015.In that time  over 40 companies have completed it. However  just one – HealthBeacon – has since progressed to an actual IPO. A review looking into the poor conversion rate would do no harm.While the government has been slow to act in any significant aid or reform to the exchange  it should take the latest string of departures seriously.Smurfit Kappa  nor any other company  has an obligation to hang around to keep the Irish exchange healthy for up and comers.But other Irish startups should be able to aspire to go on a similar journey to the one which brought Smurfit from a humble box-maker in Rathmines to a multi-billion euro business which will soon have 100 000 employeesIt’s crucial the government and Euronext figure out a way to ensure that path stays open.,negative,0.03,0.31,0.66,mixed,0.08,0.23,0.69,True,English,"['Irish stock exchange', 'Dublin firm', 'existential crisis', 'mega-merger', 'building materials giant CRH', 'last four years', 'initial public offering', 'clear direct cost', 'poor conversion rate', 'biggest success stories', 'latest body blow', 'wider European market', 'Irish dairy farms', 'tax credit scheme', 'single largest company', 'IPO Ready’ scheme', 'biggest packaging companies', 'biggest’ packaging companies', 'Irish stock exchange', 'biggest company', 'latest string', 'tax revenue', 'tax take', 'tax incentives', 'Dublin market', 'small box-maker', 'soul searching', 'New York', 'harrowing year', 'Paddy Power', 'three firms', 'bigger pool', 'short order', 'bitter pill', 'steady pipeline', 'new companies', 'three companies', 'Stamp duty', 'income stream', 'bigger problem', 'existential one', 'indigenous companies', 'greater stake', 'domestic economy', 'African nations', 'major increases', 'EU location', 'six-month programme', 'significant aid', 'Irish exchange', 'primary listing', 'secondary listing', 'new listing', 'listing process', 'IPO process', 'actual IPO', 'other company', 'home-grown businesses', 'new businesses', 'coming businesses', 'SMURFIT KAPPA', 'Less trading', 'lower trading', 'Irish investors', 'corporate taxes', 'main reason', 'investor pools', 'US rivals', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Smurfit WestRock', 'corporate Ireland', '40 companies', 'Rathmines', '1930s', 'world', 'mega-merger', 'label', 'field', 'qualifiers', 'concerns', 'step', 'growth', 'top', 'cheers', 'deal', 'plenty', 'charge', 'headquarters', 'entity', 'association', 'Flutter', 'April', 'measure', 'exit', 'Advertisement', 'door', 'executives', 'guarantees', 'half', 'departures', 'scale', 'interest', 'opportunities', 'case', 'Unipar', 'reasons', 'state', 'people', 'shares', 'numbers', 'estimates', 'employment', 'way', 'hotels', 'Dalata', 'house', 'Glenveagh', 'Cairn', 'multinationals', 'priority', 'hole', 'terms', 'suggestions', 'entrepreneurs', 'costs', 'focus', 'likes', 'promise', 'up', 'jumping', 'point', 'mind', 'advantage', 'approach', 'listings', 'time', 'HealthBeacon', 'review', 'harm', 'government', 'reform', 'obligation']",2023-09-17,2023-09-18,thejournal.ie

This guidance requested all marketing authorisation holders to review their manufacturing processes for all products containing chemically synthesised or biological active substances to identify and  if necessary  mitigate the risk of presence of nitrosamine impurities.Because performing this activity was not compatible with the conventional 30 days stop-clock  AB Science requested an extension of this stop-clock in order to complete a risk evaluation of the manufacturing process in terms of risk of formation of nitrosamines in active substance and finished product.An extension of clock-stop is not automatic. A request for extension together with a corresponding scientific justification must be submitted by the applicant and needs to be discussed in a CHMP plenary session. AB Science's request was accepted during the September 11-14  2023 CHMP session.Based on this updated timetable  the CHMP decision on masitinib marketing authorization in ALS is expected during the first quarter of 2024.Based on the current stage of investigations  AB Science is confident that the current manufacturing process of masitinib complies with this new EMA guidance.References[1] EMA/369136/2020: Nitrosamines EMEA-H-A5(3)-1490 - Assessment report. https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/nitrosamines-emea-h-a53-1490-assessment-report_en.pdf[2] EMA/409815/2020 Rev.17: Questions and answers for marketing authorization holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products. https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/nitrosamines-emea-h-a53-1490-questions-answers-marketing-authorisation-holders/applicants-chmp-opinion-article-53-regulation-ec-no-726/2004-referral-nitrosamine-impurities-human-medicinal-products_en.pdfAbout AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.
