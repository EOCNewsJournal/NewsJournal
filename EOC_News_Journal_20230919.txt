FMIs issue industry paper on challenges and opportunities addressing const,DTCC  CLEARSTREAM AND EUROCLEAR CALL FOR MORE INDUSTRY COLLABORATION TO ADVANCE DIGITAL ASSET ECOSYSTEMFMIs issue industry paper on challenges and opportunities addressing constraints of scale and interoperabilityNew York/London/Hong Kong/Singapore/Sydney  18 September  2023 ‒ Today  three of the world’s largest financial market infrastructures (FMIs) – DTCC  Clearstream  and Euroclear – released a paper on the state of the industry’s digital asset evolution. The paper calls for increased collaboration to progress an ecosystem that currently includes fragmented standards  varying regulatory treatment  limited integrations with institutional-grade payment rails and siloed liquidity – all limiting factors to the further digitalization of global financial markets.While the last several years have seen a growing number of initiatives seeking to establish digital asset-based solutions  the paper suggests that industry-wide transformation will likely slow  unless these challenges are addressed. The paper highlights that two constraints in particular – scale and interoperability – must be addressed as priorities.Years of smaller deployments have resulted in sub-scale  isolated pools of liquidity on proprietary DLTs  creating obstacles to growth. In 2023  74% of DLT projects across the capital markets involved fewer than 6 participants. Today’s digital asset initiatives are also highly disparate  with varying standards and propositions related to settlement and custody processes and inconsistent approaches to the supervision and governance of smart contracts and related DLT protocols. These challenges  if unaddressed  will perpetuate a fragmented landscape  and run counter to the very efficiencies of DLT that the industry set out to capture initially.As FMIs  DTCC  Clearstream and Euroclear bring their expertise in innovation and driving industry transformation to address these challenges. To advance adoption and scale  DTCC  Clearstream and Euroclear pledge to collaborate with the industry  ultimately reducing the costs of connectivity and enabling consistent operating standards across processes  platforms  and digital assets themselves.Jennifer Peve  Managing Director  Global Head of Strategy & Innovation at DTCC  stated: “We are at an inflection point as an industry when it comes to DLT and digital assets. With digital assets forecasted to grow in value to around $16 trillion over the next 15 years  now is the time to assess what is needed to propel advancement. While we have all accelerated our learnings and identified the benefits of and constraints related to DLT on a smaller scale in recent years  there is broad recognition of the growing need for well-regulated  neutral players to provide trust  resilience and standardized connectivity in their respective ecosystems – the role FMIs like DTCC have played for decades – to drive digital asset adoption.”Jens Hachmeister  Managing Director  Head of Issuer Services & New Digital Markets at Clearstream  said: “New technologies and digital assets will transform the financial industry. As a neutral financial market infrastructure  we are uniquely placed to help the industry’s transition efforts by modernising infrastructure and driving the adoption of standards across DLT protocols and smart contract language that will lead to better and faster interoperability between ecosystems.”Philippe Laurensy  Head of Group Strategy  Product Management and Innovation at Euroclear Group  commented: “Financial market infrastructures (FMIs) have a long legacy of supporting technological innovation. Today  the pace of change is consistently accelerating and alongside our partners  we wholeheartedly embrace the promising potential of blockchain and digital assets. FMIs play a pivotal role in helping to unlock the true business value of digital assets through our robust  resilient ecosystem. By providing leading edge analysis with our peers  we can continue to pave the way for further advancements and bring ground-breaking solutions to the market which is aligned to Euroclear’s purpose to innovate to bring safety  efficiency  and connections to financial markets for sustainable economic growth.”By engaging with traditional and new market participants  DTCC  Clearstream and Euroclear’s unique collaboration will help to advance the digital asset ecosystem by driving and encouraging market dialogue on the required characteristics of DLT networks  data access  privacy and smart contracts  and ultimately enabling greater interoperability  broad adoption of standards  enhanced operational resilience  and a more robust case for change across the industry.About DTCCWith 50 years of experience  DTCC is the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry.

In addition  Kyiv has tapped its bond market  borrowing $10 billion via local sales this year as high yields of around 10% have attracted the country's private sector.Looking beyond the war  Ukraine needs $411 billion to rebuild itself  according to World Bank estimates.Read the original article on Business Insider,neutral,0.06,0.49,0.45,negative,0.02,0.27,0.71,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'wartime funds', 'Ukraine', 'interest', 'Russia', 'Kyiv', 'Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency', 'The Wall Street Journal', 'firing practice process', 'special shooting range', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'World Bank estimates', 'frozen assets', 'Ukrainian tank', 'Getty Images', 'first half', 'budget deficit', 'Russian assets', 'security spending', 'one source', 'Western institutions', 'gold deposits', 'legal doubts', 'Belgium-based firm', 'European Union', 'windfall tax', 'European Commission', 'one proposal', 'bond market', 'local sales', 'high yields', 'private sector', 'original article', 'wartime funds', 'Russian funds', 'Business Insider', 'Ukraine', 'interest', 'Kyiv', 'frontline', 'Zaporizhzhia', 'March', 'clearinghouses', 'Euroclear', 'year', 'forces', 'counteroffensive', 'funding', 'Moscow', '2022 invasion', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'dollars', 'matter', 'costs', 'sanctions', 'talks', 'money', 'way', 'sources', 'WSJ', 'portion', 'comment', 'addition', 'country']",2023-09-19,2023-09-19,ca.sports.yahoo.com

FMIs issue industry paper on challenges and opportunities addressing const,DTCC  CLEARSTREAM AND EUROCLEAR CALL FOR MORE INDUSTRY COLLABORATION TO ADVANCE DIGITAL ASSET ECOSYSTEMFMIs issue industry paper on challenges and opportunities addressing constraints of scale and interoperabilityNew York/London/Hong Kong/Singapore/Sydney  18 September  2023 ‒ Today  three of the world’s largest financial market infrastructures (FMIs) – DTCC  Clearstream  and Euroclear – released a paper on the state of the industry’s digital asset evolution. The paper calls for increased collaboration to progress an ecosystem that currently includes fragmented standards  varying regulatory treatment  limited integrations with institutional-grade payment rails and siloed liquidity – all limiting factors to the further digitalization of global financial markets.While the last several years have seen a growing number of initiatives seeking to establish digital asset-based solutions  the paper suggests that industry-wide transformation will likely slow  unless these challenges are addressed. The paper highlights that two constraints in particular – scale and interoperability – must be addressed as priorities.Years of smaller deployments have resulted in sub-scale  isolated pools of liquidity on proprietary DLTs  creating obstacles to growth. In 2023  74% of DLT projects across the capital markets involved fewer than 6 participants. Today’s digital asset initiatives are also highly disparate  with varying standards and propositions related to settlement and custody processes and inconsistent approaches to the supervision and governance of smart contracts and related DLT protocols. These challenges  if unaddressed  will perpetuate a fragmented landscape  and run counter to the very efficiencies of DLT that the industry set out to capture initially.As FMIs  DTCC  Clearstream and Euroclear bring their expertise in innovation and driving industry transformation to address these challenges. To advance adoption and scale  DTCC  Clearstream and Euroclear pledge to collaborate with the industry  ultimately reducing the costs of connectivity and enabling consistent operating standards across processes  platforms  and digital assets themselves.Jennifer Peve  Managing Director  Global Head of Strategy & Innovation at DTCC  stated: “We are at an inflection point as an industry when it comes to DLT and digital assets. With digital assets forecasted to grow in value to around $16 trillion over the next 15 years  now is the time to assess what is needed to propel advancement. While we have all accelerated our learnings and identified the benefits of and constraints related to DLT on a smaller scale in recent years  there is broad recognition of the growing need for well-regulated  neutral players to provide trust  resilience and standardized connectivity in their respective ecosystems – the role FMIs like DTCC have played for decades – to drive digital asset adoption.”Jens Hachmeister  Managing Director  Head of Issuer Services & New Digital Markets at Clearstream  said: “New technologies and digital assets will transform the financial industry. As a neutral financial market infrastructure  we are uniquely placed to help the industry’s transition efforts by modernising infrastructure and driving the adoption of standards across DLT protocols and smart contract language that will lead to better and faster interoperability between ecosystems.”Philippe Laurensy  Head of Group Strategy  Product Management and Innovation at Euroclear Group  commented: “Financial market infrastructures (FMIs) have a long legacy of supporting technological innovation. Today  the pace of change is consistently accelerating and alongside our partners  we wholeheartedly embrace the promising potential of blockchain and digital assets. FMIs play a pivotal role in helping to unlock the true business value of digital assets through our robust  resilient ecosystem. By providing leading edge analysis with our peers  we can continue to pave the way for further advancements and bring ground-breaking solutions to the market which is aligned to Euroclear’s purpose to innovate to bring safety  efficiency  and connections to financial markets for sustainable economic growth.”By engaging with traditional and new market participants  DTCC  Clearstream and Euroclear’s unique collaboration will help to advance the digital asset ecosystem by driving and encouraging market dialogue on the required characteristics of DLT networks  data access  privacy and smart contracts  and ultimately enabling greater interoperability  broad adoption of standards  enhanced operational resilience  and a more robust case for change across the industry.About DTCCWith 50 years of experience  DTCC is the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry.

This development marks a pivotal moment in the continent’s financial history and sets a precedent for other jurisdictions to potentially follow.In the wake of this  there’s a palpable sense of anticipation. As digital assets gain traction  Europe’s decision underscores a commitment to innovation while addressing the complexities of the crypto market — the harbinger of a global shift towards a more inclusive and diversified financial ecosystem. With Hong Kong’s renewed ambition to be a major crypto hub and debuting retail crypto trading via licensed exchanges  it may not be long before we see the first spot Bitcoin ETF in Asia  too.Europe paving the digital highwayOver the past decade  Europe has witnessed a steady growth and acceptance of digital assets. From the grassroots level of early enthusiasts trading cryptocurrencies to towering financial institutions exploring and adopting blockchain solutions  the continent has championed digital asset innovation.This commitment to progress has set the stage for the current developments. Pivotal regulatory discussions  such as the European Union’s deliberations on the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation  have sculpted the digital financial landscape in Europe. These regulatory strides  buoyed by interest from institutional investors  have culminated in the introduction of the spot Bitcoin ETF  marking a significant leap forward.Inside the spot Bitcoin ETFA spot Bitcoin ETF offers a more appealing route for institutional and professional investors to invest in Bitcoin through a more familiar product structure. The ETF offers a structured and regulated way for investors to tap into Bitcoin’s potential. Unlike holding Bitcoin directly  which comes with security and storage concerns  the ETF provides a more traditional investment vehicle.Story continuesJacobi’s ETF is regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission and trades under the ticker BCOIN. What sets Jacobi’s Spot Bitcoin ETF apart is its stringent regulatory compliance  ensuring investor protection. By bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world  it showcases the transformative potential of such instruments in the evolving financial landscape.As Europe leads  US remains reluctantEurope’s introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF sets it apart as a pioneer  especially when contrasted with the United States  which  despite its dominant crypto market presence  has been reticent in approving a spot Bitcoin ETF.This strategic divergence could recalibrate global financial market dynamics  potentially positioning Europe as a magnet for digital asset investments. The more conservative stance in the U.S.  likely rooted in regulatory apprehensions and market fluctuations  accentuates the differences in regulatory visions between the two jurisdictions. It also highlights the challenges and opportunities that digital assets present  emphasizing the need for a nuanced and informed regulatory perspective.Ripple effects beyond BitcoinThe spot Bitcoin ETF’s introduction might act as a catalyst — it’s akin to opening a door  inviting other digital assets to step into the spotlight. This pioneering step could spur the development of ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies or even lead to the creation of multi-asset cryptocurrency ETFs.The ETF’s debut could also influence investor strategies  potentially driving more institutional investment into the digital asset space.Old giants learning new danceTraditional financial entities  spanning banks to asset managers  now grapple with the undeniable reality of digital assets becoming mainstream. The once clear lines between traditional finance and the world of cryptocurrencies are blurring. As digital assets gain legitimacy  especially with regulatory clarity in certain jurisdictions  the financial sector is undergoing a transformative shift.We’re also witnessing an uptick in traditional banks establishing relationships with crypto companies  propelled  in part  by the U.S. bank closures earlier this year. In March  Coinbase partnered with Standard Chartered in Singapore for free fund transfers. Following Silicon Valley Bank’s failure  Circle announced Cross River as its new banking partner. In Switzerland  Arab Bank reported an increase in U.S. firms from the crypto space seeking banking services after Silvergate’s collapse.The broader financial sector might witness seismic shifts in asset allocation strategies  advisory services  and financial product portfolios in response to this digital renaissance. The dynamic landscape painted above highlights the adaptability of the financial world.Grayscale’s effect on regulatory perspectivesGrayscale’s recent court victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is a testament to the changing tides. The federal appeals court’s decision to side with Grayscale  challenging the SEC’s rejection of their spot Bitcoin ETF  is significant. According to JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou in a recent note: “It looks more likely that the SEC would be forced to approve the Spot Bitcoin ETF applications that are still pending from several asset managers  including that from Grayscale.” This not only underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets but also highlights the need for regulatory bodies to adapt to the evolving financial landscape.Grayscale’s landmark victory against the SEC has set a precedent that could catalyze the approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. This development could inject more competition into the market  potentially lowering fees for investors.Balancing innovation and regulationThe introduction of an avant-garde financial instrument like a spot Bitcoin ETF is not devoid of pitfalls. From market volatility to regulatory uncertainties  there are challenges to consider. Vigilant regulatory oversight becomes paramount to anchor market stability and shield investors from potential market manipulations or fraud. As with any investment  education is key. Ensuring that investors are well-informed can prevent speculative bubbles and uninformed investment decisions.Europe’s Bitcoin ETF introduction signals a new era in finance  where digital assets and traditional finance come together. As Europe treads this new path  the balance between innovation and regulation will be pivotal to ensure a stable and prosperous financial future.The journey has just begun. Collaborative efforts  informed regulations and continuous education will be crucial as Europe navigates the evolving digital asset space. And Grayscale’s win across the water is another positive sign of progress.,neutral,0.04,0.95,0.01,mixed,0.16,0.39,0.45,True,English,"['new spot Bitcoin ETF', 'global markets', 'Europe', 'first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund', 'dominant crypto market presence', 'first spot Bitcoin ETF', 'U.S. bank closures', 'global financial market dynamics', 'A spot Bitcoin ETF', 'Guernsey Financial Services Commission', 'free fund transfers', 'familiar product structure', 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'U.S. firms', 'recent court victory', 'U.S. Securities', 'federal appeals court', 'diversified financial ecosystem', 'towering financial institutions', 'financial product portfolios', 'evolving financial landscape', 'major crypto hub', 'retail crypto trading', 'broader financial sector', 'stringent regulatory compliance', 'informed regulatory perspective', 'asset allocation strategies', 'digital asset investments', 'Traditional financial entities', 'digital financial landscape', 'multi-asset cryptocurrency ETFs', 'new banking partner', 'traditional investment vehicle', 'Pivotal regulatory discussions', 'digital asset space', 'Jacobi Asset Management', 'other major cryptocurrencies', 'digital asset innovation', 'digital asset world', 'other digital assets', 'banking services', 'global shift', 'market fluctuations', 'Arab Bank', 'crypto space', 'Exchange Commission', 'financial history', 'financial world', 'asset managers', 'advisory services', 'dynamic landscape', 'Crypto Assets', 'crypto world', 'pivotal moment', 'investor strategies', 'new dance', 'crypto companies', 'digital highway', 'digital renaissance', 'traditional finance', 'regulatory strides', 'regulatory apprehensions', 'regulatory visions', 'regulatory clarity', 'regulatory perspectives', 'other jurisdictions', 'institutional investment', 'The ETF', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'two years', 'initial approval', 'palpable sense', 'Hong Kong', 'licensed exchanges', 'past decade', 'steady growth', 'grassroots level', 'early enthusiasts', 'blockchain solutions', 'current developments', 'European Union', 'MiCA) regulation', 'significant leap', 'appealing route', 'regulated way', 'storage concerns', 'investor protection', 'United States', 'strategic divergence', 'conservative stance', 'Ripple effects', 'pioneering step', 'Old giants', 'undeniable reality', 'clear lines', 'transformative shift', 'Standard Chartered', 'Cross River', 'seismic shifts', 'changing tides', 'traditional banks', 'professional investors', 'two jurisdictions', 'transformative potential', 'institutional investors', 'groundbreaking introduction', 'listing', 'continent', 'precedent', 'wake', 'anticipation', 'decision', 'commitment', 'complexities', 'harbinger', 'inclusive', 'ambition', 'Asia', 'acceptance', 'progress', 'stage', 'deliberations', 'Markets', 'interest', 'structured', 'security', 'trades', 'ticker', 'BCOIN', 'gap', 'instruments', 'magnet', 'differences', 'challenges', 'opportunities', 'need', 'nuanced', 'catalyst', 'door', 'spotlight', 'creation', 'debut', 'legitimacy', 'uptick', 'relationships', 'March', 'Coinbase', 'failure', 'Circle', 'Switzerland', 'increase', 'Silvergate', 'collapse', 'response', 'adaptability', 'Grayscale', 'testament']",2023-09-18,2023-09-19,finance.yahoo.com

This guidance requested all marketing authorisation holders to review their manufacturing processes for all products containing chemically synthesised or biological active substances to identify and  if necessary  mitigate the risk of presence of nitrosamine impurities.Because performing this activity was not compatible with the conventional 30 days stop-clock  AB Science requested an extension of this stop-clock in order to complete a risk evaluation of the manufacturing process in terms of risk of formation of nitrosamines in active substance and finished product.An extension of clock-stop is not automatic. A request for extension together with a corresponding scientific justification must be submitted by the applicant and needs to be discussed in a CHMP plenary session. AB Science’s request was accepted during the September 11-14  2023 CHMP session.Based on this updated timetable  the CHMP decision on masitinib marketing authorization in ALS is expected during the first quarter of 2024.Based on the current stage of investigations  AB Science is confident that the current manufacturing process of masitinib complies with this new EMA guidance.References[1] EMA/369136/2020: Nitrosamines EMEA-H-A5(3)-1490 - Assessment report. https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/nitrosamines-emea-h-a53-1490-assessment-report_en.pdf[2] EMA/409815/2020 Rev.17: Questions and answers for marketing authorization holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products. https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/nitrosamines-emea-h-a53-1490-questions-answers-marketing-authorisation-holders/applicants-chmp-opinion-article-53-regulation-ec-no-726/2004-referral-nitrosamine-impurities-human-medicinal-products_en.pdfAbout AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

Any remaining stock fractions will be paid in cash. The stock and cash dividend are approximately equal in value. For shareholders that have not made a choice during the election period  the dividend will be paid in cash.Shareholders representing approximately 47.2% of the outstanding number of shares have elected to receive the interim dividend in ordinary shares. Consequently  4 028 308 ordinary shares will be delivered from NN Group treasury shares.NN Group will neutralise the dilutive effect of the stock dividend through the repurchase of ordinary shares for a total amount of EUR 146 million  equivalent to the value of the stock dividend.

Due to delayed deliveries  especially from China  turnover reached just 7.8 million euros  with a loss-making interim bottom line. The Board of Directors therefore decided to divest from two non-strategic subsidiaries  MARO and IPL  which substantially improves the cash position. The first is active in solar panel installations and the second in the production of hardware for lighting fixtures   excluding any ""smart"" components. Thanks to this divestment income And subsequent interventions from VZH as reference shareholder the going concern status of the company was assured alongside addressing further needs for additional working capital and a needed substantial reduction of the long term debt obligations of the company.A detailed half-year report and explanation will be published later this week.Chairman and CEO Eric Van Zele comments: ""For the current financial year we still expect a total turnover of 20 M euros with a positive EBITDA. The group aims for further growth in turnover of > 22 M euros with an EBITDA of > 1.8 M euros - excluding the divested entities - for 2024  which should enable Crescent to further substantially reduce its historical and financial debts. The growth prospects for our renewed Product and Services Portfolio for the IOT market remain very promising and competitive   thanks to state-of-the-art smart lighting solutions and a renewed Cloudgate product line with sensor offering ; Our now fully operational software platform for the leisure market and an increased focus on engineering services will allow us to put former Option back on the world map. We will continue to strengthen our team when necessary. Our biggest challenge remains generating sufficient resources to finance this growth. A further and significant reduction of the long-term debt burden was necessary.""The Board of Directors has decided to co-opt until the next annual meeting Frederic Convent (60) as director in place of ADMODUM BV  permanently represented by Paul Mathijs  who made his mandate available at the end of June 2023 due to other priorities of his professional obligations. Given his extensive financial and accounting experience (cf. company website)  Frederic was asked to also chair the audit committee. The Board of Directors has also requested him  in this capacity  to assist Mr. Eric Van Zele at board level to enable the Crescent group to grow profitably   by strengthening the business foundations  and organizing sustainable financial resources  both at the top of the balance sheet  as with adequate debt.CONTACTEdwin Bex CFOGeldenaaksebaan 329B-3001 Leuven  BelgiumTEL: +32 (0) 16 31 74 11E-mail: investor@option.comwww.crescent-ventures.com",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.48,0.23,0.29,True,English,"['REGULATED INFORMATION', 'first semester', 'new director', 'disclosure', 'foreknowledge', 'September', '02:04', 'CEO Eric Van Zele', 'Mr. Eric Van Zele', 'loss-making interim bottom line', 'long term debt obligations', 'art smart lighting solutions', 'two non-strategic subsidiaries', 'solar panel installations', 'going concern status', 'additional working capital', 'detailed half-year report', 'operational software platform', 'long-term debt burden', 'next annual meeting', 'Edwin Bex CFO', 'current financial year', 'Cloudgate product line', 'sustainable financial resources', 'lighting fixtures', 'smart"" components', 'professional obligations', 'adequate debt', 'financial debts', 'sufficient resources', 'extensive financial', '8 AM CET', 'Euronext Brussels', 'first half', 'revenue targets', 'business units', '7.8 million euros', 'cash position', 'divestment income', 'subsequent interventions', 'reference shareholder', 'substantial reduction', '20 M euros', '22 M euros', '1.8 M euros', 'Services Portfolio', 'IOT market', 'sensor offering', 'leisure market', 'engineering services', 'world map', 'biggest challenge', 'significant reduction', 'ADMODUM BV', 'Paul Mathijs', 'other priorities', 'accounting experience', 'audit committee', 'business foundations', 'balance sheet', 'Crescent NV', 'positive EBITDA', 'former Option', 'Frederic Convent', 'The Board', 'board level', 'total turnover', 'growth prospects', 'company website', 'Crescent group', 'Leuven', 'Belgium', 'Geldenaaksebaan', 'closing', 'Directors', 'period', 'deliveries', 'China', 'MARO', 'IPL', 'production', 'hardware', 'VZH', 'needs', 'explanation', 'Chairman', 'entities', 'historical', 'focus', 'team', 'place', 'mandate', 'end', 'June', 'capacity', 'top', 'CONTACT', 'mail', 'investor', '32']",2023-09-19,2023-09-19,marketscreener.com

Chinese consumption  meanwhile  has not followed the expected trajectory  as indicated by key indicators in China1.For the second half of the year  the Group targets a moderate growth in sales compared to 2022  with a stable or slightly decreasing third quarter  and a fourth quarter more in line with the trend seen in the first semester  benefiting in particular from a favorable base effect in China.The adjustment of sales annual guidance leads to a mechanical reduction of 2023 EBIT margin target  despite a reinforced cost monitoring.In this context  the Group is fully committed and focused on implementing its action plan built around four key pillars and in line with its CSR strategy:continuation of the full price strategy;prioritization of investments  with a particular focus on marketing and IT expenditure;qualitative expansion of the physical and digital network  with more visible scope effects by the end of the year;and improvement of store teams’ productivity  as well as the adjustment of the recruitment policy in head office teams.Despite this adjustment  and thanks to this action plan  supported by committed teams and strong brands’ desirability  SMCP is confident of its resilience in this deteriorated environment  and will continue to seize growth opportunities in the coming months and years.FINANCIAL CALENDAROctober 26th  2023 – Q3 2023 Sales publication***DISCLAIMER: FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSCertain information contained in this document includes projections and forecasts.

30312,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://forkast.news/what-europes-spot-bitcoin-etf-means-for-markets/,What Europe’s new spot Bitcoin ETF means for global markets,Europe's first spot Bitcoin ETF ushers in an era where traditional finance and crypto are converging  setting the stage for digital assets to become mainstays in the economy.,The crypto world is abuzz with Europe’s groundbreaking introduction of its first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund from Jacobi Asset Management  listed on Euronext Amsterdam — a listing that took two years after initial approval in 2021. This development marks a pivotal moment in the continent’s financial history and sets a precedent for other jurisdictions to potentially follow.In the wake of this  there’s a palpable sense of anticipation. As digital assets gain traction  Europe’s decision underscores a commitment to innovation while addressing the complexities of the crypto market — the harbinger of a global shift towards a more inclusive and diversified financial ecosystem. With Hong Kong’s renewed ambition to be a major crypto hub and debuting retail crypto trading via licensed exchanges  it may not be long before we see the first spot Bitcoin ETF in Asia  too.Europe paving the digital highwayOver the past decade  Europe has witnessed a steady growth and acceptance of digital assets. From the grassroots level of early enthusiasts trading cryptocurrencies to towering financial institutions exploring and adopting blockchain solutions  the continent has championed digital asset innovation.This commitment to progress has set the stage for the current developments. Pivotal regulatory discussions  such as the European Union’s deliberations on the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation  have sculpted the digital financial landscape in Europe. These regulatory strides  buoyed by interest from institutional investors  have culminated in the introduction of the spot Bitcoin ETF  marking a significant leap forward.Inside the spot Bitcoin ETFA spot Bitcoin ETF offers a more appealing route for institutional and professional investors to invest in Bitcoin through a more familiar product structure. The ETF offers a structured and regulated way for investors to tap into Bitcoin’s potential. Unlike holding Bitcoin directly  which comes with security and storage concerns  the ETF provides a more traditional investment vehicle.Jacobi’s ETF is regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission and trades under the ticker BCOIN. What sets Jacobi’s Spot Bitcoin ETF apart is its stringent regulatory compliance  ensuring investor protection. By bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world  it showcases the transformative potential of such instruments in the evolving financial landscape.As Europe leads  US remains reluctantEurope’s introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF sets it apart as a pioneer  especially when contrasted with the United States  which  despite its dominant crypto market presence  has been reticent in approving a spot Bitcoin ETF.This strategic divergence could recalibrate global financial market dynamics  potentially positioning Europe as a magnet for digital asset investments. The more conservative stance in the U.S.  likely rooted in regulatory apprehensions and market fluctuations  accentuates the differences in regulatory visions between the two jurisdictions. It also highlights the challenges and opportunities that digital assets present  emphasizing the need for a nuanced and informed regulatory perspective.Ripple effects beyond BitcoinThe spot Bitcoin ETF’s introduction might act as a catalyst — it’s akin to opening a door  inviting other digital assets to step into the spotlight. This pioneering step could spur the development of ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies or even lead to the creation of multi-asset cryptocurrency ETFs.The ETF’s debut could also influence investor strategies  potentially driving more institutional investment into the digital asset space.Old giants learning new danceTraditional financial entities  spanning banks to asset managers  now grapple with the undeniable reality of digital assets becoming mainstream. The once clear lines between traditional finance and the world of cryptocurrencies are blurring. As digital assets gain legitimacy  especially with regulatory clarity in certain jurisdictions  the financial sector is undergoing a transformative shift.We’re also witnessing an uptick in traditional banks establishing relationships with crypto companies  propelled  in part  by the U.S. bank closures earlier this year. In March  Coinbase partnered with Standard Chartered in Singapore for free fund transfers. Following Silicon Valley Bank’s failure  Circle announced Cross River as its new banking partner. In Switzerland  Arab Bank reported an increase in U.S. firms from the crypto space seeking banking services after Silvergate’s collapse.The broader financial sector might witness seismic shifts in asset allocation strategies  advisory services  and financial product portfolios in response to this digital renaissance. The dynamic landscape painted above highlights the adaptability of the financial world.Grayscale’s effect on regulatory perspectivesGrayscale’s recent court victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is a testament to the changing tides. The federal appeals court’s decision to side with Grayscale  challenging the SEC’s rejection of their spot Bitcoin ETF  is significant. According to JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou in a recent note: “It looks more likely that the SEC would be forced to approve the Spot Bitcoin ETF applications that are still pending from several asset managers  including that from Grayscale.” This not only underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets but also highlights the need for regulatory bodies to adapt to the evolving financial landscape.Grayscale’s landmark victory against the SEC has set a precedent that could catalyze the approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. This development could inject more competition into the market  potentially lowering fees for investors.Balancing innovation and regulationThe introduction of an avant-garde financial instrument like a spot Bitcoin ETF is not devoid of pitfalls. From market volatility to regulatory uncertainties  there are challenges to consider. Vigilant regulatory oversight becomes paramount to anchor market stability and shield investors from potential market manipulations or fraud. As with any investment  education is key. Ensuring that investors are well-informed can prevent speculative bubbles and uninformed investment decisions.Europe’s Bitcoin ETF introduction signals a new era in finance  where digital assets and traditional finance come together. As Europe treads this new path  the balance between innovation and regulation will be pivotal to ensure a stable and prosperous financial future.The journey has just begun. Collaborative efforts  informed regulations and continuous education will be crucial as Europe navigates the evolving digital asset space. And Grayscale’s win across the water is another positive sign of progress.,neutral,0.04,0.95,0.01,mixed,0.21,0.29,0.5,True,English,"['new spot Bitcoin ETF', 'global markets', 'Europe', 'first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund', 'dominant crypto market presence', 'first spot Bitcoin ETF', 'U.S. bank closures', 'global financial market dynamics', 'Guernsey Financial Services Commission', 'free fund transfers', 'familiar product structure', 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'U.S. firms', 'recent court victory', 'U.S. Securities', 'federal appeals court', 'diversified financial ecosystem', 'towering financial institutions', 'financial product portfolios', 'evolving financial landscape', 'major crypto hub', 'retail crypto trading', 'broader financial sector', 'stringent regulatory compliance', 'informed regulatory perspective', 'asset allocation strategies', 'digital asset investments', 'Traditional financial entities', 'digital financial landscape', 'multi-asset cryptocurrency ETFs', 'new banking partner', 'traditional investment vehicle', 'Pivotal regulatory discussions', 'digital asset space', 'Jacobi Asset Management', 'other major cryptocurrencies', 'digital asset innovation', 'digital asset world', 'other digital assets', 'banking services', 'global shift', 'market fluctuations', 'Arab Bank', 'crypto space', 'Exchange Commission', 'financial history', 'financial world', 'asset managers', 'advisory services', 'dynamic landscape', 'Crypto Assets', 'crypto world', 'pivotal moment', 'investor strategies', 'new dance', 'crypto companies', 'digital highway', 'digital renaissance', 'traditional finance', 'regulatory strides', 'regulatory apprehensions', 'regulatory visions', 'regulatory clarity', 'regulatory perspectives', 'other jurisdictions', 'The ETF', 'institutional investment', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'two years', 'initial approval', 'palpable sense', 'Hong Kong', 'licensed exchanges', 'past decade', 'steady growth', 'grassroots level', 'early enthusiasts', 'blockchain solutions', 'current developments', 'European Union', 'MiCA) regulation', 'significant leap', 'appealing route', 'regulated way', 'storage concerns', 'investor protection', 'United States', 'strategic divergence', 'conservative stance', 'Ripple effects', 'pioneering step', 'Old giants', 'undeniable reality', 'clear lines', 'transformative shift', 'Standard Chartered', 'Cross River', 'seismic shifts', 'changing tides', 'traditional banks', 'professional investors', 'two jurisdictions', 'transformative potential', 'institutional investors', 'groundbreaking introduction', 'listing', 'continent', 'precedent', 'wake', 'anticipation', 'decision', 'commitment', 'complexities', 'harbinger', 'inclusive', 'ambition', 'Asia', 'acceptance', 'progress', 'stage', 'deliberations', 'Markets', 'interest', 'structured', 'security', 'trades', 'ticker', 'BCOIN', 'gap', 'instruments', 'magnet', 'differences', 'challenges', 'opportunities', 'need', 'nuanced', 'catalyst', 'door', 'spotlight', 'creation', 'debut', 'legitimacy', 'uptick', 'relationships', 'March', 'Coinbase', 'failure', 'Circle', 'Switzerland', 'increase', 'Silvergate', 'collapse', 'response', 'adaptability', 'Grayscale', 'testament']",2023-09-18,2023-09-19,forkast.news

Chinese consumption  meanwhile  has not followed the expected trajectory  as indicated by key indicators in China1.For the second half of the year  the Group targets a moderate growth in sales compared to 2022  with a stable or slightly decreasing third quarter  and a fourth quarter more in line with the trend seen in the first semester  benefiting in particular from a favorable base effect in China.The adjustment of sales annual guidance leads to a mechanical reduction of 2023 EBIT margin target  despite a reinforced cost monitoring.In this context  the Group is fully committed and focused on implementing its action plan built around four key pillars and in line with its CSR strategy:continuation of the full price strategy;prioritization of investments  with a particular focus on marketing and IT expenditure;qualitative expansion of the physical and digital network  with more visible scope effects by the end of the year;and improvement of store teams’ productivity  as well as the adjustment of the recruitment policy in head office teams.Despite this adjustment  and thanks to this action plan  supported by committed teams and strong brands’ desirability  SMCP is confident of its resilience in this deteriorated environment  and will continue to seize growth opportunities in the coming months and years.FINANCIAL CALENDAROctober 26th  2023 – Q3 2023 Sales publication***DISCLAIMER: FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSCertain information contained in this document includes projections and forecasts.

He will focus on Colas' operational efficiency and development. Pascal Grangé will bring to Colas his in-depth knowledge of the Bouygues Group's businesses.”Commenting on the departure of Frédéric Gardès at the meeting of the Board of Directors  Olivier Roussat stated: “I would like to thank Frédéric Gardès for the work he has done to transform the company.

Under these circumstances  he has tendered his resignation from his position as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and from his mandate as Director. The Board of Directors of Colas acknowledged his resignation.The Board of Directors would like to thank Frédéric Gardès for the very important transformation work he has led within the Colas group; it salutes his career within the Group and his action at the head of Colas since his appointment as Chief Executive Officer in 2019.As part of Colas 's new governance structure  its Board of Directors  on the recommendation of the Selection and Remuneration Committee  has proceeded with the appointment  with immediate effect  of:Pascal Grangé as non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors; andas non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors; and Pierre Vanstoflegatte as Chief Executive Officer.Following the appointment of Pascal Grangé as non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Colas  Marie-Luce Godinot becomes Bouygues’ permanent representative to the Board of Directors and will chair the Audit Committee of Colas.Commenting on the contemplated delisting of Colas and the new governance structure  Bouygues’ Group Chief Executive Officer  Olivier Roussat  declared: “Colas is a company recognized worldwide as a benchmark in its businesses  and it will remain so. The plan to delist Colas demonstrates our intention to simplify operating and reporting processes. The separation of the functions of Chairman  on the one hand  and Chief Executive Officer  on the other hand  is also an opportunity to appoint a Chief Executive Officer and a non-executive Chairman who are highly complementary: Pierre Vanstoflegatte is a high-level operational executive and a recognized expert in the agency business. He will focus on Colas' operational efficiency and development. Pascal Grangé will bring to Colas his in-depth knowledge of the Bouygues Group's businesses.”Commenting on the departure of Frédéric Gardès at the meeting of the Board of Directors  Olivier Roussat stated: “I would like to thank Frédéric Gardès for the work he has done to transform the company. Together with the management team  he has succeeded in uniting all his employees to achieve new milestones  particularly in terms of internationalization and CSR. He can be proud of what he has achieved over the past 12 years at Colas  and more broadly during his career with the Bouygues Group since 1994.”Commenting on the arrival of Pierre Vanstoflegatte  he added: “I would like to welcome Pierre Vanstoflegatte to Colas. Pierre is an accomplished professional whom we know well at Bouygues  with a rich career and strong human values. He has everything it takes to succeed.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYVolta is pleased to report another positive monthly performance in August 2023 (+1.3%) leading to a YTD performance of 16.6%.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: +1.6% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +1.4% for CLO Equity tranches  +1.1% for CLO Debt tranches and -8.6% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which now represents c.1.5% of the fund’s NAV). This month  being long USD against Euro provided circa +0.35% of performance.In August  US and European leveraged loan market prices moved up again (ELLI was up 1.48% while US LLI was up 1.17% according to Pitchbook LCD) as some CLO were ramping in preparation for a September launch and that some prepayments were also visible on the calendar.In terms of cashflows  August is generally a slow month as most CLO paid in July. Still  Volta received €1.3m of distributions through the month  leading to €25.7m cashflow generation over the last 6 months. In addition  Volta received the principal repayment at par of one Bank Balance Sheet transaction for $8m resulting in Bank balance sheet exposure to reduce to 2.4%. Such proceeds will be reinvested in the CLO asset class through the month to come as Volta is transitioning to a pure CLO player (c.97.5% of the exposure today excluding cash).Through the month  we remained active with €2.2m additional fundings to our European CLO warehouse  $1m invested in the opening of a new US warehouse as well as €6.5m of investments in European CLO debt tranches purchased in the secondary market.As of end of August 2023  Volta’s NAV was €239.0m  i.e. €6.53 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 6.41% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 6.01% as at 31 July 2023  0.40% as at 30 June 2023.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

As previously indicated  the mass roll-out of the PCSTORM project is currently underway  with the forthcoming deployment of the largest MCPTT platform in the world in terms of simultaneous end-users.EBITDA: €4.6mAfter a first half 2022 marked by non-recurring staff costs  the second half of 2022 saw the satisfactory reorganisation of technical teams. The first half of 2023 continued in the same vein  with a €0.4 million net decrease in payroll compared to the first half of 2022  representing 37% of first half revenue compared to 43% in H1 2022.Before capitalisation of staff costs linked to product development (€2.8 million  down from €2.7 million at 30 June 2022)  first half payroll amounted to €5.9 million  down €0.3 million  mainly reflecting change in headcount: the Group had 193 employees at the end of June 2023 (unchanged from the end of December 2022)  down from 205 at the end of June 2022.With regard to external expenses  the Group continues to efficiently control its costs  which dropped €0.1 million  with particular attention to subcontracting expenses  professional fees and hiring costs.Excluding depreciation and amortisation and after IFRS 16 restatement of lease expenses (additional expenses of €0.4 million compared to €0.3 million a year earlier)  operating expenses amounted to €3.8 million in H1 2023  a significant reduction of €0.5 million from €4.3 million in H1 2022. Taking into account the €0.2 million increase in first half revenue  the operating margin rose to 55% (up €0.8 million)  compared to 47% in H1 2022 and 55% for the previous full year.EBIT: €1.6mNet income: €1.2mThe €0.3 million increase in depreciation and amortisation in H1 2023 is due to the amortisation of development costs (€2.3 million versus €2 million in H1 2022). They are expected to stabilise at their current level over the coming months  depending on the various software versions developed and put into production. Depreciation of lease right-of-use assets was stable at €0.3 million  following the revaluation of the Paris lease in the first half of 2022.After €0.1 million of net financial expense  reflecting adverse movements in the USD/EUR exchange rate during the first half and the financial costs associated with the new loans taken out in March 2023  and a net tax loss of €0.3 million impacted by the net deferred tax liability on capitalised development costs  with no cash impact  the Group reported net income of €1.2 million  a €0.2 million increase on H1 2022 (up 15%)._ INCREASED FREE CASH FLOW AND ROBUST FINANCIAL STRUCTUREThe Group's financial structure remained strong at 30 June 2023 with shareholders' equity at €20.5 million and a healthy net cash balance of €6.7 million (excluding lease liabilities). The balance sheet total was €44.8 million  up from €39.5 million at 31 December 2022 (see appendix below).Gross cash and cash equivalents increased by €5 million to €16.4 million at 30 June 2023. After taking into account borrowings (€9.7 million) and excluding lease liabilities (€2.8 million  compared to €2.9 million at 31 December 2022)  net cash came to €6.7 million  compared to €8.5 million at 31 December 2022.Operating cash flow amounted to €3.1 million  posting a slight decline attributable mainly to the €0.8 million decrease in working capital over the period  while recurring capital expenditure on product development remained high at €3.2 million (see appendix below). Note that the receivable relating to the Research Tax Credit for 2022 (€1.1 million) is due in the second half  whereas a €1 million refund was recorded in the first half of 2022. Lastly  cash flows from financing activities were positive at €5.3 million  following (i) changes in borrowings (up €7 million)  taking into account new loans taken out in March 2023 totalling €7.5 million and repayments of €0.5 million during the period  and (ii) net buybacks of treasury shares (€1.4 million outflow)  prior to their cancellation at the end of June 2023._ OUTLOOK: PROVEN TECHNOLOGY AND DIVERSIFICATION OF REVENUE SOURCESAs announced in the H1 2023 revenue release  the level of full-year 2023 revenue currently anticipated is satisfactory  but remains correlated with the launch schedules of the various French and European ministerial projects. In particular  the Italian project won by the Group several months ago is set to enter its first operational phase by the end of the year. The impact in terms of revenue could therefore vary widely as of the fourth quarter of 2023. Despite this uncertainty  revenue is expected to grow by at least as much over the full year as it did in the first half of 2023. With the revenue base often more favourable in the second half  and boosted by a relatively stable cost structure  the impact on operating margin and full-year earnings should therefore be positive.In the medium term  a large number of projects in France (team on the run platform and legacy businesses)  Europe (team on mission platform business) and the United States (core and legacy businesses) are set to come to fruition in the coming months. However  2024 revenue is also dependent on the various operational schedules adopted for the various projects. Although development projects in the public safety sector  and more generally the adoption of new-generation critical communications solutions  are expected to accelerate over time  the time variable remains an unknown and as such requires the Group to remain relatively cautious as to the level of full-year revenue it can anticipate for 2024.In addition  2024 is the year of the Olympic Games in France and the current challenge for the various players in the STORM and RRF projects is to roll out and maintain in operational conditions the largest MCx (critical communications) platform ever deployed in Europe  and probably the world. In this sense  the Rugby World Cup currently underway in France acts a dress rehearsal.The platform technology developed by the Group has become a must for most major players in the sector. The Group has new financial resources (new loans taken out in March 2023) to further sharpen the technological edge of its solutions. Major technical investments will accordingly be made in the coming months to further strengthen the sovereignty  security  standards compliance (particularly 3GPP) and scalability of the solutions developed  while offering new features and increasing the end-to-end quality of their components (servers  mobile and web applications).The Group therefore remains confident in its ability to maintain its profitable growth momentum  although this is still subject to the various schedules of the many projects currently underway and to the technical and organisational constraints facing customers/prospects. The Group plans to continue investing technically in these solutions in order to respond effectively to its customers' needs  while further developing its direct and indirect sales ecosystem to diversify its future revenue streams.AppendicesConsolidated financial statements at 30 June 2023 and 31 December 2022in K€ 30-Jun-23 31-Dec-22 Intangible assets 14 824 13 938 Tangible assets 3 788 4 083 Other financial assets 334 468 Deferred tax assets 75 75 NON CURRENT ASSETS 19 021 18 564 Receivables 6 326 6 704 Other receivables 1 402 1 144 Other financial assets 1 717 1 193 Cash and cash equivalent 16 354 11 341 CURRENT ASSETS 25 799 20 382 TOTAL ASSETS 44 820 38 946 Capital 280 305 Paid in capital 4 164 9 894 Consolidated reserves 15 075 10 360 Self owned shares -193 -2 814 Net Result Group share 1 197 3 399 TOTAL EQUITY 20 524 21 145 Financial liabilities 8 514 2 089 Rental liabilities 2 294 2 499 Non current provisions 329 304 Deferred financial revenues 1 773 1 743 Deferred tax liabilities 2 153 1 609 NON CURRENT LIABILITIES 15 064 8 243 Financial liabilities 1 189 734 Rental liabilities 533 499 Current provisions - - Payables 567 719 Social and fiscal debts 2 896 2 588 Deferred fiscal products 887 871 Deferred revenues 3 161 4 147 CURRENT LIABILITIES 9 233 9 558 TOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 44 820 38 946Consolidated cash flow statement HY 2023  FY 2022 and HY 2022in K€ HY 2023 FY 2022 HY 2022 Consolidated net result 1 197 3 399 1 040 Capacity of self financing before cost of debt and taxes 3 955 8 793 3 672 Variation of working capital -807 534 528 Net operating cash flow 3 148 9 327 4 200 Change in fixed assets -3 416 -9 134 -6 224 Other cash flow linked to investment operations (CIR) - 2 065 955 Net investing cash flow -3 416 -7 069 -5 269 Net financing cash flow 5 280 883 2 413 Cash variation 5 013 3 141 1 344 Cash at the end of the period 16 354 11 341 8 200Next financial release: 2023 revenue  Monday  12 February 2024_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________About STREAMWIDE (Euronext Growth: ALSTW)A major player for 20 years in the critical communications market  STREAMWIDE has successfully developed its Team on mission (mission critical) and Team on the run (business critical) software solutions for administrations and businesses.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER OF ANY OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED HEREIN.PGS ASA (“PGS” or the “Company”) refers to the announcement regarding a merger with TGS ASA (“TGS”) earlier today  and announces now that it is contemplating a private placement (the ""Private Placement"") of 45 760 726 new ordinary shares in the Company (the “Offer Shares”).The net proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement will be used to increase liquidity and enable a financially robust combined entity following the proposed merger with TGS  protect the Company against market cyclicality prior to consummation of the merger  and maintain symmetry with TGS as they expect to undertake a concurrent private placement that is sized to maintain the agreed relative ownership in the merger.PGS has retained Pareto Securities AS (the ""Manager"") as the sole manager and sole bookrunner in the Private Placement.The subscription price per Offer Share (the “Offer Price”) will be determined by the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) on the basis of an accelerated bookbuilding process which will be denominated in NOK.The bookbuilding period for the Private Placement will commence today  18 September 2023  at 16:30 CEST and is expected to close on or before 19 September 2023 at 08:00 CEST. The Company may extend or shorten the bookbuilding period at any time and for any reason on short  or without  notice. If the bookbuilding period is extended or shortened  the other dates referred to herein might be changed accordingly.Allocation of the Offer Shares will be determined after the expiry of the bookbuilding period at the Board's sole discretion (in consultation with the Manager). The Board will focus on criteria such as (but not limited to) existing ownership in the Company  price leadership  timeliness of the application  relative order size  sector knowledge  perceived investor quality and investment horizon. Notification of allocation is expected on or about 19 September before 09:00 CEST.Completion of the Private Placement is subject to: (i) all corporate resolutions of the Company required to implement the Private Placement being validly made by the Company  including  without limitation  the resolution by the Board to increase the share capital of the Company and issue the Offer Shares pursuant to an authorisation granted by the Company’s annual general meeting held on 24 April 2023  (ii) the Pre-Payment Agreement (as defined below) remaining unmodified and in full force and effect  and (iii) the share capital increase pertaining to the issuance of the allocated Offer Shares being validly registered with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises (the ""NRBE"") and the allocated Offer Shares being validly issued and registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (Euronext Securities Oslo or the “VPS”) (jointly the “Conditions""). The Company reserves the right to cancel  and/or modify the terms of  the Private Placement at any time and for any reason prior to the Conditions having been met. Neither the Company nor the Manager will be liable for any losses incurred by applicants if the Private Placement is cancelled and/or modified  irrespective of the reason for such cancellation or modification.The Private Placement is expected to be settled on a delivery-versus payment (DVP) basis on or about 21 September 2023  which will be facilitated by a pre-payment agreement expected to be entered into between the Company and the Manager (the “Pre-Payment Agreement”). The Offer Shares allocated to investors will be tradable on Oslo Børs when the Conditions have been met  expected on or about 20 September 2023.The Private Placement will be made by the Company to investors subject to applicable exemptions from relevant prospectus requirements in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 and the Norwegian Securities Trading Act of 2007 and is directed towards investors subject to available exemptions from relevant registration requirements  (i) outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the US Securities Act of 1933  as amended (the “US Securities Act”) and (ii) in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” (QIBs)  as defined in Rule 144A under the US Securities Act  pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements under the US Securities Act  as well as to “major U.S. institutional investors” as defined in Rule 15a-6 under the United States Exchange Act of 1934  in each case subject to an exemption being available from offer prospectus requirements and any other filing or registration requirements in the applicable jurisdictions and subject to other selling restrictions. The minimum application and allocation amount has been set to the NOK equivalent of EUR 100 000 per investor. The Company may offer and allocate amounts below the NOK equivalent of EUR 100 000 in the Private Placement to the extent exemptions from prospectus requirements  in accordance with applicable regulations  including the Norwegian Securities Trading Act  Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 on prospectuses for securities and ancillary regulations  are available.The contemplated Private Placement involves the setting aside of the shareholders’ preferential rights to subscribe for the Offer Shares. The Board is of the view that it is in the common interest of the Company and its shareholders to raise equity through a private placement  in view of the current market conditions and the Company’s need for increased liquidity and a financially robust combined entity following the proposed merger with TGS. A private placement enables the Company to reduce execution and completion risk  allows for the Company to raise capital more quickly  raise capital at a lower discount compared to a rights issue and without the underwriting commissions normally seen with rights offerings.The Company may  subject to completion of the Private Placement and certain other conditions  decide to carry out a subsequent repair offering of new shares at the Offer Price in the Private Placement which  subject to applicable securities law  will be directed towards existing shareholders in the Company as of 18 September 2023 (as registered in the VPS) two trading days thereafter)  who (i) were not allocated Offer Shares in the Private Placement  and (ii) are not resident in a jurisdiction where such offering would be unlawful or would (in jurisdictions other than Norway) require any prospectus  filing  registration or similar action.Advokatfirmaet BAHR AS is acting as legal advisor to the Company in connection with the Private Placement.Contacts:Bård Stenberg  VP IR & Corporate CommunicationMobile: +47 99 24 52 35***PGS is a fully integrated marine geophysical company that provides a broad range of seismic and reservoir services  including data acquisition  imaging  interpretation  and field evaluation.

In June  the Dutch-based e-commerce investor  Prosus  which is majority-owned by South African multi-national Naspers won shareholder and regulatory approval to unwind its complex ownership structure. The South African Reserve Bank gave Naspers the greenlight to begin buying back more of its shares from Prosus.'Getting rid' of the cross holdingPrior to the current structure  Naspers (headquartered in South Africa) owned a third of Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings. This was an investment made by current chairman and founder of Naspers  Koos Bekker  as early as 2001  when he paid $34 million for a 46.5% stake in the business. Van Dijk oversaw the decision to split off its holding of Tencent and other tech holdings into Prosus in 2019. In the meantime  Tencent's market capitalization rocketed close to $1 trillion as the stock boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic. This meant Naspers made up nearly a quarter of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange which was a problem for some fund managers. Then in 2021  Naspers developed a crossholding using a share swap deal. Prosus issued new shares to buy a 45.4% stake in Naspers  and this effectively moved a slice of Naspers from the Johannesburg exchange to Amsterdam's Euronext. But that crossholding offered little value to investors with van Dijk telling Reuters at the time: ""They [shareholders] said we don't like this cross holding  it creates complexity. We've listened to them. And we're basically getting rid of that now.""Stepping upOn Monday the business also announced  on a call with investors  that the unwinding of the crossholding had officially been completed with the business now aiming to maintain profitability going into the first half of the 2025 fiscal year. Erwin Tu  Prosus' group chief investment officer has been named interim CEO  with Citi saying in a research note that it sees ""a good chance of him becoming permanent CEO. ""We suspect the decision has not been sudden  but rather one the company preferred to announce following the completion of the unwind of the cross-holding process "" the Citi analysts said. Tu was previously a managing partner at the SoftBank Vision Fund where he also co-led M&A and corporate finance for SoftBank Group International. He was also managing director in the technology banking group at Goldman Sachs.watch now",neutral,0.03,0.84,0.13,negative,0.01,0.18,0.81,True,English,"['CEO Bob van Dijk', 'Tencent investors', 'abrupt departure', 'Naspers', 'Prosus', 'The South African Reserve Bank', 'Prosus CEO Bob van Dijk', 'group chief investment officer', 'Bob van Dijk Bloomberg', 'South African multi-national Naspers', 'SoftBank Group International', 'technology banking group', 'Chinese tech giant', 'Dutch-based e-commerce investor', 'Chinese internet giant', 'share swap deal', 'complex ownership structure', 'SoftBank Vision Fund', 'other tech holdings', 'Johannesburg Stock Exchange', 'permanent CEO', 'Johannesburg exchange', 'current structure', 'fund managers', 'Getty Images', 'regulatory approval', 'current chairman', 'Koos Bekker', 'market capitalization', 'Covid-19 pandemic', 'little value', 'first half', '2025 fiscal year', 'research note', 'good chance', 'cross-holding process', 'managing partner', 'M&A', 'corporate finance', 'managing director', 'Goldman Sachs', 'cross holding', 'new shares', 'Erwin Tu', 'Citi analysts', 'Tencent Holdings', 'immediate', 'departure', 'complicated', 'years', 'firm', 'coattails', 'June', 'shareholder', 'greenlight', 'third', 'founder', '46.5% stake', 'business', 'decision', 'meantime', 'quarter', 'problem', 'crossholding', '45.4% stake', 'slice', 'Amsterdam', 'Euronext', 'investors', 'Reuters', 'complexity', 'Monday', 'call', 'unwinding', 'profitability', 'company', 'completion']",2023-09-18,2023-09-19,cnbc.com

Offering the most valuable and innovative products to all client segments  it operated a total fleet of 3.4 million1 fleet as at 30 June 2023  twice the size of its nearest competitor. ALD | LeasePlan owns the largest multi-brand Electric Vehicles (EVs) fleet in the world  at 428 000 vehicles  which reflects its leading role in the transition to sustainable mobility.The mobility sector benefits from strong and structural growth  driven by long-term megatrends:Structural transition from ownership to usership is expected to accelerate  lifting the European usership market from 4.9 million vehicles in 2021 to 9.5 million vehicles in 2030  i.e. +7.7% CAGR compared to 2021. All client segments are expected to grow  in particular the consumer market 2 ;; Demand for electrification is also set to accelerate  with c. 70% of new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles expected to be electric in Europe by 2030 3 ;; Increasing digitalization  emerging ecosystems and evolving competition are creating further growth opportunities.Against this backdrop  the combination of its undisputed leadership  powerful global operating platform and strong financial profile  provides a unique position to ALD | LeasePlan to create value in the mobility industry.With “PowerUP 2026”  ALD | LeasePlan will leverage on the power of leadership to shape the future of mobility and achieve excellence  by executing a strategic plan articulated around 4 priorities: clients  operational efficiency  responsibility and profitability.ClientsALD | LeasePlan plans to launch a new brand by the end of the year  to create a powerful new identity from two highly reputed industry players.A one-stop shop with the broadest client reach  geographical coverage and the largest distribution capabilities through more than 430 partnerships  ALD | LeasePlan is best placed to answer customers’ changing needs.ALD | LeasePlan expects that its earning assets4 will grow strongly by +6%5 CAGR between 2023 and 2026  driven by higher-value vehicles (underpinned by the rising share of EVs6 in the funded fleet) and selective growth strategy to meet the Group’s profitability targets. Furthermore  the objective of reaching 200 000 active users of its MaaS7 platform  launched in 2022  by 2026  reflects its strong ambition to lead the transition to sustainable mobility and go beyond electrification  into MaaS.Operational efficiencyThe efficient integration of LeasePlan is key in the success of ALD | LeasePlan’s strategy. Conducted by the industry’s best leadership team and people who share the same international culture and performance mindset  the integration of LeasePlan is fully on track.The Group’s first objectives were reached according to plan  allowing to confirm EUR 440 million annual run-rate synergies by 2026  evenly split between margin and procurement synergies on the one hand and cost synergies on the other hand.ALD | LeasePlan expects that a substantial share of procurement synergies will stem from price and bonus improvement (c. 25% of total procurement synergies from price and bonus improvement on vehicles)  while steering and cost control would also be strong sources of procurement synergies.With “PowerUP 2026”  ALD | LeasePlan will build the most efficient scalable global operating platform and derive cost synergies from efficiency improvements in the operating processes  IT cost savings as well as direct spend savings  including on real estate. As an illustration  IT cost per vehicle would be reduced by c. 20%  while fleet / FTE8 ratio would improve by 15% in 2026 compared to 2022.By 2026  ALD | LeasePlan will improve its Cost / Income ratio (excluding Used Car Sales results) to best-in-class level of c. 52%  from 56%9 in 2022.ResponsibilityESG and risk management are at the core of ALD | LeasePlan’s strategy and drive every one of the Group’s actions.ALD | LeasePlan will continue leading the way to sustainable mobility by always advising its clients about the greenest way. As a result  it targets EVs to attain 50% of new car registrations by 2026  a strong increase from 28% in 2022. By providing end-to-end solutions  the Group makes it simple for clients to choose electric and targets that 400 000 drivers will connect to its eMSP10 joint venture with ChargePoint  to be launched by the end of 2023.“PowerUP 2026” contains ambitious decarbonization objectives. ALD | LeasePlan plans to sharply decrease the CO 2 emissions of its running fleet to less than 90g/km11 on average by 2026 vs. 112g in 2022 and to decrease its internal CO 2 emissions12 by -35% in 2026 vs. 2019. ALD | LeasePlan’s people make the difference and therefore the company targets to maintain a high employee engagement rate of 75% in 2026.Meanwhile  the Group will continue managing its risks responsibly  to ensure a strong and resilient performance over the long term. Its risk management lays on solid foundations  with a robust governance framework  the leverage of its parent Societe Generale’s best-in-class policies and resources  as well as stronger risk management practices aligned with the Financial Holding Company regulated status and supervision by the European Central Bank.ALD | LeasePlan has a strong framework in place to manage residual value risk  its largest risk  throughout the asset’s life cycle. Additionally  its global multi-channel remarketing platform (600 000 vehicles sold p.a.  access to a large range of buyers in 36 countries  of which 24 000 active traders) together with growing multi-cycle lease capabilities are efficient operational risk mitigants.ProfitabilityThe combination of ALD and LeasePlan is highly synergetic. With “PowerUP 2026”  ALD | LeasePlan targets to achieve 13% to 15% Return on Tangible Equity13 (ROTE) by 2026  a level at the high end of the financial sector. High capital generation will contribute to a robust capital position  with target Core Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio at c. 12%. Furthermore  ALD | LeasePlan targets a dividend payout ratio of 50%14 throughout the 2023-2026 period  thus providing attractive returns to shareholders.Financial targets to 2026ALD | LeasePlan’s operating environment changed abruptly over the recent years. The Group anticipates that inflation will remain high in 2023 before it gradually normalizes in 2024. Interest rates are expected to peak in 2023 and remain at a high level  leading to modest GDP growth in Western Europe. After a couple of years of disruptions in supply and logistic chains  new car production in Europe would normalize starting 2024 towards 2026. The shift to higher-value Electric Vehicles is expected to accelerate.The Group applies the IFRS 3 “Business combinations” standard  whereby a Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) exercise is conducted. This exercise is currently ongoing. ALD | LeasePlan expects that the identification and recognition at fair value of acquired assets and liabilities will be completed by end 2023. Main items covered comprise the valuation of:LeasePlan vehicles’ cash flows;Intangible assets relating to customer relationships.Limited impacts are expected from this PPA exercise on the opening balance sheet:Balance sheet: limited impact given the similarities between ALD and LeasePlan’s approaches to vehicles valuation;CET 1 capital: limited impact from upfront gain related to UCS depreciation curve alignment and intangible assets recognition;Income statement: prudent UCS profit assumed for the purpose of the PPA. For ALD in 2026  assumptions are at c. 20% of the 2023 anticipated level (before the impact of reduction in depreciation costs).ALD | LeasePlan’s financial objectives to 2026 reflect the company’s ambition to grow its activity strongly throughout the period  while substantially improving its operating efficiency to best-in-class levels and maintaining robust solvency levels.Earning Assets CAGR of 6% between 2023 and 2026;Total annual pre-tax synergies confirmed at EUR 440 million by 2026  with progressive ramp-up: EUR 120 million by 2024  EUR 350 million by 2025  and the full amount of EUR 440 million by 2026;Total cumulated costs to achieve of EUR 525 million over 2022-2025. After EUR 128 million accounted for in 2022  ALD | LeasePlan expects these costs to reach a peak in 2023 and 2024 (EUR 170 million and EUR 190 million respectively)  before they go down to EUR 37 million in 2025;Cost / income ratio (excluding Used Car Sales results) of c. 52% in 2026  from 56% 15 in 2022. The improvement is explained by:in 2022. The improvement is explained by: Margin increase (inflation on car prices and fleet growth): -9 percentage points;Synergies: -10 percentage points  only partially balanced byCosts related to capital and liquidity optimization  regulatory and funding: +5 percentage points;Inflation on overheads and cost of regulation: +10 percentage points.At c. 52% in 2026  ALD | LeasePlan’s Cost / Income positions as best-in-class  allowing ALD | LeasePlan to decisively widen the gap with competitors and reinforce its financial profile.The deviation from the previous guidance of 47%  issued on 29 November 2022  is explained by higher inflation and LeasePlan IT costs that are currently being reviewed as part of ALD | LeasePlan’s global digital architecture definition;Return on Tangible Equity in the range of 13%-15% in 2026  at the high end of the financial sector;Target CET1 ratio at 12% and Total Capital ratio at 16%;Dividend payout ratio at 50%.Thanks to LeasePlan  the Group has access to a significant base of deposits  amounting to EUR 11 billion as at 30 June 2023  thereby strongly increasing the diversification of its funding sources. Funding from parent Societe Generale  bonds and retail deposits would each account for between 25% and 30% of total funding  while securitization and commercial loans would represent c. 10% each.An established issuer on the market  ALD | LeasePlan has the best credit ratings among multi-brand car leasing player: Moody’s A1  Standard & Poor’s A- and Fitch A-. The Group expects to issue annually EUR 4-5 billion bonds through ALD S.A.  EUR 1-1.5 billion securitization while increasing its retail deposits base by c. EUR 1 billion p.a.On successful completion of “PowerUP 2026”  ALD | LeasePlan will shape the future of mobility and address fast-growing markets from a clear leadership position  combining undisputed industry leadership  best position to capture growth and lead the transition to sustainable mobility  best-in-class operating efficiency  robust financial profile and strong track record of high profitability through the cycle.Further details around ALD | LeasePlan’s strategic targets will be presented on 21 September 2023  when ALD | LeasePlan holds its Capital Markets Day.About ALD | LeasePlan’s Capital Markets DayDate: 21 September 2023  at 14.00 Paris time (13.00 London time)Speakers:Tim Albertsen  CEOJohn Saffrett  Deputy CEOBerno Kleinherenbrink  Deputy CEOPatrick Sommelet  Deputy CEO and CFOWebcast: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/cx7n2y8wAgenda21 September 2023: Capital Markets Day presentationCapital Markets Day presentation 3 November 2023: Trading update and Q3 resultsTrading update and Q3 results 8 February 2024: Q4 and FY 2023 resultsPress contactALD Automotive | LeasePlanStephanie JonvilleALD Communication DepartmentTel.: +33 (0)6 46 14 81 90stephanie.jonville@aldautomotive.comAboutALD | LeasePlanALD | LeasePlan is a leading global sustainable mobility player providing full-service leasing  flexible subscription services  fleet management services and multi-mobility solutions to a client base of large corporates  SMEs  professionals and private individuals.

Capital build-up will be a priority to increase the Group’s flexibility and long-term competitiveness.1. Enhance stewardship of capitalSocieteGeneralewill build capital to a targetCET 1 level of 13% in 2026 under Basel IV2  with a minimum level based on a buffer of 200 basis points above requirements.In addition to a disciplined business portfolio management  Societe Generale will use the following levers to achieve this target:Limited organic Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) growth below 1% per annum on average from 2024 to 2026 based on stricter capital allocation  Boursorama and ALD being the only beneficiaries;Proactive risk transfer of capital and development of capital partnerships;Increased capital generation through improved operational efficiency;A distribution policy with a payout ratio between 40% and 50% of reported net income3 from 2023  with a balanced distribution mix between cash dividend and share buybacks from 2024. A distribution of excess capital will be considered once the CET 1 target is reached.On top of the organic capital generation  the capital trajectory includes regulatory impacts (of which Basel IV for circa 85 basis points2 and remaining regulatory impact in 2023 for circa 50 basis points)  the impact of organic RWA growth and other impacts based on prudent assumptions on various items4.The Group phased-in CET1 ratio is expected above 12% in Q1 2025  around 13% at end 2025 and 13% at end 2026. The Group RWA should be above EUR 420bn at end 2026.With this strict capital discipline  businesses will grow differently mainly through increased advisory and self-financed RWA growth within an expected annual revenue growthof between 0% and 2%(CAGR 2022-2026).2. Streamline business portfolioSocieteGenerale will shape a consistent  simplified and integrated business model  anchored in the Group’s core franchises.This will be achieved by deploying strict portfolio management criteria: consistency with the ESG imperative  accretive to Group profitability  material Group synergies  limited exposure to tail-risks  and leading franchises in attractive markets.3. Improve operational efficiencyIn 2026  SocieteGenerale targets a cost-to-income ratio below 60% with linear improvement from 2024.Driven by tangible levers already identified  the Group aims to reach gross savings of circa EUR 1.7bn by 2026 (vs. 2022)  of which circa 40% will be of new gross savings. This includes the delivery of ongoing plans (in particular the merger of the French networks and the savings synergies from the integration of LeasePlan)  as well as an improvement in IT efficiency and a leaner organisation.Leveraging on a platform-based strategy  the improvement in IT efficiency will represent circa EUR 0.6bn of the total gross savings while ensuring an improved business impact.The decrease in cost-to-income between 2022 and 2026 will be driven by total expected gross savings for -600 basis points  the end of Single Resolution Funds (circa -300 basis point)  the reduction of transformation charges (between -200 and -250 basis points)  compensating the impact of inflation and other impacts (between +450 and +500 basis points).These various projects will lead to circa EUR 1bn of transformation charges over 2024-2026  which will be borne by the businesses.4. Maintain best-in-class risk managementOn the back of a sound risk profile  SocieteGenerale expects a net cost of risk between 25 and 30 basis points over the 2024-2026 period  within a stable risk appetite.The Group will maintain a clear and consistent credit risk management: prudent origination policy  diversification and low concentration risk  stable market risk appetite  and comprehensive tail-risk monitoring. The risk framework encompasses a holistic approach to risk management including environmental  social and non-financial risks.FOSTERHIGH-PERFORMANCE  SUSTAINABLE BUSINESSESThe Group’s strategy aims to foster high-performance  sustainable businesses in order to ensure a sustainable performance over time.5. Excel at what we doIn a world of change  Societe Generale will capture client value thanks to a client-centered model.The Group will benefit from the strong positioning of its franchises on megatrends to pursue long-term growth through solution-driven expert advisory and financing.With clients at the center of the value creation process  the Group intends to shape asimplified  integrated and synergetic business model  bringing businesses closer together and boosting cross-selling.The Group will scale up its value proposition by combining in-house expertise and external partnerships  providing cutting edge solution-driven expert advisory. Digital capabilities will be further developed supporting an increasing contribution of digital sales to the Group revenues  a lower cost-to-serve  and expected run-rate value creation from data and artificial intelligence of circa EUR 500m by 20265.6.

That compared with a lowest early offer at about $275 and most offers higher at $280-$285  with Russian supplies not thought to be aggressively offered  they said.Russian pricing continued to cause uncertainty  with an unofficial minimum export price seeming to be applied to a varying extent.There was speculation about whether a recent purchase by Egyptian state buyer GASC of about 480 000 tons could be sourced from EU origins  rather than Russia as initially planned  due to tensions over the Russian floor price.There was chatter that part of the sale could be sourced from France  while some volume may also be shipped from EU Black Sea states Romania and Bulgaria  traders said.Weekly EU data showed soft wheat exports so far this season from the bloc were 27% below the year-earlier level.Traders were also assessing an unclear export situation in war-torn Ukraine.A cargo vessel carrying grain has left the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk  a top government official said on Tuesday  as Kyiv tries to re-establish a direct Black Sea route for its exports.Ukraine also announced a complaint at the World Trade Organization against Poland  Hungary and Slovakia after the eastern EU states said they would maintain a ban on sales of Ukrainian grain despite an EU decision to lift the restriction.($1 = 0.9362 euros)(Reporting by Gus Trompiz in Paris and Michael Hogan in Hamburg; Editing by Pooja Desai)((gus.trompiz@thomsonreuters.com; +33 1 49 49 52 18; Reuters Messaging: gus.trompiz.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq  Inc.,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.01,negative,0.01,0.13,0.86,True,English,"['Paris wheat', 'exports', 'focus', 'big new French wheat sales', 'other Black Sea exporters', 'direct Black Sea route', 'competitive Black Sea supplies', 'unofficial minimum export price', 'EU Black Sea states', 'eastern EU states', 'December wheat BL2Z3', 'main Middle Eastern', 'North African importers', 'one German trader', 'lowest early offer', 'top government official', 'World Trade Organization', 'Russian floor price', 'unclear export situation', 'Weekly EU data', 'Algerian import tender', 'Egyptian state buyer', 'soft wheat exports', 'new sales', 'Russian supplies', 'Algerian tender', 'export competition', 'export demand', 'Euronext wheat', 'EU origins', 'EU decision', 'large sales', 'Russian pricing', 'EU market', 'hesitant session', 'welcome news', 'initial talk', 'most offers', 'varying extent', 'recent purchase', 'year-earlier level', 'cargo vessel', 'Ukrainian port', 'Michael Hogan', 'Pooja Desai', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'war-torn Ukraine', 'Ukrainian grain', 'Gus Trompiz', 'Reuters Messaging', 'Tuesday', 'traders', 'outcome', 'gauge', '237.50 euros', 'ton', '1600 GMT', 'signs', 'China', 'Monday', 'backdrop', 'prices', 'reports', 'time', 'OAIC', 'cost', 'freight', 'uncertainty', 'speculation', 'GASC', 'tensions', 'chatter', 'part', 'France', 'volume', 'Romania', 'Bulgaria', 'bloc', 'Chornomorsk', 'Kyiv', 'complaint', 'Poland', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'ban', 'restriction', '0.9362 euros', 'Hamburg', 'Editing', 'views', 'opinions', 'author', 'Nasdaq', 'Inc']",2023-09-19,2023-09-19,nasdaq.com
