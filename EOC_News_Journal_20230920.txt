As a participant in the Swift Partner Programme  this data hub will now be made accessible to all of the 11 500 financial institutions and financial market infrastructures connected to the Swift network via the Swift API Gateway.This collaboration marks a significant milestone in the journey towards helping corporates worldwide to effortlessly measure  report  and disclose ESG information to the Swift Community. Greenomy’s platform will reduce the ESG data collection and reporting burden for its users  allowing them to redirect their efforts towards implementing impactful sustainable finance initiatives with their corporate customers.Alexander Stevens  CEO of Greenomy  commented: ""We look forward to working with the Swift Community of twelve thousand financial institutions in enabling them to leverage the Greenomy platform not only to source ESG data for regulatory compliance  but also to pave the way for a more sustainable financial ecosystem  as capital will be more efficiently allocated to the sustainability transition projects of their customers.”In January 2022  Euroclear invested in the sustainable finance platform for an undisclosed sum  bringing the fintech’s reporting services into its network. Greenomy has since also signed a strategic partnership with Cerved  to deliver a new service on the Italian market designed to help Italian businesses comply with new EU Sustainable Finance regulations (EU Taxonomy  CSRD  and SFDR).During Sibos 2022  Greenomy’s CEO Alexander Stevens pitched on the SWIFT Innotribe stage  taking first place in the category of sustainability. At the time he stated: “It is a great honour to get the validation of our sustainability mission by major market infrastructures. We look forward to collaborating with SWIFT and its community.”",neutral,0.14,0.85,0.01,positive,0.69,0.29,0.02,True,English,"['Swift partner programme', 'Greenomy', 'new EU Sustainable Finance regulations', 'impactful sustainable finance initiatives', 'latest European mandatory frameworks', 'twelve thousand financial institutions', 'ESG reporting software provider', 'sustainable financial ecosystem', 'sustainable finance platform', 'financial market infrastructures', 'major market infrastructures', 'Swift Partner Programme', 'Swift API Gateway', 'SWIFT Innotribe stage', 'sustainability transition projects', 'ESG data collection', 'CEO Alexander Stevens', '11,500 financial institutions', 'new service', 'EU Taxonomy', 'international frameworks', 'Italian market', 'reporting capabilities', 'reporting burden', 'reporting services', 'ESG information', 'data hub', 'SaaS platform', 'comprehensive solution', 'significant milestone', 'regulatory compliance', 'undisclosed sum', 'strategic partnership', 'Italian businesses', 'first place', 'great honour', 'sustainability mission', 'Swift community', 'Swift network', 'corporate customers', 'Greenomy platform', 'collaboration', 'corporations', 'accordance', 'participant', 'journey', 'corporates', 'users', 'efforts', 'capital', 'January', 'Euroclear', 'fintech', 'Cerved', 'CSRD', 'SFDR', 'Sibos', 'category', 'time', 'validation']",2023-09-19,2023-09-20,finextra.com

According to NZ Super  the portfolio also outperformed its Treasury Bill return benchmark  a measure of the government’s cost of paying into the fund  by 8.1% or NZ$4.7 billion.“In FY 2022  equities and bonds both performed poorly—an uncommon scenario—and our active management strategies contributed significantly to our final result ” said Matt Whineray  CEO of the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation  which manages NZ Super  in a release. “This year  global equities performed very well  and the Super Fund slightly underperformed the reference portfolio.”“What matters to a long-term investor like us is total fund performance over time ” Whineray said in the release. “Over the life of the Super Fund  our active investment strategies have generated NZ$15.1 billion more than a passive  index-linked strategy would have achieved.”The pension fund also reported five- and 10-year annualized returns of 7.98% and 10.75%  respectively.Whineray said the pension fund will continue to be heavily weighted to equities but added that “where we see an opportunity to diversify  optimize risk settings and add value through active investment strategies  we will take it.” He also said that despite the strong performance during the fiscal year  the global investing environment ahead remains a challenge.“Core inflation remains high in many markets  leaving open the possibility of further interest rate rises ” Whineray said in the release. “At the very least  it would seem any decrease in interest rates may be more gradual and further away than might have been expected Our expectation is that will lead to lower returns overall as central banks prioritize reducing inflation over fostering economic growth.”Guardians Chair Catherine Drayton said a search for a successor for Whineray  who announced his retirement earlier this year  is underway and that the board hopes to make an announcement later in the year.Related Stories:New Zealand Super Fund Reports -6.99% Loss in Fiscal 2021New Zealand Super Fund CEO Will Step Down at End of YearNZ Super Acquires 5% Stake in Belgium’s EuroclearTags: Catherine Drayton  Fiscal Year  global equities  Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation  Matt Whineray  New Zealand Super Fund,neutral,0.05,0.95,0.01,negative,0.02,0.27,0.71,True,English,"['Global Equities Rebound', '11.87% Return', 'The New Zealand Superannuation Fund', 'New Zealand Super Fund Reports', 'New Zealand Super Fund CEO', 'Treasury Bill return benchmark', 'Guardians Chair Catherine Drayton', 'The pension fund', 'year-end record high', 'active management strategies', 'passive, index-linked strategy', 'active investment strategies', '10-year annualized returns', 'global investing environment', 'total fund performance', 'benchmark portfolio', 'lower returns', 'investment portfolio', 'strong rebound', 'significant improvement', 'uncommon scenario', 'final result', 'long-term investor', 'risk settings', 'strong performance', 'many markets', 'interest rate', 'central banks', 'economic growth', 'Euroclear Tags', 'global equities', 'reference portfolio', 'last year', 'fiscal year', 'asset value', 'Core inflation', 'Matt Whineray', '11.87% return', '12.03% return', 'taxes', 'measure', 'government', 'cost', 'FY', 'bonds', 'release', 'time', 'life', 'opportunity', 'challenge', 'possibility', 'decrease', 'expectation', 'search', 'successor', 'retirement', 'board', 'announcement', 'Stories', '99% Loss', '5% Stake', 'Belgium']",2023-09-19,2023-09-20,ai-cio.com

Photograph: Cyril ByrneTomorrow marks CRH’s last day on the Irish Stock Exchange. Long the most valuable company on the Irish market  the building materials giant is leaving and will make its US stock market debut next Monday.CRH is one of many leaving the Irish market  with 21 companies having departed over the last five years. Over the same period  just five have joined.Smurfit Kappa will soon be the 22nd company to leave  while many expect Paddy Power owner Flutter to follow suit sooner rather than later. Other potential leavers  the Department of Finance noted in a recent report  include food companies Kerry and Glanbia as well as building materials group Kingspan.Understandably concerned  Euronext Dublin has called on the Government to scrap the 1 per cent stamp duty paid when buying shares in Ireland  saying it badly disadvantages the Irish market compared with jurisdictions like Britain and the US.READ MOREScrapping stamp duty will hardly stem the tide  however. The simple reality is companies “want to gravitate towards a market that has much more liquidity and higher ratings”  as Smurfit Kappa boss Tony Smurfit put it last week.Much research confirms this point about higher valuations. A 2015 Federal Reserve paper found companies cross-listing in a more “prestigious” market enjoy “significant valuation gains” over the following five-year period.Separate research shows companies tend to significantly outperform in the year before listing. CRH shares  up 34 per cent in 2023  are following this pattern.

It serves to recognise the hard work of our teams day-to-day and our ability to win new market share in an environment still favouring our solutions.During the first half  we also strengthened our equity and cash position thanks to a successful capital increase of €6.1m in June as part of the transfer of our shares to Euronext Growth® Paris. We therefore have the financial resources to meet our ambitions. To this end  in July  we completed the acquisition of Amzair Industrie which will enhance our premium solutions and integrate all added value by controlling the value chain  from design through to distribution.This first-half performance fully aligns with our growth trajectory as we target revenue in excess of €100m by 2025 and EBITDA margin of more than 5%.""Solid results in H1 2023: double-digit growth in EBITDAIn the first half of 2023  the Airwell Group (Euronext Growth  ALAIR)  supplier and creator of smart energy ecosystems  generated consolidated revenue of €32.5m  up 12.8% year-on-year. This growth was driven by the residential market  with demand still sustained  notably in sales for Air-Water Heat Pumps which doubled over the period.France remained the Group's leading market  with 47% of total revenue (up 23.3%)  while exports also rose substantially  particularly in Northern and Eastern Europe.Gross margin totalled €10.1m  up 9.8% on the same period a year earlier. It accounted for 31.1% of revenue versus 31.9% in H1 2022  reflecting a change in the product mix. This indicator illustrates how the Group is able to maintain margins despite an inflationary environment.During the period  the Group continued developing its training course (Airwell Academy) as well as new offers (Leezy  Hybrid House). As a result  marketing and commercial costs respectively totalled€1.1m (+46.1%) and €4.0m (+10.7%). Supply chain and distribution costs returned to a more normal amount of €1.4m (vs. €1.8m in H1 2022). Lastly  overheads amounted to €1.9m (vs. €1.5m) with €0.3m non-recurring costs (one-off fees).EBITDA[3] grew at almost the same pace as revenue to €1.8m in H1 2023  versus €1.6m exactly a year earlier  representing an increase of 10.0%.After depreciation and amortisation  EBIT[4] stood at €1.6m  up 15.8% year-on-year from €1.3m. Operating margin totalled 4.8% for H1 2023 (vs. 4.7% in H1 2022).Net financial loss was -€0.4m  including interest on the €5m bond issue with Delta AM in January 2023.After accounting corporate income tax (€0.3m)  net profit totalled €1.0m (vs. €0.9m in H1 2022)  with a net margin of 3.0%.Financial structure strengthened by recent capital raisingAt 30 June 2023  Airwell's equity amounted to €10.3m versus €3.9m at 31 December 2022  strengthened by the gross capital increase of €6.1m issued in June as part of the transfer of Group shares to Euronext Growth® Paris. This new stock market listing will increase Airwell's visibility among investors and the liquidity of the share.As of 30 June 2023  cash flow from operating activities of integrated companies remained solid at €1.2m (vs. €1.3m at end-June 2022).Cash flow from operating activities totalled €(4.9)m at end-June 2023  compared to €0.0m on 30 June 2022. This reflected a €(6.1)m change in WCR (working capital requirement)  due to a one-time effect on inventories (significant build-up of Air-Water Heat Pumps combined with peak season at end-June) and an increase in trade receivables (increased invoicing at the end of the period). WCR has since returned to more normal levels.Cash flow from investing activities amounted to €(0.9)m (with €(0.3)m in investments and €(0.6)m in changes in financial assets versus €0.6m at 30 June 2022 (reflecting exceptional income from the disposal of the Johnson brand).Cash flow from financing activities totalled €9.4m (vs. €(2.1)m at 30 June 2022)  including the capital increase (€6.1m gross) and the €5m bond issue. Also note that a bank loan of €0.9m was repaid during the period.Gross financial debt was €7.8m (vs. €3.8m at 31 December 2022). Net debt remained under full control  amounting to €2.3m at end-June 2023 (vs. €1.8m at 31 December 2022).Recent acquisition to continue accelerating development and control the value chainIn the second half of 2023  the Group intends to continue capitalising on commercial momentum in its buoyant markets while continuing to invest in the deployment of new  innovative and distinctive solutions that combine products and services.Most recently  the Group announced it had acquired the assets of Amzair Industrie – renamed Airwell Industrie – a French designer and manufacturer of high-end connected heat pumps for residential and tertiary buildings  consolidated in Airwell's financial statements since 1 July 2023[5].This transaction falls squarely within the Group's growth strategy  as it gradually seeks to control the value chain  from the design through to the production of a premium connected solution with a low carbon footprint. As such  Airwell will integrate 1 Made in France plant including 15 production staff as well as strengthening its technological capabilities with four new HVAC and AI engineers and enhancing its salesforce (two additional sales representatives). The synergies achieved will help the Group to create value in the years ahead  bolstering the ramp-up in new service offerings.All told  for the fiscal year 2023 the Group is targeting double-digit growth in revenue as in the first half. After a third quarter expected stable  notably owing to the temporary slowdown in French overseas territories (reorganisation of a distributor in the Antilles)  there should be a marked acceleration in growth in the latter part of the year.Besides  the Group reiterates its targets for 2025 which were recently raised  namely revenue in excess of €100m and EBITDA margin of more than 5%.Next publication: Revenue for the third quarter of 2023: Monday 6 November 2023  after market close.About AirwellFounded in 1947 in France  Airwell is the leading French designer of heat pumps in the field of climatic and thermal engineering.

However  the emergence and spread of hypervirulent and multi-resistant strains of this bacterium have recently extended its potential targets to people with no health problems.In Western countries  we estimate that between 3% and 5% of pneumonias are linked to an infection caused by K. pneumoniae. Worldwide  K. pneumoniae is responsible for 11.8% of hospital-acquired pneumonia. In high-risk patients (alcoholics and septicemics)  the mortality rate associated with this kind of infection is between 50 and 100%1. The incidence of K. pneumoniae resistances is evaluated between 90-100 000 patients in the US and EU52  mainly in Urinary Tract infections and Respiratory Tract infections.Recent studies in Europe and the United States3 4 also revealed the existence of K. pneumoniae strains with an exceptionally high level of antimicrobial resistance  making them even more difficult to treat. The results of these studies demonstrated a worrying trend among the samples collected  which may even be resistant to enzyme-inhibiting antibiotics that have recently been developed but have not yet been marketed. This level of antimicrobial resistance in K. pneumoniae strains had never been observed before.Selected phages will be evaluated on a wide range of infections in which PHAXIAM already benefits from considerable expertise  such as lung  blood and urinary tract infections. This will enable the Company to capitalize on preclinical models validated with its three historical phage families  mutualize certain developments within the same indication and accelerate the progression to clinical phases.Thibaut du Fayet  Chief Executive Officer of PHAXIAM Therapeutics  stated: “With the launch of this new program  PHAXIAM Therapeutics deploys its strategy in line with the plan presented during the merger  and reaffirms its position at the forefront of the fight against antimicrobial resistance. K. pneumoniae bacteria represents a new target with a high medical need  affecting a large population worldwide  and for which antibiotics offer only a limited therapeutic solution. Our anti-Klebsiella phages will thus complement an already extended phage portfolio for the clinical indications we are targeting  and reinforce our ability to efficiently address a broad spectrum of resistant bacterial infections.”About PHAXIAM TherapeuticsPHAXIAM is a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for resistant bacterial infections  which are responsible for many serious infections. The company is building on an innovative approach based on the use of phages  natural bacterial-killing viruses. PHAXIAM is developing a portfolio of phages targeting 3 of the most resistant and dangerous bacteria  which together account for more than two-thirds of resistant hospital-acquired infections: Staphylococcus aureus  Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.PHAXIAM is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States (ticker: PHXM – to be modified to a new symbol) and on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0011471135  ticker: PHXM).

That’s according to experts at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting (TAA) who are on hand to discuss the changes due to legislation called the Secure Act 2.0  passed on December 29  2022.The Secure 2.0 Act is an addition to the enactment of the Secure Act in December 2019  which had also imposed a variety of related retirement plan changes. This legislation introduced significant changes to retirement plans including rules altering the age for RMDs  among other guidelines that impact retirement accounts and subsequently personal finances.Due to the legislation passing at year-end 2022  being effective January 2023  the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has received feedback from retirement plan administrators that they have not had enough time to properly adjust their systems to comply with the new requirements. The IRS has also been advised that many recipients of inherited Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) were not aware the RMDs were to be made ratably over the 10-year distribution period and had already missed some distributions when the IRS guidance requiring ratable distributions was issued. The IRS has  therefore  issued further clarifying guidance to address these issues.Why:September 30  2023 is the deadline to rollover mischaracterized required minimum distributions and avoid current taxation for people aged 72. Penalty relief is available for certain inherited IRA recipients who failed to make required minimum distributions in 2021  2022  and 2023. Starting in 2023  lower penalties apply for persons who failed to take required minimum distributions.Expert Voice: Mark Luscombe  JD  LL.M  CPA  Principal Analyst for Wolters Kluwer TAA  is available to discuss the immediate and longer-term impact of these retirement plan changes.Details: The Secure 2.0 legislation and IRS guidance has changed RMD requirements for IRAs in several ways. Taxpayers and their advisors need to be aware of these changes to avoid possible penalties for failure to take required distributions. Recipients of mischaracterized RMDs may be unaware that their right to rollover those distributions and avoid taxation expires on September 30  2023.1. Mischaracterized Required Minimum DistributionsThe required age for beginning RMDs was increased from 72 to 73  and IRA owners are no longer required to begin taking RMDs at age 72. Given these age-based changes  plan administrators may have mischaracterized clients’ distributions in early 2023 as RMDs. The IRS is permitting impacted taxpayers who received a mischaracterized single-sum distribution from their retirement account(s) between January 1  2023 and July 31  2023 an extended rollover period that ends September 30  2023.2. Beneficiary Required Minimum DistributionsNon-spousal beneficiaries not entitled to use the lifetime or life expectancy payment exceptions for an inherited IRA now must begin taking RMDs ratably over a 10-year period beginning in the year of the IRA owner’s death. This nullifies the beneficiary’s ability to refrain from receiving distributions until the 10th year when the original IRA owner had commenced IRA distributions during lifetime. Many taxpayers and tax advisors had assumed that the distributions could be taken in the 10th year and had failed to take RMDs in 2020 and 2021. The IRS is now providing penalty relief for failure to make required RMDs for 2021  2022  and 2023 for IRA owners who died in 2020  2021  or 2022.3. Lower PenaltiesStarting in 2023  the penalty for failure to take RMDs has been lowered to 25 percent from 50 percent  with a possible reduction to 10 percent if corrective action is taken within two years after the year of the missed RMD. The IRS has indicated that it will continue to consider requests for waiver of the penalty for reasonable cause shown.Contact: To arrange interviews with Mark Luscombe or other federal and state tax experts from Wolters Kluwer TAA on this or any other tax-related topics  please contact Shannon Wherry.Wolters Kluwer TAA enables tax and accounting professionals and businesses of all sizes to drive productivity  navigate change  and deliver better outcomes.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG.

However  the emergence and spread of hypervirulent and multi-resistant strains of this bacterium have recently extended its potential targets to people with no health problems.In Western countries  we estimate that between 3% and 5% of pneumonias are linked to an infection caused by K. pneumoniae. Worldwide  K. pneumoniae is responsible for 11.8% of hospital-acquired pneumonia. In high-risk patients (alcoholics and septicemics)  the mortality rate associated with this kind of infection is between 50 and 100%1. The incidence of K. pneumoniae resistances is evaluated between 90-100 000 patients in the US and EU52  mainly in Urinary Tract infections and Respiratory Tract infections.Recent studies in Europe and the United States3 4 also revealed the existence of K. pneumoniae strains with an exceptionally high level of antimicrobial resistance  making them even more difficult to treat. The results of these studies demonstrated a worrying trend among the samples collected  which may even be resistant to enzyme-inhibiting antibiotics that have recently been developed but have not yet been marketed. This level of antimicrobial resistance in K. pneumoniae strains had never been observed before.Selected phages will be evaluated on a wide range of infections in which PHAXIAM already benefits from considerable expertise  such as lung  blood and urinary tract infections. This will enable the Company to capitalize on preclinical models validated with its three historical phage families  mutualize certain developments within the same indication and accelerate the progression to clinical phases.Thibaut du Fayet  Chief Executive Officerof PHAXIAM Therapeutics  stated: “With the launch of this new program  PHAXIAM Therapeutics deploys its strategy in line with the plan presented during the merger  and reaffirms its position at the forefront of the fight against antimicrobial resistance. K. pneumoniae bacteria represents a new target with a high medical need  affecting a large population worldwide  and for which antibiotics offer only a limited therapeutic solution. Our anti-Klebsiella phages will thus complement analready extended phage portfolio for the clinical indicationswe are targeting and reinforce our ability to efficiently address a broad spectrum of resistant bacterial infections.”About PHAXIAM TherapeuticsPHAXIAM is a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for resistant bacterial infections  which are responsible for many serious infections. The company is building on an innovative approach based on the use of phages  natural bacterial-killing viruses.

In line with its expectations for the year  the Group is enjoying a sustained level of business activity  even if the ongoing supply difficulties for certain components continue to limit production with a backlog of around ten million at end June 2023.Over the first half of 2023  against a background of high inflation and a difficult labour market  EBITDA generated by ACTIA Group's continuing operations nevertheless rose by 3.3% to €20.7 million  or 7.2% of revenue. The effect of seasonality on sales  particularly for the SatCom business  is expected to create a significant improvement in the second half of 2023.You will recall that ACTIA Group disposed of two non-strategic businesses in 2022 in order to concentrate its resources on embedded electronics for mobility and the management of energy  as well as strengthening its financial structure; gearing has thus been reduced to 156.1% compared with 218.4% at end June 2022. The disposals  coupled with ACTIA's ongoing efforts to adapt to the current environment  also contributed to the strong growth of operating income to €7.6 million  or 2.6% of revenue  compared to €3.5 million at end June 2022  or just 1.4% of revenue.On 13 September 2023  ACTIA Group and Diadem  the parent company of STEEL Electronique  announced that they had entered into exclusive discussions to study the terms of merger with this Toulouse high-tech in the field of Space. The transaction  stillsubject to negotiation  would make it possible to create a leading industrial entity as a supplier of embedded electronics  essentially as a Tier 2 supplier in the areas of Aeronautics  Space and NewSpace  and Telecommunications (ground and embedded space systems).Looking forward to 2025  the solid growth prospects for its portfolio of customers  as well as ACTIA Group's order book  continue to justify a revenue target in excess of €800 million  independently from any acquisition. For 2023  ACTIA continues to forecast revenue growth of more than 15%.The interim financial statements for 2023 (1 January to 30 June 2023) were approved by the Board at the meeting held on 18 September 2023.EBITDA: Net income + tax + impairment of goodwill + interest and financial charges + provisions for depreciation +/- derivative financial instruments.Total EBITDA (including both continuing and discontinued operations) serves as the basis for calculating debt leverage ratios.2023 CONSOLIDATED HALF-YEARLY RESULTSRevenue and activity by division for the period were covered in the press release of 2 August 2023.At 30 June 2023  ACTIA's total consolidated revenue amounted to €288.7 million  up 16.2% compared with the first half of 2022. With the exception of the SatCom and Aftermarket businesses (disposal in April 2022 of the Technical Inspection and garage equipment activities)  all segments have progressed. The Automotive Division represented 85.4% of the Group's half-yearly revenues  a total of €246.6 million  up by 15.3% despite an unfavourable basis of comparison with the end of the light vehicle telematics contract having a negative impact on revenue of €11.7 million over the half year. The division generated EBITDA of €19.0 million  which grew by 8.6% even taking into account the measures taken in the first half to create a 'natural' hedge (by increasing sales in USD in the Euro zone) which were not enough  however  to fully offset the impact of the EUR/USD exchange rate on a strongly growing business. The Telecoms Division represented 14.5% of the Group's half-yearly revenues  a total of €41.9 million  up by 21.1%. The division generated EBITDA of €1.3 million  which declined by 56.9% due to the product mix over the period. Invoicing by the SatCom business is expected to be higher at the end of the year  thus helping to absorb the division's fixed costs.ACTIA Group generated EBITDA from continuing operations of €20.7 million  an increase of 3.3%. The EBITDA margin was 7.2%. The increase in the value of the dollar had a negative impact of €3.7 million on first half 2023 EBITDA  a cost the natural hedging strategy could partially offset. Purchases consumed  at 55.4% of production over the period  or the same level as in 2022  were kept under control in view of the increase in revenue. This reflected an easing in the supply difficulties. However  production capacity was still affected by shortages in some families of components  reducing the efficiency of the manufacturing base. Furthermore  the increase in payroll costs  brought about by both an increase in headcount to 3 953 at end June 2023 from 3 729 at end December 2022  and in wages  was not sufficient to cover labour requirements. Thus  in a labour market that remained difficult in certain key regions for the Group  the use of outsourcing resulted in an increase in external charges of €7.9 million to €37.9 million. They also included €1.4 million in non-recurrent expenses for the old light vehicle telematics contract.Progress in the R&D programmes resulted in a slight decrease in the rate of capitalisation and the research tax credit remaining stable at €2.3 million. R&D headcount at end June had grown to 1 398 from 1 342 at end December 2022. First half R&D commitments  at €42.3 million  of which 36.9% reinvoiced  46.3% expensed and 16.8% capitalised  were up €1.5 million  or 3.6% compared with June 2022. They reflect the high level of R&D activity arising from the commercial successes of the past few years that ensure the Group's organic growth and from the redesigns undertaken to adapt to the components market.Provisions for depreciation  at €13.0 million  were down by €2.4 million due mainly to the end of the period for depreciation of the capital expenditure programme in 2017-2019 and lower levels of capitalisation. With a view to optimising its profitability  the Group continued to focus essentially on the programmes linked to signed contracts. After non-recurrent expenses of €0.5 million  ACTIA more than doubled its operating income to €7.6 million for the first half of 2023 from €3.5 million for the same period in 2022.The financial result for the first half of 2023 was a negative €1.5 million. It consisted of €3.5 million in interest and financial charges  the €1.4 million increase of which was caused by a rise in variable rates on short-term borrowings and the medium-term loans taken out over the past two years: the average interest rate increased from 1.49% at end June 2022 to 2.97%  including State guaranteed loans  at end June 2023. The balance of €2.0 million in other financial income/expense  reflects the favourable valuation of the foreign exchange hedging instruments over the period. Net income - Group share amounted to €1.4 million for the first half of 2023  compared with a negative €8.1 million in 2022  partly thanks to the disposal of the Power Division.DEBT  CASH & BALANCE SHEETNet debt excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities stood at €191.3 million compared with €187.4 million at end December 2022. IFRS 16 lease liabilities amounted to €19.5 million. Gearing was 156.1% compared with 218.4% at end June 2022  before the disposals of non-strategic businesses. No significant new borrowings were made over the first half  but the Group's debt reduction programme was hampered by two non-recurrent cash disbursements for a total of €9.0 million (arbitrage of the disposal of the Power business  activation of a guarantee for the old light vehicle telematics contract for which ACTIA is pursuing its supplier and the regularisation of the cost of 3G licences following a three-way agreement with the customer and the supplier).The Group generated Free Cash Flow(1) from continuing operations of €7.5 million compared with €5.7 million at end June 2022  up by 31.6%. The business generated €15.6 million in cash. WCR had a positive impact of €1.8 million and collection of the research tax credit of €4.2 million made it possible to achieve a positive operating cash flow of €20.9 million compared with €4.2 million in the first half of 2022. This improvement was partially related to the disposal of the Power business as of 1 August 2022. The cash flow from operations covered capital expenditure  mainly an expense of €10.9 million  and one of €4.9 million for an adjustment of the selling price for the Power Division. Lastly  the Group distributed €2.4 million in June 2023 corresponding to the 2022 dividends  and also repaid borrowings amounting to €24.2 million.ACTIA had cash of €26.2 million at 30 June 2023  allowing it to meet its short-term maturities and 56.6% of its short-term lines of credit (excluding deconsolidating factoring) had been used at that date.2023 OUTLOOKWith a slight improvement in the supply of components by the end of the year  which should enable the factories to once again run smoothly  ACTIA maintains its annual growth target of over 15%  given sustained activity as in the second half of 2022. A considerable improvement in operational profitability is expected due to the seasonality of invoicing this year  particularly the Telecoms Division that will return to its normal cycle concerning the SatCom segment  and the overall satisfactory level of activity covering a greater portion of fixed costs. By continuing to focus on inventory levels and receivables  ACTIA Group plans to continue its actions to reduce the impact on WCR in a period of sustained growth.Based on the solidity of its order book of €444.0 million  up from €429.8 million at 30 June 2022  and its constantly reinforced portfolio of multi-year contracts  ACTIA Group aims to achieve revenue in excess of €800 million by end 2025. Future growth will go hand in hand with a new segmentation of the Group's business into 4 Divisions (Mobility  Energy  Aerospace  Engineering) in order to ensure greater clarity and visibility  and by the same token reinforce the potential for growth. It is also with this in mind that ACTIA Group has entered into discussions for a merger with STEEL Electronique in the Aerospace field  confirmation of its desire to develop in the NewSpace segment. The changes in segmentation will take place over the next three years.(1) Free Cash Flow: EBITDA - tax +/- changes in WCR - Capital expenditure………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………ABOUT ACTIAACTIA Group is a mid-market company (ETI) founded in 1986.

The shares will therefore return into the availability of their respective holders  without any charge or expense to their load.8. INTENTION TO TERMINATE TRADING OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SUBJECT TO THE OFFER  SELL-OUT PROCEDURE AND SQUEEZE-OUT RIGHTThe Offer consists of a partial voluntary public tender offer launched under Articles 102 and following of the TUF  and is not aimed at  nor will result in  the delisting of Growens' ordinary shares from Euronext Growth Milan.Given the nature and the subject of the Offer  the prerequisites for the application of the sell-out procedure under Article 108 of the TUF  nor the squeeze-out right under Article 111 of the TUF (as referred to in Article 14-bis of Growens' current bylaws)  do not apply.9. NON-APPLICABILITY OF THE OBLIGATION FOR A FULL TAKEOVER BID PURSUANT TO ARTICLES 106  PARAGRAPH 1 AND 3  LETTER B)  TUF  AND 46 OF THE ISSUERS REGULATIONIn case of full acceptance of the Offer  Growens will come to hold a total of 2 709 641 of its own shares  corresponding to approximately 17.603% of the subscribed and paid-up share capital.It should be recalled that  pursuant to Article 44-bis  paragraph 1  of the Issuers Regulation  in general  the treasury shares held by the Company  even indirectly  are excluded from the share capital for the calculation of the significant stake for the purposes of Article 106  paragraphs 1  1-bis  1-ter and 3  letter b)  of TUF concerning public tender offers.However  according to Article 44-bis  paragraph 2  of the Issuers' Regulation  the aforementioned provision does not apply if exceeding the thresholds indicated in Article 106  paragraphs 1  1-bis  1-ter  and 3  letter b)  of TUF results from purchases of treasury shares made  even indirectly  by the Company  pursuant to a resolution that has also been approved with the favorable vote of the majority of the shareholders of the Issuer present at the meeting  other than the shareholder or shareholders holding  even jointly  the majority stake  even relative  as long as it exceeds 10% (commonly known as ""whitewash"").Applying this whitewash mechanism  because the proposal for authorization to purchase treasury shares has been approved at today's GSMwith the majorities set forth in the aforementioned Article 44-bis  paragraph 2  of the Issuers Regulation  the shares purchased by the Company pursuant to said authorizing resolution will not be excluded from the share capital for calculating the relevant thresholds under Article 106  paragraph 3  of TUF and Article 46 of the Issuers Regulation.It is specified in this regard that  taking into account the holdings of the main shareholders of the Issuer (see the previous Paragraph 1.1 for reference)  as a result of the Offer no single shareholder (nor the shareholders party to the Shareholders' Agreement acting in concert) will exceed the relevant thresholds for the obligation to launch a full takeover bid pursuant to Article 106  paragraph 1 and paragraph 3  letter b) of TUF.10.

At end-June  ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) from SaaS subscriptions came in at €33.1m  reflecting continuous growth (up +70% versus end-June 2022).The EBITDA fell back (-10%) as a result of the effort to adapt sales force incentives to new sales models  the All Visiativ[1] programme  and international marketing investments for standardising the subsidiaries' brands. The EBITDA margin came to 6.8% in H1 2023.As a result of net disposal proceeds of €3.1m linked to the withdrawal from the IT infrastructure management business  net income (Group share) came in at €3.4m in H1 2023  versus €1.2m one year prior  i.e. an increase of +183%.While continuing to align its business model with the new strategic plan  dubbed SHIFT5 and due to be presented on 20 September 2023  Visiativ seeks to sustain its H2 2023 growth momentum  driven in particular by the acceleration in SaaS subscriptions revenues  and thus increase its profitability  benefiting the always more favourable seasonal effect in the 2nd half of the year.Data in €m - Limited auditaFrench accounting standards H1 2022(6 months) H1 2023(6 months) Change 2022(12 months) Revenue 110.4 122.6 +11% 258.8 EBITDAb 9.2 8.3 -10% 28.4 EBITDA margin % 8.3% 6.8% 11.0% Operating profit 4.5 3.7 -18% 19.0 Operating margin % 4.1% 3.0% 7.3% Non-operating income and expenses -1.2 -2.1 -3.2 Exceptional items 0.0 3.2 0.0 Net income (Group share) 1.2 3.4 +183% 11.1a The half-year financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting on 15 September 2023.

At constant scope and exchange rates  organic growth[2] came to +3% with  notably  an acceleration in Q2  when the Group returned to double-digit organic growth of +10%.International activity (35% of business) continued to be a growth engine for the Group  with €43.4m in H1 revenue generated outside France  an increase of +16% (of which +6% organic).Visiativ's two businesses fuelled growth in H1 2023: +9% for SOFTWARE  with a further strong increase in SaaS subscriptions revenues of +85%  which now account for 22% of the SOFTWARE business's activity versus 13% one year prior  and +15% for the CONSULTING business  responding to growing needs in innovation and cybersecurity.Recurring business accounted for 66% of total sales  driven by the transformation models towards subscription  in line with Visiativ's strategic ambitions and the gradual shift in its sales model towards SaaS.At end-June 2023  ARR from SaaS subscriptions totalled €33.1m  versus €19.4m at end-June 2022  representing growth of +70%  and versus €27.4m at end-December  i.e. sequential organic growth of +21%.HALF-YEAR EBITDA MARGIN OF 6.8% - ALIGNMENT OF THE GROUP AND ITS MODEL BEFORE THE LAUNCH OF THE NEW STRATEGIC PLANThe H1 2023 EBITDA[3] came in at €8.3m  down -€0.9m versus H1 2022. This decline was mainly due to:An increase in personnel costs (+€12.7m) from one half-year to the next  due to the companies that have joined the Group in recent months  particularly outside France (MB CAD  Braithwaite  Daxium  Absiskey)  and changes in the sales force incentive model  which is now based on order intake (bookings);An increase in purchases and external costs  following marketing investments made to standardise brands in the scope of the Group's international expansion (United Kingdom  Germany  Benelux  Switzerland)  and the escalation of investments linked to the CSR policy and the All Visiativ programme  focused on the employee experience.The Group's EBITDA margin thus came in at 6.8%  versus 8.3% one year prior  which was a record level for a first half-year. Reminder: given the seasonal nature of Visiativ's business  this half-year EBITDA margin is not representative of the profitability level expected for the full year (EBITDA margin of 11.0% in FY 2022).In France  Visiativ generated an EBITDA margin of 7.0% versus 7.2% in H1 2022  as a result of changes in the sales force incentive model.Outside France  Visiativ's EBITDA margin came to 6.5% versus 10.5% in H1 2022  taking into account the marketing investments.NET INCOME UP +183% TO €3.4MAfter accounting for net depreciation  amortization and provisions  the H1 operating income amounted to €3.0m  representing an operating margin of 3.0%.Net financial expense amounted to -€2.1m versus -€1.2m in H1 2022  reflecting the increase in financial debt  incurred by acquisitions and the rise in interest rates from one half-year to the next. To guard against a rise in interest rates  a hedging contract was taken out in January 2023 to cover the interest on 50% of variable-rate debt.Visiativ booked net proceeds of €3.1m from the sale of its 100% stake in Visiativ Managed Services  an IT infrastructure and hosting manager  to XEFI's NEXEREN datacenter subsidiary.As a result  net income (Group share) reached €3.4m in H1 2023  compared with €1.2m one year prior. This includes corporate tax of €0.8m  versus €1.5m in H1 2022  following international marketing investments.€24.7M IN AVAILABLE CASH AT END-JUNE 2023In H1 2023  the Group's cash flow amounted to €7.4m  versus €9.9m one year prior.The €25.9m change in the working capital requirement is in line with the seasonality of the Group's business (€20.5m in H1 2022)  accentuated by the contribution of acquisitions effected in H2 2022  and less recourse to factoring. Operating cash flow thus contracted by -€18.5m in H1 2023.Investment flows totalled €7.6m  including €4.5m for acquisitions and buyouts of minority interests  €6.2m in CAPEX (of which €4.2m for R&D capital expenditure)  less divestments of €3.0m.In H1 2023  Visiativ paid out €5.0m in dividends in respect of FY 2022 (reminder: the dividend in respect of FY 2021 was detached in H2 last year) and carried out a capital increase of €1.2m subsequent to the 2023 employee shareholding plan campaign.Overall  the change in cash and cash equivalents amounted to -€33.2m in H1 2023  compared with -€30.7m in H1 2022.At 30 June 2023  Visiativ's available cash totalled €24.7m against borrowings and financial debts of €108.2m  including €28.6m in state-backed loans (PGE).At mid-2023  net financial debt[4] totalled €83.5m  and shareholders' equity amounted to €73.7m  representing a net gearing[5] of 113%  still a high point at the mid-year stage. Reminder: Visiativ's bank debt was refinanced at the end of 2022. Moreover  securing new financing enabling the Group to significantly lengthen the average maturity of its debt  and to benefit from additional resources to seize new external growth opportunities in the scope of the new strategic plan. On the strength of the traditional cash flow generation in H2  Visiativ's target is to achieve a net gearing4 close to 70% by the end of 2023.OUTLOOKVisiativ intends to pursue its growth momentum in H2 2023  driven in particular by the acceleration in SaaS subscriptions revenues  and thus increase its profitability  benefiting the always more favourable seasonal effect in the second half of the year.Visiativ will present its new strategic plan  dubbed SHIFT5  on 20 September 2023  along with its longer-term ambitions.FINANCIAL AGENDAEVENTS DATES Q3 2023 revenues Tuesday 24 October  2023 Full-year 2023 revenue Wednesday 24 January 2024 Full-year 2023 results Tuesday 19 March 2024These dates are an indication and may be changed if necessary.

Adjusted for this impact  the management gross margin was 72% in H1 2022.The Board of Directors of Spineway  meeting on September 18  2023  under the chairmanship of Stéphane Le Roux  approved the financial statements for the six months to June 30  2023.Spineway’s total revenue for the first half of 2023 is €5.4 million  up 75% compared with the first half of 2022. Organic growth remains strong (+12% in H1 2023). However  this growth is primarily due to the consolidation of the revenue of Spine Innovations  acquired in July 2022  thereby confirming the relevance of Spineway’s strategy of combining organic growth and targeted acquisitions. Revenue growth is expected to slow slightly in the second half.Results reflecting the consolidation of Spine InnovationsRevenue growth is accompanied by a good gross margin of €3.9 million in the first half  taking the gross margin rate to 72%. *In line with its roadmap  the Group has continued to invest to support its development in regulatory affairs (alignment with MDR requirements  product approvals  etc.) and surgeon training (creation of the “Spineway Academy” medical training department).As such  the 53% increase in average headcount since the end of June 2022  following the integration of Spine Innovations and the strengthening of the management team  pushes personnel expenses up to €3.4 million over which 0 4 M€ non-recurring expenses (from €1.9 million).However  tight control of operating expenses limits the operating loss to €1.6 million in the six months to June 30  2023. The net loss is €1.9 million.New funding to support developmentDuring the first half  as an innovative company  Spineway received an 8-year €1.5 million “Prêt Participatif Relance” (PPR  Participatory Stimulus Loan) to support its innovation strategy and R&D investments.The Group also concluded an agreement for the issue and subscription of bonds convertible into shares1 (OCA) in a total maximum nominal amount of €10 990 000 and for a duration of 24 months. An initial tranche of €500 000 (200 OCAs) was issued on the date the agreement was signed. As of June 30  2023  148 OCAs had been converted into 721 181 shares; an increase of €39 059.05 in share capital has been recorded. Share capital totaled 218 168.95 euros as of June 30  2023  broken down into 4 363 379 shares with a par value of 0.05 euros each.This funding contributes to the implementation of new projects such as the proprietary manufacturing of the Spine Innovations ESP prosthesis.With these new contributions  Spineway’s cash position was €3.6 million at the end of June. The financial situation accordingly remains healthy  with cash flow net of financial debt still positive at €0.5 million on shareholders’ equity of €20.5 million  i.e. gearing2 of -2.4% as of June 30  2023.Geographic rollout of new ranges and start of new projectsIn line with its strategic plan  Spineway is pursuing its commercial development in Europe and its regulatory procedures for the approval of Spine Innovations and Distimp products for major export markets. The Group also plans to expand its premium range of implants and instruments to address more broadly the segment of degenerative spinal conditions and is continuing its efforts to gain access to the US market with its range of cervical disc prostheses.The development of new strategic projects and the ramp-up of premium ranges in new geographies should enable Spineway to return to operating breakeven3 in the medium term.Spineway confirms its aim of becoming the innovative player in France and internationally leader in less invasive spine treatments.Next events :October 12  2023 – Q1 2023 revenueOctober 4 to 6  2023 – Eurospine meeting in FrankfurtSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR PEA-SME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

The extension will take the longstanding partnership to 33 years by the time the deal reaches its conclusion.The UEFA Champions League is at the forefront of football culture which the global brewer has always been a part of; from Zidane’s volley at Hampden Park to the miracle in Istanbul  the company has been included in the most iconic imagery of the beautiful game  helping to create unforgettable moments for fans.The longstanding alliance started in 1994 with the brand Amstel and moved to Heineken® in 2005. For this new extension  UEFA’s most iconic club tournament takes on a new and exciting single-league format. From the 2024/25 season  the competition will expand from 32 to 36 teams which will mean 189 matches instead of the current 125  giving the brand even more opportunities to deliver unforgettable experiences for fans.A core element of the partnership has been about bringing fans together around the world to develop meaningful experiences whilst promoting a positive message of inclusion  equality  and access for all fans. To support this drive  Heineken® activated the ‘Cheers To All Fans’ campaign across both UEFA Champions League and UEFA Women’s Champions League competitions from 2022 to 2023. The campaign highlighted inclusivity of the female fans and players through a series of stunts and activations.UEFA and the HEINEKEN company have spent the last 30 years growing the competition together beyond its European home  which has reached over 2.5 billion viewers around the world*. The strong relationship between the two brands is embodied by the fact that over 330 million fans who are aware of the sponsorship have consumed Heineken® beer in the 21-22 season*. Heineken® has supported the global growth of the competition for decades through cross-market activations like the ‘UEFA Champions League Trophy Tour presented by Heineken®’. The tour has taken the most iconic trophy in club football to over 30 countries around the world to meet fans in person. Heineken® continues to hold unique events around the world to support this growth and bring fans together - in 2023  for example  the brewer held a series of screenings showing the UEFA Champions League final in 12 cities  hosting over 20 000 supporters.Dolf van den Brink  CEO at HEINEKEN:“Football and beer have a special power to bring people together and create unforgettable social moments. That’s why we are thrilled to extend our sponsorship of the UEFA Champions League until 2027 as the competition takes on an exciting new format. This change means more matches and more opportunities to bring fans together and create incredible memories for supporters around the world.”Aleksander Čeferin  President of UEFA:“We are delighted to extend our partnership with Heineken  a company with such a well-established heritage in the world of sports. This new multi-year deal pinnacles an extraordinary relationship between two long-standing allies  lasting over a quarter of a century. Just like football and beer  our collaboration is a perfect match.”The sponsorship will run alongside the brand’s sponsorship of the UEFA Women’s Champions League and UEFA Women’s EURO.Please contact HNKNFootball@edelman.com for more information.Notes to Editors:About HEINEKEN:HEINEKEN is the world’s most international brewer.

The extension will take the longstanding partnership to 33 years by the time the deal reaches its conclusion.The UEFA Champions League is at the forefront of football culture which the global brewer has always been a part of; from Zidane’s volley at Hampden Park to the miracle in Istanbul  the company has been included in the most iconic imagery of the beautiful game  helping to create unforgettable moments for fans.The longstanding alliance started in 1994 with the brand Amstel and moved to Heineken® in 2005. For this new extension  UEFA’s most iconic club tournament takes on a new and exciting single-league format. From the 2024/25 season  the competition will expand from 32 to 36 teams which will mean 189 matches instead of the current 125  giving the brand even more opportunities to deliver unforgettable experiences for fans.A core element of the partnership has been about bringing fans together around the world to develop meaningful experiences whilst promoting a positive message of inclusion  equality  and access for all fans. To support this drive  Heineken® activated the ‘Cheers To All Fans’ campaign across both UEFA Champions League and UEFA Women’s Champions League competitions from 2022 to 2023. The campaign highlighted inclusivity of the female fans and players through a series of stunts and activations.UEFA and the HEINEKEN company have spent the last 30 years growing the competition together beyond its European home  which has reached over 2.5 billion viewers around the world*. The strong relationship between the two brands is embodied by the fact that over 330 million fans who are aware of the sponsorship have consumed Heineken® beer in the 21-22 season*. Heineken® has supported the global growth of the competition for decades through cross-market activations like the ‘UEFA Champions League Trophy Tour presented by Heineken®’. The tour has taken the most iconic trophy in club football to over 30 countries around the world to meet fans in person. Heineken® continues to hold unique events around the world to support this growth and bring fans together - in 2023  for example  the brewer held a series of screenings showing the UEFA Champions League final in 12 cities  hosting over 20 000 supporters.Dolf van den Brink  CEO at HEINEKEN:“Football and beer have a special power to bring people together and create unforgettable social moments. That’s why we are thrilled to extend our sponsorship of the UEFA Champions League until 2027 as the competition takes on an exciting new format. This change means more matches and more opportunities to bring fans together and create incredible memories for supporters around the world.”Aleksander Čeferin  President of UEFA:“We are delighted to extend our partnership with Heineken  a company with such a well-established heritage in the world of sports. This new multi-year deal pinnacles an extraordinary relationship between two long-standing allies  lasting over a quarter of a century. Just like football and beer  our collaboration is a perfect match.”The sponsorship will run alongside the brand’s sponsorship of the UEFA Women’s Champions League and UEFA Women’s EURO.Please contact HNKNFootball@edelman.com for more information.Notes to Editors:About HEINEKEN:HEINEKEN is the world’s most international brewer.

This work studies the effects of ATO on a preclinical auto-immune disease model  that develops severe abnormal vascular remodeling of pulmonary arterioles and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia-like lung disease  closely resembling human systemic sclerosis (SSc)-associated pulmonary hypertension.Marked beneficial effects of ATO on skin and lung fibrosis  vascular damage and scleroderma-like lesions have been previously described by Kavian et al. (J Immunol 2012 May; Arthritis Rheum 2012 Oct) in vitro and in SSc preclinical models  at the Cochin Institute’s facilities in Paris  France. The new data  in a third valuable preclinical model  show a significant reduction in inflammatory infiltration and a strong improvement in vascular remodeling  mediated by an immune status improvement  particularly involving T-cells. These findings represent a substantial advancement in understanding of the complex interplay between inflammation-driven fibrosis and the pathophysiology of SSc. These results give ground to the proposed clinical relevance of ATO treatment in SSc  and more generally in autoimmune pathologies  where lung is often impacted by fibrosis and vascular remodeling.In oncology  ATO is now recognized as a first-line treatment for acute promyelocytic leukaemia  with demonstrated safety and long-term remission. BioSenic had recently further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of ATO treatment in successful clinical programs targeting chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease  in a phase 2 and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)  in a phase 2a trial. BioSenic believes that the clinical data it has helped to generate over the past decade  together with its ongoing efforts to understand the cellular pathways that are controlled by ATO administration at the right dose and time  now allow for further expansion of clinical trials targets. This applies to new indications in autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases. This is a reason why BioSenic specifically selected SSc for a systematic clinical approach to testing ATO as a novel first-in-class therapy.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and CEO  BioSenic said:""BioSenic is now focusing on the final preparations for its phase 3 trial with ATO targeting chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease  one of the most common complications affecting survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients. It is also essential that BioSenic continues to pave the way for clinical progression of its ATO programs to treat systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. These new pre-clinical data add to the raft of in vitro and in vivo experimental data generated by BioSenic  by the scientific community and across the industry  supporting the potential of arsenic salt medication in correcting the pathophysiological parameters of the immune system gone awry in a number of autoimmune diseases. These results demonstrate the potential of ATO on the cellular characteristics of damaged organs  with chronic and aggravating functional abnormalities. This will provide invaluable knowledge for BioSenic’s ATO application and formulation for the ongoing clinical development  and further contribute towards the future success of ATO’s late-stage clinical development. Compounded observations  both widely published and collected in various international studies  fully justify the initiation of trials on SSc patients  in need of new and decisive medications  other than existing palliative ones. The hope for success is high and BioSenic is working hard in translating the present fundamental results into real therapeutic advances with the necessary help of available international funding.”About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in orthopedics.Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined a strategic positionings and strengths to use  separately and combined  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com .About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:The ATO platform  which has been successfully developed  has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T and other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). cGvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. BioSenic has been successful in a Phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international Phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early Phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a Phase 2 clinical protocol. The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform developed by BioSenic  with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. ALLOB has recently been evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2b study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late-delayed union. However  in June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in this exploratory Phase 2b clinical trial  interpreted as a failure of a too early cell injection  just after fracture. BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (choice between early or late treatment).Note: Biosenic has reevaluated a previous important and years-long clinical development program. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase 3 JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient subpopulation. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. This leads to a next generation of JTA  off-the-shelf enhanced viscosupplement to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives are intended to provide effective lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic (OA) pain and inflammation.The company  will nevertheless focus its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

This work studies the effects of ATO on a preclinical auto-immune disease model  that develops severe abnormal vascular remodeling of pulmonary arterioles and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia-like lung disease  closely resembling human systemic sclerosis (SSc)-associated pulmonary hypertension.Marked beneficial effects of ATO on skin and lung fibrosis  vascular damage and scleroderma-like lesions have been previously described by Kavian et al. (J Immunol 2012 May; Arthritis Rheum 2012 Oct) in vitro and in SSc preclinical models  at the Cochin Institute’s facilities in Paris  France. The new data  in a third valuable preclinical model  show a significant reduction in inflammatory infiltration and a strong improvement in vascular remodeling  mediated by an immune status improvement  particularly involving T-cells. These findings represent a substantial advancement in understanding of the complex interplay between inflammation-driven fibrosis and the pathophysiology of SSc. These results give ground to the proposed clinical relevance of ATO treatment in SSc  and more generally in autoimmune pathologies  where lung is often impacted by fibrosis and vascular remodeling.In oncology  ATO is now recognized as a first-line treatment for acute promyelocytic leukaemia  with demonstrated safety and long-term remission. BioSenic had recently further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of ATO treatment in successful clinical programs targeting chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease  in a phase 2 and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)  in a phase 2a trial. BioSenic believes that the clinical data it has helped to generate over the past decade  together with its ongoing efforts to understand the cellular pathways that are controlled by ATO administration at the right dose and time  now allow for further expansion of clinical trials targets. This applies to new indications in autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases. This is a reason why BioSenic specifically selected SSc for a systematic clinical approach to testing ATO as a novel first-in-class therapy.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and CEO  BioSenic said:""BioSenic is now focusing on the final preparations for its phase 3 trial with ATO targeting chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease  one of the most common complications affecting survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients. It is also essential that BioSenic continues to pave the way for clinical progression of its ATO programs to treatsystemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis.These new pre-clinical data add to the raft of in vitro and in vivo experimental data generated by BioSenic  bythe scientific communityand across the industry  supporting the potential of arsenic salt medication in correcting the pathophysiological parameters of the immune system gone awry in a number of autoimmune diseases. These results demonstrate the potential of ATO on the cellular characteristics of damaged organs  with chronic and aggravating functional abnormalities. This will provide invaluable knowledge for BioSenic’sATO application and formulation for the ongoing clinical development  and further contribute towards the future success of ATO’s late-stage clinical development. Compounded observations  both widely published and collected in various international studies  fully justify the initiation of trials on SSc patients  in need of new and decisive medications  other than existing palliative ones. The hope for success is high and BioSenic is working hard in translating the present fundamental results into real therapeutic advances with the necessary help of available international funding.”About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in orthopedics.Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined a strategic positionings and strengths to use  separately and combined  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The ATO platform  which has been successfully developed  has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T and other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). cGvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. BioSenic has been successful in a Phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international Phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early Phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a Phase 2 clinical protocol.2) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform developed by BioSenic  with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. ALLOB has recently been evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2b study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late-delayed union. However  in June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in this exploratory Phase 2b clinical trial  interpreted as a failure of a too early cell injection  just after fracture. BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (choice between early or late treatment).Note: Biosenic has reevaluated a previous important and years-long clinical development program. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase 3 JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient subpopulation. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. This leads to a next generation of JTA  off-the-shelf enhanced viscosupplement to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives are intended to provide effective lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic (OA) pain and inflammation.The company  will nevertheless focus its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:SeitoseiActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

These critical initiatives come as the global healthcare company confirms its commitment to positively impact society bytackling climate change and its consequences for human health.Ramping up adaptation efforts and initiatives to address the impact of climate change on the health of vulnerable communities becomes increasingly critical. Through Foundation S  Sanofi’s philanthropic organization  the company is strengthening locally led adaptation and health resilience programs for vulnerable communities impacted by climate change. Foundation S is today pledging nearly EUR 40 million through 2030 to support these efforts.Paul HudsonChief Executive Officer  Sanofi“Since 2015 and COP21  where Sanofi was the first and only pharmaceutical company discussing climate change and its impact on human health  we have been making strides to reduce the emissions of our supply chain and minimize the impact our products have on the environment. As we build our road to carbon neutrality by 2030  we also want to help address the broader impacts of climate change on the health of populations by teaming up with all stakeholders.By working with governments  health professionals  patient groups  regulators we canaccelerate the decarbonization of healthcare systems  and by expanding our investments in the development of adaptation solutions for climate vulnerable communities. All our company commitments are rooted in concrete  transparent actions and driven by the greater sense of responsibility of playing our part in the global adaptation and fight against climate change.”Sanofi starts in its own ‘climate’ backyardIn line with its objective to get to carbon neutrality by 2030  Sanofi is advancing a holistic  company-wide ambition to minimize the environmental impact of its products and activities  across its value chain  while strengthening resilience to environmental changes. To support its strategy  Sanofi plans to invest over EUR 450 million through 2030. These investments notably support company programs on energy efficiency and decarbonization of energy supplies  as well as resource circularity - reduce  reuse  recycle and recover - and reduction of natural resource extraction for water for instance.Committed to the United Nation’s Race to Zero initiative  the company is building the road to carbon neutrality across all scopes of emissions by 2030  and net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045  five years earlier than previous targets. By the end of 2022  greenhouse gas emission had decreased 29% compared to 2019 in scopes 1 & 2 and by 7% in scope 3. In addition  the company has taken an end-to-end approach to reduce the environmental footprint of its products. For example  by 2027  the use of plastic in blister packs for all vaccines will be eliminated. Today  the company is at 33%. Also  62% of electricity supplied on corporate sites is renewable with a target of 100% by 2030. Sanofi’s latest state-of-the-art facilities  such as its Evolutive Facilities of Neuville-sur-Saône in southern France and in Singapore  both set to open in 2025  are carbon-neutral by design  with zero landfilling and 100% of the waste recycled or recovered.Several pilot programs have also been conducted to assess how Sanofi’s most innovative products can contribute to reducing emissions along the care pathway. The programs  evaluating medicines and vaccines for RSV  atopic dermatitis  and flu  show that prevention  reduced hospitalizations  decreased outpatient visits and fewer patient consultations have a positive impact on CO 2 emissions while improving patients’ health outcome. Additionally  a pilot program on the benefits of utilizing telemedicine for patients with atopic dermatitis showed reduced CO 2 emission attributed to less frequent healthcare professionals’ visits while also improving patient comfort and outcomes. Sanofi will continue to implement pilot programs to advance data and understanding of the co-benefits of best-in-class therapies that can improve health outcomes while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Josep CatllàHead of Corporate Affairs  Sanofi“Sustainability is at the core of Sanofi’s long-term strategy  and it is ingrained in our mindset and behaviors in everything we do. Whether it’s about accelerating our environmental commitments  improving access to healthcare for vulnerable populations  or building a diverse  equitable and inclusive workplace  we’re driven by the ambition to make a sustainable positive impact for our people  our communities and society overall. This is why we are taking the initiative to help communities around the world to work towards the decarbonization of healthcare systems  which todayaccount for more carbon emissions than air transport.By working with local governments and healthcare actors to significantly reduce those emissions and by continuing our essential work in delivering first- and best-in-class medicines and vaccines  we double our impact to make our planet healthier.”Joining forces to go one step furtherBeyond reducing emissions from operations and its supply chain  Sanofi is focused on decarbonization of healthcare systems and sustainable delivery of care. The healthcare sector is responsible for 5% of total net emissions and the patient care pathway accounts for over 40% of that total. Sanofi is a leading member of the SMI Health Systems Taskforce  a public and private partnership of healthcare leaders launched at COP26  with an ambition to accelerate delivery of net zero  patient centric health systems. Sanofi is currently leading several key initiatives  notably the Patient Care Pathway group  focused on establishing an international measurement framework to calculate the carbon emissions of the patient care journey  the development of an industry product Life-Cycle-Assessment framework and a tool to measure the impact of pharmaceutical products on climate.Sanofi @ United Nations General AssemblySanofi will host side events at the 78th UN General Assembly  on September 20.Sanofi’s Foundation S  in partnership with Foreign Policy and Africa Europe Foundation will host Time to Adapt: Accelerating Climate Adaptation for Health  a high-level strategic dialogue to spotlight the health impacts of climate change and to mobilize on the financial need required to support community-led climate adaptation efforts in low- and –middle-income countries. Despite contributing the least to climate change  low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are most affected by its consequences  including increased morbidity and mortality  loss of livelihoods  and forced migration.As part of its work  Foundation S has launched several first-in-class grant programs to enhance the capacity of communities to prepare for and respond to climate-related impacts on health. To further raise awareness about the need for and importance of strengthening and funding climate adaptation and health resilience initiatives at the local level in climate vulnerable countries  the Collective MindS think thank will publish on September 20  2023 an Action Report that highlights adaptation solutions that can be replicated and brought to scale  and will call for urgent multi-lateral action to address the health impacts of climate change at the community level.Sanofi’s Global Health Unit side event ‘Unlocking Universal Health Coverage 2030: The Power of Health Financing’  co-organized with the Health Finance Institute (HFI)  will focus on mobilizing stakeholders on the need for financial sustainability  sufficiency  and tools for better access to healthcare  while sharing Sanofi’s Global Health Unit Model. HFI will present the conclusions of research supported by Sanofi on healthcare financing and highlight that focus on higher efficiency and collaboration among different actors is key.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Sarah came to ONWARD from Nevro  an implantable neuromodulation company  and has more than 20 years of experience in new product development and commercial marketing in the medical device industry  including at Johnson & Johnson.In May  Bryan  Garnier & Co  a leading investment bank focused on growth companies  reinitiated research coverage on the Company with a Buy rating. The Company is also covered by equity research at Degroof Petercam and Kepler Cheuvreux.FinancialONWARD reported an operating loss of EUR 18.8 million for the first six months of 2023 compared to EUR 15.1 million in the same period of 2022.The Company ended the six-month period with a positive cash balance of EUR 43.8 million (31 December 2022: EUR 61.8 million). The decrease in cash of EUR 18 million compared to 31 December 2021 is due to cash outflows for operating activities.First Half 2023 Financial SummaryIn EUR millionsFor the six-month period ended June 30 2023 2022 Total Revenues & Other Income 0.9 1.0 Total Operating Expenses (19.7) (16.1) Operating Loss for the Period (18.8) (15.1) Net Finance Expenses (0.4) (0.9) Income Tax Expenses (0.0) (0.0) Net Loss for the Period (19.2) (16.0) at 30 June 2023 31 December 2022 Cash position at the end of the period 43.8 61.8 Interest Bearing Loans (14.3) (12.7) Equity 34.3 52.6Business Update: 2H Outlook and Upcoming MilestonesONWARD expects to continue strong execution of its strategy in the second half of 2023 and beyond.Clinical and DevelopmentIn August  ONWARD marked the successful first-in-human use of an investigational implanted wireless BCI to help a person with SCI recover use of paralyzed arms and hands with thought-driven movement. The implant was part of a clinical feasibility study with partners at CEA-Clinatec  CHUV  and EPFL that is supported by a grant from the European Innovation Council. BCI-augmented ARC-IM implants will continue throughout 2024 as part of this study.ONWARD now expects to launch ARC-EX in the US in the second half of 2024. The new date is driven by our decision to redesign the device’s printed circuit board assembly (PCBA). Once the PCBA redesign and associated testing are completed  the Company plans to submit a de novo application for FDA clearance for the ARC-EX system  which would be the Company’s first commercial offering. The Company does not expect the postponement to negatively impact its cash runway.The Company also continues to prepare for its pivotal clinical study  called Empower BP  to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of its implantable ARC-IM system to address blood pressure instability after SCI.Commercial UpdateONWARD continues to make robust progress in preparing for launch. In September  it forged an agreement with a US third-party logistics (3PL) provider to manage fulfillment to civilian customers and an agreement with a US Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) to manage fulfillment to the US Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Administration. The latter agreement will provide ONWARD with rapid access to US government purchasing vehicles after FDA clearance.Based on positive feedback from potential customers on the value of the ARC-EX system  expected to be the first-ever external spinal cord stimulation therapy to restore hand and arm function after SCI  the Company is anticipating a list price of USD 30 000. In addition  the Company expects to offer tiered service packages.CorporateCFO Lara Smith Weber will step down as Chief Financial Officer at the end of September to pursue a new opportunity in the Boston area. Khaled Bahi will join ONWARD as Interim CFO. Prior to joining ONWARD  Khaled served as CFO of Lausanne-based Symetis  acquired by Boston Scientific in 2017 for USD 435 million  and Paris-based Stilla Technologies. He was also a finance leader with Fresenius Medical Care in Europe  Latin America  Middle East  and Africa. Khaled brings more than 20 years of finance experience in the medtech industry. Early in his career  he was a corporate and investment banker with Crédit Lyonnais and the Industrial Bank of Japan.The Company continues to expect its current cash position to fuel operations through the end of 2024. ONWARD plans to explore opportunities to further strengthen its cash position to support future investments in product development  clinical trials  and operational and commercial capabilities.Conference Call & WebcastONWARD will host a conference call with a live webcast today  September 19  2023  at 2:00 pm CET / 8:00 am ET.

These critical initiatives come as the global healthcare company confirms its commitment to positively impact society by tackling climate change and its consequences for human health.Ramping up adaptation efforts and initiatives to address the impact of climate change on the health of vulnerable communities becomes increasingly critical. Through Foundation S  Sanofi’s philanthropic organization  the company is strengthening locally led adaptation and health resilience programs for vulnerable communities impacted by climate change. Foundation S is today pledging nearly EUR 40 million through 2030 to support these efforts.Paul HudsonChief Executive Officer  Sanofi“Since 2015 and COP21  where Sanofi was the first and only pharmaceutical company discussing climate change and its impact on human health  we have been making strides to reduce the emissions of our supply chain and minimize the impact our products have on the environment. As we build our road to carbon neutrality by 2030  we also want to help address the broader impacts of climate change on the health of populations by teaming up with all stakeholders. By working with governments  health professionals  patient groups  regulators we can accelerate the decarbonization of healthcare systems  and by expanding our investments in the development of adaptation solutions for climate vulnerable communities. All our company commitments are rooted in concrete  transparent actions and driven by the greater sense of responsibility of playing our part in the global adaptation and fight against climate change.”Sanofi starts in its own ‘climate’ backyardIn line with its objective to get to carbon neutrality by 2030  Sanofi is advancing a holistic  company-wide ambition to minimize the environmental impact of its products and activities  across its value chain  while strengthening resilience to environmental changes. To support its strategy  Sanofi plans to invest over EUR 450 million through 2030. These investments notably support company programs on energy efficiency and decarbonization of energy supplies  as well as resource circularity - reduce  reuse  recycle and recover - and reduction of natural resource extraction for water for instance.Committed to the United Nation’s Race to Zero initiative  the company is building the road to carbon neutrality across all scopes of emissions by 2030  and net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045  five years earlier than previous targets. By the end of 2022  greenhouse gas emission had decreased 29% compared to 2019 in scopes 1 & 2 and by 7% in scope 3. In addition  the company has taken an end-to-end approach to reduce the environmental footprint of its products. For example  by 2027  the use of plastic in blister packs for all vaccines will be eliminated. Today  the company is at 33%. Also  62% of electricity supplied on corporate sites is renewable with a target of 100% by 2030. Sanofi’s latest state-of-the-art facilities  such as its Evolutive Facilities of Neuville-sur-Saône in southern France and in Singapore  both set to open in 2025  are carbon-neutral by design  with zero landfilling and 100% of the waste recycled or recovered.Several pilot programs have also been conducted to assess how Sanofi’s most innovative products can contribute to reducing emissions along the care pathway. The programs  evaluating medicines and vaccines for RSV  atopic dermatitis  and flu  show that prevention  reduced hospitalizations  decreased outpatient visits and fewer patient consultations have a positive impact on CO 2 emissions while improving patients’ health outcome. Additionally  a pilot program on the benefits of utilizing telemedicine for patients with atopic dermatitis showed reduced CO 2 emission attributed to less frequent healthcare professionals’ visits while also improving patient comfort and outcomes. Sanofi will continue to implement pilot programs to advance data and understanding of the co-benefits of best-in-class therapies that can improve health outcomes while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Josep CatllàHead of Corporate Affairs  Sanofi“Sustainability is at the core of Sanofi’s long-term strategy  and it is ingrained in our mindset and behaviors in everything we do. Whether it’s about accelerating our environmental commitments  improving access to healthcare for vulnerable populations  or building a diverse  equitable and inclusive workplace  we’re driven by the ambition to make a sustainable positive impact for our people  our communities and society overall. This is why we are taking the initiative to help communities around the world to work towards the decarbonization of healthcare systems  which today account for more carbon emissions than air transport. By working with local governments and healthcare actors to significantly reduce those emissions  and by continuing our essential work in delivering first- and best-in-class medicines and vaccines  we double our impact to make our planet healthier.”Joining forces to go one step furtherBeyond reducing emissions from operations and its supply chain  Sanofi is focused on decarbonization of healthcare systems and sustainable delivery of care. The healthcare sector is responsible for 5% of total net emissions and the patient care pathway accounts for over 40% of that total. Sanofi is a leading member of the SMI Health Systems Taskforce  a public and private partnership of healthcare leaders launched at COP26  with an ambition to accelerate delivery of net zero  patient centric health systems. Sanofi is currently leading several key initiatives  notably the Patient Care Pathway group  focused on establishing an international measurement framework to calculate the carbon emissions of the patient care journey  the development of an industry product Life-Cycle-Assessment framework and a tool to measure the impact of pharmaceutical products on climate.Sanofi @ United Nations General AssemblySanofi will host side events at the 78th UN General Assembly  on September 20.Sanofi’s Foundation S  in partnership with Foreign Policy and Africa Europe Foundation will host Time to Adapt: Accelerating Climate Adaptation for Health  a high-level strategic dialogue to spotlight the health impacts of climate change and to mobilize on the financial need required to support community-led climate adaptation efforts in low- and –middle-income countries. Despite contributing the least to climate change  low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are most affected by its consequences  including increased morbidity and mortality  loss of livelihoods  and forced migration.As part of its work  Foundation S has launched several first-in-class grant programs to enhance the capacity of communities to prepare for and respond to climate-related impacts on health. To further raise awareness about the need for and importance of strengthening and funding climate adaptation and health resilience initiatives at the local level in climate vulnerable countries  the Collective MindS think thank will publish on September 20  2023 an Action Report that highlights adaptation solutions that can be replicated and brought to scale  and will call for urgent multi-lateral action to address the health impacts of climate change at the community level.Sanofi’s Global Health Unit side event ‘Unlocking Universal Health Coverage 2030: The Power of Health Financing’  co-organized with the Health Finance Institute (HFI)  will focus on mobilizing stakeholders on the need for financial sustainability  sufficiency  and tools for better access to healthcare  while sharing Sanofi’s Global Health Unit Model. HFI will present the conclusions of research supported by Sanofi on healthcare financing and highlight that focus on higher efficiency and collaboration among different actors is key.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Capital increases generated a net inflow of €6.5 million  supplemented by the receipt of subsidies and trade receivables (€2.7 million). Cash flows from operating activities accounted for most of the cash outflows over the period (€7.7 million) and were heavily impacted by IsonaturaneTM 12 production costs.Highlights of the first half of 2023  recent events and outlook- Successful delivery of the first tons of IsonaturaneTM 12To meet orders placed by major cosmetics companies including L’Oréal  Global Bioenergies has set up a dedicated value chain  partly subcontracted  and delivered several tonnes of IsonaturaneTM 12 in H1 2023. Although the associated revenue is substantial  the corresponding production costs remain considerably high and this business activity  which will not generate a significant margin for the Company  is now no longer a priority. The Company is currently focusing all its efforts on building a larger plant.- ASTM certification for sustainable aviation fuel from Global Bioenergies technologyThe aviation industry requires all of its fuels to be certified by ASTM. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are certified worldwide in accordance with the ASTM D7566 standard  which sets out the fuel specification requirements and maximum blending percentage with conventional fuels. The standard allows SAFs to be considered as “drop-in” fuels  meaning that they can be blended up to 50% with fossil kerosene and can be safely used in airliners and existing infrastructure worldwide.Global Bioenergies obtained certification for its process in June 2023 marking the starting point for the roll-out of its sustainable aviation fuel technology. In order to become a major player in this field  production costs still need to be reduced significantly in order to be compatible with market prices. The Company aims for a share of the European SAF market in 2030  when the mandatory minimum share of sustainable aviation fuels will be raised to 6% in Europe.Focus on the larger scale plant projectGlobal Bioenergies has decided to adjust its roadmap to focus as of now on building a large-scale plant capable of producing up to 10 000 tonnes of isobutene and derivatives per year. This increase in production volume coupled with a reduction in selling prices will enable the Company to meet the needs of the cosmetics market more broadly and then gradually penetrate the Sustainable Aviation Fuel market. The plant would start operations at the end of 2027. Global Bioenergies will release design and construction schedules by the end of 2023.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies substitutes products of fossil origin with products of natural origin. In their quest for naturalness without compromising on performance  the cosmetics players are the Company's first customers. By 2027  the Company will be operating its innovative process in a large-scale plant.

Capital increases generated a net inflow of €6.5 million  supplemented by the receipt of subsidies and trade receivables (€2.7 million). Cash flows from operating activities accounted for most of the cash outflows over the period (€7.7 million) and were heavily impacted by IsonaturaneTM 12 production costs.Highlights of the first half of 2023  recent events and outlook- Successful delivery of the first tons of IsonaturaneTM 12To meet orders placed by major cosmetics companies including L’Oréal  Global Bioenergies has set up a dedicated value chain  partly subcontracted  and delivered several tonnes of IsonaturaneTM 12 in H1 2023. Although the associated revenue is substantial  the corresponding production costs remain considerably high and this business activity  which will not generate a significant margin for the Company  is now no longer a priority. The Company is currently focusing all its efforts on building a larger plant.- ASTM certification for sustainable aviation fuel from Global Bioenergies technologyThe aviation industry requires all of its fuels to be certified by ASTM. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are certified worldwide in accordance with the ASTM D7566 standard  which sets out the fuel specification requirements and maximum blending percentage with conventional fuels. The standard allows SAFs to be considered as “drop-in” fuels  meaning that they can be blended up to 50% with fossil kerosene and can be safely used in airliners and existing infrastructure worldwide.Global Bioenergies obtained certification for its process in June 2023 marking the starting point for the roll-out of its sustainable aviation fuel technology. In order to become a major player in this field  production costs still need to be reduced significantly in order to be compatible with market prices. The Company aims for a share of the European SAF market in 2030  when the mandatory minimum share of sustainable aviation fuels will be raised to 6% in Europe.Focus on the larger scale plant projectGlobal Bioenergies has decided to adjust its roadmap to focus as of now on building a large-scale plant capable of producing up to 10 000 tonnes of isobutene and derivatives per year. This increase in production volume coupled with a reduction in selling prices will enable the Company to meet the needs of the cosmetics market more broadly and then gradually penetrate the Sustainable Aviation Fuel market. The plant would start operations at the end of 2027. Global Bioenergies will release design and construction schedules by the end of 2023.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies substitutes products of fossil origin with products of natural origin. In their quest for naturalness without compromising on performance  the cosmetics players are the Company's first customers. By 2027  the Company will be operating its innovative process in a large-scale plant. By 2030  the Company plans to become a leader in the huge emerging market for sustainable aviation fuels  in order to fight against global warming.

30388,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.rigzone.com/news/eni_lg_chem_plan_to_build_biorefinery_in_south_korea-19-sep-2023-174049-article/,Eni  LG Chem Plan to Build Biorefinery in South Korea,The planned biorefinery would have a throughput capacity of about 400 000 tons.,South Korean chemicals producer LG Chem Ltd. and Italy’s Eni Sustainable Mobility are exploring the possibility of developing and operating a new biorefinery at LG Chem’s Daesan chemical complex located 49.7 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Seoul  South Korea.The two companies are conducting technical and economic feasibility assessments for the proposed project  LG Chem and Eni said in separate news releases. The final decision for the investment is expected by 2024 and the plant will be completed by 2026 at the existing integrated petrochemical complex in Daesan  Korea  according to the releases.The planned biorefinery would be designed to process approximately 400 000 tons of bio-feedstocks annually using Eni's Ecofining process  developed in collaboration with Honeywell UOP. It would also have the flexibility to process renewable bio-feedstocks and produce multiple products  including sustainable aviation fuel  hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO)  and bio-naphtha. The biorefinery would leverage LG Chem’s integrated value chain as well as the existing utilities and facilities of the industrial site as it “aims to meet the growing demand for more sustainable fuels and plastics produced by low-carbon processes  as well as to help progressively decarbonize the energy and mobility sector”  according to the releases.Eni said it plans to provide the South Korean biorefinery “with sustainable feedstock mainly based on waste and residues from the processing of vegetable oils  used cooking oil  and also vegetable oils from drought-resistant crops in degraded  semi-arid  or abandoned soils not in competition with the food chain”.Earlier this year  Eni joined a joint venture with PBF Energy acquiring a 50 percent interest in the St Bernard Renewables LLC bio-refinery in Louisiana  which is also based on the use of the Ecofining technology. The facility is targeted to have a processing capacity of about 1.1 million metric tons per year of raw materials  with full pretreatment capabilities  producing mainly HVO Diesel  commonly known as “renewable diesel” in North America  with a production capacity of 306 million gallons per year  Eni said.Sustainability-Linked Convertible BondsMeanwhile  Eni launched an offering of sustainability-linked senior unsecured convertible bonds with a seven-year maturity  the company said in an earlier news release.The bonds  which are expected to be rated A- by Standard & Poor’s  Baa1 by Moody’s  and A- by Fitch and to have an aggregate nominal amount of approximately $1.07 billion (EUR 1 billion)  will be convertible into Eni existing ordinary shares listed on Euronext Milan bought under its share buyback program  according to the release.The bonds are expected to pay an annual coupon ranging between 2.625 percent and 3.125 percent. They will be linked to the achievement of a net carbon footprint upstream (scope 1 and 2) equal to or lower than 5.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent and a renewable installed capacity equal to or greater than 5 gigawatts by December 31  2025. If one or both targets are not achieved  Eni shall pay an amount equal to 0.50 percent of the principal amount of the bonds on the fourth interest payment date of September 14  2027  according to the release.The bonds  which have a minimum denomination of $107 000 (EUR 100 000) each  will be placed subject to market conditions and will be issued at 100 percent of their nominal amount. Unless previously redeemed  converted  or purchased and canceled in accordance with the terms and conditions  the bonds will be redeemed at par with maturity on September 14  2030  the release said.To contact the author  email rocky.teodoro@rigzone.com,neutral,0.04,0.96,0.01,neutral,0.03,0.92,0.06,True,English,"['LG Chem Plan', 'South Korea', 'Eni', 'Biorefinery', 'St Bernard Renewables LLC bio-refinery', 'sustainability-linked senior unsecured convertible bonds', 'fourth interest payment date', 'South Korean chemicals producer', 'existing integrated petrochemical complex', 'Eni existing ordinary shares', 'Sustainability-Linked Convertible Bonds', 'economic feasibility assessments', 'integrated value chain', 'full pretreatment capabilities', 'share buyback program', 'net carbon footprint', 'carbon dioxide equivalent', 'Daesan chemical complex', 'sustainable aviation fuel', 'South Korean biorefinery', '1.1 million metric tons', '5.2 million metric tons', 'hydrotreated vegetable oil', 'separate news releases', 'LG Chem Ltd.', 'earlier news release', 'aggregate nominal amount', 'Eni Sustainable Mobility', 'existing utilities', '306 million gallons', 'sustainable fuels', 'mobility sector', 'sustainable feedstock', 'cooking oil', 'food chain', 'vegetable oils', '50 percent interest', 'two companies', 'final decision', 'Ecofining process', 'Honeywell UOP', 'multiple products', 'industrial site', 'growing demand', 'low-carbon processes', 'drought-resistant crops', 'joint venture', 'Ecofining technology', 'raw materials', 'North America', 'Euronext Milan', 'annual coupon', 'principal amount', 'minimum denomination', 'new biorefinery', 'renewable diesel', 'production capacity', 'PBF Energy', 'HVO Diesel', 'seven-year maturity', 'market conditions', 'renewable bio-feedstocks', 'processing capacity', '400,000 tons', '2.625 percent', '3.125 percent', '0.50 percent', '100 percent', 'Italy', 'possibility', 'Seoul', 'technical', 'project', 'investment', 'plant', 'collaboration', 'flexibility', 'bio-naphtha', 'facilities', 'plastics', 'waste', 'residues', 'soils', 'competition', 'Louisiana', 'use', 'facility', 'offering', 'company', 'Poor', 'Moody', 'Fitch', 'achievement', 'scope', '5 gigawatts', 'December', 'targets', 'September', 'accordance', 'terms', 'author', 'teodoro', 'rigzone']",2023-09-19,2023-09-20,rigzone.com
