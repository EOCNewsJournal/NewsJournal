Additional ELATIVE® data will be released in the coming months  and we are confident that this data will further demonstrate that elafibranor has a very competitive profile and the potential to add significant value to patients with PBC. We are pleased to see the commitment of our partner Ipsen and believe that they will make the most of the opportunity. For GENFIT  this means a potential first milestone in 2023 and  if elafibranor is approved in PBC  additional milestones and a regular revenue stream of royalty payments. These potential revenues would be used to finance the development of a very exciting pipeline of seven different programs ranging from preclinical to Phase 2. In particular we have five distinct programs in ACLF where the medical need is significant.”GENFIT will host a conference call in English on September 20  2023 at 4.15pm EDT | 9.15pm GMT | 10.15pm CETThe conference call will be accessible on the investor page of our website  under the Events section at: https://ir.genfit.com/events%26presentations/events or by calling 888-204-4368 (toll-free United States/Canada)  0800 279 0425 (toll-free United Kingdom)  0805 101 219 (toll-free France) five minutes prior to the start time (confirmation code: 1615622). A transcript of the conference call will be made available in French on the investor page of the GENFIT website soon after the call.I. 1H23 Business highlights1PBC: positive results from pivotal Phase 3 ELATIVE® trialGENFIT and Ipsen announced positive interim topline data from the pivotal ELATIVE® Phase 3 trial of elafibranor in PBC in the second quarter of 2023. The trial met its primary endpoint  with a statistically significant higher percentage of patients achieving a clinically meaningful cholestasis response compared to patients who received placebo. 51% of patients on elafibranor 80mg achieved a cholestasis response compared with 4% on placebo (p<0.0001). The first key secondary endpoint  normalization of ALP at Week 52  was also met with statistically significant improvements for investigational elafibranor compared with placebo. For the other key secondary endpoint  a trend for pruritus improvement was observed with a greater decrease from baseline in the PBC Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale score for patients on elafibranor compared to placebo  which did not reach statistical significance. In the study  elafibranor was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with that observed in previously reported studies.ACLF franchise2GENFIT’s Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) franchise now comprises 5 assets (VS-01  NTZ  SRT-015  CLM-022  VS-02-HE) based on differentiated mechanisms of action leveraging complementary pathways.VS-01-ACLF: First patient randomized in the Phase 2 trialVS-01 is currently being evaluated in the international UNVEIL-IT™ Phase 2  open-label  randomized  controlled  multi-center  proof of concept study to assess its efficacy  safety  and tolerability in addition to standard of care (SOC)  compared to SOC alone  in adult patients with ACLF grades 1 and 2 and ascites.The Investigational New Drug (IND) was in effect as of April 17  2023  and the first patient was randomized in the Phase 2 trial in early July. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 60 adult patients with ACLF grades 1 and 2. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either daily intraperitoneal administration of VS-01 over 4 days on top of SOC (active treatment group) or SOC alone (control group).NTZ in ACLF: Phase 1 clinical data presented at DDW®Data presented in May 2023 at Digestive Disease Week® (DDW®) showed that nitazoxanide (NTZ) was generally safe and well tolerated in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. Preliminary data from a similar Phase 1 study also showed that NTZ was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile in subjects with renal impairment.Following engagement with the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  and on the basis of the preclinical work and phase 1 data confirming the potential of NTZ in ACLF  GENFIT has decided to pursue the development of a new nitazoxanide formulation  which will permit greater dosing flexibility.ASK1 Inhibitor SRT-015 in acute liver diseaseIn May 2023  GENFIT licensed the exclusive worldwide rights of ASK1 Inhibitor SRT-015 (injectable formulation in acute liver disease) from Seal Rock Therapeutics  a Seattle  Washington (USA) based clinical stage company developing potential first-in-class and best-in-class kinase inhibitors.Preclinical and clinical evidence support ASK1 inhibition as a relevant therapeutic strategy in multi-system disorders such as ACLF. ASK1 inhibition has shown several potentially beneficial effects that may be relevant in ACLF  such as blocking LPS (lipopolysaccharide) associated hyperinflammatory response  reducing the ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species)-related immune response  reducing apoptosis  reducing release of the proinflammatory cytokines  reducing fibrosis  and protecting macrophage mitochondrial function. Multi-organ benefits have been observed in several animal models and clinical trials.Under the terms of the agreement  Seal Rock Therapeutics is eligible for payments of up to €100 million  including regulatory  clinical  and commercial milestone payments  plus tiered royalties. This agreement does not have any material impact on our current financial forecast  as specified in Part III of this press release.CLM-022 in liver disease treatmentIn July 2023  GENFIT licensed the exclusive worldwide rights of CLM-022  a potential first-in-class inflammasome inhibitor  from Celloram Inc.  a Cleveland  Ohio (USA) based biotechnology company. GENFIT will leverage Celloram’s acquired scientific insights on this molecule to finalize IND enabling studies of this preclinical stage asset and secure an IND for future clinical trials.Under the terms of the agreement  Celloram is eligible for payments of up to €160 million  including regulatory  clinical and commercial milestones  as well as tiered royalties. This agreement does not have any material impact on our current financial forecast  as specified in Part III of this press release.VS-02 in HEVS-02-HE is in preclinical stages and is being developed in Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE)  which is one of the major complications of advanced liver disease and portal hypertension. As many as 45% of patients with cirrhosis will experience at least one episode of HE. VS-02-HE is a urease inhibitor  designed to inhibit ureases by binding to nickel atoms in their active site.CCACCA: Phase 1b/2a study evaluating GNS561The first patient is expected to be screened in the second half of 2023 in a Phase 1b/2a study evaluating GNS561 in patients with KRAS mutated cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).In the Phase 1b  patients are enrolled to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GNS561 when given in combination with a MEK inhibitor  and to identify the recommended doses of the combination to be administered in the Phase 2a study.UCD and OAGENFIT is also pursuing the development of preclinical programs in Urea Cycle Disorders (UCD) and Organic Acidemias (OA).VS-01-HACVS-01-HAC is a potential first-line lifesaving treatment for acute hyperammonemic crisis associated with Inborn Errors of Metabolism in UCD and OA.NASH diagnosticIn May 2023  the Journal of Hepatology published a manuscript on the development and validation of NIS2+™  followed by an article in August 2023 on NIS2+™ ‘s performance in older patients in Hepatology Communications.At the EASL3 Congress 2023  GENFIT presented NIS2+™ as an effective screening tool for optimizing patient selection in clinical trials targeting NASH4 and as the most adapted Non-Invasive Test (NIT) for an efficient identification of at-risk NASH that is not impacted by age.Corporate governance updatesAt the Company’s Annual Shareholders’ Meeting held on May 24  2023  all of the resolutions endorsed by the Board of Directors were adopted by a significant majority of the votes cast. This includes the renewal of financial authorizations that would allow the Company flexibility to seize relevant market opportunities.In June 2023  Sandra Silvestri  M.D.  Ph.D.  replaced Steven Hildemann M.D.  Ph.D.  on the Board of Directors of the Company as representative of IPSEN  the legal entity that holds the board seat. Sandra Silvestri  M.D.  Ph.D.  joined Ipsen in 2023 as Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Medical Affairs  Patient Safety and Patient Affairs.In the first half of 2023  Sakina Sayah Jeanne and Tom Huijbers joined GENFIT’s Executive Committee  respectively as Executive Vice-President Research & Translational Science and Executive Vice-President Regulatory.ESG commitmentGENFIT's ESG commitment and performance were recognized by independent stakeholders.In July 2023  GENFIT was awarded a gold medal by Ethifinance (compared to bronze in 2022) and ranked 2 out of 75 companies in the biopharmaceutical sector. This upgrade in the ratings is a testament to a company-wide effort in implementing CSR initiatives and ensuring transparent communications in relation to our CSR approach.In June 2023  GENFIT was classified by ODDO Research as ""Best-in-Class"" in its sector  based on two main criteria: activity impact and ESG maturity.In January 2023  GENFIT obtained a “Prime status” label by ISS ESG  upgrading its corporate rating from C to C+.In the second half of 2023  GENFIT will continue to reaffirm its commitment to social/societal responsibility and sustainable development.II. 2H23 and beyond: key milestones and outlookPBCAdditional data on the ELATIVE® study is expected to be disclosed by Ipsen at an upcoming scientific conference.Ipsen is responsible for the development and commercialization of elafibranor  including the submission of regulatory applications for elafibranor following discussions with the FDA and the European Medicines Agency.ACLF franchiseVS-01-ACLF: Interim data expected to be available in 1H24Interim data are expected to be available in the first half of 2024 with the objective of supporting preparation of further testing of efficacy. Given the high unmet need in this indication and the Orphan Drug Designation obtained from the FDA for VS-01  it is expected that the program may qualify for some of the expedited regulatory pathways provided by health authorities.NTZ in ACLF: Phase 2 clinical trial launch expected in 1H25Subject to the successful development of a new nitazoxanide formulation  we have revised the expected launch date of a Phase 2 clinical trial to the first half of 2025.ASK1 Inhibitor SRT-015 in acute liver disease: First-in-Human study planned in 2H24A First-in-Human study is planned in the second half of 2024 to support a Proof-of-Concept study in ACLF patients as early as 2025.VS-02-HEIND enabling nonclinical studies are targeted to be completed in 2025.CLM-022 in liver disease treatmentA preclinical proof-of-concept study is targeted for 2024.CCAGNS561 in CCA: First biomarker data targeted for 1H24The first patient is expected to be screened in the second half of 2023.The first biomarker data are expected to be available as early as the first half of 2024 and should support preparation of further evaluation of efficacy with the optimal doses of GNS561 and a MEK inhibitor in Phase 2a of the study.Given the high unmet need in this indication and the Orphan Drug Designation obtained from the FDA for GNS561  it is expected that the program may qualify for some of the expedited regulatory pathways provided by health authorities.UCD and OAIND enabling nonclinical studies are targeted to be completed in 2024 for UCD and OA.NIS2+™ in NASHGENFIT continues to explore the possibility of obtaining regulatory approval and CE Certificates of Conformity  with a development and commercial partner  to release an IVD test powered by NIS2+™ technology on the US and European markets.In the second half of 2023  GENFIT will continue to publish data in scientific publications and at scientific events on NIS2+™.III. 1H23 Financial highlightsCash  cash equivalents and other current financial assetsAs of June 30  2023  GENFIT had €111.8 million in cash  cash equivalents and other current financial assets compared with €140.2 million as of December 31  2022. We expect that our existing cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements until approximately the fourth quarter of 2024. This is based on current assumptions and without taking exceptional events into account  as well as potential milestones and royalties that the Company may receive pursuant to the licensing agreement with Ipsen.In the first half of 2023  these cash flows are mainly the result of our research and development efforts  notably for ELATIVE®  our Phase 3 clinical trial of elafibranor in PBC; UNVEIL-IT™  our Phase 2 clinical trial of VS-01 in ACLF; GNS561  as part of our cholangiocarcinoma program; and NTZ  as part of our ACLF program.Revenues and other incomeRevenues and other income amounted to €15.4 million in the first half of 2023 (compared with €12.2 million in the first half of 2022).Substantially  all revenue is attributable to our Collaboration and License Agreement with Ipsen and related Transition Services Agreement. Revenue growth reflects certain services billed to Ipsen under the Transition Services Agreement  originally entered into in the first half of 2022.Operating expensesOperating expenses amounted to €34.7 million in the first half of 2023 (compared with €26.5 million in the first half of 2022).Substantially  all of the increase in operating expenses is due to research and development expenses  which amounted to €25.6 million in the six months to June 30  2023  compared with €17.6 million in the six months to June 30  2022. Specifically  there has been an increase in:Contracting costs which amounted to €14.4 million in the first half of 2023 compared with €8.5 million in the first half of 2022  reflecting increased activities across multiple product candidates  including ELATIVE ®  VS-01  GNS561 and NTZ VS-01  GNS561 and NTZ  Employee expenses which amounted to €6.3 million in the first half of 2023 compared with €4.9 million in the first half of 2022  reflecting increased headcount  andOther expenses (maintenance  fees  travel and other taxes) which amounted to €3.3 million in the first half of 2023 compared with €2.4 million in the first half of 2022  reflecting increased activity overall  as previously noted.Financial resultsFinancial income in the first half of 2023 was a loss of €1.1 million  compared to a gain of €4.0 million in the first half of 2022.The change in financial results is mainly due to foreign exchange gains in 2022 which did not repeat in 2023  partially offset by increased interest income in 2023 relative to 2022.Net lossThe first half of 2023 resulted in a net loss of €20.9 million  compared with a net profit of €10.4 million in the first half of 2022.The table below presents the condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the first half of 2023  with comparative figures for the first half of 2022.

This compares with a reported loss for all of fiscal year 2022 of -0.6 mio euro (before non-recurring income related to the sale of an industrial land  the loss for all of fiscal year 2022 was -2.1 mio euro).Sales  EBIT and EBITDA evolved to 143.4 mio euro  2.8 mio euro and 13.9 mio euro  respectively. This represents an 11.6 % increase in sales compared to adjusted 2022 sales (*). EBIT decreased 16.8 %  while EBITDA clocked in at the same level as the first half of 2022 (both compared to 2022 adjusted EBITDA and EBIT (*)).This evolution must be assessed from the perspective that the negative effects of the war in Ukraine last year only began to seep through starting in May.The positive sales evolution is linked to the traditional business  which again recorded a nice growth. It focuses on the out-of-home market  where coffee is consumed outside the domestic sphere  such as in offices  companies  restaurants and institutions.In this market segment  a whole service is offered such as sales  customer care  logistics service  engineering. It also includes full operating  where large vending machines are refilled and maintained at the customer's premises.Across almost the entire line of the international organization  Miko managed to increase sales. In the UK it was slightly more difficult  partly a consequence of the BREXIT.In Scandinavia  the result experienced a small decrease due to the weakening of the Norwegian and Swedish Krone. Furthermore  wage indexation in Belgium  where all coffee is roasted and packaged  is also having an impact. The margin of the out-of-home division is still under pressure  but is moving in the right direction.As recently as May  Miko acquired the German company PROCON GmbH  based in Magdeburg  which achieves sales of about 1.5 mio euro with about 10 employees. Procon also operates in the out-of-home market.Within the business of private label for the retail market  things are difficult. Supermarkets are undergoing very difficult times  and this comes at the expense of passing on increased commodity prices and costs.Says Frans Van Tilborg  CEO of the Miko Group: ""We see our importance in the out-of-home market continuing to grow  not only in euros  but also in volume. We are pleased that we are meeting this challenge in a market that remains a victim of the popularity of working from home. The fact that we have already invested 9.2 mio euro in coffee machines  the engine of this division  confirms our positive outlook.Private label in retail remains a battle. It will take some time to win it. In any case  we can already confirm that when our new building is completed in a few years  and we merge our aging plants into a better automated plant with state-of-the-art technology  we will realize economies of scale.""(*) The adjustment refers to the elimination of the sale of an industrial land in 2022.",neutral,0.16,0.82,0.02,mixed,0.25,0.17,0.58,True,English,"['Miko N', '\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffMiko', 'profitability', 'September', '01:33', 'Euronext Brussels-listed coffee service specialist', 'increased commodity prices', 'Frans Van Tilborg', 'large vending machines', 'positive sales evolution', 'coffee machines', 'logistics service', 'positive outlook', 'Press release', 'Regulated information', 'first half', 'non-recurring income', 'industrial land', 'same level', 'negative effects', 'nice growth', 'domestic sphere', 'full operating', 'entire line', 'international organization', 'small decrease', 'Swedish Krone', 'wage indexation', 'right direction', 'German company', 'private label', 'difficult times', 'new building', 'aging plants', 'automated plant', 'art technology', '0.6 mio euro', '2.1 mio euro', '143.4 mio euro', '13.9 mio euro', '1.5 mio euro', '9.2 mio euro', 'market segment', 'fiscal year', 'traditional business', 'customer care', 'PROCON GmbH', 'home market', 'Miko Group', 'retail market', 'home division', '0.8 mio', '2022 sales', 'profitability', 'Turnhout', 'loss-making', 'EBIT', '11.6 % increase', 'perspective', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'May', 'offices', 'companies', 'restaurants', 'institutions', 'engineering', 'premises', 'consequence', 'BREXIT', 'Scandinavia', 'result', 'weakening', 'Norwegian', 'Belgium', 'impact', 'margin', 'pressure', 'Magdeburg', '10 employees', 'things', 'Supermarkets', 'expense', 'costs', 'CEO', 'importance', 'euros', 'volume', 'challenge', 'victim', 'popularity', 'fact', 'battle', 'case', 'years', 'state', 'economies', 'scale', 'adjustment', 'elimination']",2023-09-20,2023-09-21,marketscreener.com

The company's decision follows shareholder approval received in June earlier this year. As part of this transition  CRH will withdraw its shares from the Euronext Dublin stock exchange  where it was first listed in 1973. The delisting is set for September 25.This significant change doesn't mean a complete departure from European exchanges for CRH. The company will retain a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange  where it has been listed since 2005. The move to an American primary listing mirrors the company's operational focus  given that North America generates roughly 75% of CRH's earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization.The decision to shift towards a U.S. primary listing aligns with CRH's future growth strategy. The company anticipates that the U.S. market  with its ongoing economic expansion  growing population  and substantial construction requirements  will be a key driver of its progress.In terms of financial performance  CRH has demonstrated encouraging results in the first half of this year. The company reported a pretax profit of $1.51 billion  marking an increase from $1.20 billion during the same period last year. Revenue also showed positive momentum  growing by 7.6% to reach $16.14 billion.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

(""Company"" or ""RFG"")  the parent company of Racing Force Group  which is specialized in the development  production and marketing of safety components for motorsports competitions worldwide  as well as listed on the Euronext Growth Milan and Paris segments  reviewed and approved the consolidated half-yearly financial statements as of June 30  2023  prepared in accordance with the Euronext Growth Milan and Paris Issuers' Regulations.Paolo Delprato  Chairman and CEO of Racing Force Group  commented: ""The results of the first half of 2023 were achieved in a complex macroeconomic scenario  characterized by strong uncertainty  within a year that represents a period of investments for the Group  in view of a significant boost to growth expected in the coming years  also benefitting from the diversification projects currently underway. In particular  in the first six months of the year  the Group has already made significant investments to further strengthen its organizational structure and to increase production and logistics capacity  with the aim to be ready for the developments expected in the near future”.Summary of Group Results as of June 30  2023- Group's Revenues amounted to €37.2 million  up compared to the first half of 2022 (+10.8%).The increase characterized particularly the geographical areas of EMEA (+15.8%) and APAC (+9.6%)  while the Americas recorded a slight decline (-0.5%)  mainly due to a one-off supply carried out during the previous year. Excluding this one-off supply  growth would have been double digit. Dealers are confirmed as the primary sales channel for the Group (62.4% of revenues)  while Driver's Equipment represents the main category in terms of product type (72.1% of revenues).- EBITDA amounted to €7.9 million (EBITDA margin 21.3%)  against €9.3 million in the first half of 2022 (EBITDA margin 27.8%). Variance is mainly due to higher costs incurred in the first six months of 2023 to support growth in Motorsport and  particularly  the investments and diversification projects currently being implemented.- EBIT was €6.4 million (17.1% EBIT margin)  against €8.1 million (24.1% EBIT margin) in the first half of 2022.- Net income is €4.9 million (13.1% of Revenues)  against €6.9 million (20.7% of Revenues) in the first half of 2022.- The Group's Net Financial Position passed from a net debt of €4.4 million at the end of 2022  to a positive balance of €0.3 million as of June 30  2023  also thanks to the share capital increase completed in January 2023  in addition to the cash generated during the period from operations  net of the investments in the first half of the year.Performance AnalysisDuring the first months of the year  the global economy suffered a deceleration due to the high rate of inflation and restrictions in financing conditions. In this context  characterized by strong uncertainty  the Group recorded a growth in sales of +10.8% compared to the first half of 2022  strengthening its leadership in motorsport  thanks to the continuous research for innovation combined with the offer of new products  the constant improvement of existing ones and the completeness of the range offered.The increase in revenues during the half-year particularly affected the segments of racewear  driven by higher sales of suits  communication systems and non-technical apparel.Gross profit recorded an increase in absolute value of €1.9 million compared to the first half of 2022. In percentage terms  there was a slight decrease  equal to 0.9%  due to the different composition of the product mix and higher incidence of raw materials costs.In the first six months of the financial year  the Group made significant investments to support growth within motorsport and  particularly to implement the diversification projects currently underway. General and administrative expenses  specifically  recorded an increase of €1.8 million compared to the first half of 2022  mainly due to the higher number of employees within the Group (+89 units employed on average in the first six months of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022). This increase was necessary in order to timely set up the proper organizationalstructure and production capacity  required to support both the activities within Motorport and the diversification projects.The current capital structure is such as to allow investments in the coming future to further support the Group's growth plan  both within motorsport and as regards the diversification projects.Current tradingSales in the first two months of the second half of 2023 show significant growth compared to the already particularly positive figures of last year.Contributing to the growth in turnover  albeit in a limited way  is the start of the first deliveries of the carbon shells for the jet pilot helmet (Next Generation Fixed-Wing Helmet) in August  in line with the Group's plans.In the second half of the year  a higher dilution of structural costs is expected  with a positive impact on marginality  compared to the second half of 2022.Presentation of the resultsThe results for the half-year ended June 30  2023 will be presented to analysts and investors on September 21  2023 at 10:00 a.m. (CET)  through Microsoft Teams platform  using the following link:Microsoft Teams MeetingClick here to join the meetingMeeting ID: 326 418 185 859 Passcode: HsPpwPThe presentation supporting the conference call will be made available on the Company's website www.racingforce.com in the «Investor Relations» section at the following link: https://ir.racingforce.com/en/presentations.This publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: xZltaJiaaGrHl5tpZcdta2loZ5tnlZOYaWeayGdoZMedm5xllmaVZ5TKZnFinWlu- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Inside Information:- News release on accounts  results Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/81848-rfg-results-1h-2023-eng-v.20.09.23.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2023 ActusNews",neutral,0.04,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.38,0.26,0.36,True,English,"['Racing Force S.p.a', '1H 2023 results', 'Net income', 'Board', 'Directors', 'Revenues', 'September', 'Racing Force S.p.A.', 'CONSOLIDATED HALF-YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS', 'half-yearly financial statements', 'complex macroeconomic scenario', 'Racing Force Group', ""Paris Issuers' Regulations"", 'raw materials costs', 'current capital structure', 'Net Financial Position', 'primary sales channel', 'Current trading Sales', 'first six months', 'Euronext Growth Milan', 'share capital increase', 'first months', 'organizational structure', 'higher costs', 'Net Income', 'net debt', 'financial year', 'first half', 'higher sales', 'Gross Profit', 'Ronco Scrivia', 'safety components', 'motorsports competitions', 'Paris segments', 'Paolo Delprato', 'strong uncertainty', 'significant boost', 'coming years', 'diversification projects', 'logistics capacity', 'near future', 'geographical areas', 'slight decline', 'main category', 'product type', 'positive balance', 'Performance Analysis', 'global economy', 'high rate', 'financing conditions', 'continuous research', 'new products', 'constant improvement', 'communication systems', 'technical apparel', 'absolute value', 'slight decrease', 'different composition', 'product mix', 'higher incidence', 'administrative expenses', 'higher number', 'proper organizationalstructure', 'coming future', 'growth plan', '21.3% EBITDA margin', 'parent company', 'The Group', 'percentage terms', 'significant investments', 'previous year', 'production capacity', 'Group Results', 'one-off supply', 'BOARD', 'DIRECTORS', 'JUNE', 'Revenues', '1H', 'December', 'Italy', 'RFG', 'development', 'marketing', 'accordance', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'period', 'view', 'aim', 'Summary', 'EMEA', 'Americas', 'Dealers', 'Driver', 'Equipment', 'Variance', 'end', 'January', 'addition', 'cash', 'operations', 'deceleration', 'inflation', 'restrictions', 'context', 'leadership', 'innovation', 'offer', 'existing', 'completeness', 'range', 'racewear', 'suits', 'General', 'employees', '89 units', 'average', 'order', 'activities', 'Motorport']",2023-09-20,2023-09-21,marketscreener.com

Consequently  safeguarding sensitive data and associated workloads in the cloud is an increasing priority  especially for compliance and data privacy. Thales' collaboration with Intel combines the industry leading CipherTrust Data Security Platform with the verifiable attestation service from Intel® Trust Authority to protect data in use and workloads while delivering seamless end-to-end data security.Confidential computing protects data in use by performing computations in a cryptographically isolated hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Often  the cryptographic material verifying the TEE is managed by the cloud provider. Thales' comprehensive data security solution effectively sidesteps this security issue by implementing separation of duties and puts the customer in control of the cryptographic key material. This approach eliminates the need to place complete trust in the cloud provider.By using trusted attestation from Intel  Thales' CipherTrust Data Security Platform can ensure sensitive workloads are never decrypted outside of an Intel® TEE  Intel® Trust Domain Extension (TDX) or Intel® Software Guard Extension (SGX).«Thales' collaboration with Intel enables security conscious organisations to share data safely while preserving privacy  confidentiality  and compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR  PCI-DSS and HIPAA  only disclosing the results of the processes performed. This is especially important for highly regulated industries where data security is paramount to safeguarding the privacy of the information.» -Todd Moore  Vice President of Data Security Products at Thales« It is critical that enterprises retain control of their data protection and can confidently retain business agility while meeting compliance requirements. Together  Thales CipherTrust Data Security Platform Intel Confidential Computing technologies and Intel Trust Authority provide customers the tools they need to do so. We're pleased to combine the technology leadership and innovation of Thales and Intel with this solution.» -Anil Rao Vice President  Systems Architecture and Engineering and Office of the CTO  IntelAbout ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies within three domains: Defence & Security  Aeronautics & Space  and Digital Identity & Security.

Dubbed SHIFT5  this new plan seeks to build on the success of the previous AUDEO  NEXT100 and CATALYST plans which have enabled Visiativ to progressively become the preferred strategic partner of SMEs and mid-sized companies  helping them to step up their innovation effort and transform their companies.Today  against a backdrop of profound change (increasingly fierce competition and an ever-greater need for innovation  acceleration of the digital revolution  climate and environmental emergencies  cybersecurity  artificial intelligence)  the need for companies to transform has undoubtedly never been greater or more pressing.Operating in a buoyant market context  Visiativ's ambition with SHIFT5 is to further enhance its position as a preferred and trusted partner for companies  helping them to rise to the critical challenges inherent in their technological and business transformations.SHIFT5 is intended to make Visiativ an all-in-one software and consulting partner for businesses  and to leverage the commercial synergies that exist between all of the Group's activities.In the words of Laurent Fiard  Chairman and CEO of Visiativ:""In the space of just a few years  Visiativ has become a major player in the transformation of businesses  establishing itself as the strategic partner of SMEs and mid-sized companies for bringing innovation to the heart of their business and industrial processes.

Meanwhile  the company's development has been underpinned by targeted acquisitions to strengthen its offering and expand its scope beyond France.While pursuing this conquest through cross-selling and up-selling  one of Visiativ's challenges with SHIFT5 is to ramp up the recurring nature of its activities by developing subscription-based models in order to meet the needs of companies  as well as to extend the scope of its activities internationally by cultivating veritable customer communities  as has been done in France.EXcellence: Visiativ's previous strategic plans enabled it to build a brand platform on the basis of its SHARING IS GROWING promise  foster the development of the employee experience within its various activities  and establish itself as one of the best-performing companies in terms of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility).Through SHIFT5  Visiativ seeks to consolidate this excellence by offering a unique branded customer experience  pushing forward the All Visiativ programme dedicated to its employees and  more than ever  delivering sustainable and responsible performance with regard to all its stakeholders in terms of CSR.SHIFT5: GENERATE SALES OF €500M BY DEVELOPING ITS SUBSCRIPTION MODELFollowing the success of the AUDEO and NEXT100 growth plans  through which Visiativ increased its sales from €50m to more than €200m  and the focus on profitability via the CATALYST plan  where the Group reached new levels of profitability and generated more than €30m in EBITDA[1] in 2022  the SHIFT5 plan aims to change the company's development profile by focusing on SaaS (Software as a Service).In this respect  Visiativ has set itself the following financial targets for 2028:Achieve sales of €500m  50% of which internationally  through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions (compared with sales of €258.8m in 2022  36% of which internationally);Significantly develop the subscription model to increase ARR to €100m (versus €27.4m at end-December 2022).By maintaining a high level of profitability  combined with new financing arrangements signed at the end of 2022 for €115m  including a senior loan of up to €70m  the fulfilment of these targets will give Visiativ the financial leeway it needs to implement the external growth component of SHIFT5.SHIFT5: EXCELLENCE IN TERMS OF CSR TO RANK AMONG THE LEADERSOn the strength of its growth and profitability trajectory  Visiativ also seeks to reach a new CSR milestone  where the underlying aim is to place the Group among the best-performing companies in terms of CSR.Through SHIFT5  Visiativ will step up its efforts in the various areas of its CSR policy:Customer satisfaction   by amplifying the CSR dimension of our offers  and developing a dedicated offering to enable customers to implement their own actions;

 by accelerating the reduction of our carbon footprint in the scope of a 2035 trajectory aligned with SBTi's Corporate Net-Zero Standard; Societal footprint  by supporting local philanthropy and linking it to employee commitment.In terms of CSR objectives  Visiativ has set itself the following targets for 2028:Reduce its carbon emissions by 5% per year (at constant scope);(at constant scope); Maintain the percentage of women in the total workforce (32% in 2022);(32% in 2022); Increase the number of disabled employees in France by 10% per year over the period 2023-2028 (the company had 21 disabled employees in 2022);over the period 2023-2028 (the company had 21 disabled employees in 2022); Maintain the percentage of work-study students in France each year (6% in 2022).Visiativ is embarking on a new phase in its development  which will enable it to assert itself as the preferred partner of companies  both in France and internationally  wishing to successfully carry out their strategic transformations and bring innovation to the heart of their activities and industrial processes.

This newly created organisation underlines our common ambition to support industries in their transition efforts to a low carbon future.At the same time  it shows our readiness for both the upcoming legal and regulatory frameworks for CO 2 transport activities. Fluxys c-grid ensures a long-term approach combining a regional focus with a broad internationally interconnected network.A coordinated approach with many benefitsCarbon Capture and Utilisation/Storage (CCUS) is essential for industry to meet its transition targets  especially for hard-to-abate sectors such as steel  petrochemical  cement and lime production. With this partnership we go for a coordinated approach across the international borders and across the Belgian regions. To best serve the industry our goal is to interconnect the CO 2 network with export infrastructure and adjacent infrastructure in neighbouring countries enabling transit volumes through a CO 2 backbone. With a service offer for industry across national and regional borders and accommodating large quantities  we can offer a competitive tariff for industries. In fact  Fluxys c-grid offers industry the CO 2 takeaway options it needs to sustain its activity and employment.Fluxys Belgium has comprehensive experience in offering open access pipeline services and working in tandem with regulatory authorities and the market to set up customer-driven services and adequate tariff methodologies.Longstanding expertiseThe shareholders have the expertise as well as the financial solidity to ensure adequate financing of the investments for developing and operating the extensive CO 2 network the industry requires for its transition needs.As independent infrastructure partners  both Fluxys Belgium and Pipelink  an affiliate of Port of Antwerp-Bruges’  have extensive and long-standing experience in the development  construction and safe operation of pipeline infrastructure.Fluxys c-grid will be set up as a subsidiary of Fluxys Belgium who will hold a majority share of 77 5%  partners Pipelink and Socofe each holding 10% and SFPIM will support Fluxys c-grid with a 2 5% share.Pascal De Buck  CEO of Fluxys: “The launch of Fluxys c-grid aligns perfectly with our ambition to offer industry across Belgium and the neighbouring countries the capacity to transport 30MT of CO 2 per year by 2030.

The shares had their last day on the Irish market on Wednesday. Photograph: Nick BradshawCRH shares rose on the building materials giant’s last day of trading on the Irish market on Wednesday  drawing to an end an association with the exchange that goes back 87 years.The long-standing largest company on the Irish market  known as Euronext Dublin  decided earlier this year to quit Dublin as part of an overhaul of its stock market quotations  which will see its main listing move from London to the New York Stock Exchange from Monday.Its shares closed 1.5 per cent higher at €50.34  giving it a market value of €35.8 billion.The building materials giant will remain headquartered and tax resident in Ireland. However  it is believed its advisers concluded it would be easier to ultimately secure inclusion on the keenly-followed S&P 500 if it were not also listed in Dublin  where most of the trading volume in the stock had beenREAD MOREThe hope is that the group would also trade at a premium relative to profits by being listed in the US  where companies are traditionally valued on higher earnings multiples compared to Europe.However  CRH’s departure is a seminal moment for the Irish market  where it routinely is the most traded stock by value. CRH was formed in 1970 through the merger of the already publicly quoted Irish Cement  which floated in 1936  and Roadstone companies.Davy analysts Ross Harvey and Andrea Collins said in a note to clients on Wednesday that the move of the primary listing to New York “is a significant event for the share”.“Over the past 10 years the existing management team [led by chief executive Albert Manifold] has reshaped the portfolio around a clear and consistent strategy  all the while evolving hallmark characteristics of the business – commercial execution  efficiency and prudent capital allocation ” they said.Mr Manifold said earlier this year that CRH was now “a de facto” US company  with its North American unit having grown from accounting for about half of group profits a decade ago to make up 75 per cent of its $5.6 billion (€5.1bn) of earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation last year.The US listing is also aimed at improving CRH’s chances of securing lucrative contracts under a $1.2 trillion US infrastructure programme to run until 2026.,neutral,0.11,0.85,0.04,positive,0.67,0.32,0.01,True,English,"['Irish stock market', 'Wall Street beckons', 'CRH shares', 'last day', 'CRH chief executive Albert Manifold', '$1.2 trillion US infrastructure programme', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'building materials giant', 'Davy analysts Ross', 'existing management team', 'prudent capital allocation', 'North American unit', 'higher earnings multiples', 'stock market quotations', 'main listing move', 'Mr Manifold', 'US listing', 'primary listing', 'US company', 'Irish market', 'last day', 'Nick Bradshaw', 'largest company', 'S&P 500', 'trading volume', 'seminal moment', 'Irish Cement', 'Andrea Collins', 'significant event', 'past 10 years', 'consistent strategy', 'hallmark characteristics', 'commercial execution', 'de facto', '75 per cent', 'lucrative contracts', 'market value', 'Roadstone companies', 'Euronext Dublin', 'CRH shares', 'group profits', 'Wednesday', 'Photograph', 'end', 'association', 'part', 'overhaul', 'London', 'Monday', 'Ireland', 'advisers', 'inclusion', 'READ', 'hope', 'premium', 'Europe', 'merger', 'Harvey', 'note', 'clients', 'portfolio', 'clear', 'business', 'efficiency', 'half', 'interest', 'tax', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'chances']",2023-09-20,2023-09-21,irishtimes.com

These measures  in combination with a stringent control on other key parameters  such as gross margin  have enabled a return to positive EBITDA from 1st half 2023.The breakdown of EBITDA by country maturity is as follows:Consolidated data Unaudited  in k€ H1 2023 H1 2022 H1 2021 Existing countries (1) Turnover 8 332 10 148 7 014 EBITDA 2 543 3 316 2 078 % EBITDA 31% 33% 30% Scale-up (2) Turnover 3 584 2 918 1 691 EBITDA 133 (446) (283) % EBITDA 4% -15% -17% New countries (start-ups) (3) Turnover 524 199 10 EBITDA (392) (753) (40) % EBITDA - - - Group overheads (4) (2 094) (3 084) (1 252) Consolidated EBITDA 192 (967) 503(1) France  Spain  Switzerland and ML2GROW(2) Germany  United Kingdom  Italy  and Belgium(3) Sweden  Norway  Denmark  South Africa  Netherlands  UAE  Poland  and Czech Republic(4) Excluding CAPEXDespite a fall in activity in the countries where Invibes has been established for the longest (France  Spain  Switzerland)  the EBITDA margin remained solid at over 31%  demonstrating the resilience of the model when a market is mature and established and all the fundamentals are activated  despite more difficult conditions.In countries in the scale-up phase (Germany  the UK  Italy and Belgium)  sales growth has been accompanied by an improvement in profitability  with EBITDA showing a positive trend over the period.After considering a depreciation of €599k  Invibes posted an operating loss of €407k  more than quadruple the figure for the first half of 2022.The net loss was also divided by almost 4 over the period  reaching €446k.A solid balance sheet to support growth.With a gross cash position of €17.3m (including €5.3m of deconsolidating factoring) and a net cash position of €10.5m at 30 June 2023  the Group has the necessary capacity to finance its future development and maintain a high level of investment in R&D  with innovation remaining the key driver of the Invibes model.Intelligent targeting solutions that are ever more innovative and unique  offering a strong competitive differentiation.The cost-cutting measures have been implemented with the aim of maintaining its capacity for innovation  which is essential if it is to continue to stand out in the digital advertising ecosystem and win new market share.On the strength of this constant innovation  Invibes stands out from its competitors with a unique value proposition incorporating technological Services & Solutions tailored to advertisers' business sectors and ever more new intelligent targeting solutions based on big data and innovative  high-impact in-feed formats.To give an example  in the first half of the year  Invibes launched Invibes Survey  an interactive targeting solution which has proved very popular with advertisers - combining the power of branding with the collection of direct feedback from users on any subject to gather key data with a view to optimising future campaigns and improving the customer experience.Upstream of a campaign  this new solution uses a survey of a group of people to accurately identify target audience segments based on characteristics similar to those of the survey respondents  making it possible to extend the reach of the advertising campaign and win over new customers.At the end of a campaign  the advertiser can also launch a survey to measure its effectiveness and impact (awareness  image  purchase intentions  consumption habits  etc.).Multiple advertisers have already successfully used this innovative solution in recent months  including Nissan  Universal Pictures and Amazon Prime Video.Outlook: reaffirmation of target of positive EBITDA in 2023With a first half marked by a return to positive EBITDA  benefiting from the effect of the cost-cutting measures implemented at the end of 2022  Invibes is reaffirming its confidence in its objective of achieving positive EBITDA over the full 2023 financial year.About Invibes AdvertisingInvibes Advertising (Invibes) is an international technology company specialising in digital advertising innovation.Founded on the philosophy that advertising efficiency comes from being truly innovative and naturally engaging to users  Invibes has developed an integrated technology platform for brands to reach consumers through impactful in-feed advertising.Invibes delivers advertising that creates positive attention by harnessing the power of big data  innovative in-feed formats  wide reach and extensive intelligence services.Pioneering the way in sustainable advertising  Invibes also offers a unique solution to offset campaign emissions through its Carbon-Neutral label.In order to partner with some of the greatest brands in the world  like Amazon  Bacardi  Dell  IKEA and Toyota  we rely on even greater people.

Revenue as at 30 June amounted to €378.6 million  up 2% compared to the same period in 2022. Excluding the unfavourable foreign currency effect (-€2.9 million)  revenue was up 2.8% at CER1. As anticipated  this change was marked by a sharp acceleration of activity in the second quarter (+6.7% at CER) after a slight decline in the first quarter (-1.3%).1 Constant exchange rates (CER): the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous fiscal year.2 Excluding extraordinary costs relating to optimisation of the operational structure and changes in the sales model.Strong activity in Asia and Europe; good dynamics for Diagnostic ImagingIn the EMEA region  activity increased over the first six months of the fiscal year by 7.8% at current exchange rates and at CER  in the wake of the sustained increase in volumes and positive price effects  which had been accelerating since the beginning of the year.In Asia  the large increase in revenue in the first half of the year (+16.6% at CER) resulted from a sharp acceleration in the second quarter (+30.1%). This performance was driven by China  where the implementation of direct distribution just a year ago continues to pay off.The decline in sales in the Americas region (-15.3% at CER)  reflects in part the optimisation of the customer portfolio and the production adjustments associated with the launch of EluciremTM. On the Raleigh site (North Carolina)  the situation returned to normal  with production as of 30 June 2023 higher than in the first half of 2021  i.e. before the decline in production linked to recruitment difficulties.By activity  revenue for Diagnostic Imaging increased by 3.3% at CER. It should be noted that X-ray revenue now includes the revenue of the company Intrasense (€2.2 million in the first half of 2023)  consolidated as of 11 January 2023.In MRI   growth of 3.2% at CER was marked by an acceleration in the second quarter (+5.6%);  growth of 3.2% at CER was marked by an acceleration in the second quarter (+5.6%); X-ray growth over the first half of the year (+3.4% at CER) reflected an ever-strong increase in sales of Xenetix® and a decrease in Optiray® volumes  resulting from price increases and customer portfolio and production adjustments on the Raleigh site.In Interventional Imaging  sales at CER were down 1.1% in the first half of 2023 due to a base effect in the Asia region; activity increased (+1.4%) in the second quarter alone.In millions of eurosConsolidated financial statements (IFRS standards) H1 2022Published H1 2023Published Revenue 371.1 378.6 EBITDA* 50.5 45.9 % of revenue 13.6% 12.1% Operating income 16.9 10.3 % of revenue 4.6% 2.7% Net income 3.3 1.3 % of revenue 0.9% 0.4% Net debt 251.5 342.3* EBITDA = Operating income + net amortisation  depreciation  and provisions.Note: Audit procedures have been carried out for the consolidated financial statements. The certification report is currently being issued.Resilience of the EBITDA margin in a context of inflationAs indicated when the annual results were published  Guerbet's 2023 operational profitability is subject to a context in which costs are rising more sharply than in the previous fiscal year. In the first half of the year  this context was particularly reflected in a significant increase in staff costs  in connection with salary inflation but also with the compensation paid as part of the departure of employees following the optimisation of the operational structure. The sales price increases initiated over the past few months  as well as continued efforts focusing on the cost structure  partially offset inflationary pressures  limiting the decrease of the EBITDA margin  which amounted to 12.1%  compared to 13.6% in the first half of 2022. The restated EBITDA margin  calculated excluding extraordinary costs relating to optimisation of the operational structure and changes in the sales model  came to 12.7%  compared to 13.9% one year earlier.As of 30 June 2023  the Group's operating income was €10.3 million  compared to €16.9 million one year earlier.Net income was €1.3 million over the period. Taxes came to €2.2 million compared to €11.2 million in the first half of 2022  which was marked by the accounting of items notified by the tax authorities (for €4.5 million) and additional expenses under IFRIC 23 (€4.4 million). Financial expenses increased to €3.8 million (compared to €1.2 million one year earlier).At the end of June 2023  shareholders' equity amounted to €370 million  compared to €380 million at the end of 2022. Over the same period  the Group's net debt rose from €270 million on 31 December 2022 to €342 million at the end of June 2023. This change was related to an increase in WCR driven by the increase in stocks  due to the prices of supplies (iodine) as well as the creation of stocks of EluciremTM.As a reminder  in late July  Guerbet finalised the refinancing of its debt backed by a new five-year credit agreement  replacing the one expiring in March 2024. The amount of this agreement comes to €350 million  including an undrawn €100 million revolving credit facility. In addition  in order to support its development and diversify its sources of financing  Guerbet has announced the signing of agreements for the issue of €50 million in EuroPP bonds over a period of six and a half years and the issue of €50 million in Relance bonds over eight years.Continued acceleration of sales in the second half of the year and rebound in margins in 2024Guerbet's teams are committed to the strategic priorities that should enable the Group to boost its growth in the long term; these include:Increasing sales of Elucirem TM . Launched in March 2023 in the United States  this breakthrough MRI innovation posted initial sales in line with the Group's expectations. In Europe  marketing authorisation is still expected in the second half of 2023. For clarification  this process will be carried out in two stages: in mid-October  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) should issue its opinion  which must then be approved by the European commission around mid-December.. Launched in March 2023 in the United States  this breakthrough MRI innovation posted initial sales in line with the Group's expectations.

For clarification  this process will be carried out in two stages: in mid-October  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) should issue its opinion  which must then be approved by the European commission around mid-December. Accelerating the Artificial Intelligence roadmap. The non-exclusive licensing agreement signed in June with the company Intrasense  in which the Group now owns a 56.5% stake  will enable the algorithms developed by Guerbet to be marketed in the near future via the Myrian® platform. As a reminder  Guerbet has built its AI portfolio around the detection of liver and bone lesions and pancreatic and prostate cancers. With regard to this latter disease  the Group's algorithm recently won the ""PI-CAI"" challenge organised by a large international consortium (see press release of 17 July 2023).In terms of financial prospects  Guerbet remains confident for the second half of fiscal year 2023 and beyond. The contrast media market remains driven by structural volume growth along with positive price effects. Activity in the coming months will also benefit from the gradual rise in EluciremTM sales and the sustained growth of Lipiodol® sales. As previously stated  Guerbet's growth in the second half of 2023 will be more sustained than in the first half. In terms of profitability  inflationary pressures (in particular for iodine) will continue to be felt in the second half of 2023.In this context  Guerbet confirms that it anticipates revenue growth of more than 5% on a like-for-like basis and at CER in 2023. The restated EBITDA margin/revenue ratio is expected to be around 11%  before a return in 2024 to a higher level than in 2021 (14.4%).About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

Revenue as at 30 June amounted to €378.6 million  up 2% compared to the same period in 2022. Excluding the unfavourable foreign currency effect (-€2.9 million)  revenue was up 2.8% at CER1. As anticipated  this change was marked by a sharp acceleration of activity in the second quarter (+6.7% at CER) after a slight decline in the first quarter (-1.3%).1Constant exchange rates (CER): the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous fiscal year.2 Excluding extraordinary costs relating to optimisation of the operational structure and changes in the sales model.Strong activity in Asia and Europe; good dynamics for Diagnostic ImagingIn the EMEA region  activity increased over the first six months of the fiscal year by 7.8% at current exchange rates and at CER  in the wake of the sustained increase in volumes and positive price effects  which had been accelerating since the beginning of the year.In Asia  the large increase in revenue in the first half of the year (+16.6% at CER) resulted from a sharp acceleration in the second quarter (+30.1%). This performance was driven by China  where the implementation of direct distribution just a year ago continues to pay off.The decline in sales in the Americas region (-15.3% at CER)  reflects in part the optimisation of the customer portfolio and the production adjustments associated with the launch of EluciremTM. On the Raleigh site (North Carolina)  the situation returned to normal  with production as of 30 June 2023 higher than in the first half of 2021  i.e. before the decline in production linked to recruitment difficulties.By activity  revenue for Diagnostic Imaging increased by 3.3% at CER. It should be noted that X-ray revenue now includes the revenue of the company Intrasense (€2.2 million in the first half of 2023)  consolidated as of 11 January 2023.In MRI   growth of 3.2% at CER was marked by an acceleration in the second quarter (+5.6%);  growth of 3.2% at CER was marked by an acceleration in the second quarter (+5.6%); X-ray growth over the first half of the year (+3.4% at CER) reflected an ever-strong increase in sales of Xenetix® and a decrease in Optiray® volumes  resulting from price increases and customer portfolio and production adjustments on the Raleigh site.In Interventional Imaging  sales at CER were down 1.1% in the first half of 2023 due to a base effect in the Asia region; activity increased (+1.4%) in the second quarter alone.In millions of eurosConsolidated financial statements (IFRS standards) H1 2022Published H1 2023Published Revenue 371.1 378.6 EBITDA* 50.5 45.9 % of revenue 13.6% 12.1% Operating income 16.9 10.3 % of revenue 4.6% 2.7% Net income 3.3 1.3 % of revenue 0.9% 0.4% Net debt 251.5 342.3* EBITDA = Operating income + net amortisation  depreciation  and provisions.Note: Audit procedures have been carried out for the consolidated financial statements. The certification report is currently being issued.Resilience of the EBITDA margin in a context of inflationAs indicated when the annual results were published  Guerbet's 2023 operational profitability is subject to a context in which costs are rising more sharply than in the previous fiscal year. In the first half of the year  this context was particularly reflected in a significant increase in staff costs  in connection with salary inflation but also with the compensation paid as part of the departure of employees following the optimisation of the operational structure. The sales price increases initiated over the past few months  as well as continued efforts focusing on the cost structure  partially offset inflationary pressures  limiting the decrease of the EBITDA margin  which amounted to 12.1%  compared to 13.6% in the first half of 2022. The restated EBITDA margin  calculated excluding extraordinary costs relating to optimisation of the operational structure and changes in the sales model  came to 12.7%  compared to 13.9% one year earlier.As of 30 June 2023  the Group's operating income was €10.3 million  compared to €16.9 million one year earlier.Net income was €1.3 million over the period. Taxes came to €2.2 million compared to €11.2 million in the first half of 2022  which was marked by the accounting of items notified by the tax authorities (for €4.5 million) and additional expenses under IFRIC 23 (€4.4 million). Financial expenses increased to €3.8 million (compared to €1.2 million one year earlier).At the end of June 2023  shareholders' equity amounted to €370 million  compared to €380 million at the end of 2022. Over the same period  the Group's net debt rose from €270 million on 31 December 2022 to €342 million at the end of June 2023. This change was related to an increase in WCR driven by the increase in stocks  due to the prices of supplies (iodine) as well as the creation of stocks of EluciremTM.As a reminder  in late July  Guerbet finalised the refinancing of its debt backed by a new five-year credit agreement  replacing the one expiring in March 2024. The amount of this agreement comes to €350 million  including an undrawn €100 million revolving credit facility. In addition  in order to support its development and diversify its sources of financing  Guerbet has announced the signing of agreements for the issue of €50 million in EuroPP bonds over a period of six and a half years and the issue of €50 million in Relance bonds over eight years.Continued acceleration of sales in the second half of the year and rebound in margins in 2024Guerbet's teams are committed to the strategic priorities that should enable the Group to boost its growth in the long term; these include:Increasing sales of Elucirem TM . Launched in March 2023 in the United States  this breakthrough MRI innovation posted initial sales in line with the Group's expectations. In Europe  marketing authorisation is still expected in the second half of 2023. For clarification  this process will be carried out in two stages: in mid-October  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) should issue its opinion  which must then be approved by the European commission around mid-December..

Accelerating the Artificial Intelligence roadmap. The non-exclusive licensing agreement signed in June with the company Intrasense  in which the Group now owns a 56.5% stake  will enable the algorithms developed by Guerbet to be marketed in the near future via the Myrian® platform. As a reminder  Guerbet has built its AI portfolio around the detection of liver and bone lesions and pancreatic and prostate cancers. With regard to this latter disease  the Group's algorithm recently won the ""PI-CAI"" challenge organised by a large international consortium (see press release of 17 July 2023).In terms of financial prospects  Guerbet remains confident for the second half of fiscal year 2023 and beyond. The contrast media market remains driven by structural volume growth along with positive price effects. Activity in the coming months will also benefit from the gradual rise in EluciremTM sales and the sustained growth of Lipiodol® sales. As previously stated  Guerbet's growth in the second half of 2023 will be more sustained than in the first half. In terms of profitability  inflationary pressures (in particular for iodine) will continue to be felt in the second half of 2023.In this context  Guerbet confirms that it anticipates revenue growth of more than 5% on a like-for-like basis and at CER in 2023. The restated EBITDA margin/revenue ratio is expected to be around 11%  before a return in 2024 to a higher level than in 2021 (14.4%).About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

We are confident that  if successful in our clinical programs and if required regulatory approvals are obtained  lanifibranor could potentially become an effective treatment for patients with NASH in Japan and South Korea based onthe efficacy demonstrated so far on fibrosis and NASH resolution and on the cardiometabolic components of the disease. We are looking forward to starting the clinical development program of lanifibranor in Japan and South Korea.”About Hepalys Pharma  Inc.Hepalys Pharma  Inc. is a private venture-backed biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutics for liver disease  led by a world-class team and a transpacific clinical advisory board  committed to develop and commercialize lanifibranor and potentially other compounds for patients in Asian countries.

The firm maintains offices in Tokyo  Japan and in San Francisco  California.About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce anti-fibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms  which are well-characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well-balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH (also known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH))  mucopolysaccharidoses (“MPS”) and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva is currently advancing one clinical candidate  has a pipeline of two preclinical programs and continues to explore other development opportunities to add to its pipeline.Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult MPS VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is also in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 90 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment B of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA  ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.comContactsInventivaPascaline ClercVP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175 Brunswick GroupTristan Roquet Montegon /Aude Lepreux /Matthieu BenoistMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

Accordingly  the sponsors of the Company will forfeit their Sponsor Warrants upon expiry of the Public Warrants.Munich  September 20  2023The board (the ""Board"") of European Healthcare Acquisition & Growth Company B.V. (""EHC"" or the ""Company"")  a Dutch operators-led special purpose acquisition company listed on Euronext Amsterdam  announces today that it intends to convene an extraordinary general meeting to request the shareholders to resolve on the extension of the Business Combination Deadline  to offer the redemption of the Public Shares and to terminate the warrants.Extension of Business Combination Deadline and dissolutionEHC has until November 17  2023 (the ""Business Combination Deadline"") to complete a business combination. Following the termination of the discussions with Croma-Pharma GmbH and its shareholders on August 7  2023  EHC is still in the process of investigating the possibility of completing a business combination in the future. The Board believes that the consummation of a business combination before the Business Combination Deadline seems unlikely given the limited amount of time left. However  the Board believes it would be in the interest of both the Company and its stakeholders to extend the Business Combination Deadline to continue the process and search to successfully complete a business combination and to reclaim some outstanding receivables. The Board therefore intends to convene an extraordinary general meeting  to be held on or before November 17  2023  to have its shareholders resolve on the extension of the Business Combination Deadline by twelve months or such earlier date as announced by EHC on its website (the ""Extended Business Combination Deadline""). The general meeting of the Company will also be requested to resolve upon the dissolution of the Company if: (i) no business combination agreement will have been signed on or before the Extended Business Combination Deadline; or (ii) the Extended Business Combination Deadline will not be approved by the general meeting.Redemption of Public SharesIn light of the proposed extension of the Business Combination Deadline  the Company will offer its class A ordinary shareholders to redeem their class A ordinary shares (the ""Public Shares"") under the same terms as in the event of a liquidation scenario as further detailed in the Company's prospectus dated November 16  2021.Envisaged termination of all warrantsThe Board will seek approval from the holders of the class A warrants (the ""Public Warrants"") to have the Public Warrants expire worthless immediately following the original Business Combination Deadline  i.e. November 17  2023  as the warrants have proved to impede the chances of successfully completing a business combination. Accordingly  the sponsors of the Company will forfeit their class B warrants (""Sponsor Warrants"") upon expiry of the Public Warrants.Next stepsThe Board will prepare the relevant documentation for an extraordinary general meeting to be held before expiry of the Business Combination Deadline and for the redemption of the Public Shares and will publish such documentation when available.-----------About EHCEHC is an operators-led special purpose acquisition company.

This plan was designed to leverage and increase the penetration of our existing customers base of over 400 000 companies by selling them additional solutions. This enlarged product offering has been accompanied by a continuous focus on developing our integrated B to B subscription model. This allows us to deliver stronger recurring top line growth  year after year.In addition  our current strategy was also designed to deliver growth in a profitable manner as shown by our ambitious mid-single digit organic growth at the current EBIT(2) level over the three-year period of the plan. In this respect  the 8% organic growth achieved in the first half of the year is clearly encouraging. Importantly  this performance is driven by a strong improvement in the profitability of our software business  as the evolution of the business mix towards a SaaS subscription model is almost completed.The solid results achieved in the first half of 2023 demonstrate our ability to develop our integrated platform sustainably and profitably. We are therefore confident that organic growth at both revenue and current EBIT(2) levels will continue in the second part of the year enabling  the Group to successfully complete its strategic plan.”FIRST HALF-YEAR 2023 CONSOLIDATED SALESGroup sales stood at €522 million in H1 2023  a 2.0% organic growth compared to H1 2022 and a (0.3)% decrease on a reported basis.

The change of scope is related to the divestments of the Graphic activities in the Nordics and the Shipping business in France  both sold in June 2022.Consolidated sales and current EBIT(2) by SolutionConsolidated salesIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change Organic change(1) Intelligent Communication Automation 120 108 +10.8% +11.8% Mail-Related Solutions(a) 358 367 (2.4)% (1.4)% Parcel Locker Solutions(a) 45 44 +2.2% +5.5% Other solutions divested in 2022 0 5 n/a n/a Group total 522 524 (0.3)% +2.0% (a) Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions 2022 data have been restated to reflect the fact that they now include activities previously accounting for in Additional Operations.Current EBIT(b) and current EBIT Margin(b)H1 2023Reported H1 2023(Excluding IFRIC impact) H1 2022Reported In € million Current EBIT(c) EBIT Margin(c) Current EBIT(c) EBIT Margin(c) Current EBIT EBIT Margin Intelligent Communication Automation (3) (2.9)% (3) (2.5)% (10) (9.7)% Mail-Related Solutions(a) 82 23.0% 84 23.4% 89 24.2% Parcel Locker Solutions(a) (11) (24.1)% (11) (23.7)% (13) (29.7)% Other solutions divested in 2022 - - - - (0) - Group total 68 13.0% 70 13.5% 65 12.5%(a) Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions 2022 data have been restated to reflect the fact that they now include activities previously accounting for in Additional Operations.(b) Before acquisition-related expenses(c) 2023 current EBIT and EBIT margin were negatively impacted by the €2.3 million negative impact from the new IFRIC accounting standard for cloud computing. There was no IFRIC impact in H1 2022Intelligent Communication AutomationIn H1 2023  sales from Intelligent Communication Automation reached €120 million  up 11.8% organically and up 10.8% on a reported basis compared to H1 2022. Subscription-related revenue  which recorded a strong 20.5% organic growth  accounted for 80% of Intelligent Communication Automation total sales in H1 2023  a significant increase compared to 74% in H1 2022. Of note  pursuing the development of its offering in Europe  Quadient is experiencing strong customer adoption of its Accounts Payable (AP) and Accounts Receivable (AR) cloud solutions  with accelerating trends  especially in the UK  in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022.The share of SaaS customers reached 81% at the end of H1 2023 compared to 78% at the end of H1 2022. As the transition to the SaaS model continues to progress  the weight of license sales has decreased further representing less than 7% of Intelligent Communication Automation total sales in H1 2023. Professional services (14% of sales) also went down  recording a (17.3)% organic decline. This continued decline is due to the change in business model  cloud adoption requiring less onboarding services  and to the customer mix evolution towards mid-sized companies.At the end of H1 2023  annual recurring revenue (ARR)  which is a forward-looking indicator of future subscription-related revenue  reached €197 million  up from €187 million at the end of FY 2022  i.e. a 16.1% annualized organic(5) growth compared to the end of FY 2022. Additionally  the Group recorded a double-digit increase in AP/AR financial automation customers upsold in H1 2023 vs H1 2022.Regarding the new Quadient Hub  which unifies business communications and financial automation into one single cloud-platform  onboarding of customers progressed at a rapid pace with c. 2 500 customers having already been onboarded since its launch in April 2023. The Group remains focused on improving its overall platform offering both from a customer experience standpoint  through the addition of new features and from a service standpoint by adding new functionalities. For example  Quadient recently invested in artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities leveraging Microsoft Azure AI services. This integration of generative AI into Quadient’s cloud platform will further contribute to transforming the way organizations engage with their customers. Additionally  Quadient launched an AI-based cash application module to accelerate invoice-to-cash processes. To further complement its cloud platform offering  Quadient announced  on 18 September  the acquisition of Daylight  an already existing partner. Daylight provides dynamic i-form  bringing increased flexibility to the Inspire solution. With Daylight becoming an integral part of the Hub  the i-form functionality will be deployed to all solutions of the Hub.Q2 2023 also brought additional external recognitions for Quadient’s SaaS solutions. Quadient’s cloud financial automation solutions have been positioned as a leader both in the 2023 SPARK MatrixTM for Accounts Receivable (AR) Application and in the SPARK MatrixTM for Accounts Payable (AP) Application.Current EBIT(2) for Intelligent Communication Automation was negative at €(3) million  i.e. an EBIT margin(2) of (2.9)%. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact recorded in H1 2023  the EBIT margin(2) would have reached (2.5)%  a strong improvement of 7.2pts compared to (9.7)% in H1 2022 (there was no IFRIC impact in H1 2022).The solid improvement in current EBIT(2) in H1 2023 confirms the upturn in profitability trend seen since the inflexion point in H1 2022. Higher go-to-market efficiency drives strong increase in current EBIT(2) despite continued investment in R&D and product developments. This improving trend is expected to continue in H2 2023 driven by the rising profitability of the installed base  the contribution from the growing revenue and careful costs control  while the negative impact from the change in business model continues to decline.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales reached €358 million in H1 2023  down (1.4)% on an organic basis and down (2.4)% on a reported basis. While North America and International recorded small increases year over year  Main European Countries showed a contained decline thanks to improving trends during the second quarter 2023 in France and in the United Kingdom.Hardware sales recorded a (4.8)% organic decline in Q2 2023  impacted by a high comparison basis in Q2 2022  especially in the United States. However  the good performance recorded in Q1 2023 led to a limited (0.9)% organic decline in the first half of the year. Quadient’s continuous investments into renewing its product offering supports this positive trend with increasing penetration of the new generation of innovative machines. In H1 2023  Quadient successfully launched the iX-1 in the US  a postage meter for small businesses and home offices. This new connected equipment combines mail and parcel processing and is mostly sold through tele-sales and digital sales. The iX-1 as well as the iX-3 answer an opportunity linked to the decertification ongoing in the US as United States Postal Service (USPS) plans to discontinue postage meters not compliant with Intelligent Mail Indicia (IMI) on 31 December 2024. At the end of H1 2023  the share of the upgraded installed base increased further  reaching 26.7% vs. 19.9% at the end of FY 2022.Subscription-related revenues (70% of Mail-Related Solutions sales) also recorded a limited (1.5)% decline in H1 2023  thanks to a solid performance in Q2  driven by the solid installed base as well as by a positive contribution from revenue related to usage and from the indexation impact of multi-year contracts.Mail-Related Solutions’ sales force are mobilized to both nurture Quadient installed base and seize cross-sell opportunities. In Q2 2023  Mail-Related Solutions recorded strong bookings leading to an increased backlog at the end of the quarter. Mail-Related Solutions also won some significant contracts in the period. For example  Quadient was selected to provide tailor-made mail production line to NBT Norway to manage rising parcel volumes. The new integrated sorting facility allows NBT Norway to scale its capacity from 2 000 to 6 000 parcels per hour and represents and investment of more than €3 million overall.Current EBIT(2) for Mail-Related Solutions was €82 million for H1 2023 including the negative IFRIC impact. Current EBIT(2) margin for H1 2023 was 23.0%  i.e. 23.4% excluding IFRIC impact. The level of profitability of Mail-Related Solutions remains high and well within the mid-term 22%-24% indicated range despite investments in sales capabilities and a small decline in gross margin.Current EBIT(2) for the Solution is expected to remain solid in FY 2023 supported by a tight focus on cost control  a continued focus on remanufacturing and a further penetration of the new generation of mail equipment.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales reached €45 million in H1 2023  a 5.5% increase on an organic basis and a 2.2% increase compared to H1 2022.Subscription-related revenues were up 10.0% organically in the first half of the year  well oriented thanks to the strong contribution from the existing installed base and the deployment of existing contracts. In Q2 2023  this was mainly driven by the performance of France and the UK that recorded double-digit growth. Subscription-related revenue stood at 61% of total revenue for Parcel Locker Solutions in H1 2023 and the usage rate of the platform remained solid  standing at 57% in H1 2023.License and hardware sales were down (3.2)% organically in H1 2023. Hardware sales suffered from a high comparison basis in Q2 2022.In Q2 2023  progress was made in securing future growth in Parcel Locker Solutions:In Japan  Quadient and Yamato signed in July the renewal of the joint venture Packcity Japan under unchanged ownership (51% Quadient / 49% Yamato). In addition  Quadient also signed with Yamato a new commercial agreement that is based on a fee per parcel whereas the previous agreement was based on fixed subscriptions per locker.In the UK  the development of Quadient’s open network made further progress with carriers’ integration being almost completed. Quadient is now ready to scale the lockers deployment thanks to secured prime locations. In Q2  new agreements have notably been signed with Homebase and other prime location sites  giving Quadient access to a base of over 8 000 sites.In France  Quadient will convert part of its existing click and collect installed base into a hybrid open network / click and collect model thanks to an agreement with Auchan  securing 400 prime locations in France. The Company also signed an agreement with another important retail real estate company to install Parcel lockers. These wins will help accelerate the deployment of the French open network in H2 2023.Quadient continues to develop and introduce innovative product lines. In Q2 2023  the new rearloading lockers were designed to meet the expectations of the higher education large configuration lockers in the US as they prevent bottlenecks between the loading and the collection of parcels.Quadient’s global installed locker base reached c.18 900 units at the end of H1 2023 vs. c.18 000 units at the end of FY 2022. Thanks to recent deals signed  Quadient is now expecting the pace of installations to intensify  more than doubling in H2 2023 vs H1 2023. This will be mostly driven by the open network strategy with installations expected to take off in the UK  the French network also expected to accelerate  and the expansion of the Japanese installed base expected to resume.Current EBIT(2) for Parcel Locker Solutions was negative at €(11) million in H1 2023  compared to €(13) million in H1 2022  i.e. an EBIT margin(2) of (24.1)%. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact regarded in H1 2023  the EBIT margin(2) would have reached (23.7)%  a robust improvement of 6.0pts compared to (29.7)% in H1 2022.The improvement in operating profitability can be explained by gross margin expansion with positive volume/mix effect as well as cost control measures. Profitability is expected to continue improving in H2 2023  following sharp improvement throughout H1. Acceleration of lockers deployments  rising profitability of the installed base and careful cost control are all expected to contribute to the increase in profitability.Lastly  profitability of the installed base continues to increase standing at 13.7% in H1 2023 against 12.5% in the FY 2022.Consolidated sales by geographiesIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change Organic change1 North America 295 287 +3.0% +4.4% Main European countries(a) 178 179 (0.2)% (1.6)% International(b) 49 58 (16.8)% +1.1% Group total 522 524 (0.3)% +2.0% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Intelligent Communication Automation  Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions outside of North America and the Main European countries as well as  in Q1 2022  other solutions previously recorded under Additional Operation and divested in Q2 2022.Sales in North America (57% of Group sales) were up 4.4% organically to €295 million and 3.0% on a reported basis. All three Solutions posted organic growth in H1 2023. Intelligent Communication Automation was the main contributor to the growth in the region with a solid double-digit organic growth. Penetration of Quadient’s cloud-based solutions continues to be well supported by successful cross-selling from the Mail customer base. Quadient’s Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable cloud solutions also performed well in the region  contributing to the overall solid performance. Mail-Related Solutions benefited from the solid penetration of recently launched products meeting the requirements brought by the ongoing USPS decertification  while Parcel Locker Solutions benefited from improving trends in the residential sector in Q2.Main European countries (34% of Group sales) were down by only (1.6)% organically and (0.2)% on a reported basis to €178 million  thanks to:the contribution from Intelligence Communication Automation  that experienced a strong customer adoption of Financial Automation cloud Solutions of the Hub  with accelerating trends in Q2 2023;the contribution from Parcel Locker Solutions  supported by the on-going deployment of existing contracts; andthe resilient performance of Mail-Related Solutions.The International segment (9% of Group sales) delivered a 1.1% organic growth  to €49 million  despite a slowdown in the expansion of the Japanese lockers network which is expected to resume following the signature of new contractual arrangements with Yamato.Q2 2023 SALESConsolidated sales stood at €266 million in the second quarter of 2023  up 1.8% on an organic basis and down (1.8)% on a reported basis compared to the second quarter of 2022.In € million Q2 2023 Q2 2022 Change Organicchange1 Intelligent Communication Automation 61 55 +10.7% +13.1% Mail-Related Solutions(a) 181 190 (4.4)% (1.6)% Parcel Locker Solutions(a) 24 24 (2.1)% +2.9% Other solutions divested in 2022 0 2 n/a n/a Group total 266 271 (1.8)% +1.8% (a) Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions have been restated to reflect the fact that they now include activities previously accounting for in Additional Operations.Intelligent Communication Automation sales were up by 13.1% on an organic basis to €61 million with positive performance from all geographies. The subscription-related revenue showed a strong organic growth at +20.4%.Mail-Related Solutions sales continued to show strong resilience  reaching €181 million in Q2  down by 1.6% on an organic basis with a solid performance in subscription-related revenue. This performance is however offset by lower hardware sales in Q2 2023 against a high comparison basis in Q2 2022 especially in the US. Of note  France and the UK recorded improving trends with only a contained organic decline and International posted a positive contribution.Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €24 million in Q2 2023  with a +2.9% organic growth compared to Q2 2022 thanks to a continued solid performance from subscription-related revenue mainly driven by double-digit organic growth in France and in the UK partially offset by decline in hardware sales.In € million Q2 2023 Q2 2022 Change Organicchange1 North America 150 152 (1.5)% +3.0% Main European countries(a) 92 90 +2.3% +0.6% International(b) 25 29 (15.6)% (0.5)% Group total 266 271 (1.8)% +1.8% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Intelligent Communication Automation  Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions outside of North America and the Main European countries.North America posted 3.0% organic growth in the quarter mainly driven by the strong double-digit organic growth in Intelligent Communication Automation.Main European Countries posted a 0.6% organic growth  fuelled by a remarkable performance of Parcel Locker Solutions  benefitting from the development of the recent contracts in France and a much contained declined in Mail-Related Solutions.International declined slightly by 0.5% organically  impacted by the temporary slowdown in the Japanese lockers expansion as mentioned above.REVIEW OF 2023 HALF-YEAR RESULTSSimplified P&LIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change Sales 522 524 (0.3)% Gross profit 389 385 +1.2% Gross margin 74.6% 73.5% EBITDA 112 111 0.5% EBITDA margin 21.5% 21.3% Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 68 65 +4.3% Current operating income margin (before acquisition related expenses) 13.0% 12.5% Current operating income 65 61 +6.8% Optimization expenses and other operating income & expenses (6) (5) n.m.

Gross margin improvement was mainly driven by a positive volume/mix impact for Parcel Lockers and Intelligent Communication Automation while Mail-Related Solution posted a contained decline.Current operating income (current EBIT) before acquisition-related expenses increased to €68 million in H1 2023 compared to €65 million in H1 2022  up 4.3% on a reported basis and 8.0% on an organic3 basis. The current EBIT(2) includes a €2.3 million negative impact from the IFRIC accounting rule related to cloud computing. Current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses stood at 13.0% of sales in H1 2023 compared to 12.5% in H1 2022. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact  the current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses would have stood at 13.5%. The Group’s operating profitability was driven by a strong improvement from software and lockers profitability due to improved gross margin and costs control. The increase in profitability also benefitted from lower freight costs.With no significant M&A activities in H1 2023  acquisition-related expenses declined to €3 million in H1 2023  compared to €5 million in H1 2022. Consequently  current operating income stood at €65 million in 2022 including the negative IFRIC impact  compared to €61 million in H1 2022.Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €6 million in H1 2023  versus €5 million in H1 2022.Consequently  operating income for H1 2023 was €59 million  versus €56 million recorded in H1 2022.Net attributable incomeH1 2023 net cost of debt was up year-on-year at €15 million  against €12 million in H1 2022. The increase is mainly due to the impact from higher interest rates on the variable portion of the debt ( 1/3 of Quadient’s debt). The currency gains & losses and other financial items were a loss of €1 million in H1 2023 versus a loss of €2 million in H1 2022. Overall  net financial result was a loss of €16 million in H1 2023 compared to a loss of €14 million in H1 2022.Income tax decreased to €6 million in H1 2023 versus €12 million in H1 2022  due to the recognition of a one-off tax benefit due to internal IP transfer  amounting to €5 million. Consequently  the corporate tax rate stood at 13.7% in H1 2023 compared to 28.8% in H1 2022. Restated from this impact  the corporate tax rate would have been comparable to last year rate.Net attributable income after minority interest amounted to €36 million in H1 2023 compared to €29 million in H1 2022  up 24.2%.Earnings per share6 stood at €1.05 in H1 2023 compared to €0.75 in H1 2022.Cash flow generationEBITDA79 was €112 million in H1 2023  representing a slight increase compared to H1 2022  hence an EBITDA margin at 21.5% in H1 2023  vs 21.3% in H1 2022.The change in working capital was negative by €57 million in H1 2023 compared to a net cash outflow of €53 million in H1 2022  reflecting the unfavorable seasonality of working capital requirement at the end of H1. Lease receivables recorded a decrease of only €16 million in H1 2023 compared to a decrease of €18 million in H1 2022  thanks to the strong resilience of the leasing portfolio.The leasing portfolio and other financing services stood at €575 million as of 31 July 2023  compared to €595 million as of 31 January 2023 impacted by the seasonality of the business and unfavorable currency impact. On an organic basis  this represents a decrease of 2.6% compared to the end of FY 2022. At the end of H1 2023  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.2% compared to c.1.6% at the end of FY 2022.Interest and taxes paid increased significantly to €35 million in H1 2023 versus the low amount of €15 million paid in H1 2022. The difference was mostly explained by the reimbursement of the 2020 tax loss carry-back measures in the US in H1 2022 as well as the impact from higher interest rates in H1 2023.Capital expenditure was up at €46 million in H1 2023  compared to €44 million in H1 2022. Development capex was down slightly at €17 million in H1 2023 after the high investment level in H1 2022  at €19 million. Rented equipment capex was up year-over-year at €17 million in H1 2023  compared to €13 million in H1 2022  thanks to the sustained level of Mail-Related Solutions hardware placements as well as the higher activity level for parcel lockers from both ongoing open-networks and contracts deployments. Of note  the level of capex for rent is expected to increase in H2 2023. The decrease in maintenance capex  to €6 million  was mostly due to the IFRIC accounting standard impact related to cloud computing investments. The increase in capex linked to IFRS 16 was driven by new office leases.Consequently  cash flow after capital expenditure was down to €(17) million in H1 2023 compared to €13 million in H1 2022 which benefited from the reimbursement of the 2020 tax loss carry-back measures in the US. Cash flow after capital expenditure is expected to benefit in H2 2023 from the usual seasonality between H1 and H2.2023 OPENING BALANCE SHEETAt the time of closing the accounts for the first half of 2023  the Group identified accounting irregularities and practices that did not comply with Group procedures attributable to the finance team responsible for Mail-Related Solutions’ Italian and Swiss subsidiaries. These accounting irregularities were detected thanks to the reorganization measures  and in particular the centralization of support functions  implemented in the first half of 2023  improving the controls in place. These measures also enabled the Group to react quickly and effectively to this situation as soon as it was detected.At this stage  the verification measures taken following the discovery of these accounting irregularities have established:the active involvement of at least two people within the finance team responsible for the Italian and Swiss Mail-Related Solutions subsidiaries the likely containment of these accounting irregularities to these local subsidiaries  andthe absence of any material impact on the FY 2022 and H1 2023 income statements.However  the results of the investigations undertaken  both internally and with the support of recognized external experts  have led the Group to record accounting adjustments relating to previous financial years. As a result  a total amount of approximately €(29) million has been recognized in shareholders’ equity(8) in the FY 2023 opening balance sheet. This amount can be broken down as follow:adjustment of differences between the local and the consolidated accounts for a net amount of 8 million euros provisions for bad debts for an amount of 14 million euros due to the application of Group accounting rules cancellation of all invoices to be issued for 7 million euros.While investigations continue  Quadient reserves the right to take legal action against the persons responsible for these accounting irregularities. As investigations are still ongoing  the Group cannot exclude additional financial impacts in the 2023 financial accounts.LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY POSITIONNet debt stood at €746 million as of 31 July 2023  a small increase against the €736 million of net financial debt recorded as of 31 January 2023 and adjusted for the aforementioned accounting corrections. In June 2023  the Group renewed its Revolving Credit Facility for an amount of €300 million with a new 5-year maturity. This revolving Credit Facility is the first sustainability linked loan of Quadient with ESG criteria based on the Group CO 2 reduction target. A €90 million stimulus participating loan was also signed in June 2023. The Group has no significant debt maturity before its €325 million 2.25% bond maturing in 2025.The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) remained broadly stable at 3.1x(4) as of 31 July 2023 versus 3.0x(4) as of 31 January 2023.

Consolidated leverage ratio stable at 1.8x excluding leasing FY 2023 outlook confirmedParis  20 September 2023 Quadient S.A. (Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  today announces its 2023 second-quarter consolidated sales and half-year results (period ended on 31 July 2023). The half-year 2023 results were approved by the Board of Directors during a meeting held on 19 September 2023.Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated: “2023 is the final year of the second phase of our “Back to Growth” strategic plan. This plan was designed to leverage and increase the penetration of our existing customers base of over 400 000 companies by selling themadditionalsolutions. This enlarged product offering has been accompanied by a continuous focus on developing our integrated B to B subscription model. This allows us to deliver stronger recurring top line growth  year after year.In addition  ourcurrent strategy was also designed to deliver growth in a profitable manner as shown by our ambitious mid-single digit organic growth at the current EBIT(2) level over the three-year period of the plan. In this respect  the 8% organic growth achieved in the first half of the year is clearly encouraging. Importantly  this performance is driven by a strong improvement in the profitability of our software business  as the evolution of the business mix towards a SaaS subscriptionmodel isalmostcompleted.The solid results achieved in the first half of 2023 demonstrate our ability to develop our integrated platform sustainably and profitably. We are therefore confident that organic growth at both revenue and current EBIT(2) levels will continue in the second part of the year enabling  the Group to successfully complete its strategic plan.”FIRST HALF-YEAR 2023 CONSOLIDATED SALESGroup sales stood at €522 million in H1 2023  a 2.0% organic growth compared to H1 2022 and a (0.3)% decrease on a reported basis. The variation includes a negative currency impact of €7 million and a negative scope effect of €5 million. The change of scope is related to the divestments of the Graphic activities in the Nordics and the Shipping business in France  both sold in June 2022.Consolidated salesand current EBIT(2)by SolutionConsolidated salesIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change Organic change(1) Intelligent Communication Automation 120 108 +10.8% +11.8% Mail-Related Solutions(a) 358 367 (2.4)% (1.4)% Parcel Locker Solutions(a) 45 44 +2.2% +5.5% Other solutions divested in 2022 0 5 n/a n/a Group total 522 524 (0.3)% +2.0% (a) Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions2022 data have been restated to reflect the fact that theynow include activities previously accounting for in Additional Operations.Current EBIT(b) and current EBIT Margin(b)H1 2023Reported H1 2023(Excluding IFRIC impact) H1 2022Reported In € million Current EBIT(c) EBIT Margin(c) Current EBIT(c) EBIT Margin(c) Current EBIT EBIT Margin Intelligent Communication Automation (3) (2.9)% (3) (2.5)% (10) (9.7)% Mail-Related Solutions(a) 82 23.0% 84 23.4% 89 24.2% Parcel Locker Solutions(a) (11) (24.1)% (11) (23.7)% (13) (29.7)% Other solutions divested in 2022 - - - - (0) - Group total 68 13.0% 70 13.5% 65 12.5%(a) Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions2022 data have been restated to reflect the fact that theynow include activities previously accounting for in Additional Operations.(b) Before acquisition-related expenses(c) 2023 current EBIT and EBIT margin were negatively impacted by the €2.3 million negative impact from the new IFRIC accounting standard for cloud computing. There was no IFRIC impact in H1 2022Intelligent Communication AutomationIn H1 2023  sales from Intelligent Communication Automation reached €120 million  up 11.8% organically and up 10.8% on a reported basis compared to H1 2022. Subscription-related revenue  which recorded a strong 20.5% organic growth  accounted for 80% of Intelligent Communication Automation total sales in H1 2023  a significant increase compared to 74% in H1 2022. Of note  pursuing the development of its offering in Europe  Quadient is experiencing strong customer adoption of its Accounts Payable (AP) and Accounts Receivable (AR) cloud solutions  with accelerating trends  especially in the UK  in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022.The share of SaaS customers reached 81% at the end of H1 2023 compared to 78% at the end of H1 2022. As the transition to the SaaS model continues to progress  the weight of license sales has decreased further representing less than 7% of Intelligent Communication Automation total sales in H1 2023. Professional services (14% of sales) also went down  recording a (17.3)% organic decline. This continued decline is due to the change in business model  cloud adoption requiring less onboarding services  and to the customer mix evolution towards mid-sized companies.At the end of H1 2023  annual recurring revenue (ARR)  which is a forward-looking indicator of future subscription-related revenue  reached €197 million  up from €187 million at the end of FY 2022  i.e. a 16.1% annualized organic(5) growth compared to the end of FY 2022. Additionally  the Group recorded a double-digit increase in AP/AR financial automation customers upsold in H1 2023 vs H1 2022.Regarding the new Quadient Hub  which unifies business communications and financial automation into one single cloud-platform  onboarding of customers progressed at a rapid pace with c. 2 500 customers having already been onboarded since its launch in April 2023. The Group remains focused on improving its overall platform offering both from a customer experience standpoint  through the addition of new features and from a service standpoint by adding new functionalities. For example  Quadient recently invested in artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities leveraging Microsoft Azure AI services. This integration of generative AI into Quadient’s cloud platform will further contribute to transforming the way organizations engage with their customers. Additionally  Quadient launched an AI-based cash application module to accelerate invoice-to-cash processes. To further complement its cloud platform offering  Quadient announced  on 18 September  the acquisition of Daylight  an already existing partner. Daylight provides dynamic i-form  bringing increased flexibility to the Inspire solution. With Daylight becoming an integral part of the Hub  the i-form functionality will be deployed to all solutions of the Hub.Q2 2023 also brought additional external recognitions for Quadient’s SaaS solutions. Quadient’s cloud financial automation solutions have been positioned as a leader both in the 2023 SPARK MatrixTM for Accounts Receivable (AR) Application and in the SPARK MatrixTM for Accounts Payable (AP) Application.Current EBIT(2) for Intelligent Communication Automation was negative at €(3) million  i.e. an EBIT margin(2) of (2.9)%. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact recorded in H1 2023  the EBIT margin(2) would have reached (2.5)%  a strong improvement of 7.2pts compared to (9.7)% in H1 2022 (there was no IFRIC impact in H1 2022).The solid improvement in current EBIT(2) in H1 2023 confirms the upturn in profitability trend seen since the inflexion point in H1 2022. Higher go-to-market efficiency drives strong increase in current EBIT(2) despite continued investment in R&D and product developments. This improving trend is expected to continue in H2 2023 driven by the rising profitability of the installed base  the contribution from the growing revenue and careful costs control  while the negative impact from the change in business model continues to decline.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales reached €358 million in H1 2023  down (1.4)% on an organic basis and down (2.4)% on a reported basis. While North America and International recorded small increases year over year  Main European Countries showed a contained decline thanks to improving trends during the second quarter 2023 in France and in the United Kingdom.Hardware sales recorded a (4.8)% organic decline in Q2 2023  impacted by a high comparison basis in Q2 2022  especially in the United States. However  the good performance recorded in Q1 2023 led to a limited (0.9)% organic decline in the first half of the year. Quadient’s continuous investments into renewing its product offering supports this positive trend with increasing penetration of the new generation of innovative machines. In H1 2023  Quadient successfully launched the iX-1 in the US  a postage meter for small businesses and home offices. This new connected equipment combines mail and parcel processing and is mostly sold through tele-sales and digital sales. The iX-1 as well as the iX-3 answer an opportunity linked to the decertification ongoing in the US as United States Postal Service (USPS) plans to discontinue postage meters not compliant with Intelligent Mail Indicia (IMI) on 31 December 2024. At the end of H1 2023  the share of the upgraded installed base increased further  reaching 26.7% vs. 19.9% at the end of FY 2022.Subscription-related revenues (70% of Mail-Related Solutions sales) also recorded a limited (1.5)% decline in H1 2023  thanks to a solid performance in Q2  driven by the solid installed base as well as by a positive contribution from revenue related to usage and from the indexation impact of multi-year contracts.Mail-Related Solutions’ sales force are mobilized to both nurture Quadient installed base and seize cross-sell opportunities. In Q2 2023  Mail-Related Solutions recorded strong bookings leading to an increased backlog at the end of the quarter. Mail-Related Solutions also won some significant contracts in the period. For example  Quadient was selected to provide tailor-made mail production line to NBT Norway to manage rising parcel volumes. The new integrated sorting facility allows NBT Norway to scale its capacity from 2 000 to 6 000 parcels per hour and represents and investment of more than €3 million overall.Current EBIT(2) for Mail-Related Solutions was €82 million for H1 2023 including the negative IFRIC impact. Current EBIT(2) margin for H1 2023 was 23.0%  i.e. 23.4% excluding IFRIC impact. The level of profitability of Mail-Related Solutions remains high and well within the mid-term 22%-24% indicated range despite investments in sales capabilities and a small decline in gross margin.Current EBIT(2) for the Solution is expected to remain solid in FY 2023 supported by a tight focus on cost control  a continued focus on remanufacturing and a further penetration of the new generation of mail equipment.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales reached €45 million in H1 2023  a 5.5% increase on an organic basis and a 2.2% increase compared to H1 2022.Subscription-related revenues were up 10.0% organically in the first half of the year  well oriented thanks to the strong contribution from the existing installed base and the deployment of existing contracts. In Q2 2023  this was mainly driven by the performance of France and the UK that recorded double-digit growth. Subscription-related revenue stood at 61% of total revenue for Parcel Locker Solutions in H1 2023 and the usage rate of the platform remained solid  standing at 57% in H1 2023.License and hardware sales were down (3.2)% organically in H1 2023. Hardware sales suffered from a high comparison basis in Q2 2022.In Q2 2023  progress was made in securing future growth in Parcel Locker Solutions:In Japan  Quadient and Yamato signed in July the renewal of the joint venture Packcity Japan under unchanged ownership (51% Quadient / 49% Yamato). In addition  Quadient also signed with Yamato a new commercial agreement that is based on a fee per parcel whereas the previous agreement was based on fixed subscriptions per locker.In the UK  the development of Quadient’s open network made further progress with carriers’ integration being almost completed. Quadient is now ready to scale the lockers deployment thanks to secured prime locations. In Q2  new agreements have notably been signed with Homebase and other prime location sites  giving Quadient access to a base of over 8 000 sites.In France  Quadient will convert part of its existing click and collect installed base into a hybrid open network / click and collect model thanks to an agreement with Auchan  securing 400 prime locations in France. The Company also signed an agreement with another important retail real estate company to install Parcel lockers. These wins will help accelerate the deployment of the French open network in H2 2023.Quadient continues to develop and introduce innovative product lines. In Q2 2023  the new rearloading lockers were designed to meet the expectations of the higher education large configuration lockers in the US as they prevent bottlenecks between the loading and the collection of parcels.Quadient’s global installed locker base reached c.18 900 units at the end of H1 2023 vs. c.18 000 units at the end of FY 2022. Thanks to recent deals signed  Quadient is now expecting the pace of installations to intensify  more than doubling in H2 2023 vs H1 2023. This will be mostly driven by the open network strategy with installations expected to take off in the UK  the French network also expected to accelerate  and the expansion of the Japanese installed base expected to resume.Current EBIT(2) for Parcel Locker Solutions was negative at €(11) million in H1 2023  compared to €(13) million in H1 2022  i.e. an EBIT margin(2) of (24.1)%. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact regarded in H1 2023  the EBIT margin(2) would have reached (23.7)%  a robust improvement of 6.0pts compared to (29.7)% in H1 2022.The improvement in operating profitability can be explained by gross margin expansion with positive volume/mix effect as well as cost control measures. Profitability is expected to continue improvingin H2 2023  following sharp improvement throughout H1. Acceleration of lockers deployments  rising profitability of the installed base and careful cost control are all expected to contribute to the increase in profitability.Lastly  profitability of the installed base continues to increase standing at 13.7% in H1 2023 against 12.5% in the FY 2022.Consolidated sales by geographiesIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change Organic change1 North America 295 287 +3.0% +4.4% Main European countries(a) 178 179 (0.2)% (1.6)% International(b) 49 58 (16.8)% +1.1% Group total 522 524 (0.3)% +2.0% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Intelligent Communication Automation  Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions outside of North America and the Main European countries as well as  in Q1 2022  other solutions previously recorded under Additional Operation and divested in Q2 2022.Sales in North America (57% of Group sales) were up 4.4% organically to €295 million and 3.0% on a reported basis. All three Solutions posted organic growth in H1 2023. Intelligent Communication Automation was the main contributor to the growth in the region with a solid double-digit organic growth. Penetration of Quadient’s cloud-based solutions continues to be well supported by successful cross-selling from the Mail customer base. Quadient’s Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable cloud solutions also performed well in the region  contributing to the overall solid performance. Mail-Related Solutions benefited from the solid penetration of recently launched products meeting the requirements brought by the ongoing USPS decertification  while Parcel Locker Solutions benefited from improving trends in the residential sector in Q2.Main European countries (34% of Group sales) were down by only (1.6)% organically and (0.2)% on a reported basis to €178 million  thanks to:the contribution from Intelligence Communication Automation  that experienced a strong customer adoption of Financial Automation cloud Solutions of the Hub  with accelerating trends in Q2 2023;the contribution from Parcel Locker Solutions  supported by the on-going deployment of existing contracts; andthe resilient performance of Mail-Related Solutions.The International segment (9% of Group sales) delivered a 1.1% organic growth  to €49 million  despite a slowdown in the expansion of the Japanese lockers network which is expected to resume following the signature of new contractual arrangements with Yamato.Q2 2023 SALESConsolidated sales stood at €266 million in the second quarter of 2023  up 1.8% on an organic basis and down (1.8)% on a reported basis compared to the second quarter of 2022.In € million Q2 2023 Q2 2022 Change Organicchange1 Intelligent Communication Automation 61 55 +10.7% +13.1% Mail-Related Solutions(a) 181 190 (4.4)% (1.6)% Parcel Locker Solutions(a) 24 24 (2.1)% +2.9% Other solutions divested in 2022 0 2 n/a n/a Group total 266 271 (1.8)% +1.8% (a) Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions have been restated to reflect the fact that they now include activities previously accounting for in Additional Operations.Intelligent Communication Automation sales were up by 13.1% on an organic basis to €61 million with positive performance from all geographies. The subscription-related revenue showed a strong organic growth at +20.4%.Mail-Related Solutions sales continued to show strong resilience  reaching €181 million in Q2  down by 1.6% on an organic basis with a solid performance in subscription-related revenue. This performance is however offset by lower hardware sales in Q2 2023 against a high comparison basis in Q2 2022 especially in the US. Of note  France and the UK recorded improving trends with only a contained organic decline and International posted a positive contribution.Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €24 million in Q2 2023  with a +2.9% organic growth compared to Q2 2022 thanks to a continued solid performance from subscription-related revenue mainly driven by double-digit organic growth in France and in the UK partially offset by decline in hardware sales.In € million Q2 2023 Q2 2022 Change Organicchange1 North America 150 152 (1.5)% +3.0% Main European countries(a) 92 90 +2.3% +0.6% International(b) 25 29 (15.6)% (0.5)% Group total 266 271 (1.8)% +1.8% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Intelligent Communication Automation  Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions outside of North America and the Main European countries.North America posted 3.0% organic growth in the quarter mainly driven by the strong double-digit organic growth in Intelligent Communication Automation.Main European Countries posted a 0.6% organic growth  fuelled by a remarkable performance of Parcel Locker Solutions  benefitting from the development of the recent contracts in France and a much contained declined in Mail-Related Solutions.International declined slightly by 0.5% organically  impacted by the temporary slowdown in the Japanese lockers expansion as mentioned above.REVIEW OF 2023HALF-YEAR RESULTSSimplified P&LIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change Sales 522 524 (0.3)% Gross profit 389 385 +1.2% Gross margin 74.6% 73.5% EBITDA 112 111 0.5% EBITDA margin 21.5% 21.3% Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 68 65 +4.3% Current operating income margin (before acquisition related expenses) 13.0% 12.5% Current operating income 65 61 +6.8% Optimization expenses and other operating income & expenses (6) (5) n.m.

Net attributable income 36 29 +24.2% Earnings per share 1.05 0.75 Diluted earnings per share 1.05 0.75Gross marginimproved to 74.6% in H1 2023 compared to 73.5% in H1 2022. Gross margin improvement was mainly driven by a positive volume/mix impact for Parcel Lockers and Intelligent Communication Automation while Mail-Related Solution posted a contained decline.Current operating income (current EBIT) before acquisition-related expensesincreased to €68 million in H1 2023 compared to €65 million in H1 2022  up 4.3% on a reported basis and 8.0% on an organic3 basis. The current EBIT(2) includes a €2.3 million negative impact from the IFRIC accounting rule related to cloud computing. Current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses stood at 13.0% of sales in H1 2023 compared to 12.5% in H1 2022. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact  the current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses would have stood at 13.5%. The Group’s operating profitability was driven by a strong improvement from software and lockers profitability due to improved gross margin and costs control. The increase in profitability also benefitted from lower freight costs.With no significant M&A activities in H1 2023  acquisition-related expenses declined to €3 million in H1 2023  compared to €5 million in H1 2022. Consequently  current operating income stood at €65 million in 2022 including the negative IFRIC impact  compared to €61 million in H1 2022.Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €6 million in H1 2023  versus €5 million in H1 2022.Consequently  operating income for H1 2023 was €59 million  versus €56 million recorded in H1 2022.Net attributable incomeH1 2023 net cost of debt was up year-on-year at €15 million  against €12 million in H1 2022. The increase is mainly due to the impact from higher interest rates on the variable portion of the debt ( 1/3 of Quadient’s debt). The currency gains & losses and other financial items were a loss of €1 million in H1 2023 versus a loss of €2 million in H1 2022. Overall  net financial result was a loss of €16 million in H1 2023 compared to a loss of €14 million in H1 2022.Income tax decreased to €6 million in H1 2023 versus €12 million in H1 2022  due to the recognition of a one-off tax benefit due to internal IP transfer  amounting to €5 million. Consequently  the corporate tax rate stood at 13.7% in H1 2023 compared to 28.8% in H1 2022. Restated from this impact  the corporate tax rate would have been comparable to last year rate.Net attributable income after minority interest amounted to €36 million in H1 2023 compared to €29 million in H1 2022  up 24.2%.Earnings per share6 stood at €1.05 in H1 2023 compared to €0.75 in H1 2022.Cash flow generationEBITDA79 was €112 million in H1 2023  representing a slight increase compared to H1 2022  hence an EBITDA margin at 21.5% in H1 2023  vs 21.3% in H1 2022.The change in working capital was negative by €57 million in H1 2023 compared to a net cash outflow of €53 million in H1 2022  reflecting the unfavorable seasonality of working capital requirement at the end of H1. Lease receivables recorded a decrease of only €16 million in H1 2023 compared to a decrease of €18 million in H1 2022  thanks to the strong resilience of the leasing portfolio.The leasing portfolio and other financing services stood at €575 million as of 31 July 2023  compared to €595 million as of 31 January 2023 impacted by the seasonality of the business and unfavorable currency impact. On an organic basis  this represents a decrease of 2.6% compared to the end of FY 2022. At the end of H1 2023  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.2% compared to c.1.6% at the end of FY 2022.Interest and taxes paid increased significantly to €35 million in H1 2023 versus the low amount of €15 million paid in H1 2022. The difference was mostly explained by the reimbursement of the 2020 tax loss carry-back measures in the US in H1 2022 as well as the impact from higher interest rates in H1 2023.Capital expenditure was up at €46 million in H1 2023  compared to €44 million in H1 2022. Development capex was down slightly at €17 million in H1 2023 after the high investment level in H1 2022  at €19 million. Rented equipment capex was up year-over-year at €17 million in H1 2023  compared to €13 million in H1 2022  thanks to the sustained level of Mail-Related Solutions hardware placements as well as the higher activity level for parcel lockers from both ongoing open-networks and contracts deployments. Of note  the level of capex for rent is expected to increase in H2 2023. The decrease in maintenance capex  to €6 million  was mostly due to the IFRIC accounting standard impact related to cloud computing investments. The increase in capex linked to IFRS 16 was driven by new office leases.Consequently  cash flow after capital expenditure was down to €(17) million in H1 2023 compared to €13 million in H1 2022 which benefited from the reimbursement of the 2020 tax loss carry-back measures in the US. Cash flow after capital expenditure is expected to benefit in H2 2023 from the usual seasonality between H1 and H2.2023 OPENING BALANCE SHEETAt the time of closing the accounts for the first half of 2023  the Group identified accounting irregularities and practices that did not comply with Group procedures attributable to the finance team responsible for Mail-Related Solutions’ Italian and Swiss subsidiaries. These accounting irregularities were detected thanks to the reorganization measures  and in particular the centralization of support functions  implemented in the first half of 2023  improving the controls in place. These measures also enabled the Group to react quickly and effectively to this situation as soon as it was detected.At this stage  the verification measures taken following the discovery of these accounting irregularities have established:the active involvement of at least two people within the finance team responsible for the Italian and Swiss Mail-Related Solutions subsidiaries the likely containment of these accounting irregularities to these local subsidiaries  andthe absence of any material impact on the FY 2022 and H1 2023 income statements.However  the results of the investigations undertaken  both internally and with the support of recognized external experts  have led the Group to record accounting adjustments relating to previous financial years. As a result  a total amount of approximately €(29) million has been recognized in shareholders’ equity(8) in the FY 2023 opening balance sheet. This amount can be broken down as follow:adjustment of differences between the local and the consolidated accounts for a net amount of 8 million euros provisions for bad debts for an amount of 14 million euros due to the application of Group accounting rules cancellation of all invoices to be issued for 7 million euros.While investigations continue  Quadient reserves the right to take legal action against the persons responsible for these accounting irregularities. As investigations are still ongoing  the Group cannot exclude additional financial impacts in the 2023 financial accounts.LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY POSITIONNet debt stood at €746 million as of 31 July 2023  a small increase against the €736 million of net financial debt recorded as of 31 January 2023 and adjusted for the aforementioned accounting corrections. In June 2023  the Group renewed its Revolving Credit Facility for an amount of €300 million with a new 5-year maturity.

The Group has no significant debt maturity before its €325 million 2.25% bond maturing in 2025.The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) remained broadly stable at 3.1x(4) as of 31 July 2023 versus 3.0x(4) as of 31 January 2023. Excluding leasing  the leverage ratio was also stable to 1.8x(4) as of 31 July 2023 vs 1.8x(4) as of 31 January 2023.

The current EBITDA margin  which stands at 11%  is lower than last year but in line with the group's expectations for the first half thanks to good control of margins and structural costs.This first part of the year also demonstrated Prodways' ability to remain profitable and maintain sound financial discipline in this transition year of 2023 with the launch of the BOOST plan. The company generated €4.6 million of cash from operations[1] and received €4 million from the sale of its stake in the company Biotech Dental.Overall  the company's net profit stood at €3.6 million  above the level of the first half of 2022.P&L statement of the first half 2023( in €million) H1 2023 H1 2022 Variation(€m) % Revenues 43.0 41.5 +1.6 +4%-1% org.

This effect is partially offset by the good performance of recurring sales of 3D Materials  which constitute a solid revenue base year after year.The Products division has seen good momentum since the start of the year  with growth of +26% in the first half of 2023  including +12% organic growth. This performance is driven by the increase in orders in Digital Manufacturing  both in France and Germany  the continued growth of audiology and external growth with the acquisition of Auditech in 2022.A dedicated press release on turnover for the first half of 2023 was published on July 24 (link to the press release).A current EBITDA margin of 11%Prodways Group achieved a current EBITDA of €4.8 million in the first half of 2023  below last year's level but in line with its expectations in this 2023 year of transition and investment.The decrease in profitability compared to the first half of 2022 is explained by the unfavorable base effect due to abnormal seasonality in 2022  the exceptional impact of +€900 thousands linked to a debt waiver last year and by the increase in the workforce  announced several months ago in the context of the launch of the BOOST plan.The current EBITDA margin thus stands at 11% thanks to the good control of the group's gross margin  which remains around 50%  and structural costs.Results by division [4](in €million) H1 2023 H1 2022 Variation€m Variation% Systems Revenues 24.0 26.4 -2.5 -9% Current EBITDA 2.5 6.0 -3.5 -58% Current EBITDA margin (%) 10% 22.7% -12.3 pts - Income from ordinary activities 1.7 5.0 -3.3 -66% Products Revenues 19.1 15.3 +3.9 26% Current EBITDA 3.0 2.3 +0.7 30% Current EBITDA margin (%) 16% 15.1% 0.6 pts - Income from ordinary activities 1.4 0.8 +0.6 n.aAn increasing net resultMaintaining healthy profitability  combined with the sale of a minority stake in the company Biotech Dental Smilers  allows Prodways Group to achieve a net profit of €3.6 million in the first half of 2023  slightly above the level of the first half 2022.This stake was acquired in 2014 for €1.1 million in a context of the emergence of 3D printing for the production of orthodontic alignment trays. It generated €4 million of cash in April 2023 and a significant capital gain of €2.9 million.This investment made it possible to establish a long-term partnership with Biotech Dental  which has become the French champion of highly technological dental care by introducing digital workflow to dentists. The company relied in particular on the MOVINGLight® technology developed by Prodways  combined with new developments of 3D materials dedicated to orthodontics.This sale took place during the acquisition of a majority stake in Biotech Dental by the American medical giant Henry Schein  also a client of Prodways Group. This customer recently ordered 3 new MovingLight LD20 printers to complete its production capacity  which now stands at 17 printers.Prodways maintains a solid financial positionProdways Group generated €4.6m in cash flow from operations[5] in the first half  demonstrating its ability to convert earnings into cash effectively and to finance its development plan.This performance was partially offset by the abnormally high peak in working capital requirements at 30 June 2023 (+€1.5m compared with 31 December 2022)  due to the harmonization of the Group's accounting tools  which resulted in payment delays. The Working capital requirements should decrease by the end of 2023.As a result  Prodways Group's financial position once again reflects the discipline that the Group has demonstrated for many years. With €15m of available cash  Prodways Group has net debt5 of €0.9m (compared with € -3.3m at the end of 2022).The consolidated financial statements are available in the appendix at the end of this press release.Outlook : positive signals for 2024Despite the downward revision of the 2023 outlook during this year of preparation and transition  the various actions deployed internally and with the group's customers since the start of the year lead Prodways to share its confidence in the future growth trajectory. The large-scale industrial projects currently under negotiation are moving forward with various successful technical evaluations which enable milestones to be reached. In the event of significant new commercial success  part of this work could turn into orders towards the end of 2023 or the beginning of 2024 with several dozen orders for MovingLight® printers  associated with large volumes of 3D materials.Signals regarding the consumption of 3D materials are also well oriented for existing customers. Several large consumers of the group have already indicated their intentions to increase their consumption through framework contracts for increasing deliveries of materials in 2024.The start of the geographic expansion of Software 3D activity began in the first half of the year in Germany and the United Kingdom and makes it possible to address a new network of industrial SMEs in the Prodways coverage area for its 3D printers and services. printing on demand.Activities with a shorter sales cycle are currently preparing to increase their production capacity in 2024 and to follow the trend of increasing the number of customers  which should be reinforced by the dynamism of the sales teams. The Digital Manufacturing activity was equipped with a new printer in the second quarter and the audiology activity is optimizing the organization of end-user impressions as well as production flows.The performance for the first half of 2023 confirms the revenue and profitability outlook communicated in June for the year 2023  of around +5% revenue growth and around 8% current EBITDA margin.About Prodways GroupProdways Group is a specialist in industrial and professional 3D printing with a unique positioning as an integrated European player.

The trial met its primary endpoint  with a statistically significant higher percentage of patients achieving a clinically meaningful cholestasis response compared to patients who received placebo. 51% of patients on elafibranor 80mg achieved a cholestasis response compared with 4% on placebo (p<0.0001). The first key secondary endpoint  normalization of ALP at Week 52  was also met with statistically significant improvements for investigational elafibranor compared with placebo. For the other key secondary endpoint  a trend for pruritus improvement was observed with a greater decrease from baseline in the PBC Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale score for patients on elafibranor compared to placebo  which did not reach statistical significance. In the study  elafibranor was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with that observed in previously reported studies.ACLF franchise2GENFIT’s Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) franchise now comprises 5 assets (VS-01  NTZ  SRT-015  CLM-022  VS-02-HE) based on differentiated mechanisms of action leveraging complementary pathways.VS-01-ACLF: First patient randomized in the Phase 2 trialVS-01 is currently being evaluated in the international UNVEIL-IT™ Phase 2  open-label  randomized  controlled  multi-center  proof of concept study to assess its efficacy  safety  and tolerability in addition to standard of care (SOC)  compared to SOC alone  in adult patients with ACLF grades 1 and 2 and ascites.The Investigational New Drug (IND) was in effect as of April 17  2023  and the first patient was randomized in the Phase 2 trial in early July. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 60 adult patients with ACLF grades 1 and 2. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either daily intraperitoneal administration of VS-01 over 4 days on top of SOC (active treatment group) or SOC alone (control group).NTZ in ACLF: Phase 1 clinical data presented at DDW®Data presented in May 2023 at Digestive Disease Week® (DDW®) showed that nitazoxanide (NTZ) was generally safe and well tolerated in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. Preliminary data from a similar Phase 1 study also showed that NTZ was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile in subjects with renal impairment.Following engagement with the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  and on the basis of the preclinical work and phase 1 data confirming the potential of NTZ in ACLF  GENFIT has decided to pursue the development of a new nitazoxanide formulation  which will permit greater dosing flexibility.ASK1 Inhibitor SRT-015 in acute liver diseaseIn May 2023  GENFIT licensed the exclusive worldwide rights of ASK1 Inhibitor SRT-015 (injectable formulation in acute liver disease) from Seal Rock Therapeutics  a Seattle  Washington (USA) based clinical stage company developing potential first-in-class and best-in-class kinase inhibitors.Preclinical and clinical evidence support ASK1 inhibition as a relevant therapeutic strategy in multi-system disorders such as ACLF. ASK1 inhibition has shown several potentially beneficial effects that may be relevant in ACLF  such as blocking LPS (lipopolysaccharide) associated hyperinflammatory response  reducing the ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species)-related immune response  reducing apoptosis  reducing release of the proinflammatory cytokines  reducing fibrosis  and protecting macrophage mitochondrial function. Multi-organ benefits have been observed in several animal models and clinical trials.Under the terms of the agreement  Seal Rock Therapeutics is eligible for payments of up to €100 million  including regulatory  clinical  and commercial milestone payments  plus tiered royalties. This agreement does not have any material impact on our current financial forecast  as specified in Part III of this press release.CLM-022 in liver disease treatmentIn July 2023  GENFIT licensed the exclusive worldwide rights of CLM-022  a potential first-in-class inflammasome inhibitor  from Celloram Inc.  a Cleveland  Ohio (USA) based biotechnology company.

It amounted to 3.6% of 2023 revenue compared with 2.5% in 2022. The increase was chiefly the result of improved earnings at Cegedim Santé and businesses in the UK (catering to both healthcare professionals and insurers)  as well as strong performances in human resources  data  and marketing activities.Other non-recurring operating income and expenses(1): the first-half 2023 figure came to an expense of €1.4 million  compared with a €4.4 million expense in the year-earlier period  and comprised restructuring costs.-------------(1) Alternative performance indicator See pages 110-111 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.(2) At constant scope and exchange rates.Depreciation and amortization expenses: this item rose €3.3 million including a €1.4 million increase in R&D amortization compared with 2022.EBITDA(1): the €7.2 million increase between first half 2023 and first half 2022 was a result of revenue growth and good management of personnel costs.Financial result: was a loss of -€5.6 million compared with a -€4.4 million loss in H1 2022. Most of the expense was related to the cost of debt  which increased €1.5 million over the period.Tax: tax increased €8.9 million in the first half of 2023 compared with the year-earlier period  notably due to the recognition of a deferred tax expense of €9.5 million during the period. This entry  which had no cash impact  was done to adjust the value of deferred tax assets on the balance sheet. In response to a tax ruling in July 2023  the Group opted for a more conservative assessment of the unrealized future gains from its remaining tax-loss carryforwards (see Highlights section below).Analysis of business trends by divisionin millions of euros Total Software & services Flow Data & Marketing BPO Corporate and others Revenue 2022 267.6 145.6 45.2 50.0 25.4 1.3 2023 301.0 161.5 48.2 54.9 32.8 3.5 Change 12.5% 10.9% 6.7% 9.9% 29.3% 160.9% Recurring operating income 2022 6.8 -7.6 6.3 6.1 1.0 1.0 2023 10.7 -2.0 5.6 6.6 1.4 -0.9 Change 57.0% 73.5% -10.8% 8.2% 34.4% -186.7% Recurring operating margin (as a % of revenues) 2022 2.5% -5.2% 14.0% 12.1% 4.0% 74.5% 2023 3.6% -1.2% 11.7% 11.9% 4.2% -24.7%Software & Services: H1 2023 revenues rose 10.9%  driven by good performances at Cegedim Santé (+25% in H1  o/w €4.3 million related to Ségur de la Santé public health investments)  international businesses (+10% on new signings with pharmacies  new sites for doctors in Scotland  and projects for the UK Ministry of Defence)  and HR solutions (+10% over the full year).Recurring operating income (REBIT)(1) amounted to a loss of €2.0 million in H1 2023  a €5.6 million improvement compared with the €7.6 million loss a year earlier. The improvement came from two main sources: Cegedim Santé (REBIT(1) up €4.9 million)  which saw robust business activity and kept hiring under control; and international businesses (REBIT(1) up €2.8 million)  due to a rebound in revenues and cost structure adjustments. The other companies in the division posted a €2.2 million decrease in REBIT(1) compared with 2022. The fine performance at HR solutions was obscured by delays starting up production in the Insurance segment and by the delay until H2 of the Ségur de la Santé public health investments’ impact on the Pharmacy division in France.Software & Services First half Change2023 / 2022in millions of euros 2023 2022 Revenue 161.5 145.6 15.9 10.9% Cegedim Santé 39.8 31.8 8.0 25.1% Insurance  HR  Pharmacies  and other services 95.3 89.8 5.6 6.2% International businesses 26.3 24.0 2.4 9.8% Recurring operating income(1) -2.0 -7.6 5.6 73.5% Cegedim Santé -1.4 -6.3 4.9 77.7% Insurance  HR  Pharmacies  and other services 3.8 5.9 -2.2 -36.6% International businesses -4.4 -7.2 2.8 39.4%-------------(1) Alternative performance indicator See pages 110-111 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.Flow : revenues rose 6.7%  led by Cegedim e-business (process digitalization and electronic data flows)  whose French and international businesses grew 6% and 18% respectively.

Corporate and others: H1 2023 REBIT(1) was a €0.9 million loss  down €1.9 compared with H1 2022. As we explained when presenting 2022 results  the deterioration was caused by an effort to standardize methods for reinvoicing corporate office activities  notably in the areas of R&D and IT systems  as well as lower margins at the offshore corporate centers.---------(1) Alternative performance indicator See pages 110-111 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.HighlightsApart from the items cited below  to the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no events or changes during H1 2023 that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.TaxOn February 21  2018  Cegedim S.A. received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for 2015 and 2016. The audit resulted in a reassessment notice covering the use of tax-loss carryforwards  which the authorities disputed. On February 21  2021  Cegedim S.A. received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for 2019 and 2020. That audit did not result in any additional reassessments.After consultation with its lawyers and based on the applicable tax law and existing tax rulings  the Group believes that the tax authorities’ proposed reassessment is unwarranted. Cegedim S.A. has appealed the decision and continues to explore its options for contesting the reassessment.Over the first half of 2023  Cegedim S.A. continued to apply the disputed tax-loss carryforwards to its taxable earnings  bringing cumulative tax savings to €24.4 million at June 30  2023.Furthermore  as it is permitted to do under this process  in the first half of 2022 tax authorities issued Cegedim S.A. a notice of collection  in response to which the Group paid a total of €12.1 million in respect of tax loss carryforwards used through 2020 and a €0.4 million late payment penalty. The corresponding entry for these payments was not recognized in expenses  but rather as a tax receivable in the balance sheet  as the Company expects these sums to be repaid once the dispute has been resolved in its favor.As a result  if Cegedim S.A. ultimately loses its appeal  it would have to record a tax charge of €24.4 million in its profit and loss statement  but it would only have to make a cash payment of €12.3 million for the share of taxes not yet paid.In addition  in accordance with IFRS  Cegedim S.A. records in its consolidated financial statements a deferred tax asset in respect of its unused tax-loss carryforwards  which represents the future tax gain the company may yet realize. Note that the accounting entries related to deferred tax never have cash impact. Through December 31  2022  deferred tax assets were unchanged at €20 million. At June 30  2023  those assets amounted to €10.5 million owing to a €9.5 million downward adjustment recorded in deferred tax expenses in the consolidated profit and loss statements. In response to a recent tax ruling in July 2023  the Group opted for a more conservative assessment of the unrealized future gains from its remaining  disputed tax-loss carryforwards.If Cegedim S.A. ultimately loses its appeal  the entirety of the deferred tax assets in the balance sheet at June 30  2023  would have to be recorded as a €10.5 million charge in the profit and loss statements  with no cash outlay.Cegedim S.A.  in consultation with its attorneys  believes that it still has a solid case for dismissal of the reassessment  consistently with the position currently reflected in its financial statements. As a result  Cegedim is preparing to appeal the dispute to the administrative court  an effort which could take several years. Cegedim is confident in its chances of success and has not recorded any provisions in respect of the dispute.The maximum amount of risk from the potential tax charges cited above is expected to remain constant at €34.9 million  but the breakdown could change: the €10.5 million deferred tax asset would decrease as tax savings are realized  incrementally increasing the €24.4 million already used.The maximum potential cash payment  which came to €12.3 million at June 30  2023  will continue to rise as future tax savings are realized  but could also decrease if the tax authorities issue additional notices of collection while the appeal is ongoing.Significant transactions and events post June 30  2023Apart from the items cited below  to the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no events or changes during the period that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.War in UkraineThe Group does not do business in Russia or Ukraine and has no assets exposed to those countries.OutlookDespite the economic  geopolitical and monetary uncertainties facing the world  we are confident we will be able to grow our revenues. Based on the currently available information  the Group expects 2023 like-for-like revenue(2) growth to be at least 10% relative to 2022.Recurring operating income(1) is expected to grow  notably thanks to the initial returns on investments made in Cegedim Santé and international activities.These targets may need to be revised if there is a resurgence in the Covid-19 pandemic and/or a significant worsening of geopolitical and macroeconomic risks.The Group does not expect to make any significant acquisitions in 2023.---------------The Audit Committee met on September 18  2023.

The positive scope effect of €1.7 million  or 0.7%  was attributable to the first-time consolidation in Cegedim’s accounts of new acquisitions Kobus Tech  MesDocteurs  Laponi  Sedia  and Clinityx. The negative currency impact of was €0.7 million  or 0.3%.Like-for-like(1) revenue increased 12.1% over the period.Recurring operating income(1): rose €3.9 million to €10.7 million in H1 2023 compared with €6.8 million in 2022. It amounted to 3.6% of 2023 revenue compared with 2.5% in 2022. The increase was chiefly the result of improved earnings at Cegedim Santé and businesses in the UK (catering to both healthcare professionals and insurers)  as well as strong performances in humanresources  data  and marketing activities.Other non-recurring operating income and expenses(1): the first-half 2023 figure came to an expense of €1.4 million  compared with a €4.4 million expense in the year-earlier period  and comprised restructuring costs.-------------(1) Alternative performance indicator See pages 110-111 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.(2) At constant scope and exchange rates.Depreciation and amortization expenses: this item rose €3.3 million including a €1.4 million increase in R&D amortization compared with 2022.EBITDA(1): the €7.2 million increase between first half 2023 and first half 2022 was a result of revenue growth and good management of personnel costs.Financial result: was a loss of -€5.6 million compared with a -€4.4 million loss in H1 2022. Most of the expense was related to the cost of debt  which increased €1.5 million over the period.Tax: tax increased €8.9 million in the first half of 2023 compared with the year-earlier period  notably due to the recognition of a deferred tax expense of €9.5 million during the period. This entry  which had no cash impact  was done to adjust the value of deferred tax assets on the balance sheet. In response to a tax ruling in July 2023  the Group opted for a more conservative assessment of the unrealized future gains from its remaining tax-loss carryforwards (see Highlights section below).Analysis of business trends by divisionin millions of euros Total Software & services Flow Data & Marketing BPO Corporate and others Revenue 2022 267.6 145.6 45.2 50.0 25.4 1.3 2023 301.0 161.5 48.2 54.9 32.8 3.5 Change 12.5% 10.9% 6.7% 9.9% 29.3% 160.9% Recurring operating income 2022 6.8 -7.6 6.3 6.1 1.0 1.0 2023 10.7 -2.0 5.6 6.6 1.4 -0.9 Change 57.0% 73.5% -10.8% 8.2% 34.4% -186.7% Recurring operating margin (as a % of revenues) 2022 2.5% -5.2% 14.0% 12.1% 4.0% 74.5% 2023 3.6% -1.2% 11.7% 11.9% 4.2% -24.7%Software & Services: H1 2023 revenues rose 10.9%  driven by good performances at CegedimSanté (+25% in H1  o/w €4.3 million related to Ségur de la Santé public health investments)  internationalbusinesses (+10% on new signings with pharmacies  new sites for doctors in Scotland  and projects for the UK Ministry of Defence)  and HRsolutions (+10% over the full year).Recurring operating income (REBIT)(1) amounted to a loss of €2.0 million in H1 2023  a €5.6 million improvement compared with the €7.6 million loss a year earlier. The improvement came from two main sources: Cegedim Santé (REBIT(1) up €4.9 million)  which saw robust business activity and kept hiring under control; and international businesses (REBIT(1) up €2.8 million)  due to a rebound in revenues and cost structure adjustments. The other companies in the division posted a €2.2 million decrease in REBIT(1) compared with 2022. The fine performance at HRsolutions was obscured by delays starting up production in the Insurance segment and by the delay until H2 of the Ségur de la Santé public health investments’ impact on the Pharmacy division in France.Software & Services First half Change2023 / 2022in millions of euros 2023 2022 Revenue 161.5 145.6 15.9 10.9% Cegedim Santé 39.8 31.8 8.0 25.1% Insurance  HR  Pharmacies  and other services 95.3 89.8 5.6 6.2% International businesses 26.3 24.0 2.4 9.8% Recurring operating income(1) -2.0 -7.6 5.6 73.5% Cegedim Santé -1.4 -6.3 4.9 77.7% Insurance  HR  Pharmacies  and other services 3.8 5.9 -2.2 -36.6% International businesses -4.4 -7.2 2.8 39.4%-------------(1) Alternative performance indicator See pages 110-111 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.Flow : revenues rose 6.7%  led by Cegedim e-business (process digitalization and electronic data flows)  whose French and international businesses grew 6% and 18% respectively.

Corporate and others: H1 2023 REBIT(1) was a €0.9 million loss  down €1.9 compared with H1 2022. As we explained when presenting 2022 results  the deterioration was caused by an effort to standardize methods for reinvoicing corporate office activities  notably in the areas of R&D and IT systems  as well as lower margins at the offshore corporate centers.---------(1) Alternative performance indicator See pages 110-111 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.HighlightsApart from the items cited below  to the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no events or changes during H1 2023 that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.TaxOn February 21  2018  CegedimS.A. received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for 2015 and 2016. The audit resulted in a reassessment notice covering the use of tax-loss carryforwards  which the authorities disputed. On February 21  2021  CegedimS.A. received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for 2019 and 2020. That audit did not result in any additional reassessments.After consultation with its lawyers and based on the applicable tax law and existing tax rulings  the Group believes that the tax authorities’ proposed reassessment is unwarranted. CegedimS.A. has appealed the decision and continues to explore its options for contesting the reassessment.Over the first half of 2023  CegedimS.A. continued to apply the disputed tax-loss carryforwards to its taxable earnings  bringing cumulative tax savings to €24.4 million at June 30  2023.Furthermore  as it is permitted to do under this process  in the first half of 2022 tax authorities issued CegedimS.A. a notice of collection  in response to which the Group paid a total of €12.1 million in respect of tax loss carryforwards used through 2020 and a €0.4 million late payment penalty. The corresponding entry for these payments was not recognized in expenses  but rather as a tax receivable in the balance sheet  as the Company expects these sums to be repaid once the dispute has been resolved in its favor.As a result  if CegedimS.A. ultimately loses its appeal  it would have to record a tax charge of €24.4 million in its profit and loss statement  but it would only have to make a cash payment of €12.3 million for the share of taxes not yet paid.In addition  in accordance with IFRS  Cegedim S.A. records in its consolidated financial statements a deferred tax asset in respect of its unused tax-loss carryforwards  which represents the future tax gain the company may yet realize. Note that the accounting entries related to deferred tax never have cash impact. Through December 31  2022  deferred tax assets were unchanged at €20 million. At June 30  2023  those assets amounted to €10.5 million owing to a €9.5 million downward adjustment recorded in deferred tax expenses in the consolidated profit and loss statements. In response to a recent tax ruling in July 2023  the Group opted for a more conservative assessment of the unrealized future gains from its remaining  disputed tax-loss carryforwards.If CegedimS.A. ultimately loses its appeal  the entirety of the deferred tax assets in the balance sheet at June 30  2023  would have to be recorded as a €10.5 million charge in the profit and loss statements  with no cash outlay.CegedimS.A.  in consultation with its attorneys  believes that it still has a solid case for dismissal of the reassessment  consistently with the position currently reflected in its financial statements. As a result  Cegedim is preparing to appeal the dispute to the administrative court  an effort which could take several years. Cegedim is confident in its chances of success and has not recorded any provisions in respect of the dispute.The maximum amount of risk from the potential tax charges cited above is expected to remain constant at €34.9 million  but the breakdown could change: the €10.5 million deferred tax asset would decrease as tax savings are realized  incrementally increasing the €24.4 million already used.The maximum potential cash payment  which came to €12.3 million at June 30  2023  will continue to rise as future tax savings are realized  but could also decrease if the tax authorities issue additional notices of collection while the appeal is ongoing.Significant transactions and events post June 30  2023Apart from the items cited below  to the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no events or changes during the period that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.War in UkraineThe Group does not do business in Russia or Ukraine and has no assets exposed to those countries.OutlookDespite the economic  geopolitical and monetary uncertainties facing the world  we are confident we will be able to grow our revenues. Based on the currently available information  the Group expects 2023 like-for-like revenue(2) growth to be at least 10% relative to 2022.Recurring operating income(1) is expected to grow  notably thanks to the initial returns on investments made in Cegedim Santé and international activities.These targets may need to be revised if there is a resurgence in the Covid-19 pandemic and/or a significant worsening of geopolitical and macroeconomic risks.The Group does not expect to make any significant acquisitions in 2023.---------------The Audit Committee met on September 18  2023.

30443,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/power-list-whos-who-of-new-zealands-24-billion-wine-industry/GKVIQSPO35FNRHML6TX4YHTGZU/,Power list: Who’s who of New Zealand’s $2.4 billion wine industry,Is it still a viable option for those who dream of owning a vineyard?,"These days  you'll need a ""serious Lotto win"" to start your own vineyard and winery. Photo / Jim HarrisSo your dream is to wander at sunset through your own vineyard then  as the evening chills  you whistle up the dogs and turn for home  where there’s an open fire and a glass of your own label awaiting your opinion.Maybe it’s best to freeze that frame in your head-movie until you’ve met Hawke’s Bay boutique winery co-owner John Loughlin.The well-known businessman  who with wife Kathryn founded the Askerne Estate Winery near the foothills of Te Mata Peak 30 years ago  isn’t a killjoy. They too chased the dream and have enjoyed “enormous satisfaction” achieving it.But behind the idyll of a home overlooking their vineyards and all the wine awards and recognition  Loughlin says there’s been sacrifice  sweat and tears  forsaken overseas adventures and an investment that runs into millions of dollars.It was a big enough challenge starting out three decades ago  he says  but these days  with land prices  capital  compliance and other costs and inflation  he reckons you’d need a “serious Lotto win” to establish a medium-sized integrated wine venture - a vineyard with its own winery.“The cost pressures on the production side have been enormous - wage rates  excise going up  inflation  bottling costs... everything’s gone up except sale prices.“To give a concrete example: we made our first chardonnay from the 1997 vintage and we won a gold medal and 4.5 stars in Cuisine magazine. We sold it for $24.90. Twenty-five years later we have a chardonnay that has had similar success and it sells for $26.90.Askerne Estate Winery founders Kathryn and John Loughlin. Photo / Florence Chavin“That’s the big challenge of the wine industry  to find efficiency and productivity gains to try to offset the cost pressure. It’s certainly got a lot harder in the past six years. The working capital side of it is enormous.”And those vineyards in the TV rom-coms “seem to need very little work  the birds don’t come and the weather is never a problem”.The Loughlins started with 11 hectares of bare land  an old house and a mortgage. Today  after acquiring neighbouring land  they grow 17 grape varieties on 32ha.To build Askerne  which Loughlin describes as a “tiny” player in the industry  he worked fulltime offsite and Kathryn ran the business. They reinvested every cent in the operation and lived in the old house on the original land for 23 years before rebuilding on the vineyard. The old house remains in the family. They employ a winemaker and produce around 8000 cases a year  with exports to the UK  China and Singapore making up about 10 per cent of Askerne’s annual production.So if winemaking isn’t delivering riches (at least the financial sort)  why buy more land?“One of the ways to try to make money is to get a bit of scale and spread your fixed costs over more volume ” says Loughlin.“You’re getting efficiencies on your fixed costs. It’s a race to try to get productivity and efficiency gains because the pricing just doesn’t support the industry like it used to.”The couple have done extramural courses in winemaking  but as wine lovers  “we always had clarity about what we wanted to finish with in the glass  and what was a good wine in the style we were looking to make”  says Loughlin.“You get enormous satisfaction when you make a wine that is everything you hoped it would be and you get recognition.”But running an integrated business “is getting harder and harder”.“We’re starting to see economies of scale really coming in. If you’re going to be small  you have to be really high-priced to make it all work.”Most Askerne wines sell for about $25 a bottle  whereas the “average” price in New Zealand is $13-$14  he says. Askerne’s most expensive wines are around $60  but the volumes are small.“Wines are being made now that are over $100. Not big volumes  but quite a number are around there.”Loughlin notes the business is easier to get into for a winemaker with a little bit of capital who can buy grapes from a contract grower and use someone else’s facility to make wine.“That way they don’t have to put up the capital for a vineyard and winery. They can then launch a brand based on their name and reputation. That’s a route a number have taken pretty successfully.”Latest figures from industry group New Zealand Winegrowers show grower numbers fell in the 2023 financial year from 706 to 681. There were 739 wineries  compared to 744 the previous year.Total New Zealand wine production was 360.7 million litres compared to 383 million litres in the 2022 year. Of the 2023 production  315 million litres were exported  to the value of $2.4 billion.New Zealand produces only 1 per cent of the world’s wine but has an international presence and reputation far exceeding that  particularly for its sauvignon blanc  says New Zealand Winegrowers.Philip Gregan  chief executive of New Zealand Winegrowers. Photo / Richard RobinsonChief executive Philip Gregan agrees the capital cost of buying a vineyard is much higher than previously and therefore “a significant challenge”. But he says there are different ways to do it and the group’s membership list suggests “we are seeing new people all the time”.But the fall in grower and winery numbers in 2023 suggests the industry is consolidating  which is in line with Loughlin’s suggestion that “with all the compliance work and costs these days  you need to be bigger and bigger to make it all work”.“New Zealand has a massive challenge in the primary sector these days in that land is expensive  labour is expensive and capital is expensive. New Zealand doesn’t do cheap food. We sell to rich people. On an average basis  New Zealand wine is the first or second most expensive on shelves in most markets around the world ” says Loughlin  a professional company director whose many governance roles have included chairing kiwifruit marketer Zespri and the Meat Industry Association.“If you’re trying to make a wine to go on the supermarket shelves... that’s a game for the big boys. You need industrial production systems and really low-cost viticulture and winemaking  and you’ll only make a tiny few cents a bottle.”So who are the big players of the New Zealand wine industry and how many of them are foreign-owned?Gregan said that at a winery production level  about 30 per cent could be attributed to overseas owners  and “roughly” 50 per cent of the grapes received by wineries were produced by operations with international investor interests.According to the New Zealand Winegrowers’ 2023 annual report  of the country’s 739 wineries in that year  646 were described as small-sized  75 as medium and 18 as large.“Small” was defined as those with annual sales not exceeding 200 000 litres. “Medium” had annual sales between 200 000 and 4 million litres. The 18 “large” wineries had annual sales of more than 4 million litres. For context  a case of 12 standard-sized bottles amounts to nine litres of wine.Coriolis Research’s latest report in 2020 for the Government on the country’s top 200 food and beverage producers named 19 wine producers.They were: Lion; Delegat Group (NZX-listed); Indevin Group; Constellation Brands; Pernod Ricard; Villa Maria Estate; Treasury Wine Estates; Yealands; Giesen Wines; Cloudy Bay Vineyards; Sacred Hill Vineyards; Saint Clair Estate; Booster Wines; Accolade Wines; The Wine Portfolio; Craggy Range Vineyards; Allan Scott Wines; Mount Riley Wines; and Foley Wines.Sacred Hill was put into liquidation in August 2021 and is still in receivership and liquidation  according to the Companies Office. Villa Maria’s former parent FFWL was also put into receivership after the Coriolis report was published: it has been bought by New Zealand’s Indevin Group.When the Herald ran this company list - minus Sacred Hill and Villa Maria - past New Zealand Winegrowers  Gregan said the Coriolis report had missed some names. He declined to identify them.The Herald elected to add New Zealand-owned Babich Wines to the top players’ list.This brought their number - omitting Sacred Hill and Villa Maria - to 18  which corresponds to the New Zealand Winegrowers’ 2023 classification of 18 “large” wineries.Of the 18  Herald research suggests eight are overseas-owned.Who’s who in the foreign-owned stakes?The New Zealand wine industry was founded on the entrepreneurial spirit of foreigners  dating back to 1819 when missionary Samuel Marsden arrived in Kerikeri  Northland with 100 vines which he planted at his mission station.In the 1840s  British arrival James Busby made the first recorded wine  from a small vineyard he planted at Waitangi. The history books say it was his enthusiasm that encouraged other immigrants from Europe to set up across the country with vineyards and start winemaking.New Zealand Winegrowers’ Gregan says foreign-owned companies have made “an incredibly strong” contribution to the industry. You only have to look at Cloudy Bay’s contribution to forging New Zealand’s reputation internationally  he says.Askerne’s Loughlin says as well as the big international players featured below  he knows of “quite a few” foreign wine growers “often below the radar”.“They’re from Switzerland and Japan and China  passionate people who put a lot in [to the industry] and often provide routes to market.“A massive amount of capital and working capital is required in vineyards and wineries and we’ve needed that foreign capital to grow the industry. A lot of the growth has happened with New Zealand capital but the massive growth has been enabled by foreign investment.”1.
