Those bets have been proved right: In a milestone for Asia’s third-largest economy  JPMorgan Chase & Co. has announced it will add Indian government debt to its benchmark emerging-market index starting in mid-2024. Overseas investors will get a new way to put money into a giant economy that has been offering some of the highest returns in the region. JPMorgan will be able to tout greater diversification following the exclusion of Russia last year  and as concerns over US-China geopolitical tensions persist. For India  the move represents greater connectivity between its domestic and global financial markets — and the potential for lower borrowing costs.1. What’s the back story?India began liberalizing its economy in 1991 but does all its borrowing locally in rupee bonds because it wants to avoid the kind of dollar dependence that provoked the Asian currency crisis and other meltdowns. But in late 2019  India started working to gain access to bond indexes in a bid to lower its borrowing costs by generating additional demand — and to tout its financial discipline. As Covid-19 was ravaging the economy and the government was borrowing at record levels to fund a multibillion-dollar stimulus package  it opened a swath of its sovereign bond market to overseas investors. At the time  however  global funds were selling emerging-market assets to hoard dollars. More recently  foreign investors held just 0.4% of Indian sovereign debt in March this year  against a ceiling of 6%. That’s among the lowest for any big emerging market. New Delhi balked at tax changes for foreigners that would have facilitated trading of Indian debt on international platforms such as Euroclear. There were also domestic political objections about granting tax exemptions for foreign investors. Those concerns  however  may have been overridden by investors’ needs for more options in emerging market sovereign debt. Almost three-quarters of benchmark investors surveyed were in favor of India’s addition to the index  the JPMorgan team said.Advertisement2. What happens now?Currently  23 bonds worth a combined notional $330 billion are eligible to be added to the the JPMorgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets starting June 28  2024. Inclusion will be staggered over 10 months at roughly 1% weight per month  up to a maximum weight of 10%. JPMorgan’s decision puts pressure on other index compilers to diversify their fixed income gauges. India has been on the watch list to get into FTSE Russell’s emerging market debt index since March 2021. Its next review is scheduled for Sept. 28. Yet the prospects for India being added to that gauge or the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index are dim because Indian bonds are not settled on Euroclear  and the nation doesn’t have a high enough sovereign credit rating  according to analysts at Barclays. Bloomberg LP is the parent company of Bloomberg Index Services Ltd  which administers indexes that compete with those from other service providers.3. Why expand the index now?AdvertisementRussia’s exclusion from JPMorgan’s emerging markets gauges after the country invaded Ukraine last year may have added incentives for the index compiler to consider filling the gap with Indian debt. Persistent geopolitical tensions between China and the US  and a negative yield gap there  have put investors on the lookout for new opportunities in local currency emerging market debt. While foreigners play a small role in the Indian bond market  inflows have been picking up in recent years and the country’s assets have proven resilient to financial turbulence that has roiled other developing-nations. The inclusion reflects the “confidence that financial markets have on the long-term prospects of the Indian economy and our financial and macro policies ” Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran said.Share this article Share4. What are the potential benefits?Investors will be able to diversify their portfolios and allocate money to a high-yielding market in the world’s fifth-largest economy. For India  it’s an opportunity to tap a larger pool of liquidity to meet growing needs. (The nation is set to borrow a record 15.43 trillion rupees ($186 billion) this fiscal year.) Inclusion is expected to attract inflows of at least $25 billion through March 2025. That’s money India needs to finance its current account deficit  which risks expanding as higher crude oil prices lead to a worsening trade balance for the net energy importer. Greater scrutiny from foreign investors  even though many of them will be tied to index decisions  could also re-energize Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to whittle down the fiscal deficit that exploded during the pandemic. With elections less than a year away  Modi’s government hasn’t shown much sign of turning on the spending taps  and this would be one more reason not to.Advertisement5. What about the concerns?The government and central bank remain concerned that foreign inflows will increase the volatility of local markets. Officials have in the past worried about the consequences of “hot money” sloshing in and out from offshore. If events as far afield as Turkey or Brazil put investors off emerging markets  India may bear more of the brunt than it currently does  with its relatively insulated markets. The Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy decisions may also need to ascribe greater weight to how foreign bond investors will respond. Money managers  meanwhile  point to the Euroclear issue  transaction efficiency and clarity on taxes as hurdles that haven’t gone away. For India to get the most out of index inclusion  making it easier for foreign investors to put their money to work in local bonds will be important.6. What’s the impact on markets?AdvertisementAt a time when global bond markets are gloomy  the index news is expected to keep Indian yields relatively steady. Benchmark 10-year yields have traded in a range of 7.09% to 7.25% in September. In contrast  similar-tenor US yields climbed over 30 basis points during the same period. Longer term  especially if other index providers add India  the nation may see structurally lower interest rates. The inclusion could also provide some relief for the rupee  which has been trading near a record low.--With assistance from Malavika Kaur Makol and Subhadip Sircar.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2023 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.07,0.3,0.63,True,English,"['EM Bond Index', 'JPMorgan', 'India', 'Chief Economic Adviser V.

30450,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.financialexpress.com/market/jpmorgan-index-inclusion-pushes-indian-bond-yields-to-2-mth-lows-3251306/,India gets green light to join JPMorgan bond index; rupee  bonds gain,The widely tracked index will include a total of 23 government securities  currently placed under the category of Fully Accessible Route (FAR) where there is no cap on foreign investment.,JPMorgan will include India in its widely tracked emerging market debt index  setting the stage for billions of dollars of inflows into the world’s fifth-largest economy and helping it finance its current account and fiscal deficits. India’s local bonds will be included in the Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) index and the index suite  benchmarked by about $236 billion in global funds  JPMorgan said in a release on Friday.JPMorgan said 23 Indian Government Bonds (IGBs) with a combined notional value of $330 billion  all of which fall under the “fully accessible route” for non-residents are eligible. “India’s weight is expected to reach the maximum weight threshold of 10% in the GBI-EM Global Diversified  and approximately 8.7% in the GBI-EM Global index ” said JPMorgan.India’s benchmark 10-year bond yield dropped 7 basis points to a two-month low of 7.0788% in opening trade but retreated to 7.12% by 0700 GMT  while the rupee gained 0.3% early to 82.25 per dollar before giving up some gains to trade at 82.93. “We welcome this development ” said India’s chief economic adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran. “It attests to the confidence that financial market participants and financial markets  in general  have on India’s potential and growth prospects and its macroeconomic and fiscal policies ” he added. Inclusion will start on June 28  2024  and extend over 10 months with 1% increments on its index weighting  as India is expected to reach the maximum weighting of 10%  JPMorgan said.Also Read Rupee rises 38 paise to 82.75 against US dollar in early trade“Beyond the near-term euphoria  this should structurally augur well for rates and FX markets  leading to lower cost of borrowings for the economy at large and more accountable fiscal policy-making ” said Madhavi Arora  lead economist at Emkay Global Financial Services. However  India’s inclusion will trigger outflows elsewhere  with weightings for domestic government bonds issued by other countries set to shrink: Thailand will see the biggest losses at 1.65 percentage points  while South Africa  Poland  Czech Republic and Brazil will see theirs cut by 1-1.36 percentage points  according to JPMorgan.TALKS BEGAN IN 2019India began talks on including its debt in global indexes in 2019  while also talking to Euroclear about clearing and settlement. It removed foreign investment restrictions on some government securities in 2020 as part of an effort to enter global bond indexes with several bonds now part of the “Fully Accessible Route” without any foreign investment restrictions. But the government’s stance on other issues including capital gains taxes and local settlement delayed its inclusion  though it did not actually budge on its stand. “It would be reasonable to expect inflows to start from now  which in the interim helps even the demand-supply gap in balance of payments ” said Rahul Bajoria  managing director and head of EM Asia (ex China) at Barclays. “We believe a total of $20-25 billion should come in over the index inclusion horizon  but some front loading is reasonable.”Foreign investor buying in Indian bonds has remained tepid with net purchases of $3.4 billion so far in 2023. Foreign investors own less than 2% of outstanding government debt. “This announcement is a significant positive for the INR bond in the short-term as investors look to front-run the eventual inclusion ” said analysts at DBS in a note on Friday. In the same announcement  JPMorgan said Egypt’s eligibility in the GBI-EM series will be on review for three to six months  due to reports of “material” hurdles in currency repatriation. “If the hurdles cited by benchmarked investors persist  a status review will be triggered for Egypt’s removal from the GBI-EM series ” JPMorgan said. Egypt will remain in the index during the review.,neutral,0.16,0.82,0.01,negative,0.02,0.41,0.57,True,English,"['JPMorgan bond index', 'green light', 'India', 'rupee', 'bonds', 'benchmark 10-year bond yield', 'three to six months', 'Emkay Global Financial Services', 'emerging market debt index', 'Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets', 'financial market participants', 'combined notional value', 'chief economic adviser', 'V.

This could contribute to India's $5T economy  but also bring heightened vulnerability to global market fluctuations.,The inclusion of Indian bonds in JPMorgan’s emerging-market index is expected to attract foreign investments  and help bolster the Indian currency  according to market watchers.JPM Government Bond Index-EM Global diversified Index has assets under management of about $200 billion. A 10 per cent weightage on the index will mean that about $20 billion dollar will flow into these bonds.“India’s inclusion in the global bond index is a pivotal step towards international recognition and access to vital capital for growth. This move promises increased demand for the Indian rupee  potentially buffering against depreciation. Lower borrowing costs can fuel essential infrastructure projects  while heightened liquidity may foster more efficient trading conditions ” said Suresh Swamy  partner  Price Waterhouse & Co.Also read: Rupee rallies on JPMorgan’s move to include India in its indexThis would also contribute to the roadmap for India’s growth of $5 trillion economy. However  the inclusion may also entail heightened vulnerability to global market fluctuations  as India becomes subject to shifts in sentiment  economic conditions  and policies in major economies  influencing bond prices and yields.“Navigating these dynamics will be key to India’s success ” said Swamy.The much-anticipated inclusion of India in JPMorgan GBI-EM index  which has been in the works for over 10 years now  will be effective from June 28  2024  accounting for post-announcement operational lags.Also read: The big deal about global bonds and India’s inclusionIndia’s weight of 10 per cent will be staggered over 10 months  leading to passive inflows of $22 billion. The actual flows though may be higher  contingent on market dynamics and active flows.Reliance SecuritiesA big long-term positive in the domestic market after the news that the JPMorgan Chase & Co. will add Indian government bonds to its benchmark emerging-market index  a keenly awaited event that could drive billions of foreign inflows to the nation’s debt market  starting from June 28 2024.Nilesh Shah  Managing Director  Kotak Mahindra AMCIndia’s inclusion in bond index is a step in the right direction. With exclusion of Russia and troubles in China  the options for global debt investors have narrowed down. Hopefully rating agencies will respect investors view point and give up on their moody and poor standards. This inclusion will deepen bond market in India.HSBC Holdings PlcThe inclusion may also prompt flows of as much as $30 billion. We expect this as a positive for PSU Banks.DBSForeign bank DBS said there was also high demand amongst benchmark investors for India’s inclusion in the index and that a final 10% weightage in the JPM index could lead to inflows of $25 billion to $30 billion into India after the inclusion is complete.Rakeshh Mehta chairman of Mehta Equities LtdIndia’s inclusion in JP Morgan emerging markets bond index is great news which would give a booster access to global investors to participate in the world’s fastest-growing large economy that would offer them the highest alpha returns in the emerging region.I believe it is after waiting for 10 odd years India has finally been included in the JP Morgan EM Bond Index today effective 28th June 2024. The credit goes to the Govt of India  regulator as well as various government organisations who made this possible in the current scenario.The news has come at the right time when the market is under pressure and hereafter the possibility of larger FPI flows could be seen ahead of this inclusion. The Rupee would also benefit from this news. We continue to remain optimistic on a great Indian long term story. Equity markets would take this as a welcome note at the right time.Madhavi Arora  Economist at Emkay Global FinancialThe much-anticipated inclusion of India in JP Morgan GBI-EM index will be effective from 28th Jun’24  accounting for post-announcement operational lags. India’s weight of 10% will be staggered over 10 months  leading to passive inflows of $22bn ($26bn accounting for addition in other smaller indices).The actual flows though may be higher  contingent on market dynamics and active flows. Structurally  this will lower India’s risk premia/cost of funding  enhance the liquidity and ownership base of G-Secs and help India finance its fiscal and CAD.This does not immediately pave way for inclusion in FTSE and Bloomberg indexes  which have more stringent conditions (FPI taxation/Euroclear). But it could have a demonstration effect in the medium term as the lower risk premia could trigger positive externalities.Near-term  we expect bond yields and INR to reverse gains after the initial euphoria  tracking global markets. However  the trend will again reverse in favour of bonds by end-Mar’24  with 10-yr yield coming off well below 7%.For 2H FY24  we see USD-INR ranging 82.25-84.25  with tactical RBI intervention keeping it middle of EM Asia pack.VK Vijayakumar  Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial ServicesJP Morgan’s inclusion of India in its Emerging Market Bond Index will reduce bond yields and the consequent decline in the cost of borrowing will boost the bottom line of companies.HDFC BankThe inclusion could lead to passive inflows as index tracking funds increase their holdings in Indian bonds. According to estimates this could be anywhere between $25-30 billion in the first year. As of now  23 bonds worth a notional value of $330 billion are eligible to be added in the index in a staggered way over 10 months – 10% of this (maximum weightage) could therefore lead to close to $30 billion passive inflows.This is a structural change that could rerate Indian bonds and could have positive medium-term implications for bonds  the rupee  and the balance of payment situation. Even with the same supply of bonds  bond yields could trade in a lower range. This could also have spillover effects to cost of borrowing for Indian corporates as well (for instance for the ECB market).While there appears to be some short-term decoupling with the US yields and oil movements (the recent increase)  the bond yield could continue to respond to global movement once the immediate knee-jerk reaction plays out. Moreover  over the medium term  index inclusion does not imply a permanent insulation from global and domestic vulnerabilities. Moreover  the rise in external debt could also bring about another set of macro stability issues.The announcement is likely to cause an immediate rally in the domestic bond market today  with the possibility of the 10Y benchmark moving towards 7.05% (closed at 7.15% yesterday and opened at 7.088% today). The USD/INR pair could also see some relief and might move towards 82.80 levels  after closing at 83.09 yesterday. We expect the pair to trade in the range of 82.70-83.00 today.Ajay Seth  Secretary  DEA  Ministry of FinanceIt is a welcome development showing confidence in Indian Economy.Anantha Nageswaran  Chief Economic AdvisorWe welcome this development. JPMorgan has made this decision on their own. It attests to the confidence that financial market participants and financial markets  in general  have on India’s potential and growth prospects and its macroeconomic and fiscal policies.

Despite the negativity around global bond yields  we believe our markets will remain quite resilient after this inclusion. In the medium term  our target for the benchmark 10-year bond yields at 6.75% remains on track.For the medium term  once this entire noise around Fed hikes and global yields stabilizes  we believe peak market rates are behind us and market yields could gradually soften. From a demand perspective  markets could see incremental buying from active foreign funds.

30458,Clearstream,Bing API,https://delano.lu/article/getting-fund-managers-and-dist,Getting fund managers and distributors better connected,Clearstream Fund Centre SA is the new bank launched. Managed from Luxembourg  it provides a platform where fund distributors and fund managers can interact.,It’s not every day that Luxembourg sees the creation of a new bank. Deutsche Börse  Clearstream’s parent company  has done just that  though  deciding to spin off all of its Luxembourg entity’s ‘funds’ business and moving it to a new organisation. “Over the last 10 years and more  we’ve had some success in developing a suite of fund-focused services within Clearstream ” says Philippe Seyll  head of the new Clearstream Fund Centre. “To take things further  we needed greater autonomy  by operating under a more appropriate regulatory regime for the business. While Clearstream is governed by the CSDR (Central Securities Depositories Regulation)  our new organisation will be subject to MiFID requirements  which are better aligned with what we have to offer.”Managed from LuxembourgDeutsche Börse wanted the new bank  Clearstream’s sister company  to be located in Luxembourg  demonstrating its dedication to the financial centre and the Group’s strong relationships with its ecosystem  the regulator and the Ministry of Finance. The banking licence was secured last November and operations began in January. “The new organisation employs 200 people in its home location of Luxembourg  from where all international business will be managed. Further afield  from Singapore to Zurich and from Zurich to Sydney  operations will be handled by various sister entities employing another 800 people or so in total ” says Philippe Seyll.Making it easier to do businessThe new entity will help the Group to step up its development and strengthen its offering to the fund industry. “We act as a platform that makes it easier for distributors to access numerous products worldwide and for fund managers to make their funds widely available ” says the CEO. Vestima  Clearstream’s fund processing platform  already connects 850 distributors and the same number of asset managers  and covers around 300 000 ISINs. The bank’s business handles some €3 500 billion in assets under administration. “For distributors  the benefit lies in the ability to establish relationships with asset managers without having to develop their own connections.Using our infrastructure  they can transform fixed costs to variable costs linked to individual transactions  and above all  reduce the overall costs associated with acquiring and holding funds. The approach  based on proven procedures and processes  also reduces the risks associated with these types of transaction.”We’ve been successfully developing a suite of fund focused services as part of Clearstream for over10 years. Philippe Seyll   CEO   ClearstreamFund Centre LuxembourgExpanding the range of servicesFrom the outset  the new entity’s intention for this platform — part of the Clearstream Fund Services segment — was also to enhance its ecosystem of services around the product range. The Group’s integration of Kneip will support efforts in this direction  making it easier to provide players within the ecosystem with value-added data so as to meet fund management  administration and distribution needs. Generating efficiency gains building on these strengths  the Deutsche Börse Group’s new organisational unit has ambitious plans for sustained growth. “We’ve experienced double-digit growth over the last 10 years  currently generate nearly €400 million in revenue each year and employ around a thousand people. The aim is to generate efficiency gains and grow our revenues ” says Philippe Seyll.Generate efficiency gainsOver the past year  the entity has recruited and onboarded around 100 people in Luxembourg alone  mainly assigned to the new bank’s control functions. “To meet these objectives  we intend to leverage our strengths to win market share across Europe and beyond.

""It's a matter of when rather than if a tape comes in.""Haynes said even a very low level of revenue from contributing data to a tape would be a material amount of money for Aquis.The exchange will not be part of a group of European bourses such as Euronext and Deutsche Boerse  which have set up a company to tender for EU permission to operate a stock tape  Haynes said.Separately  Aquis is ending its eight-year self-imposed ban on high-frequency traders (HFT)  who dart in and out of markets to exploit tiny differences in prices  from accessing its market.Haynes  a City of London veteran who founded Aquis a decade ago  said the ban had crimped Aquis' ability to build up market share  and that in the medium term lifting it would have a ""very significant impact on market share"".Aquis' members will be able to choose if they want to interact with HFT firms  also known as prop traders  from the fourth quarter of this year  subject to regulatory approval.Aquis  still a minnow compared with domestic rival London Stock Exchange Group  reported net revenue up 17% to 9.7 million pounds ($11.92 million) in the six months to June 30.

30465,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://delano.lu/article/getting-fund-managers-and-dist,Getting fund managers and distributors better connected,Clearstream Fund Centre SA is the new bank launched. Managed from Luxembourg  it provides a platform where fund distributors and fund managers can interact.,It’s not every day that Luxembourg sees the creation of a new bank. Deutsche Börse  Clearstream’s parent company  has done just that  though  deciding to spin off all of its Luxembourg entity’s ‘funds’ business and moving it to a new organisation. “Over the last 10 years and more  we’ve had some success in developing a suite of fund-focused services within Clearstream ” says Philippe Seyll  head of the new Clearstream Fund Centre. “To take things further  we needed greater autonomy  by operating under a more appropriate regulatory regime for the business. While Clearstream is governed by the CSDR (Central Securities Depositories Regulation)  our new organisation will be subject to MiFID requirements  which are better aligned with what we have to offer.”Managed from LuxembourgDeutsche Börse wanted the new bank  Clearstream’s sister company  to be located in Luxembourg  demonstrating its dedication to the financial centre and the Group’s strong relationships with its ecosystem  the regulator and the Ministry of Finance. The banking licence was secured last November and operations began in January. “The new organisation employs 200 people in its home location of Luxembourg  from where all international business will be managed. Further afield  from Singapore to Zurich and from Zurich to Sydney  operations will be handled by various sister entities employing another 800 people or so in total ” says Philippe Seyll.Making it easier to do businessThe new entity will help the Group to step up its development and strengthen its offering to the fund industry. “We act as a platform that makes it easier for distributors to access numerous products worldwide and for fund managers to make their funds widely available ” says the CEO. Vestima  Clearstream’s fund processing platform  already connects 850 distributors and the same number of asset managers  and covers around 300 000 ISINs. The bank’s business handles some €3 500 billion in assets under administration. “For distributors  the benefit lies in the ability to establish relationships with asset managers without having to develop their own connections.Using our infrastructure  they can transform fixed costs to variable costs linked to individual transactions  and above all  reduce the overall costs associated with acquiring and holding funds. The approach  based on proven procedures and processes  also reduces the risks associated with these types of transaction.”We’ve been successfully developing a suite of fund focused services as part of Clearstream for over10 years. Philippe Seyll   CEO   ClearstreamFund Centre LuxembourgExpanding the range of servicesFrom the outset  the new entity’s intention for this platform — part of the Clearstream Fund Services segment — was also to enhance its ecosystem of services around the product range. The Group’s integration of Kneip will support efforts in this direction  making it easier to provide players within the ecosystem with value-added data so as to meet fund management  administration and distribution needs. Generating efficiency gains building on these strengths  the Deutsche Börse Group’s new organisational unit has ambitious plans for sustained growth. “We’ve experienced double-digit growth over the last 10 years  currently generate nearly €400 million in revenue each year and employ around a thousand people. The aim is to generate efficiency gains and grow our revenues ” says Philippe Seyll.Generate efficiency gainsOver the past year  the entity has recruited and onboarded around 100 people in Luxembourg alone  mainly assigned to the new bank’s control functions. “To meet these objectives  we intend to leverage our strengths to win market share across Europe and beyond. While our operations encompass €3 500 billion in fund assets under administration  the European market represents €15 000 billion in assets  and the Asian market some €10 000 billion. There’s a lot of room to grow ” says Seyll.

With this regulatory milestone  VYVGART is the first-and-only neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker authorized for sale in Canada.“There continues to be a significant unmet medical need for people living with gMG  who face debilitating muscle weakness and mobility issues. We are very excited by the authorization of VYVGART for sale in Canada  bringing a safe and effective treatment option to patients and clinicians that targets the underlying driver of gMG by reducing IgG autoantibodies ” said Dr. Vera Bril  Professor of Medicine (Neurology) at the University of Toronto  Director of the Neuromuscular Section  Division of Neurology  University of Toronto and University Health Network.“Living with gMG can significantly impact a person’s independence and affect basic personal tasks  such as speaking  chewing and swallowing food  and brushing teeth and hair  and in some severe cases  it can also affect breathing. The gMG community in Canada has long awaited new effective treatment advancements for this rare condition. Today’s announcement brings new hope for people with gMG  and we look forward to seeing the important impact of this additional treatment option ” said Stacey Lintern  Chief Executive Officer  Muscular Dystrophy Canada.The authorization of VYVGART is based on results from the global Phase 3 ADAPT trial  which were published in the July 2021 issue of The Lancet Neurology . The ADAPT trial met its primary endpoint  demonstrating that significantly more anti-AChR antibody positive gMG patients were responders on the MG-ADL scale following treatment with VYVGART compared with placebo (68% vs. 30%; p<0.0001) and on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scale (63% VYVGART vs. 14% placebo; p<0.0001).VYVGART had a demonstrated safety profile in the ADAPT clinical trial. The most common adverse events in ADAPT were headache (29% vs 28% placebo)  upper respiratory tract infection (11% vs 5% placebo)  and urinary tract infection (10% vs. 5% placebo).“Today is an important day for us as we deliver on our commitment to the gMG community to make VYVGART available to patients in Canada ” said John Haslam  General Manager argenx Canada. “For the first time  people living with gMG in Canada will have a treatment option that is targeted to the biology of their disease  which is both well-tolerated and effective in managing symptoms.”About VYVGARTVYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker in the United States  EU and China for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti- acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About Phase 3 ADAPT TrialThe Phase 3 ADAPT trial was a 26-week randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multi-center  global trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of VYVGART in adult patients with gMG. A total of 167 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the trial. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive VYVGART or placebo  in addition to stable doses of their current gMG treatment. ADAPT was designed to enable an individualized treatment approach with an initial treatment cycle followed by subsequent treatment cycles based on clinical evaluation. The primary endpoint was the comparison of percentage of MG-ADL responders in the first treatment cycle between VYVGART and placebo treatment groups in the anti-AChR antibody positive population. Responders were defined as having at least a two-point reduction on the MG-ADL scale sustained for four or more consecutive weeks during the first treatment cycle.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months 1 where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.1About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

Procurement has become a major lever of action …,As a trailblazer in hospitality  Accor considers its responsibility to pioneer innovations that can move the needle for all its stakeholders and accelerate the sustainable transformation of the industry overall. Procurement has become a major lever of action for a more sustainable hospitality model.Facing up to Environmental Issues: The Challenge for the Hospitality IndustryAs the world is becoming more aware of the importance of living sustainably  travelers expect hospitality companies to step-up their action plan and offer a hospitality experience with a positive impact. A recent study by PWC named the Environmental Social Governance (ESG) goals that set a business apart: natural resource protection  sustainable and local sourcing  zero waste and water conservation. To act on sustainable development  hospitality leaders must meet science-based targets in all these areas.A major part of companies’ environment  social  and governance footprint lies outside their walls  with suppliers. Over the past few years  Procurement has become increasingly instrumental in supporting sustainability transformation strategies  particularly driving sustainability compliance within supply chains  sourcing and co-designing more sustainable products and services  and building sustainable relationships with suppliers. CAROLINE TISSOT  Chief Procurement OfficerAstore: Five Concrete Innovations for ProcurementTo achieve a more sustainable model  procurement is a major lever for action. Astore  Accor’s leading procurement organization for hospitality  serves more than 8 500 international clients and contributes to driving more sustainable procurement for the entire hospitality industry.Open not only to the Group’s hotels  but to all hospitality players  Astore delivers best in-class expertise and solutions to ease operations  optimize costs and maximize performance. Astore is also driving sustainability transformation to improve the environmental and social performance of procurement in the hospitality industry  including the following five key action areas:1. Toward Net Zero: driving the energy transitionAs part of Accor’s commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and its efforts to move the sector towards a more sustainable model  Astore’s procurement teams are selecting committed suppliers respecting high environmental and societal standards. In line with this objective  Accor’s Paris corporate headquarters is 100% supplied by renewable sources.2. Natural Resource Protection: eliminating single-use plasticAt the end of 2022  84% of hotels have eliminated 46 types of single-use plastics in their guest experience. Accor’s procurement organization has implemented a range of innovative alternatives. As an example  working with the Group’s long-term suppliers  dispensers are now replacing single doses in amenities  for overall savings of more than 300 tons of plastics in a year.3. Sustainable and local sourcing: onboarding local suppliersOn Astore Shop  Accor’s online purchasing platform  Accor’s strong local anchorage to work closest to the field is represented by an ongoing dialogue with a large network of suppliers to promote local procurement  including in Food & Beverage. Today  more than three quarters of Accor’s suppliers in France are small or very small structures  and this number is growing. Furthermore  by sourcing closer to hotels in their own area  Accor is also reducing the environmental impact of transport. And in line with the Group’s Sustainable Food Charter commitments  Accor is increasing seasonal sourcing  organic product use  and selecting suppliers with responsible practices in animal welfare and fishing.4. Product safety and quality: stepping up supply chain audits for supplier complianceAstore vets the environmental and social standards of the more than 5 000 quality suppliers on its platform  selected through a process that incorporates sustainability criteria. Using the trusted sustainability ratings partner for procurement teams  EcoVadis  Astore is also working to address the issue of CSR compliance in subcontracting.5. Inclusion: supporting local initiativesIn the U.S.  Astore supports minority and women-owned businesses through partnerships such as with the NMSDC National Minority Supplier Development Council. In France  Accor is part of the collective of companies for a more inclusive economy. A supplier program also works for the inclusion of people with disabilities  such as the partnership with Café Joyeux  a coffee shop employing people with disabilities.As a key lever in supporting sustainability objectives  Astore is facilitating through innovation more sustainable supply chains to maximize value and support owners and partners as the hospitality industry continues to transform.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries in 5 400 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

Audit reports are in the process of being issued.Consolidated data - in € millions 30.06.2023 30.06.2022 Var. in % Revenue 533.2 491.0 +8.6% EBITDA 49.0 42.3 +15.8% Current operating income 30.2 17.7 +70.6% Current operating margin 5.7% 3.6% +2.1 pts Operating income 30.0 17.2 +74.4% Financial income (2.5) (10.0) +77.0% Net result (group share) 19.2 1.9 - Net margin 3.6% 0.4% +3.2 ptsLEVEL OF ACTIVITY CLOSE TO PRE-CRISIS PERFORMANCEIn the first half of 2023  AKWEL posted a consolidated turnover of €545.8m  up by 11.8% when comparing published figures and by 16.2% when taking exchange rates and scope as constants. Business growth was particularly significant in Europe and Africa  with an increase of 17.5%. The application of IAS29 led to a restatement of the half-yearly turnover published on 27 July  for an amount of -€12.6m  following the continued devaluation of the Turkish lira. This restatement has no impact on the performances communicated at constant scope and exchange rates.IMPROVED PROFITABILITYContinued growth in business volumes  combined with better control of costs and sales prices  have led to a return to a more significant level of profitability. Pressures on costs remain high  however  particularly on the wage bill  although energy and transport prices are now more contained.In this context  gross operating surplus was up by 15.8% to €49.0m  and current operating income rose by 70.6% to €30.2m  i.e. a current operating margin of 5.7% of turnover. With a financial income of -€2.5m and a tax expense representing €8.5m  the net income Group share stood at €19.2m for the half-year  i.e. a net margin of 3.6%  up by more than 3 points.The investment envelope for this half-year stands at €220.9m  compared with €12.7m in the first half of 2022  and the change in WCR was €32.1m  to finance the increase in activity. After payment of the dividend and loan repayments totalling €7.2m  the Group’s net cash position  including debts on lease obligations  at 30 June 2023 was €91.5m  compared with €113.7m at 31 December 2022.OUTLOOK FOR THE 2023 FINANCIAL YEARAt its last publication  AKWEL confirmed that it anticipated an increase in turnover of around 10% for 2023  thanks to the favourable prospects of the automotive and HGV sector at global level  with potential strikes being likely to create further uncertainty in the North American market. The performances recorded in the first half of the year and better control of costs and sales prices make it possible to forecast an increase in operating profitability over the entire year.APPOINTMENT OF BENOIT COUTIER TO THE POSITION OF CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERThe Group announces the appointment of Benoit Coutier to the position of Chief Financial Officer from 1 October 2023. A plastics engineer in transformation process engineering with a Masters from ESSEC specialising in International Business Strategy and Engineering  Benoit Coutier has worked in the family company since 2003.

Audit reports are in the process of being issued.Consolidated data - in € millions 30.06.2023 30.06.2022 Var. in % Revenue 533.2 491.0 +8.6% EBITDA 49.0 42.3 +15.8% Current operating income 30.2 17.7 +70.6% Current operating margin 5.7% 3.6% +2.1 pts Operating income 30.0 17.2 +74.4% Financial income (2.5) (10.0) +77.0% Net result (group share) 19.2 1.9 - Net margin 3.6% 0.4% +3.2 ptsLEVEL OF ACTIVITY CLOSE TO PRE-CRISIS PERFORMANCEIn the first half of 2023  AKWEL posted a consolidated turnover of €545.8m  up by 11.8% when comparing published figures and by 16.2% when taking exchange rates and scope as constants. Business growth was particularly significant in Europe and Africa  with an increase of 17.5%. The application of IAS29 led to a restatement of the half-yearly turnover published on 27 July  for an amount of -€12.6m  following the continued devaluation of the Turkish lira. This restatement has no impact on the performances communicated at constant scope and exchange rates.IMPROVED PROFITABILITYContinued growth in business volumes  combined with better control of costs and sales prices  have led to a return to a more significant level of profitability. Pressures on costs remain high  however  particularly on the wage bill  although energy and transport prices are now more contained.In this context  gross operating surplus was up by 15.8% to €49.0m  and current operating income rose by 70.6% to €30.2m  i.e. a current operating margin of 5.7% of turnover. With a financial income of -€2.5m and a tax expense representing €8.5m  the net income Group share stood at €19.2m for the half-year  i.e. a net margin of 3.6%  up by more than 3 points.The investment envelope for this half-year stands at €220.9m  compared with €12.7m in the first half of 2022  and the change in WCR was €32.1m  to finance the increase in activity. After payment of the dividend and loan repayments totalling €7.2m  the Group’s net cash position  including debts on lease obligations  at 30 June 2023 was €91.5m  compared with €113.7m at 31 December 2022.OUTLOOK FOR THE 2023 FINANCIAL YEARAt its last publication  AKWEL confirmed that it anticipated an increase in turnover of around 10% for 2023  thanks to the favourable prospects of the automotive and HGV sector at global level  with potential strikes being likely to create further uncertainty in the North American market. The performances recorded in the first half of the year and better control of costs and sales prices make it possible to forecast an increase in operating profitability over the entire year.APPOINTMENT OF BENOIT COUTIER TO THE POSITION OF CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERThe Group announces the appointment of Benoit Coutier to the position of Chief Financial Officer from 1 October 2023.

The growth is mainly attributable to the Medical business line  whose revenues increased by 48.% compared to the first half of 2022  while revenues from the Industrial business line were in line with the same period last year.Value of production is EUR17.1 million up from EUR13.9 million in H1 2022  an increase of 23 percent.Ebitda amounted to EUR4.0 million  up from EUR2.8 million in the same period of 2022  ""thanks to the optimization of the mix in favor of the medical business line and cost control "" the company points out. Ebitda margin  calculated on the value of production  rises from 19.8 percent to 23.2 percent. Adjusted Ebitda is EUR4.6 million up from EUR3.1 million in the first half of 2022.Ebit is EUR3.3 million up 47 percent from EUR2.2 million in the same period of 2022.Net financial debt is EUR400 000 cash positive compared to EUR5.0 million as of December 31  2022. ""A large part of this very significant improvement is attributable to the resources raised in capital increase at the IPO on the Euronext Growth Milan market "" the company points out.As for the rest of the year  ""the revenue trend could show some seasonality due to the stock production contracts in place with some customers "" the company note reads  ""This could result in the postponement of the invoicing of part of the production volumes realized in the final months of 2023  in line with the orders in the portfolio  in the following year. For the company  the second half of the year is in any case structurally less productive than the first because it includes fewer working days.""After a period of substantial volume stability that lasted from the post-Covid recovery that began in the last months of 2020  the Industrial business line began to show some small signs of shrinking order backlog in the more traditional supply chains. ""In management's opinion  the phenomenon-assuming  and not granted  that it finds confirmation in the latter part of the year-is not a cause for concern  since it does not have a structural character and affects a limited part of the product portfolio "" the company points out.Valtecne's stock trades up 2.8 percent at EUR4.48 per share.By Chiara Bruschi  Alliance News reporterComments and questions to redazione@alliancenews.comCopyright 2023 Alliance News IS Italian Service Ltd.

Thanks to We Edu  students receive training on a market-leading Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution. This technology is highly regarded by top analysts like Gartner and KuppingerCole as crucial for regaining control of access and preventing cyberattacks. After establishing the program's foundations through an initial collaboration with the French engineering school ESIEA  WALLIX is furthering its efforts by entering into a partnership with the French national network of IUTs in its Bachelor of Science in Networks and Telecommunication. This program is available at 29 University Institutes of Technology (IUTs) across France and internationally  offering a major in cybersecurity.What is the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Networks and Telecommunication?The B.S. in Networks and Telecommunication is a three-year national diploma granted by IUTs. It signifies a progression from the previous French University Diploma in Technology (DUT)  which was completed over a span of two years. Among the 108 IUTs in operation  29 now provide the Bachelor of Science in Networks and Telecommunication  equipping students with specialized training in diverse roles within the digital industry. The program encompasses a foundational curriculum  and starting from the second year  students have the option to select from five different majors  one of which is cybersecurity.""Cybersecurity education is an integral part of the core curriculum because an understanding of this concept is crucial for individuals pursuing careers as network technicians  regardless of their field of specialization. Furthermore  in our efforts to train the next generation of cybersecurity experts  we launched the cybersecurity major within the Bachelor of Science in Networks and Telecommunication in September 2021  following five years of preparation. While the industry has grappled with a shortage of talent  there is a noticeable shift occurring. Not too long ago  a career in cybersecurity was considered niche  but today  the majority of students recruited in 2021 have opted for the Bachelor of Science in Networks and Telecommunication with a focus on cybersecurity. This development is incredibly promising for the industry "" explains Frédéric Drouhin  President of the Assembly of Heads of Networks and Telecommunications Departments of France.What does the partnership with WALLIX involve?The major in cybersecurity of the B.S. in Networks and Telecommunication  taught in 2nd and 3rd year  enables students to acquire two fundamental skills:Administering a secure information system:Awareness of information system vulnerabilities and possible remedies.Implementing a secure information system for a small organization.Monitoring a secure information system:Becoming familiar with information system monitoring and testing tools.Implementing a security incident monitoring system.The acquisition of these two skills is based on a project-based approach  involving a large number of work placements. To this end  the B.S. in Networks and Telecommunication offers students certification courses  delivered by industry professionals  enabling them to acquire mastery of various cybersecurity solutions on completion of their studies. This is a guarantee for future employers.Within the framework of the We Edu partnership with the French national network of IUTs  WALLIX is enriching the major in cybersecurity of the Bachelor of Science in Networks and Telecommunication. Firstly  WALLIX is offering training for educators at its certified training center  accredited by Qualiopi  an official French state certification that guarantees the quality of vocational training programs  aligning them with the skill requirements of both companies and individuals. Secondly  WALLIX is granting access to the technical and educational resources of WALLIX PAM4ALL. And thirdly  upon completing the course  students have the opportunity to take a certification exam. This approach equips recent graduates with a technical platform that not only enhances their competence but also streamlines their employability  particularly for organizations seeking specialists capable of implementing a critical PAM solution for managing their digital access needs.""For WALLIX  becoming part of the major in cybersecurity within the Bachelor of Science in Networks and Telecommunication represents a significant milestone in its mission to play a vital role in cultivating experts capable of fortifying companies' resilience. This program paves the way for students to seamlessly transition into the job market upon graduating  spanning a broad spectrum of sectors and professional fields. We believe this is a concrete response at the French level to the urgent need to ensure the continuity of human resources in our clients' IT departments  as well as for companies struggling to recruit staff to ensure the resilience of their organizations "" explains Jean-Noel de Galzain  Founder and CEO of WALLIX.ABOUT WALLIXWALLIX is the European specialist in access and digital identity security and the world leader in PAM (Privileged Access Management).

Given increasing customer demand for digital transactions  equipment lenders would benefit from looking closely at how to further transform their processes  according to Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions.”Digitization of the entire process will solve several key pain points for the industry. First and foremost  digitization will significantly improve the risk and liability of exposed PII (personally identifiable information) in a paper-based environment. There are major inefficiencies and added costs to manage paper  keeping up with revisions ” explains Tim Yalich  Head of Automotive Strategy  Compliance Solutions  Wolters Kluwer in an article for Equipment Finance Advisor. “What’s more  a paper-based environment often results in the use of outdated contracts  which usually leads to lender rejections  and paper returned to the customer  which further increases the risk of exposure.”Yalich speaks to the benefits of purpose-built  digital ecosystems  and how equipment finance and lease providers can leverage these digital ecosystems  which “will help to control and track access  manage status changes  and transfer control of digital documents while utilizing sophisticated granular controls and permissions to allow for departmental separation and visibility ” he writes. “All of this will result in improved speed and process efficiency  and for lenders particularly it will free up capital through syndication  sale  or securitization ” Yalich adds.Equipment Finance Advisor is the leading online publisher exclusively focused on providing original article and blog content  daily updated news  equipment finance industry/economic data  thought-leadership videos  employment opportunities  and various online resources for equipment leasing and finance  commercial finance  and banking and product/services provider professionals in the commercial equipment finance industry.Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions is a market leader and trusted provider of risk management and regulatory compliance solutions and services to U.S. banks  credit unions  insurers and securities firms.

The statutory auditors have conducted a limited review of the first half financial statements. The interim financial report will be published no later than 30 September 2023.SQLI publishes first half results marked by a slight decline in operating margins  which nevertheless remained high despite the limited increase in turnover. Amid slower growth in global demand for digital platform projects  SQLI undertook a major organisational transformation among its French teams while making significant investments for the future.€m - IFRS - audited H1 2022 H1 2023 Change TURNOVER 124.5 128.3 +3% CURRENT OPERATING INCOME 11.2 9.9 -12% 9.0% 7.7% -1.3 pp EBIT 7.9 6.7 -15% 6.3% 5.2% -1.1 pp NET INCOME 2.6 3.4 +31%REVENUE GROWTHSQLI posted its fifth consecutive half-year of organic growth as first half 2023 turnover climbed to €128.3m (up 3% versus H1 2022 including 2.3% growth at constant exchange rates). The Group recorded sustained growth in key account revenues  its strategic priority  offsetting a slight decline across the rest of the customer base.Both France (+2.4%) and the international market (+3.8%) contributed to Group revenue growth.TRANSFORMATION AND INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTUREDuring the first half  SQLI rolled out a new organisational system in France based on areas of expertise  drawing on a model also applied to its international operations  in order to support its growth ambitions. The Group also invested in expanding technological expertise  improving sales performance and developing its service centre in Morocco.The short-term impact of this transformation on business levels and of these investments on fixed expenses resulted in a reduction in the current operating profitability  mainly in France (4.1% of turnover versus 6.5% in H1 2022). Meanwhile  the international current operating profitability remained solid at 11.7%  stable versus H1 2022. As a result  Group current operating income came to €9.9m  compared to €11.2m in H1 2022.EBIT amounted to €6.7m after €3.2m net non-recurring expenses (roughly half of these expenses are due to the accounting recognition of the long-term incentive plan set up in 2022  with no impact on cash).The reduction in net cost of debt (€1.6m versus €2.3m in H1 2022  for which the figure includes the cost of setting up new financing arrangements) and tax expense (€1.7m versus €2.3m) had a positive impact on consolidated net income  up 31% year-on-year to €3.4m.LOW NET DEBT TO EQUITY RATIOAt 30 June 2023  SQLI held gross cash and cash equivalents of €17.9m[1]  down from €22.2m at the start of the year. The change is mainly due to a reduction in the use of off-balance sheet factoring and a seasonal increase in working capital requirement.Net debt (excluding IFRS 16) remains very low at €9.2m  while shareholders' equity stands at €116.3m  giving a highly respectable net debt to equity ratio (gearing) of 8%.OUTLOOKAmid sluggish growth in demand and as the measures implemented since the start of the year begin to kick in  SQLI confirms its objectives to grow turnover in 2023  aims to preserve its margins while continuing to review acquisition opportunities.Receive SQLI financial news free of charge by email by signing on at: www.actusnews.comAbout SQLI: Founded in 1990  SQLI is a European digital services group that supports major international brands in creating value through Digital.

At times when antimicrobial resistance is an ever-growing concern in Europe and in the US  considered as a ’Silent Pandemics’  PHAXIAM is now very well positioned to become a global leader in the fight against severe and resistant infections of very high medical needs.”BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSa) Phage Therapy strategy focused on key  high-value indicationsPHAXIAM has been refocusing its clinical development programs in indications of high medical needs  for patients with severe resistant infections  often associated with high mortality and budget impact. Significant progress has been achieved since the merger to build on team synergies and accelerate PHAXIAM’s strategy deployment on key therapeutic programs  particularly with its lead program targeting resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.b) Clinical development: significant progress on Clinical and Regulatory strategy toward a registration study in PJIStaphylococcus a ureus ( S. a ureus ) programWith its lead S. aureus program  PHAXIAM pursues the ambition to propose a therapeutic solution to patients who failed traditional antimicrobial treatments in complex mono-bacterial S. aureus infections in different high-value indications.Leveraging on promising activity signals from real-life treatments of compassionate patients  PHAXIAM is preparing the initiation of the first global (EU/US)  pivotal randomized Phase 2b/3 study for PJI patients having an open-surgery debridement (DAIR) in combination with antibiotics.While developing the clinical protocol of the study  PHAXIAM has requested this summer a pre-IND meeting with the U.S. FDA and a Scientific Advice meeting with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Meetings are expected to happen in Q4 2023. This global pivotal study is paving the way for a potential Early access pathway in Europe  if associated with positive phase 2b data.PHAXIAM is also preparing a phase 1 trial (PK data) in Endocarditis Infections (EI)  to demonstrate intravenous administration of phages for EI and other indications.Program Status and Progress Prosthetic Joint Infections(Hip / Knee)New Phase 2b/3And PhagoDAIR PJI patients having a DAIR in combination with SOC antibioticsPhages administered locallySafety evidence already demonstrated in current PhagoDAIR studyPlan to launch ambitious efficacy study in a large global registration Phase 2b / 3 trialRecent updatesPhase 2b/3Pre-IND meeting (FDA) and a Scientific Advice (EMA) expected to happen in Q4 2023Potential Phase 2b/3 study launch expected in H2 2024 PhagoDAIR pilot study Additional supportive clinical data expected in 2024 Endocarditis Infections (EI)Phase 1 PKEI patients having resistant infections in the cardiac chambers and valvesPhages administered intravenouslyExpected assessment of the PK and PD of the IV route in the EI indication   potentially leading to the registration in EI and other indications where the IV route is the recommended mode of administrationRecent updates First Patient-In expected in Q4 2023Escherichia coli (E. coli) programThe objective of this program is to propose a therapeutic solution to patients having failed traditional antimicrobial treatment in complex mono-bacterial E. coli infections in the urinary tract.Complex Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI)Phase 1 PK cUTI patients with resistant E. Coli infections in the bladderPhages administered through a catheter into the bladderExpected demonstration of intra-bladder route of administration (PK data) before moving to registration studyRecent updates CTA submission in France planned before end of year 2023Valuable real-life efficacy data from compassionate treatmentsTo date  PHAXIAM has treated more than 90 patients under compassionate treatment status  most of them suffering from hip or knee PJI. Data from the first 50 PJI patients evaluated show promising clinical data for infection control at 3 months  considered as a significant improvement over standard of care in this hard-to-treat patient population with severe resistant infections.In June 2022  PHAXIAM has received a first regulatory validation from the French ANSM with the granting of an AAC (Authorisation d’Accès Compassionnel – early access program) for PJI patients  associated with S. aureus resistance. The company is awaiting a second AAC regulatory validation for PJI patients  associated with P. aeruginosa resistance from the ANSM.Investigator-sponsored trialsIn addition to PHAXIAM’s clinical activities  two French clinical centers are considering Investigator-Sponsored Trials (IST) with PHAXIAM’s products. These studies are the opportunity for PHAXIAM to potentially deliver additional clinical POC data in other high-value indications:Phase 1/2 IST in complex Respiratory Tract Infections (cUTI): this clinical study by La Pitié Salpétrière Hospital in Paris  is targeting nosocomial pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa  including patients with ventilator-associated pneumopathies (VAP)  a growing concern in hospital environments.Phase 1/2 IST in Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU): this clinical study by Nîmes Hospitals  is targeting DFU infections due to mono-bacterial Staphylococcus aureus infection.c) Preclinical research programs initiated to reinforce PHAXIAM’s phage therapy platformPHAXIAM has launched several strategic research programs to reinforce its current clinical programs and prepare future developments  including the extension of the current phage bank for E. coli and P. aeruginosa to increase patient resistant infections coverage  and the demonstration a Pre-clinical POC for Endolysins.On September 19  2023  the company announced the extension of its portfolio to Klebsiella pneumoniae  a new resistant aggressive bacterial target.A strategic research program  PhageBac  targeting Bacteremia  has been initiated. Currently at preclinical stage  this program is aiming at controlling blood infection and the risk of secondary infection with mono-bacterial infection due to S. aureus  P. aeruginosa  or E. coli. Pre-clinical data are expected for mid-2024.1H 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTSKey financial figures for the first half of 2023 compared with the same period of the previous year are summarized below. In the context of the Erytech-Pherecydes merger  PHAXIAM’s consolidated financial statements in IFRS standards include ex-Pherecydes financial results as of the date of the merger  i.e. June 23  2023. Consequently  PHAXIAM’s P&L information for the first 6 months of 2023 are mostly related to ex-Erytech activities only  while PHAXIAM’s consolidated balance sheet as of June 30  2023  includes the financial positions of both merged companies.The full Financial Statements of PHAXIAM Therapeutics as of June 30 2023 will be filed with the AMF and the SEC on Monday  September 25  2023  and will be available on the company’s website at that date.In thousands of euros 1H 2023(6 months) 1H 2022(6 months) Revenues — — Other income 278 954 Net gain on asset sale — 24 351 Operating income 278 25 304 Research and development (3 431) (17 300) General and administrative (9 245) (7 911) Operating expenses (12 676) (25 211) Operating income (loss) (12 398) 93 Financial income 331 3 370 Financial expenses (342) (750) Financial income (loss) (11) 2 620 Income tax 203 (3 737) Net loss (12 201) (1 024)Operating expenses of €12.7 million in the first half of 2023 were 50% lower (i.e. a €12.5 million reduction) than in the previous year  the decrease being driven by the 80% reduction of R&D expenses  with the closing of Princeton operations and the termination of ex-Erytech clinical development activities. PHAXIAM’s G&A expenses in the first half of 2023 increased by €1.3 million (+17%) versus the previous year  an increase related to the merger transaction and other merger-related costs. Net loss for the first half of 2023 was €12.2 million  compared with a net loss of €1 million for the same period of 2022  which benefited from the €24.4 million net gain on the sale of the Princeton facility in April 2022.As of June 30  2023  PHAXIAM had cash and cash equivalents totaling €25.2 million (approximately $27.5 million)  compared with €38.8 million as of December 31  2022. The €13.6 million decrease in cash position during the first half of 2023 was the result of a €12.1 million net cash utilization in operating activities and investing activities and €1.6 million used in financing activities  mostly related with the start in 2023 of the reimbursement of the ‘PGE’  Covid-loan  while the variation of the U.S. dollar against the euro led to a €0.3 million negative currency exchange impact.The Company believes that its current cash position can fund its current programs and planned operating expenses into the second quarter of 2024.COMPLETION OF THE REVERSE SHARE SPLITOn September 18  2023  PHAXIAM announced the completion of its reverse share split on ordinary shares and ADRs. The reverse share split involved the exchange of ten (10) existing shares with a par value of ten-euro cents (€0.10) for one (1) new share with a par value of one euro (€1). This reverse share split has no impact on the Company's share capital and results in the division of the number of shares outstanding by ten  and a multiplication by ten of the par value of each share.

With this regulatory milestone  VYVGART is the first-and-only neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker authorized for sale in Canada.“There continues to be a significant unmet medical need for people living with gMG  who face debilitating muscle weakness and mobility issues. We are very excited by the authorization of VYVGART for sale in Canada  bringing a safe and effective treatment option to patients and clinicians that targets the underlying driver of gMG by reducing IgG autoantibodies ” said Dr. Vera Bril  Professor of Medicine (Neurology) at the University of Toronto  Director of the Neuromuscular Section  Division of Neurology  University of Toronto and University Health Network.“Living with gMG can significantly impact a person’s independence and affect basic personal tasks  such as speaking  chewing and swallowing food  and brushing teeth and hair  and in some severe cases  it can also affect breathing. The gMG community in Canada has long awaited new effective treatment advancements for this rare condition. Today’s announcement brings new hope for people with gMG  and we look forward to seeing the important impact of this additional treatment option ” said Stacey Lintern  Chief Executive Officer  Muscular Dystrophy Canada.The authorization of VYVGART is based on results from the global Phase 3 ADAPT trial  which were published in the July 2021 issue of The Lancet Neurology . The ADAPT trial met its primary endpoint  demonstrating that significantly more anti-AChR antibody positive gMG patients were responders on the MG-ADL scale following treatment with VYVGART compared with placebo (68% vs. 30%; p<0.0001) and on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scale (63% VYVGART vs. 14% placebo; p<0.0001).VYVGART had a demonstrated safety profile in the ADAPT clinical trial. The most common adverse events in ADAPT were headache (29% vs 28% placebo)  upper respiratory tract infection (11% vs 5% placebo)  and urinary tract infection (10% vs. 5% placebo).“Today is an important day for us as we deliver on our commitment to the gMG community to make VYVGART available to patients in Canada ” said John Haslam  General Manager argenx Canada. “For the first time  people living with gMG in Canada will have a treatment option that is targeted to the biology of their disease  which is both well-tolerated and effective in managing symptoms.”About VYVGARTVYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker in the United States  EU and China for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti- acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About Phase 3 ADAPT TrialThe Phase 3 ADAPT trial was a 26-week randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multi-center  global trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of VYVGART in adult patients with gMG. A total of 167 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the trial. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive VYVGART or placebo  in addition to stable doses of their current gMG treatment. ADAPT was designed to enable an individualized treatment approach with an initial treatment cycle followed by subsequent treatment cycles based on clinical evaluation. The primary endpoint was the comparison of percentage of MG-ADL responders in the first treatment cycle between VYVGART and placebo treatment groups in the anti-AChR antibody positive population. Responders were defined as having at least a two-point reduction on the MG-ADL scale sustained for four or more consecutive weeks during the first treatment cycle.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months 1 where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.1About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

Duijvestijn was a guest on Bus…,On Sunday  17 of September  the CEO of DGB Group  Selwyn Duijvestijn  appeared on Dutch television to talk about the company and its achievements in the world of carbon neutrality and nature restoration. Duijvestijn was a guest on Business Class  a current affairs programme that discusses relevant socio-economic companies and their effects on business life. Let's take a look at the highlights of the interview.Video of the interview between Harry Mens and Selwyn Duijvestijn  CEO of DGB Group  on the Business Class programme.Economic facetsFor investors  the economic aspect of any featured company is vital. Duijvestijn explains that DGB is listed on the Euronext Amsterdam  a stock exchange that is considered the oldest modern securities market in the world. On the Dutch stock exchange  DGB is the greenest project developer. Nature is at the core of our mission; we manage a portfolio of 7 worldwide projects  with 10 more on the horizon  and we generate carbonreduction credits-which is the current hot topic in the business world. This is why many companies want to partner with DGB.According to Duijvestijn  more than 1 900 companies are currently already required to reduce their carbonemissions. These companies all benefit from carbon credits  which are measurable carbon reductions from certified carbon projects like DGB's nature-based solutions. Major players on this list include the likes of Unilever  Ahold  Samsung  and Apple. In addition  a whopping 2 700 other companies have voluntarily committed to sustainability  offering opportunities for DGB and expanding our client base.Use our Carbon Footprint Calculator to calculate your emissionsDGB Group's portfolioDGB provides a portfolio of nature-based solutions to help companies achieve complete carbon neutrality. We supervise projects that  for example  provide carbon reduction by planting trees  creating and selling cookstoves to counteract deforestation  and generally provide opportunities for nature protection and restoration. These have proven to be attractive to companies wanting to achieve net zero.Drone view of a tree nursery - Hongera Reforestation Project  DGB.'Companies like Albert Heijn used to have their sustainability reports  detailing their emissions  buried at the end of their annual reports. Now  these reports are moving further towards the start  indicating that sustainability is becoming more important'  Duijvestijn explains. 'They are optimising internal processes  but for the carbon emissions that cannot be eliminated  they turn to companies like us. They want to transform the negative impact into something positive.'DGB's portfolio currently represents 45 million tonnes of carbon reduction through the aforementioned activities. Even though it has still been a work in progress over the past 3.5 years  Duijvestijn expects the first carbon credits to be available by the middle of next year and is currently in active discussions with its buyers.Experiencing DGB Group's projectsIntrigued by DGB's nature-based solutions  presenter Harry Mens asked Duijvestijn about the possibility of watching DGB's projects unfold. After all  investors might be very interested to see if DGB is putting words into action. Duijvestijn confirmed that it's a common occurrence. DGB's largest client  who committed € 1 7 million last year  is coming to visit the Hongera Energy Efficient Cookstoves Project in Kenya  which provides the local population with cleaner ways of cooking to help carbon reduction  reduce indoor air pollution  and decrease deforestation.A community member with a DGB cookstove - Hongera Energy Efficient Cookstoves Project  DGB.Even investors without a similarly huge wallet will be able to experience their investment. DGB is currently organising a trip for such investors to our project sites. These smaller investors have most likely purchased a green bond. These bonds provide the investor with financial returns through social and environmental impacts.DGB's current projects require an investing process of two to four years  starting from €100 000  with annual interest returns of 8%  distributed every quarter. Duijvestijn explained that  'During this time  the bondholders would like to expand their participation because the projects are doing very well and because our plans are coming to fruition'. The issuance of credits  as well as the future of the tree nurseries and the stock fund  serves as collateral for the bonds.Learn more about DGB's green bondsVerification standardsDGB's green bonds  carbon credits  and all its projects need to be verified. Due to the global footprint and the 30-year longevity of the carbon market  everything must go through thorough scrutiny before we can offer carbon reduction credits. Duijvestijn detailed the various carbon standards used to ensure the utmost legitimacy of DGB's practices. Currently  the Verified Carbon Standard  administered by Verra  is the biggest player. The Gold Standard  headquartered in Geneva  Switzerland  is another leading standard that also verifies very efficiently.As everything is independently audited  even a company is not exempt from verification. One can't just claim to be carbon neutral without putting money where one's mouth is. This way  transparency and credibility can be maintained in the market.DGB Group's projects in KenyaSelwyn Duijvestijn elaborated on DGB's amazing efforts in central Kenya and the projects' recent developments. The Hongera Reforestation Projectaims to replant 16 million trees that have been lost due to human activities  which will also do wonders for carbon offsetting and air quality-with an expected 11 million tonnes of carbon to be captured over the project's lifetime. The project currently delivers 15 000 seedlings monthly to local farmers. The local community will also benefit from this project. The Hongera Reforestation Project creates jobs and provides training and yield-bearing trees to farmers  offering better opportunities for locals and alleviating poverty.A community member with tree seedlings in a tree nursery in Kenya - Hongera Reforestation Project  DGB.The aforementioned Hongera Energy Efficient Cookstoves Projectmanufactures and distributes cookstoves that serve as a direct alternative to cooking on open flames. This is directly related to nature because this method of cooking requires less wood than open flames  reducing illegal logging and air pollution and combating deforestation on a large scale. Removing the necessity to cook on open flames also increases the local population's quality of life. Approximately 200 people work at the factory in central Kenya to ensure that we can manufacture and sell 150 000 stoves to the local population. The project aims to capture around 2 million tonnes of carbonover its lifetime. According to Duijvestijn  more than half of the world's population still cooks over open fires. The air pollution that these open fires produce is the cause of the premature deaths of four million people annually. The manufacturing and use of these stoves are thus a significant step towards the locals' general wellbeing  modernisation  and nature conservation.Artisans working in a cookstove factory - Hongera Energy Efficient Cookstoves Project  DGB.These projects prove that together  we can make a positive difference. We can make a lasting impact on the world  winding back negative human intervention and making the world a better  greener place.Read more aboutour projects in KenyaDGB's commitment to nature  driven by CEO Selwyn Duijvestijn  has created a portfolio of impactful nature-based solutions. The carbon credits created by these projects have proven to be a hot commodity from which at least 1 900 companies benefit. These credits can create real change. To purchase carbon credits means to reduce your carbon footprint. Reducing your carbon footprint means becoming more sustainable. Together  we can create a greener  more sustainable tomorrow.Become a sustainable company with D,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,positive,0.55,0.43,0.02,True,English,"['DGB Group CEO', 'TV spotlight', 'Selwyn Duijvestijn', 'carbon offsetting', 'insights', 'September', '07:11', 'Hongera Energy Efficient Cookstoves Project', 'oldest modern securities market', 'two to four years', 'Hongera Reforestation Project', 'greenest project developer', 'indoor air pollution', 'current affairs programme', 'current hot topic', 'The Gold Standard', 'measurable carbon reductions', 'Verified Carbon Standard', 'presenter Harry Mens', 'annual interest returns', 'Carbon Footprint Calculator', 'complete carbon neutrality', 'various carbon standards', 'Business Class programme', 'first carbon credits', 'relevant socio-economic companies', 'Dutch stock exchange', 'carbon reduction credits', 'project sites', 'carbon market', 'past 3.5 years', 'leading standard', 'Dutch television', 'financial returns', 'Verification standards', 'global footprint', 'stock fund', 'business life', 'annual reports', 'carbonreduction credits', 'current projects', 'Economic facets', 'economic aspect', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'nature-based solutions', 'Major players', 'client base', 'net zero', 'Drone view', 'tree nursery', 'Albert Heijn', 'internal processes', 'negative impact', '45 million tonnes', 'next year', 'active discussions', 'largest client', 'local population', 'cleaner ways', 'community member', 'huge wallet', 'green bond', 'environmental impacts', 'investing process', 'tree nurseries', '30-year longevity', 'thorough scrutiny', 'biggest player', 'carbon projects', 'carbon emissions', 'nature protection', 'business world', 'featured company', 'many companies', '2,700 other companies', '7 worldwide projects', 'DGB Group', 'DGB cookstove', 'smaller investors', 'Selwyn Duijvestijn', 'nature restoration', 'sustainability reports', 'bonds', '1,900 companies', 'DGB.', 'Sunday', 'September', 'CEO', 'achievements', 'guest', 'effects', 'look', 'highlights', 'interview', 'Video', 'core', 'portfolio', 'horizon', 'carbonemissions', 'list', 'likes', 'Unilever', 'Ahold', 'Samsung', 'Apple', 'addition', 'opportunities', 'example', 'trees', 'deforestation', 'end', 'start', 'something', 'activities', 'work', 'progress', 'middle', 'buyers', 'possibility', 'words', 'action', 'common', 'Kenya', 'cooking', 'investment', 'trip', 'social', 'time', 'bondholders', 'participation', 'plans', 'fruition', 'issuance', 'future', 'collateral', 'everything', 'legitimacy', 'practices', 'Verra', 'Geneva', 'Switzerland']",2023-09-21,2023-09-22,marketscreener.com

The half-yearly financial report  including the consolidated financial statements (condensed interim financial statements and notes) reviewed by the auditor  is available on the Solutions30 website  www.solutions30.com  in the “Investors Relations” section.Key figuresIn millions of euros H1 2023 H2 2022 H1 2022 Revenue 519.1 460.3 444.3 Adjusted EBITDA 27.5 17.1 29.6 As a % of revenue (EBITDA margin) 5.3% 3.7% 6.7% Adjusted EBIT 5.0 (7.0) 6.7 As a % of revenue 1.0% (1.5%) 1.5% EBIT (6.4) (17.6) (8.9) As a % of revenue (1.2%) (3.8%) (2.0%) Net income. group share (14.4) (37.8) (12.3) As a % of revenue (2.8%) (8.2%) (2.8%) Free cash flow (32.4) 54.1 (16.9) Financial structure dataIn millions of euros 06/30/2023 12/31/2022 Equity 131.8 145.3 Net debt 95.3 38.9 Net bank debt 10.3 (54.0)Consolidated revenueSolutions30’s consolidated half-year revenue for 2023 amounted to €519.1 million  up 16.8% (reported and organic growth).After a solid first quarter with organic growth of 14.5%  strong business momentum continued to build in the second quarter of 2023  with consolidated revenue of €263.9 million growing organically by 18.9% compared to the same period in 2022.This excellent performance was driven by particularly robust growth in the Benelux  Poland  and the United Kingdom. This puts the group on target to exceed the milestone of €1 billion in revenue before the end of 2023.ProfitabilityFigures by geographical area are detailed below:H1 2023 H2 2022 H1 2022 France Revenue 199.4 204.0 221.9 Adjusted EBITDA 15.8 2.0 18.8 EBITDA margin % 7.9% 1.0% 8.5% Benelux Revenue 180.0 123.5 98.4 Adjusted EBITDA 17.5 14.7 13.7 EBITDA margin % 9.7% 11.8% 13.9% Other countries Revenue 139.7 132.8 124.0 Adjusted EBITDA (0.8) 4.7 2.4 EBITDA margin % (0.5%) 3.5% 2.0 %In France  revenue reached €199.4 million in the first half of 2023. Business continued to be negatively impacted by the transformation of the telecom sector and the transition into new activities in the energy sector. The telecom market  however  is showing signs of stabilizing in the second quarter  and the group has been very successful in the energy sector  as illustrated by the recent solar-power contract signed with Q Energy. Growth opportunities are gradually falling into place  while Amaury Boilot  recently named CEO of the group’s French entities  is transforming its organization. Adapting the business model and readjusting the corporate structure to new market conditions have led to a significant recovery of the EBITDA margin compared to the second half of 2022. It rose to 7.9%  a level close to the first half of 2022 and a clear recovery from the 1.0% in the second half of 2022.In the Benelux  revenue for the first half of 2023 grew +82.9% compared to the first half of 2022 to reach €180.0 million driven by fiber-optic roll-outs across the country and the group’s ability to keep up with faster than anticipated installation schedules and consolidate its position as a market leader. This phase of hyper-growth and the fast pace of large-scale ramp-ups required to fulfill orders are temporarily impacting the EBITDA margin  which stood at 9.7% compared to 13.9% in the first half of 2022 and 11.8% in the second half of 2022.In other countries  revenue is up +12.7% compared to the first half of 2022. It reached €139.7 million whereas it was €124.0 million a year earlier. In Italy  the conditions under which ultra-fast broadband infrastructure is being deployed have deteriorated in recent months due to the national service provider’s recurring operational difficulties. The entire sector has been affected  and Solutions30 decided to slow down the pace of call-outs until the situation returns to normal and a more efficient way of operating has been found  in agreement with our various partners. This situation is negatively impacting the segment’s EBITDA margin. Elsewhere  margins are relatively stable but still below the group’s normative levels. In the United Kingdom and Germany  Solutions30 is preparing to absorb the expected growth in the fiber sector  whereas it is focusing on the business activities that are the most profitable in the mature Spanish market. Meanwhile  business in Poland remains dynamic  driven by market share gains. The EBITDA margin for the “Other countries” segment was -0.5% compared with 2.0% for the first half of 2022 and 3.5% for the second half of 2022.As a result  adjusted EBITDA for the entire group amounted to €27.5 million at the end of June 2023 (5.3% of revenue) compared to €29.6 million a year earlier (6.7% of revenue) and €17.1 million in the second half of 2022 (3.7% of revenue).Operating costs increased by +18.9% compared with the first half of 2022 and by 10.9% compared with the second half of 2022. They amounted to €444.4 million  representing 85.6% of revenue. Structural costs increased by 15.6% compared with the first half of 2022 and by 10.5% compared with the second half of 2022. They amounted to €47.2 million  representing 9.1% of revenue.After accounting for €8.9 million in impairments and operational provisions and after amortizing €13.6 million in usage rights for leased assets (IFRS 16)  adjusted EBIT stood at €5.0 million at June 30  2023  compared to €6.7 million a year earlier. This figure is clearly recovering compared to the second half of 2022.The first half of 2023 includes €4.3 million in non-current operating expenses  which mainly consist of restructuring costs  compared to €10.3 million a year earlier.Customer relationship amortization amounted to €7.1 million at June 30  2023 stable compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year.Net financial income represented an expense of €2.9 million in the first half of 2023 compared to an expense of €5.3 million a year earlier. This change is due to an increase in financial income  resulting from foreign exchange gains and a fair value adjustment  while expenses remained stable.After including a tax expense of €1.3 million compared to €3.0 million a year earlier and accounting for €3.7 million in minority interests  the group share of net income amounted to -€14.4 million compared to -€12.3 million for the same period in 2022  and -€37.8 million for the second half of 2022.Financial structureAt June 30  2023  the group had €131.8 million in equity compared to €145.3 million at December 31  2022. The group’s gross cash amounted to €73.4 million  compared to €124.4 million at the end of December 2022 and €85.0 million at June 30  2022  reflecting the usual seasonality of the working capital requirements.Gross bank debt stood at €83.6 million compared to €70.4 million six months earlier. This increase is due to additional drawdowns on the “acquisitions” envelope of the financing secured on November 29  2022. These drawdowns were made to pay earnouts to minority shareholders of group subsidiaries in the first half of the year. The group had €10.3 million in net bank debt at the end of June 2023 compared to €54.0 million in cash net of debt at the end of December 2022. Including €72.8 million in leasing liabilities (IFRS 16) and €12.2 million in potential financial debt on future call options and earnouts  the total net debt amounts to €95.3 million.The group maintains a solid financial structure  with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.7 and a net debt-to-equity ratio of 72.3%.Outstanding receivables under the group’s non-recourse factoring program amounted to €85.9 million at the end of June 2023  compared with €77.3 million at December 31  2022  reflecting the increase in activity. The increase in mobilized receivables is due to ramp-ups in new contracts for which the factoring program is being implemented. Factoring can finance working capital from recurring activities that have fully developed  at a cost of less than 1% of the amount of assigned receivables. This program  combined with a solid financial structure  provides Solutions30 with the resources it needs to finance its growth strategy.Operating cash flow amounted to €22.9 million for the first half of 2023  compared to €19.6 million in the first half of 2022. Though working capital increased by €39.1 million  it remained negative at -€25.6 million. This increase reflects strong growth over the half-year  particularly in the Benelux during the second quarter  and preparation for a new phase of growth in Other Countries. Measures have been put in place to optimize working capital by the end of the year. Cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2023 was a negative €22.0 million  compared with negative cash flow of €6.5 million a year earlier.Net investments amounted to €10.5 million  at a normative level of 2.0% of revenue  compared with 2.4% a year earlier. Overall  this means there was -€32.4 million in free cash flow  compared to -€16.9 million at the end of June 2022.OutlookAt the end of this first half-year  the group remains confident in achieving its goal of double-digit growth in 2023  putting it on track to exceed €1 billion in revenue this year. Over the last six months  the group has seen growth paired with a steady increase in margins experienced. This improvement is due to ongoing adaptations in France and rapid expansion throughout the rest of Europe.In France  operational and organizational efforts to restore margins and improve conditions for telecom contracts are bearing fruit. With the replacement of smart meter deployment activities accelerating and the return to normal in the telecoms market  revenue should begin to stabilize. The photovoltaic business is experiencing significant growth  fueled by Europe’s shift towards greener energy solutions and the goal of achieving energy independence. Notably  the backlog of orders has doubled compared to the same period last year. Through its subsidiaries  Solutions30 Sud-Ouest and Elec-EnR  the group is consolidating its position as one of the top 5 leaders in the renewable energy installation market in France. Solutions30 is now involved in major projects  including the construction of Europe’s largest floating solar park. Leveraging its wide-ranging expertise and advanced electrical know-how acquired from years of experience with fiber and smart meter deployments  Solutions30 is well positioned to undertake this significant initiative.In the Benelux  the group should continue to experience sustained growth  and profitability should be back above 10% in the second half of the year since most of the ramp-ups had already occurred in the first six months.In other countries  growth is expected to continue  carried by encouraging trends in the United Kingdom  while efforts to restore profitability in Italy should start to pay off soon. Giovanni Ragusa  Chief Operations Officer of Solutions30 Italy since 2008  has been appointed Chief Executive Officer for this country.The group aims to maintain its leadership in its existing markets and to scale to a critical size everywhere it operates  all while working to improve profitability. The group will leverage the structural trends that are carrying its markets  returning to dynamic and profitable growth over the long term.Upcoming event2023 Q3 Revenue Report November 8  2023About Solutions30 SESolutions30 provides consumers and businesses with access to the key technological advancements that are shaping our everyday lives  especially those driving the digital transformation and energy transition.

They amounted to €47.2 million  representing 9.1% of revenue.After accounting for €8.9 million in impairments and operational provisions and after amortizing €13.6 million in usage rights for leased assets (IFRS 16)  adjusted EBIT stood at €5.0 million at June 30  2023  compared to €6.7 million a year earlier. This figure is clearly recovering compared to the second half of 2022.The first half of 2023 includes €4.3 million in non-current operating expenses  which mainly consist of restructuring costs  compared to €10.3 million a year earlier.Customer relationship amortization amounted to €7.1 million at June 30  2023 stable compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year.Net financial income represented an expense of €2.9 million in the first half of 2023 compared to an expense of €5.3 million a year earlier. This change is due to an increase in financial income  resulting from foreign exchange gains and a fair value adjustment  while expenses remained stable.After including a tax expense of €1.3 million compared to €3.0 million a year earlier and accounting for €3.7 million in minority interests  the group share of net income amounted to -€14.4 million compared to -€12.3 million for the same period in 2022  and -€37.8 million for the second half of 2022.Financial structureAt June 30  2023  the group had €131.8 million in equity compared to €145.3 million at December 31  2022. The group’s gross cash amounted to €73.4 million  compared to €124.4 million at the end of December 2022 and €85.0 million at June 30  2022  reflecting the usual seasonality of the working capital requirements.Gross bank debt stood at €83.6 million compared to €70.4 million six months earlier. This increase is due to additional drawdowns on the “acquisitions” envelope of the financing secured on November 29  2022. These drawdowns were made to pay earnouts to minority shareholders of group subsidiaries in the first half of the year. The group had €10.3 million in net bank debt at the end of June 2023 compared to €54.0 million in cash net of debt at the end of December 2022. Including €72.8 million in leasing liabilities (IFRS 16) and €12.2 million in potential financial debt on future call options and earnouts  the total net debt amounts to €95.3 million.The group maintains a solid financial structure  with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.7 and a net debt-to-equity ratio of 72.3%.Outstanding receivables under the group’s non-recourse factoring program amounted to €85.9 million at the end of June 2023  compared with €77.3 million at December 31  2022  reflecting the increase in activity. The increase in mobilized receivables is due to ramp-ups in new contracts for which the factoring program is being implemented. Factoring can finance working capital from recurring activities that have fully developed  at a cost of less than 1% of the amount of assigned receivables. This program  combined with a solid financial structure  provides Solutions30 with the resources it needs to finance its growth strategy.Operating cash flow amounted to €22.9 million for the first half of 2023  compared to €19.6 million in the first half of 2022. Though working capital increased by €39.1 million  it remained negative at -€25.6 million. This increase reflects strong growth over the half-year  particularly in the Benelux during the second quarter  and preparation for a new phase of growth in Other Countries. Measures have been put in place to optimize working capital by the end of the year. Cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2023 was a negative €22.0 million  compared with negative cash flow of €6.5 million a year earlier.Net investments amounted to €10.5 million  at a normative level of 2.0% of revenue  compared with 2.4% a year earlier. Overall  this means there was -€32.4 million in free cash flow  compared to -€16.9 million at the end of June 2022.OutlookAt the end of this first half-year  the group remains confident in achieving its goal of double-digit growth in 2023  putting it on track to exceed €1 billion in revenue this year. Over the last six months  the group has seen growth paired with a steady increase in margins experienced. This improvement is due to ongoing adaptations in France and rapid expansion throughout the rest of Europe.In France  operational and organizational efforts to restore margins and improve conditions for telecom contracts are bearing fruit. With the replacement of smart meter deployment activities accelerating and the return to normal in the telecoms market  revenue should begin to stabilize. The photovoltaic business is experiencing significant growth  fueled by Europe’s shift towards greener energy solutions and the goal of achieving energy independence. Notably  the backlog of orders has doubled compared to the same period last year. Through its subsidiaries  Solutions30 Sud-Ouest and Elec-EnR  the group is consolidating its position as one of the top 5 leaders in the renewable energy installation market in France. Solutions30 is now involved in major projects  including the construction of Europe’s largest floating solar park. Leveraging its wide-ranging expertise and advanced electrical know-how acquired from years of experience with fiber and smart meter deployments  Solutions30 is well positioned to undertake this significant initiative.In the Benelux  the group should continue to experience sustained growth  and profitability should be back above 10% in the second half of the year since most of the ramp-ups had already occurred in the first six months.In other countries  growth is expected to continue  carried by encouraging trends in the United Kingdom  while efforts to restore profitability in Italy should start to pay off soon. Giovanni Ragusa  Chief Operations Officer of Solutions30 Italy since 2008  has been appointed Chief Executive Officer for this country.The group aims to maintain its leadership in its existing markets and to scale to a critical size everywhere it operates  all while working to improve profitability. The group will leverage the structural trends that are carrying its markets  returning to dynamic and profitable growth over the long term.Upcoming event2023 Q3 Revenue Report November 8  2023About Solutions30 SESolutions30 provides consumers and businesses with access to the key technological advancements that are shaping our everyday lives  especially those driving the digital transformation and energy transition.

This reflects the relevance of our strategic choices and the value of our products. Our transformation in 2022 allow us to enter the cycle of growth and profitability we're experiencing today.Our markets are dynamic  and there are numerous opportunities  especially with the surge in demand related to the emergence of AI and the new opportunities for Kalray with the release of Coolidge2. The ramp-up of the partnership with Dell is more gradual than anticipated  with also longer sales cycles than direct sales  this model confirms its effectiveness  and we are confident in achieving EBITDA breakeven as early as this year.

This includes 5 016 K€ in external expenses (compared to €4 417 K€ as of June 30  2022) and an increase in personnel expenses of +40% to 10 680 K€ compared to 7 283 K€ as of June 30  2022  due to ongoing recruitment (sales  support  management) and salary increases in an inflationary context.Despite increases in operating expenses aligned with the Company's growth strategy  and thanks to strong growth and gross margin  consolidated EBITDA[1] is at break-even for the first time  at -34 K€ as of June 30  2023  compared to -2 015 K€ as of June 30  2022.Depreciation and provision expenses amount to 4 317 K€ in the first half of 2023  compared to 7 837 K€ in the first half of 2022. This variation is explained by the end of the depreciation of Coolidge™ before the start of the depreciation of Coolidge™ 2  whose production was launched this summer.Research tax credit amounts to 1 474 K€ compared to 2 244 K€ as of June 30  2022 due to a higher proportion of subsidies in the first half.The adjusted operating result[2] improves significantly to -2 877 K€ compared to -7 608 K€.After taking into account the financial result  the net result improves significantly to -3 001 K€ as of June 30  2023  compared to -7 524 K€ as of June 30  2022.STRONG GROSS CASH OF €23.3 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30  2023KALRAY's equity stands at 55 572 K€ as of June 30  2023  compared to 47 707 K€ as of June 30  2022.KALRAY's available cash remains strong at 23 298 K€ as of June 30  2023  compared to €32 198 K€ as of December 31  2022  in a context of financing growth (-6 515 K€ in operating cash flows) and continued investments (-1 844 K€ in investment cash flows).Financial debts amount to 10 129 K€ (compared to 12 974 K€ as of December 31  2022) and include 6 229 K€ in conditional advances and 3 900 K€ in bank debts (corresponding to the amortizable government-guaranteed loan over 4 years starting from mid-2022).JUMBO CONTRACT SCHEDULE ON TRACK  COOLIDGE™ 2 LAUNCH   AND EXPANDING HORIZONS IN THE FIELD OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEFollowing the completion of the Coolidge™2 design phase in June and the beginning of its production  Kalray received the first samples of its new processor in late August. Coolidge™2 will be delivered to the first customers by the end of September. Coolidge™2 comes with Kalray's complete development environment  including the Kalray AccessCore™ SDK  the KaNN software tool for porting various deep learning networks developed from industry-standard tools  and the new K300 acceleration cards featuring Coolidge™2.With the rise of AI and the need to process and analyze data more efficiently  fast storage plays a crucial role. Coolidge™2 aims to further enhance the performance of its current range of fast storage solutions. Acceleration cards based on Coolidge™2 will deliver performance gains of 20% to 50% compared to current solutions  significant energy consumption reductions  and support for additional features such as real-time compression to optimize storage utilization.Beyond the data-intensive storage market  Kalray aims to take a leadership position in the broader edge computing market. Coolidge™2 targets two particular types of solutions. First  ""Smart Vision"" solutions involve analyzing streams of images or videos as efficiently as possible  particularly using new AI-based approaches. Kalray has already signed a major contract with an industry leader in 2022[3] who will be one of the first to test Coolidge™2. Additionally  the telecommunications and 5G market  for which Kalray is working with several industry leaders  is also evolving rapidly with the increasing adoption of AI to replace or complement traditional algorithms that have been commonly used to date.CONTINUATION OF KALRAY'S TECHNOLOGY RECOGNITION AND NEW ALLIANCE IN THE MEDIA SECTORAs announced during the summer[4]  KALRAY was recognized for the best DPU at the 17th edition of the Flash Memory Summit Awards. This award signifies industry recognition of KALRAY's innovation and commercial value in the data intensive storage market  and for DPUs in general. for the second consecutive year.KALRAY also recently announced a strategic alliance between its subsidiary pixitmedia and Grass Valley  a leading provider of technologies for the media and entertainment industry  to offer a joint solution for content delivery on-site  in the cloud  and in hybrid mode. This technical alliance aims to combine the expertise and technology of two industry leaders in media  integrating pixitmedia's storage solution that delivers capacity and performance to demanding workloads with Grass Valley's Agile Media Processing Platform (AMPP) ecosystem[5].EXPECTED EBITDA AT BREAK-EVEN FOR 2023 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE COMPANY HISTORYKALRAY observes a strong demand on its offering targeting fast storage  especially in the domain of GenAI (“Generative Artificial Intelligence”) and of Media & Entertainment. The implementation of an indirect sales model for this offering allows Kalray to leverage its partners' existing infrastructure and reduce the Group's operational expenses. However  the ramp-up of the recent partnership with Dell  while significant  is slower than initially anticipated  with longer sales cycles compared to Kalray's direct sales.For these reasons  Kalray anticipates annual revenue of approximately €30 million  compared to the initial projection of €40 million  while remaining confident in achieving EBITDA breakeven this year  surpassing its previous goal of improving EBITDA (compared to -€2.7 million in 2022).AVAILABILITY OF THE 2023 HALF-YEAR FINANCIAL REPORTThe half-year financial report  including unaudited consolidated financial statements as of June 30  2023  and their appendices  will be available in the ""Financial Documents"" section on the company's website at www.kalray-bourse.comABOUT KALRAYKalray is a leading provider of hardware and software technologies and solutions for high-performance  data-centric computing markets  from cloud to edge.Kalray provides a full range of products to enable smarter  more efficient  and energy-wise data-intensive applications and infrastructures.

The half year financial report  including the condensed consolidated interim financial report and the half year management report  is available on the Company’s website (Financial Reports – Valneva).Valneva will provide a live webcast of its first half 2023 results conference call beginningat 3 p.m. CEST/9 a.m. EDT today. This webcast will also be available on the Company’s website. Please refer to this link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/qbnasrnqPeter Bühler  Valneva’s Chief Financial Officer  commented  “We delivered another strong quarter of growth  leading our first half vaccine sales to more than double year-over-year  while continuing to progress our clinical studies. Our objective is to continue driving these sales in 2023 and  at the same time  continue to build a stronger commercial vaccine portfolio  notably with the potential addition of our chikungunya vaccine candidate later this year.”Clinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesCHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1553BLA under priority review by the U.S. FDAVLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single-dose vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a mosquito-borne virus that has spread to more than 110 countries3 with the potential to rapidly expand further. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert in February 2023 as the number of cases and deaths due to chikungunya continues to rise in the Americas4. With no preventive vaccine or specific treatment yet available  chikungunya is considered a major public health threat.VLA1553 is currently the first and only chikungunya vaccine candidate worldwide for which regulatory review processes are underway. A Biologic License Application (BLA) is currently under priority review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)5 with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date planned for end of November 20236. The FDA extended the PDUFA date by three months in August 2023 to allow sufficient time to align and agree on the Phase 4 program (post marketing requirements) necessary under the accelerated approval pathway7. No additional clinical data have been requested for the approval process.Additionally  a regulatory application was filed with Health Canada at the end of May 20238 and accepted for review at the end of August 20239.If approved  VLA1553 could become the first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need.The regulatory submissions with Health Canada and the FDA follow final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 202210  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202211 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202212. The pivotal Phase 3 data were published in The Lancet  the world’s leading peer-reviewed medical journal  in June 202313. The article  titled  “ Safety and immunogenicity of a single-shot live-attenuated chikungunya vaccine: a double-blind  multicenter  randomized  placebo-controlled phase 3 trial   ” provides a detailed analysis of the Phase 3 results showing that VLA1553 demonstrated a very high seroresponse rate of 98.9% in participants 28 days after receiving the single administration. This immunogenicity profile was similar in both younger and older adults  and 96% of participants maintained seroresponse six months after vaccination. VLA1553 was equally well tolerated in younger and older adults. Earlier clinical data  published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases  showed that the onset of the immune response after a single dose of VLA1553 is between 7- and 14-days post-vaccination14. This potential for a rapid onset of seroresponse was later confirmed in a post-hoc analysis of the Phase 1 study which showed that 100% of vaccinated individuals reached the seroresponse threshold at day 1415. Additionally  VLA1553 was able to demonstrate a robust immune response which was sustained for 12 months with a 99% seroresponse rate and was equally durable in younger and older adults16. This dedicated antibody persistence trial (VLA1553-303) will continue to evaluate persistence for a period of at least five years. VLA1553 uses the live-attenuated virus vaccine technology  known to induce long-lasting immunity after a single dose. Examples of live-attenuated vaccines include the combined measles  mumps and rubella (MMR)  yellow fever  and chickenpox (varicella) vaccines.A clinical study in adolescents  VLA1553-321  is ongoing in Brazil  for which Valneva reported enrollment and vaccination completion in February 202317 and initial safety data in August 202318. Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and conducted in collaboration with Instituto Butantan  the VLA1553-321 adolescent trial is intended to support the label extension in this age group following a potential initial FDA approval in adults. The trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations. Additionally  the present safety analysis is expected to enable regulatory submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) later this year.Initial safety data generated from the study  Valneva’s first clinical study in an endemic area and with individuals previously infected with CHIKV  show that VLA1553 was generally well tolerated in 754 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years  regardless of previous CHIKV infection. Immunogenicity data for the trial are expected in November 2023.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing  and marketing of VLA155319. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201920  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.VLA1553 received FDA Fast Track  Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review designations in 2018  2021 and 2023 respectively. The sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine BLA to be approved in the United States will be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher  or PRV. The program was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the EMA in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the second half of 2023.Valneva intends to commercialize VLA1553  if approved  by leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial infrastructures. The global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 203221.LYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 study ongoing and first positive pediatric and adolescent booster results reportedValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. VLA15 is a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine that targets six serotypes of Borrelia representing the most common strains found in North America and Europe. VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine program in advanced clinical development today and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA.Valneva and Pfizer reported results for three Phase 2 clinical trials of VLA15 in both adult and pediatric populations  in which high levels of antibodies against all six strains were observed22 23 24. These include the announcement in September 2023 of positive Phase 2 pediatric and adolescent immunogenicity and safety data following a booster vaccination with VLA15. These results from the VLA15-221 Phase 2 study showed a strong anamnestic antibody response for all serotypes in pediatric (5 to 11 years of age) and adolescent participants (12 to 17 years of age)  as well as in adults (18 to 65 years of age)  one month after administration of a booster dose (month 19). The safety and tolerability profile of VLA15 after a booster dose was consistent with previous studies25.In August 2022  the companies initiated a Phase 3 clinical study  ""Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR)""  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in participants five years of age and older in highly endemic regions in the United States and Europe26.The VALOR study is currently ongoing and is designed to follow vaccinated participants over two consecutive tick seasons. As communicated in February 2023  Pfizer had to discontinue approximately half of the total recruited participants in the trial following violations of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) at certain trial sites in the U.S. run by a third-party trial site operator. The clinical study remains ongoing with other sites not operated by the third party  and Pfizer has begun enrolling new participants into a second  identical cohort at those sites in addition to newly added sites in the U.S. and Canada. The original study design and endpoints previously agreed with regulators have not changed. Current projected incremental study execution costs incurred due to the agreed amount of additional enrollment will be borne by Pfizer.Participants enrolled in the first cohort will receive their booster vaccination as planned in the second quarter of 2024 in advance of the 2024 tick season. Enrollment for primary immunization of the second cohort began in the second quarter of 2023 with overall trial continuation to include the 2025 tick season.Pfizer is aiming to submit a BLA to the FDA and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the EMA in 2026  subject to positive data.ZIKA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1601Re-initiation of clinical development with further program evaluation plannedVLA1601 is a highly purified inactivated  adjuvanted vaccine candidate against the mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV). Disease outbreaks have been reported in tropical Africa  Southeast Asia  the Pacific Islands  and  since 2015  in the Americas. Zika virus transmission persists in several countries in the Americas and in other endemic regions. To date  a total of 89 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito-transmitted Zika virus infection; however  surveillance remains limited globally. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  Zika remains a public health threat.VLA1601 is being developed on the original manufacturing platform of Valneva’s licensed Japanese Encephalitis vaccine IXIARO®  which was further optimized to develop the Company’s inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001  the first one to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe27.Valneva has decided to re-initiate clinical development with further program evaluation to be conducted subject to data  medical need and market prospects. This decision is based on the persistence of Zika transmission in several countries28  the possibility to leverage the Company’s existing inactivated viral platform and potentially its expertise in accelerated regulatory pathways  as well as VLA1601’s compelling Target Product Profile (TPP).Pre-Clinical Vaccine CandidatesValneva continues to progress selected pre-clinical assets to further strengthen its future clinical pipeline.In preclinical R&D  the Company is currently prioritizing VLA2112  a vaccine candidate targeting the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is a ubiquitous human pathogen that can cause infectious mononucleosis29 and is strongly associated with the development of several types of cancer30 and multiple sclerosis31.Other early-stage activities include vaccine candidates against different enteric diseases.Valneva continues to explore potential partnering opportunities for VLA1554  its vaccine candidate targeting the human metapneumovirus (hMPV)  a major worldwide respiratory pathogen that causes acute upper and lower respiratory tract infection32.Commercial VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO®/JESPECT®)IXIARO® is a Vero cell culture-derived inactivated Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine that is the only JE vaccine licensed and available in the United States  Canada and Europe. IXIARO® is indicated for active immunization against Japanese encephalitis  the most prevalent cause of viral encephalitis in Asia  for adults  adolescents  children and infants aged two months and older.In the first half of 2023  IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales increased by to 147% to €30.3 million compared to €12.3 million in the first half of 2022  benefiting from a significant recovery in the private travel markets following the decline of the COVID-19 pandemic  as well as from price increases.Valneva distributes IXIARO® directly to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Company expects to announce a new contract with the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) imminently.CHOLERA / ETEC33-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL®)DUKORAL® is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC34  the leading cause of travelers’ diarrhea. DUKORAL® is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera  and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.In the first half of 2023  DUKORAL® sales increased by 197% to €17.1 million compared to €5.8 million in the first half of 2022  also benefiting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets and price increases.THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTIONValneva distributes certain third-party vaccines in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure. In the first half of 2023  third party product sales increased by 44% to €16.5 million from €11.5 million in the first half of 2022.MANUFACTURING UPDATEValneva’s Management Board decides on strategic direction for new Scottish manufacturing facility AlmeidaIn July 2023  Valneva’s Management Board took the decision to begin a staggered transfer of production for Valneva’s Japanese encephalitis vaccine and chikungunya vaccine candidate to its state-of-the-art Almeida manufacturing facility  which was initially built to produce the Company’s COVID-19 vaccine. As communicated in its first quarter results on May 4  2023  the Company had been exploring options for the facility  including a possible sale of the facility. The Company will carefully balance resources across its two Scottish facilities to ensure a smooth and efficient transfer of production to Almeida.Valneva divests Swedish clinical trial manufacturing unit to NorthX BiologicsAs part of its strategy to focus on core business activities  Valneva divested its clinical trial manufacturing  or CTM  unit in Solna  Sweden  to NorthX Biologics  an established Nordic contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) in July 2023. The deal comprised Valneva’s CTM production facility and approximately 30 staff members in Sweden. Valneva Sweden retains 150 employees at its Swedish site  working in the Company’s dedicated production unit for its cholera vaccine DUKORAL® and its center of excellence for fill and finish operations.First Half 2023 Financial Review(Unaudited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €73.7 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €93.2 million in the first half of 2022  a decrease of 20.9%. The decrease was related to non-recurring revenues recorded in the prior year related to the Company’s COVID-19 program.Valneva’s total product sales reached €69.7 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €33.3 million in the first half of 2022  an increase of 109.0%. This was driven by a continued recovery of travel vaccine sales. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed to a €0.7 million decline in product sales. COVID-19 vaccine sales in the first half of 2023 amounted to €5.7 million compared to €3.8 million in the first half of 2022. Excluding COVID-19  product sales reached €64.0 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €29.5 million in the comparator period of 2022  an increase of 116.6%.IXIARO®/JESPECT® product sales were €30.3 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €12.3 million in the first half of 2022  an increase of 146.8% with sales benefitting from the continuing recovery of travel markets as well as price increases. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed to a €0.2 million decline in product sales. DUKORAL® sales were €17.1 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €5.8 million in the first half of 2022  an increase of 197.4%  also benefitting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets and price increases. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed to a €0.3 million decline in product sales. Third Party product sales were €16.5 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €11.5 million in the first half of 2022  an increase of 43.8%  which was mainly driven by sales under the distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic for Rabipur®/RabAvert® and Encepur®.Other revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services amounted to €4.1 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €59.9 million in the first half of 2022. The prior year period included €89.4 million released from the refund liability as a result of the settlement with the UK government  partially offset by €36.1 million of negative revenue resulting from an increase in the refund liability linked to the amendment to the VLA15 collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer.Operating Result and Adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €53.8 million in the first half of 2023. The gross margin on commercial product sales excluding COVID-19 sales was 40.0% compared to 58.3% in the first half of 2022. COGS of €18.1 million related to IXIARO® product sales yielding a product gross margin of 40.2%. COGS of €10.1 million related to DUKORAL® product sales yielding a product gross margin of 40.9%. The gross margin of IXIARO® was impacted by batch write-offs in the Scottish manufacturing site. Additionally  the gross margins of both IXIARO® and DUKORAL® were adversely impacted by high indirect sales in markets where Valneva sells through distributors. Of the remaining COGS for the first half of 2023  €10.2 million were related to the Third-Party product distribution business  €3.8 million to COVID-19 product sales and €6.1 million to initial COGS related to the launch preparations for the chikungunya vaccine candidate as well as to idle capacity costs. In the first half of 2022  overall COGS were €171.5 million  of which €167.2 million related to cost of goods and €4.3 million related to cost of services. COGS in the first half of 2022 included write-offs related to the significant reduction of COVID-19 sales volumes to EC Member States.Research and development expenses amounted to €26.0 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €51.9 million in the first half of 2022. This decrease was exclusively driven by the lower spend on Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001. At the same time  cost related to the Zika vaccine candidate increased as the Company has been working towards a re-initiation of clinical development. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first half of 2023 amounted to €20.0 million compared to €7.8 million in the first half of 2022. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first half of 2023 notably included €7.8 million of expenses related to the launch preparation costs of the chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  compared to €2.2 million in the first half of 2022. In the first half of 2023  general and administrative expenses increased to €22.9 million from €16.0 million in the first half of 2022. COGS  research and development  marketing and distribution as well as general and administrative expenses benefited in the first half of 2022 from an accrual adjustment income of €19.5 million related to the favorable effect of the Company’s share price development on the employee share-based compensation programs.Other income  net of other expenses  increased to €15.9 million in the first half of 2023 from €3.6 million in the first half of 2022. This increase was mainly driven by recognizing grant income received from Scottish Enterprise into the income statement in the first half of 2023.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €35.0 million in the first half of 2023 compared to an operating loss of €150.4 million in the first half of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss in the first half of 2023 was €28.3 million compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of €136.0 million in the first half of 2022 (as explained further below).Net ResultIn the first half of 2023  Valneva generated a net loss of €35.0 million compared to a net loss of €171.5 million in the first half of 2022.Finance expense and foreign currency effects in the first half of 2023 resulted in a net finance expense of €3.9 million  compared to a net finance expense of €18.8 million in the first half of 2022. This was mainly a result of a foreign exchange gain amounting to €4.5 million in the first half of 2023  primarily driven by revaluation results of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  compared to a net foreign exchange loss of €10.7 million in the first half of 2022. Interest expenses net of interest income were €8.4 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €8.2 million in the first half of 2022.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €65.4 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €100.2 million in the first half of 2022. Cash outflows in the first half of 2023 mainly resulted from the operating loss as well as increased working capital. Cash outflows in the first half of 2022 mainly resulted from the operating loss generated.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €6.6 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €16.0 million in the first half of 2022  both mainly related to construction activities at the Scottish production site and purchases of equipment.Net cash used in financing activities amounted to €9.5 million in the first half of 2023  which was mainly due to interest payments as well as payments of lease liabilities. Cash inflows in the first half of 2022 amounted to €105.0 million and mainly related to proceeds from the equity subscription agreement with Pfizer as well as disbursements from the credit facility provided by Deerfield & OrbiMed.Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €204.4 million as at June 30  2023  compared to €289.4 million as at December 31  2022.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results  as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provides additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization.A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating loss  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million 6 months ending June 30 (unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS) 2023 2022 Net Income (35.0) (171.5) Add: Income tax expense (3.8) 2.3 Total Finance income (0.5) (0.0) Total Finance expense 8.9 8.2 Foreign exchange gain/(loss) – net (4.5) 10.7 Result from investments in associates - (0.0) Amortization 3.2 3.5 Depreciation 5.4 7.7 Impairment  excluding impairment loss of disposal (1.9) 3.3 Adjusted EBITDA (28.3) (136.0)About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases.

The half year financial report  including the condensed consolidated interim financial report and the half year management report  is available on the Company’s website (Financial Reports – Valneva).Valneva will provide a live webcast of its first half 2023 results conference call beginningat 3 p.m. CEST/9 a.m. EDT today. This webcast will also be available on the Company’s website. Please refer to this link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/qbnasrnqPeter Bühler  Valneva’s Chief Financial Officer  commented  “We delivered another strong quarter of growth  leading our first half vaccine sales to more than double year-over-year  while continuing to progress our clinical studies. Our objective is to continue driving these sales in 2023 and  at the same time  continue to build a stronger commercial vaccine portfolio  notably with the potential addition of our chikungunya vaccine candidate later this year.”Clinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesCHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1553BLA under priority review by the U.S. FDAVLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single-dose vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a mosquito-borne virus that has spread to more than 110 countries3 with the potential to rapidly expand further. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert in February 2023 as the number of cases and deaths due to chikungunya continues to rise in the Americas4. With no preventive vaccine or specific treatment yet available  chikungunya is considered a major public health threat.VLA1553 is currently the first and only chikungunya vaccine candidate worldwide for which regulatory review processes are underway. A Biologic License Application (BLA) is currently under priority review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)5 with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date planned for end of November 20236. The FDA extended the PDUFA date by three months in August 2023 to allow sufficient time to align and agree on the Phase 4 program (post marketing requirements) necessary under the accelerated approval pathway7. No additional clinical data have been requested for the approval process.Additionally  a regulatory application was filed with Health Canada at the end of May 20238 and accepted for review at the end of August 20239.If approved  VLA1553 could become the first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need.The regulatory submissions with Health Canada and the FDA follow final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 202210  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202211 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202212. The pivotal Phase 3 data were published in The Lancet  the world’s leading peer-reviewed medical journal  in June 202313. The article  titled  “ Safety and immunogenicity of a single-shot live-attenuated chikungunya vaccine: a double-blind  multicenter  randomized  placebo-controlled phase 3 trial   ” provides a detailed analysis of the Phase 3 results showing that VLA1553 demonstrated a very high seroresponse rate of 98.9% in participants 28 days after receiving the single administration. This immunogenicity profile was similar in both younger and older adults  and 96% of participants maintained seroresponse six months after vaccination. VLA1553 was equally well tolerated in younger and older adults. Earlier clinical data  published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases  showed that the onset of the immune response after a single dose of VLA1553 is between 7- and 14-days post-vaccination14. This potential for a rapid onset of seroresponse was later confirmed in a post-hoc analysis of the Phase 1 study which showed that 100% of vaccinated individuals reached the seroresponse threshold at day 1415. Additionally  VLA1553 was able to demonstrate a robust immune response which was sustained for 12 months with a 99% seroresponse rate and was equally durable in younger and older adults16. This dedicated antibody persistence trial (VLA1553-303) will continue to evaluate persistence for a period of at least five years. VLA1553 uses the live-attenuated virus vaccine technology  known to induce long-lasting immunity after a single dose. Examples of live-attenuated vaccines include the combined measles  mumps and rubella (MMR)  yellow fever  and chickenpox (varicella) vaccines.A clinical study in adolescents  VLA1553-321  is ongoing in Brazil  for which Valneva reported enrollment and vaccination completion in February 202317 and initial safety data in August 202318. Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and conducted in collaboration with Instituto Butantan  the VLA1553-321 adolescent trial is intended to support the label extension in this age group following a potential initial FDA approval in adults. The trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations. Additionally  the present safety analysis is expected to enable regulatory submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) later this year.Initial safety data generated from the study  Valneva’s first clinical study in an endemic area and with individuals previously infected with CHIKV  show that VLA1553 was generally well tolerated in 754 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years  regardless of previous CHIKV infection. Immunogenicity data for the trial are expected in November 2023.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing  and marketing of VLA155319. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201920  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.VLA1553 received FDA Fast Track  Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review designations in 2018  2021 and 2023 respectively. The sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine BLA to be approved in the United States will be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher  or PRV. The program was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the EMA in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the second half of 2023.Valneva intends to commercialize VLA1553  if approved  by leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial infrastructures. The global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 203221.LYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 study ongoing and first positive pediatric and adolescent booster results reportedValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. VLA15 is a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine that targets six serotypes of Borrelia representing the most common strains found in North America and Europe. VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine program in advanced clinical development today and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA.Valneva and Pfizer reported results for three Phase 2 clinical trials of VLA15 in both adult and pediatric populations  in which high levels of antibodies against all six strains were observed22 23 24. These include the announcement in September 2023 of positive Phase 2 pediatric and adolescent immunogenicity and safety data following a booster vaccination with VLA15. These results from the VLA15-221 Phase 2 study showed a strong anamnestic antibody response for all serotypes in pediatric (5 to 11 years of age) and adolescent participants (12 to 17 years of age)  as well as in adults (18 to 65 years of age)  one month after administration of a booster dose (month 19). The safety and tolerability profile of VLA15 after a booster dose was consistent with previous studies25.In August 2022  the companies initiated a Phase 3 clinical study  ""Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR)""  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in participants five years of age and older in highly endemic regions in the United States and Europe26.The VALOR study is currently ongoing and is designed to follow vaccinated participants over two consecutive tick seasons. As communicated in February 2023  Pfizer had to discontinue approximately half of the total recruited participants in the trial following violations of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) at certain trial sites in the U.S. run by a third-party trial site operator. The clinical study remains ongoing with other sites not operated by the third party  and Pfizer has begun enrolling new participants into a second  identical cohort at those sites in addition to newly added sites in the U.S. and Canada. The original study design and endpoints previously agreed with regulators have not changed. Current projected incremental study execution costs incurred due to the agreed amount of additional enrollment will be borne by Pfizer.Participants enrolled in the first cohort will receive their booster vaccination as planned in the second quarter of 2024 in advance of the 2024 tick season. Enrollment for primary immunization of the second cohort began in the second quarter of 2023 with overall trial continuation to include the 2025 tick season.Pfizer is aiming to submit a BLA to the FDA and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the EMA in 2026  subject to positive data.ZIKA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1601Re-initiation of clinical development with further program evaluation plannedVLA1601 is a highly purified inactivated  adjuvanted vaccine candidate against the mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV). Disease outbreaks have been reported in tropical Africa  Southeast Asia  the Pacific Islands  and  since 2015  in the Americas. Zika virus transmission persists in several countries in the Americas and in other endemic regions. To date  a total of 89 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito-transmitted Zika virus infection; however  surveillance remains limited globally. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  Zika remains a public health threat.VLA1601 is being developed on the original manufacturing platform of Valneva’s licensed Japanese Encephalitis vaccine IXIARO®  which was further optimized to develop the Company’s inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001  the first one to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe27.Valneva has decided to re-initiate clinical development with further program evaluation to be conducted subject to data  medical need and market prospects. This decision is based on the persistence of Zika transmission in several countries28  the possibility to leverage the Company’s existing inactivated viral platform and potentially its expertise in accelerated regulatory pathways  as well as VLA1601’s compelling Target Product Profile (TPP).Pre-Clinical Vaccine CandidatesValneva continues to progress selected pre-clinical assets to further strengthen its future clinical pipeline.In preclinical R&D  the Company is currently prioritizing VLA2112  a vaccine candidate targeting the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is a ubiquitous human pathogen that can cause infectious mononucleosis29 and is strongly associated with the development of several types of cancer30 and multiple sclerosis31.Other early-stage activities include vaccine candidates against different enteric diseases.Valneva continues to explore potential partnering opportunities for VLA1554  its vaccine candidate targeting the human metapneumovirus (hMPV)  a major worldwide respiratory pathogen that causes acute upper and lower respiratory tract infection32.Commercial VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO®/JESPECT®)IXIARO® is a Vero cell culture-derived inactivated Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine that is the only JE vaccine licensed and available in the United States  Canada and Europe. IXIARO® is indicated for active immunization against Japanese encephalitis  the most prevalent cause of viral encephalitis in Asia  for adults  adolescents  children and infants aged two months and older.In the first half of 2023  IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales increased by to 147% to €30.3 million compared to €12.3 million in the first half of 2022  benefiting from a significant recovery in the private travel markets following the decline of the COVID-19 pandemic  as well as from price increases.Valneva distributes IXIARO® directly to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Company expects to announce a new contract with the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) imminently.CHOLERA / ETEC33-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL®)DUKORAL® is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC34  the leading cause of travelers’ diarrhea. DUKORAL® is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera  and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.In the first half of 2023  DUKORAL® sales increased by 197% to €17.1 million compared to €5.8 million in the first half of 2022  also benefiting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets and price increases.THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTIONValneva distributes certain third-party vaccines in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure. In the first half of 2023  third party product sales increased by 44% to €16.5 million from €11.5 million in the first half of 2022.MANUFACTURING UPDATEValneva’s Management Board decides on strategic direction for new Scottish manufacturing facility AlmeidaIn July 2023  Valneva’s Management Board took the decision to begin a staggered transfer of production for Valneva’s Japanese encephalitis vaccine and chikungunya vaccine candidate to its state-of-the-art Almeida manufacturing facility  which was initially built to produce the Company’s COVID-19 vaccine. As communicated in its first quarter results on May 4  2023  the Company had been exploring options for the facility  including a possible sale of the facility. The Company will carefully balance resources across its two Scottish facilities to ensure a smooth and efficient transfer of production to Almeida.Valneva divests Swedish clinical trial manufacturing unit to NorthX BiologicsAs part of its strategy to focus on core business activities  Valneva divested its clinical trial manufacturing  or CTM  unit in Solna  Sweden  to NorthX Biologics  an established Nordic contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) in July 2023. The deal comprised Valneva’s CTM production facility and approximately 30 staff members in Sweden. Valneva Sweden retains 150 employees at its Swedish site  working in the Company’s dedicated production unit for its cholera vaccine DUKORAL® and its center of excellence for fill and finish operations.First Half 2023 Financial Review(Unaudited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €73.7 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €93.2 million in the first half of 2022  a decrease of 20.9%. The decrease was related to non-recurring revenues recorded in the prior year related to the Company’s COVID-19 program.Valneva’s total product sales reached €69.7 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €33.3 million in the first half of 2022  an increase of 109.0%. This was driven by a continued recovery of travel vaccine sales. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed to a €0.7 million decline in product sales. COVID-19 vaccine sales in the first half of 2023 amounted to €5.7 million compared to €3.8 million in the first half of 2022. Excluding COVID-19  product sales reached €64.0 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €29.5 million in the comparator period of 2022  an increase of 116.6%.IXIARO®/JESPECT® product sales were €30.3 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €12.3 million in the first half of 2022  an increase of 146.8% with sales benefitting from the continuing recovery of travel markets as well as price increases. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed to a €0.2 million decline in product sales. DUKORAL® sales were €17.1 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €5.8 million in the first half of 2022  an increase of 197.4%  also benefitting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets and price increases. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed to a €0.3 million decline in product sales. Third Party product sales were €16.5 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €11.5 million in the first half of 2022  an increase of 43.8%  which was mainly driven by sales under the distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic for Rabipur®/RabAvert® and Encepur®.Other revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services amounted to €4.1 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €59.9 million in the first half of 2022. The prior year period included €89.4 million released from the refund liability as a result of the settlement with the UK government  partially offset by €36.1 million of negative revenue resulting from an increase in the refund liability linked to the amendment to the VLA15 collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer.Operating Result and Adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €53.8 million in the first half of 2023. The gross margin on commercial product sales excluding COVID-19 sales was 40.0% compared to 58.3% in the first half of 2022. COGS of €18.1 million related to IXIARO® product sales yielding a product gross margin of 40.2%. COGS of €10.1 million related to DUKORAL® product sales yielding a product gross margin of 40.9%. The gross margin of IXIARO® was impacted by batch write-offs in the Scottish manufacturing site. Additionally  the gross margins of both IXIARO® and DUKORAL® were adversely impacted by high indirect sales in markets where Valneva sells through distributors. Of the remaining COGS for the first half of 2023  €10.2 million were related to the Third-Party product distribution business  €3.8 million to COVID-19 product sales and €6.1 million to initial COGS related to the launch preparations for the chikungunya vaccine candidate as well as to idle capacity costs. In the first half of 2022  overall COGS were €171.5 million  of which €167.2 million related to cost of goods and €4.3 million related to cost of services. COGS in the first half of 2022 included write-offs related to the significant reduction of COVID-19 sales volumes to EC Member States.Research and development expenses amounted to €26.0 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €51.9 million in the first half of 2022. This decrease was exclusively driven by the lower spend on Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001. At the same time  cost related to the Zika vaccine candidate increased as the Company has been working towards a re-initiation of clinical development. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first half of 2023 amounted to €20.0 million compared to €7.8 million in the first half of 2022. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first half of 2023 notably included €7.8 million of expenses related to the launch preparation costs of the chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  compared to €2.2 million in the first half of 2022. In the first half of 2023  general and administrative expenses increased to €22.9 million from €16.0 million in the first half of 2022. COGS  research and development  marketing and distribution as well as general and administrative expenses benefited in the first half of 2022 from an accrual adjustment income of €19.5 million related to the favorable effect of the Company’s share price development on the employee share-based compensation programs.Other income  net of other expenses  increased to €15.9 million in the first half of 2023 from €3.6 million in the first half of 2022. This increase was mainly driven by recognizing grant income received from Scottish Enterprise into the income statement in the first half of 2023.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €35.0 million in the first half of 2023 compared to an operating loss of €150.4 million in the first half of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss in the first half of 2023 was €28.3 million compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of €136.0 million in the first half of 2022 (as explained further below).Net ResultIn the first half of 2023  Valneva generated a net loss of €35.0 million compared to a net loss of €171.5 million in the first half of 2022.Finance expense and foreign currency effects in the first half of 2023 resulted in a net finance expense of €3.9 million  compared to a net finance expense of €18.8 million in the first half of 2022. This was mainly a result of a foreign exchange gain amounting to €4.5 million in the first half of 2023  primarily driven by revaluation results of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  compared to a net foreign exchange loss of €10.7 million in the first half of 2022. Interest expenses net of interest income were €8.4 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €8.2 million in the first half of 2022.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €65.4 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €100.2 million in the first half of 2022. Cash outflows in the first half of 2023 mainly resulted from the operating loss as well as increased working capital. Cash outflows in the first half of 2022 mainly resulted from the operating loss generated.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €6.6 million in the first half of 2023 compared to €16.0 million in the first half of 2022  both mainly related to construction activities at the Scottish production site and purchases of equipment.Net cash used in financing activities amounted to €9.5 million in the first half of 2023  which was mainly due to interest payments as well as payments of lease liabilities. Cash inflows in the first half of 2022 amounted to €105.0 million and mainly related to proceeds from the equity subscription agreement with Pfizer as well as disbursements from the credit facility provided by Deerfield & OrbiMed.Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €204.4 million as at June 30  2023  compared to €289.4 million as at December 31  2022.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results  as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts.

In the year to date as well as good progress being made with the Company’s collaboration with AstraZeneca  a new strategic collaboration was recently signed with Merck.The second pillar is the clinical and preclinical pipeline. While there was disappointment earlier in the year with the decision not to proceed with BEN-2293 in Atopic Dermatitis  following the pipeline review the Company has prioritised five key pipeline assets and commenced a Phase I trial for BEN-8744 for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis (UC).The third pillar  knowledge exploration  adds a new expansion opportunity through a suite of knowledge exploration tools that enables scientists to make higher-confidence decisions and improve R&D productivity.With the appointment of the Company’s new Chief Revenue Officer driving revenue generation  alongside the appointment of the new Chief Financial Officer  the Group looks forward to the future and realising the full potential of the Platform  pipeline and AI-tools and delivering a return to shareholders.OPERATIONAL REVIEWCorporate and organisation developmentsDuring the first six months of the year and post-period end  there have been significant changes within the Board of Directors and the Executive Leadership Team. As announced separately  today  Joanna Shields has stepped down as Chief Executive Officer and Executive Board member and Dr. François Nader  Chair of the Board of Directors assumes the role of Chair and Acting CEO. A search has been initiated for a new CEO.In early September  Catherine Isted was appointed Chief Financial Officer and later in September  Christina Busmalis was appointed Chief Revenue Officer  highlighting the Company’s commitment to drive revenue growth as it continues to expand its presence in the market.Additionally  in June  Dr. Jackie Hunter retired from the Board as a Non-Executive Director and in May the Company welcomed Marcello Damiani as a new Independent Non-Executive Director.End-to-end drug discovery offeringsEnd-to-end collaborations utilise the Group’s capabilities and the Benevolent Platform™ enables novel discoveries throughout the drug discovery process. The Group receives upfront payments  milestones  and royalties from collaborations. In the year to date as well as good progress being made with the Group’s collaboration with AstraZeneca  a new strategic collaboration was signed with Merck.Merck: New strategic collaborationIn September  a new collaboration with Merck was signed utilising BenevolentAI’s end-to-end platform capabilities to deliver novel drug candidates  initially for three targets in oncology  neurology and immunology.The Company will identify and develop innovative compounds  through Hit Identification to preclinical stage. The agreement includes payments to BenevolentAI of up to $594 million  consisting of a low double-digit million-dollar upfront payment sum on signing and then potentially discovery  development and commercial milestones. Tiered royalties will also be payable on net sales of any commercialised products.AstraZeneca: Continues to progressThe collaboration continues to progress successfully and in May  AstraZeneca presented new preclinical data at the ATS International Conference 2023 on an AI-generated target in IPF identified in our collaboration and provided information on the biological validation of Serum Response Factor as a potential target for IPF. AstraZeneca is now progressing four of the most promising targets out of the five initially selected into the AstraZeneca portfolio in CKD and IPF. In addition  good progress is being made toward further target sections in Heart Failure and SLE use cases following the extension in January 2022 for a further three years to include these target indications. Each novel target selected by AstraZeneca has the potential to generate significant milestones and royalties for BenevolentAI.Clinical and preclinical PipelineIn April  the Company announced top-line Phase IIa study results for its topical pan-Trk inhibitor  BEN-2293  in mild-to-moderate dermatitis. The study successfully met its primary endpoint with BEN-2293 found to be safe and well tolerated. Secondary efficacy endpoints  to reduce itch and inflammation  were not achieved. Subsequently  in May the Company confirmed there would be no additional spend on this asset.Following a strategic review of the pipeline  in May the Company confirmed that five of the Group’s most advanced and high-potential clinical and preclinical assets are being progressed to their next inflection point. In excess of ten programmes have been paused and the Company makes regular re-evaluation of these programmes as well as assessing potential new portfolio entries.In August  the Group initiated a Phase I study in its lead asset  BEN-8744  an oral phosphodiesterase 10 (PDE10) inhibitor intended for the treatment of UC. This asset has a novel therapeutic approach and is a potential first-in-class peripherally restricted small molecule for the treatment of UC with the potential for meaningful differentiation from existing immunosuppressive standard-of-care treatments  through disease-modifying efficacy. The topline data readout from this study is expected in Q1 2024.BEN-28010 is on track  progressing and is expected to be investigational new drug (IND) ready by Q4 2023. BEN-28010 is an oral brain penetrant CHK1 inhibitor under development as a potential first-in-class CNS penetrant drug for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) and metastatic brain tumours with the potential for meaningful differentiation in efficacy in patients resistant to chemotherapeutic standard of care agents and the potential to be used in combination therapy approaches.In June  the Company announced the progression of BEN-34712 a preclinical candidate for the potential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) into IND-enabling studies. BEN-34712 is an oral  potent and selective brain penetrant RARɑβ (retinoic acid receptor alpha beta) biased agonist under development as a potential best-in-class treatment for ALS. BEN-34712 is expected to be IND-ready by Q2 2024.The Group also has two earlier-stage prioritised assets in Parkinson’s disease and fibrosis (neurodegenerative and immunological diseases) which are currently in chemistry lead optimisation stage. The Parkinson’s disease asset is a potential first-in-class CNS penetrant drug with neuroprotective activity and the fibrosis asset is a novel target focused on the underlying mechanisms of fibrotic diseases.Knowledge ExplorationWe have over five years of experience building highly specific  biopharma sector and domain-specific large language models and AI models for use across research.

With the investment we have made in our platform over the last few years combined with the acceleration in interest in the field by Biopharma companies  the Group believes we are at an inflection point in the adoption of AI in research and drug discovery and that BenevolentAI is well placed to benefit from this.Our priorities within the clinical and preclinical pipeline  are the funding of the Phase I study for BEN-8744 that started in August  with the top line data readout expected in Q1 2024. The Group is also funding BEN-28010 IND enabling work in GBM that is expected to be IND ready by Q4 2023 and for BEN-34712 IND enabling work in ALS  due to complete in Q2 2024. We will also further invest to enhance the Benevolent Platform™ and invest in our Knowledge Exploration tools and progress our go-to-market plan.Additionally  we look forward to providing updates on our Biopharma collaborations.Dr. François NaderChairman and Acting CEOFINANCIAL REVIEWRevenuesThe Group’s revenues for the first half of 2023 have increased by 9% from £4.8 million (H1 2022) to £5.3 million  reflecting the ongoing second AI-enabled drug discovery collaboration with AstraZeneca which started in January 2022.Alternative performance measures and normalised presentationThe normalised presentation of the Group’s performance can be found in the interim condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is explained further in note 2.3 of the financial statements.Research and development (R&D) expensesNormalised spend in research and development for the first half of 2023 has decreased by 5% from £34.7 million (H1 2022) to £33.0 million  primarily driven by a reduction in share-based payment expenses under the BenevolentAI Equity Incentive Scheme (“BEIS”).Normalised spend in research and development  excluding share-based payments  for the first half of 2023 has increased 5% from £30.0 million (H1 2022) to £31.5 million  driven by the BenevolentAI pipeline advancing into later stages of development  in particular BEN-8744 and its preparation for the Phase I trial in H2 2023  combined with an increase in staff related costs supporting the continued innovation of the Benevolent Platform™.The Group also has costs relating to BEN-2293 which  as communicated in May 2023  will not be subject to further investment following the Phase IIa trial results.Reported spend in research and development increased by 7% from £34.7 million (H2 2022) to £37.0 million due to £4.1 million of restructuring programme expenses not present in the first half of 2022  largely offset by a reduction in share-based payment expenses from H1 2022.General and administrative costsNormalised business operations spend for the first half of 2023 has significantly reduced by 40% from £21.7 million (H1 2022) to £13.0 million  primarily driven by a reduction in share-based payment expenses under the BEIS.Normalised business operations spend  excluding share-based payments  has significantly increased by 82% from £6.5 million (H1 2022) to £11.9 million  primarily driven by fluctuations in exchange rates leading to significant unrealised gains in the first half of 2022 not replicated in the current period.Removing the impact of unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses  the spend for the first half of 2023 increased by 19% from £9.7 million (H1 2022) to £11.5 million  reflecting a full six months of additional costs from being in a listed environment  as compared to the two months of listing status in H1 2022.Reported administrative spend for the first half of 2023 has significantly decreased by 89% from £123.6 million (H1 2022) to £14.2 million  with £1.2 million in expected restructuring programme expenses more than offset by £101.9 million in costs arising from the 2022 Business Combination being no longer present in the first half of 2023  of which £87.0 million related to non-cash share-based payment expenses.Operating lossNormalised operating loss for the first half of 2023 has decreased 21% from £51.4 million (H1 2022) to £40.6 million  reflecting a sharp decrease in employee-related share-based payment expenses of 87% from £19.9 million (H1 2022) to £2.6 million offset by increases in other normalised expenditure.Reported operating loss decreased by 70% from £153.4 million (H1 2022) to £45.9 million  in line with the absence of Business Combination costs incurred in the first half of 2022 described above.Finance incomeFinance income for the first half of 2023 has decreased 63% from £6.3 million (H1 2022) to £2.3 million  predominantly driven by the fair value revaluation of the warrant liabilities  equal to £0.3 million (H1 2022: £6.1 million). Excluding the fair value revaluation of the warrant liabilities held  normalised finance income has increased 915% from £0.2 million (H1 2022) to £2.0 million  reflecting a significant increase in interest income earned from bank deposits  given rising interest rates in the period.TaxationTaxation income for the first half of 2023 has decreased 8% from £7.6 million (H1 2022) to £7.0 million. This is predominantly composed of tax credits arising from the UK’s small and medium-sized enterprises R&D tax relief regime  under which the scheme rates have decreased with effect from 1 April 2023. The decrease on the claim between the two periods is driven by the effect of this drop in rates against the broadly consistent base of eligible R&D expenditure.Loss per shareNormalised basic loss per share has reduced 40% from 45.2p (H1 2022) to 27.0p for the first half of 2023  predominantly driven by the sharp fall in share-based payment expenses. The loss per share is then further reduced as a result of the increase in weighted average ordinary shares outstanding from one period to the next.Current assetsCurrent assets as at 30 June 2023 have decreased 24% from £152.1 million (31 December 2022) to £115.5 million  largely driven by a £45.9 million decrease across cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits  due to funding of operations in the period.Cash  cash equivalents and short-term depositsCash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits as at 30 June 2023 have decreased 35% from £130.2 million (31 December 2022) to £84.3 million  reflecting proceeds from the AstraZeneca collaboration being more than offset by ordinary course working capital expenditure.Current liabilitiesCurrent liabilities as at 30 June 2023 have decreased 23% from £25.6 million (31 December 2022) to £19.7 million  reflecting the payment of trade payables during the period and a release in deferred income under the AstraZeneca agreement  partly offset by the remaining £4.8 million provision recognised in relation to the Group’s restructuring programme.The restructuring programme provision reflects £5.3 million of total expected expenditure  both cash and non-cash  of which £0.5 million has been utilised in the period. The provision includes expenditure that is necessarily entailed by the restructuring announced on 25 May 2023 and does not relate to the ongoing activities of the Group. It includes costs associated with contractual obligations that no longer provide economic benefit to the Group.Normalised cash flowCash expended from operating activities before taxation and non-normalised items has increased 51% from £34.8 million (H1 2022) to £52.5 million for the first half of 2023  driven by changes to working capital from outstanding payables at the start of 2023 having been settled  in addition to a decrease in provisions for employer-related share based payment taxes arising from remeasurements inline with the share price.Catherine Isted  Chief Financial OfficerINTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEfor the six months ended 30 June 20232023Unaudited 2022Unaudited and restated2 Note Normalised£’000 Non-normalised1£’000 Total£’000 Normalised£’000 Non-normalised1£’000 Total£’000 Revenue 3 5 297 - 5 297 4 843 - 4 843 Research and development (""R&D"") expenses2 (32 995) (4 052) (37 047) (34 673) - (34 673) Included within R&D expenses: Restructuring programme expenses 9 - (4 052) (4 052) - - - Employee-related share-based payment (""SBP"") expenses 10 (1 489) - (1 489) (4 697) - (4 697) Administrative expenses2 (12 971) (1 238) (14 209) (21 681) (101 945) (123 626) Included within administrative expenses: Restructuring programme expenses 9 - (1 238) (1 238) - - - Employee-related SBP expenses 10 (1 111) - (1 111) (15 172) (3 883) (19 055) Other income 109 - 109 72 - 72 Operating loss (40 560) (5 290) (45 850) (51 439) (101 945) (153 384) Finance income 4 1 980 336 2 316 195 6 120 6 315 Finance expense2 5 (190) - (190) (1 822) - (1 822) Loss before taxation (38 770) (4 954) (43 724) (53 066) (95 825) (148 891) Taxation2 6 7 014 - 7 014 7 637 - 7 637 Loss for the period (31 756) (4 954) (36 710) (45 429) (95 825) (141 254) Basic and diluted loss per share  expressed in pence (31.2p) (140.5p) Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding 117 488 722 100 545 304 Loss for the period (36 710) (141 254) Other comprehensive expense that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss: Foreign currency translation differences for foreign operations (7) (41) Total comprehensive loss for the period (36 717) (141 295)1.

The Group’s opportunity to deliver future value depends on a unified and amalgamated approach across the whole of the Group and could not be achieved independently by any individual entity or separately identifiable line of business.Registered office address2 Principal business Class of shares held Ownership BenevolentAI Limited 4-8 Maple Street  London  W1T 5HD  United Kingdom Holding Ordinary shares 100% BenevolentAI Cambridge Limited1 4-8 Maple Street  London  W1T 5HD  United Kingdom R&D Ordinary shares 100% BenevolentAI Bio Limited1 4-8 Maple Street  London  W1T 5HD  United Kingdom R&D Ordinary shares 100% BenevolentAI Technology Limited1 4-8 Maple Street  London  W1T 5HD  United Kingdom R&D Ordinary shares 100% Benevolent Technology Inc1 15 MetroTech Center  8th FL  NY 11201  United States R&D Ordinary shares 100% BenevolentAI Energy Limited1 4-8 Maple Street  London  W1T 5HD  United Kingdom Dormant Ordinary shares 100% Stratified Medical Limited1 4-8 Maple Street  London  W1T 5HD  United Kingdom Dormant Ordinary shares 100%1. Held indirectly 2. The country of registration for each subsidiary is also its principal place of business.2 Accounting policies2.1Basis of preparationThese unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2023 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 (Interim Financial Reporting) as adopted by the EU  and applicable law. They have been prepared on a historical cost basis  except for financial instruments measured at fair value  and all amounts have been rounded to the nearest £‘000.As at 30 June 2023  net assets totalled £123.5 million  with a combined cash and short-term deposits balance of £84.3 million. Management have reviewed the Group’s cash flow forecasts and believes it has sufficient cash for at least the next twelve months from the approval of these financial statements. The financial statements  therefore  continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.The financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2023 were authorised for issue in accordance with a Board resolution on 20 September 2023.2.2 Significant accounting policiesThere were no significant changes in accounting policies applied in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements compared to those used in the most recent annual consolidated financial statements of 31 December 2022. New standards and interpretations applicable for the annual period beginning on 1 January 2023 did not have any material impact on these condensed consolidated interim financial statements.A number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024 and earlier application is permitted; however  the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated interim financial statements.2.3Normalised operating lossNormalised operating loss for the six months ended 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022 is defined as operating loss excluding non-normalised transactions  defined as those related to the restructuring programme undertaken following the strategic plan announced on 25 May 2023; those related to the Transaction; the revaluation of investments which BAI does not manage directly; and the revaluation of the warrants recognised as finance income. This is to show an underlying representation of operating losses for the respective periods and extends to normalised operating cash flows on the same basis.Normalised operating losses  normalised operating cash flows and non-normalised transactions are each alternative performance measures (“APM”s) that are not calculated in accordance with IFRS and  therefore  may not be directly comparable with other companies’ APMs  including those in the Group’s industry. APMs should be considered in addition to  and are not intended to substitute or supersede  IFRS measures.This APM is in our view an important metric for a biotech company in the development stage. Removing the non-normalised costs  given their material  isolated and one-off nature  enables users to better compare the Group’s normal operating performance between reporting periods.The following table presents a reconciliation of normalised operating loss  to the closest IFRS measures  for the six months ended 30 June:Note 2023£’000 2022restated£’000 Operating loss (45 850) (153 384) Adjustments for: Restructuring programme expenses 9 5 290 - Transaction-related expenditure - 11 255 Transaction-related listing service SBP expense - 83 067 Transaction-related employee-related SBP expenses - 3 883 Transaction-related stamp duty expense - 3 740 Total non-normalised operating charges 5 290 101 945 Normalised operating loss (40 560) (51 439)Similarly  normalised operating cash flows are considered on the same basis and to the same effect.

Normalised R&D expenses have been adjusted to reflect a £1.9 million decrease in employee-related SBP expenses. Normalised administrative expenses have been adjusted to reflect a £0.4 million decrease in employee-related SBP expenses and a reclassification of the £1.6 million loss in fair value of settled forward contract to finance expenses  previously recognised as a foreign exchange loss. 2. Non-normalised administrative expenses have been adjusted to reflect a £17.7 million increase to the listing service SBP expense; £1.3 million increase to employee-related SBP expenses; and a reclassification of the £3.7 million stamp duty expense from taxation. 3. The equity arising from the PIPE financing and backstop facility now reflects a £0.3 million decrease in the costs incurred. 4. The listing service SBP expense has increased by £17.7 million  partly offset by a £0.8 million overall decrease to the equity-settled employee-related SBP expense. 5. The capital reorganisation of Odyssey Acquisition S.A. now reflects a £43.2 million reclassification from accumulated losses to merger difference. The total net equity impact of the capital reorganisation remains unchanged.3 RevenueThe Group initially recognises income under the AstraZeneca (“AZ”) collaborations as deferred revenue  which the Group becomes entitled to recognise as revenue in line with the delivery efforts towards the completion of tasks and provision of the deliverables set out in the agreements governing the AZ collaborations. For the six months to 30 June 2023  this is represented by revenue of £5.3 million (six months to 30 June 2022: £4.8 million).Second AZ collaborationBuilding on the success of the first collaboration  the relationship with AZ was expanded into a new three-year partnership  starting 1 January 2022 and focusing on systemic lupus erythematosus (“SLE”) and heart failure (“HF”).As the result of the corresponding collaboration payments  £nil deferred revenue is recognised as of 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022: £2.9 million).Management have determined that costs directly attributable to the collaboration agreements are immaterial  and consequently cost of sales has not been presented.There is no related party revenue in the six months to 30 June 2023 (six months to 30 June 2022: £nil).

The weighted average number of shares is calculated from the number of ordinary BenevolentAI shares in circulation at the beginning of the period adjusted by the number of ordinary shares issued during the period and multiplied by a time-weighting factor. The time-weighting factor reflects the ratio of the number of days on which ordinary shares were issued and the total number of days of the period.For the six months ended 30 June Note 2023£’000 2022restated£’000 Basic and diluted loss per share  expressed in pence (31.2p) (140.5p) Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding 117 488 722 100 545 304 Total loss for the period (36 710) (141 254) Adjustments for: Non-normalised items within operating expenses 2.3 5 290 101 945 Fair value of warrants within finance income 4 (336) (6 120) Normalised total loss (31 756) (45 429) Normalised basic and diluted loss per share (27.0p) (45.2p)The dilutive shares and other instruments total 145 126 303 (2022: 145 126 303)  as outlined below:BenevolentAI (€0.001 par value) Ordinary shares Sponsor shares1 Treasury shares1 Total As at 1 January 2022 30 000 000 7 500 000 - 37 500 000 Redemptions (25 137 581) - 25 137 581 - Equity Backstop facility 4 000 000 - - 4 000 000 Cancellation of G2 Growth Shares - - - - Capital reorganisation 90 012 909 - - 90 012 909 Equity PIPE Financing 13 613 394 - - 13 613 394 Conversion of two thirds of Sponsor shares 5 000 000 (5 000 000) - - Shares in issue as at 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2023 117 488 722 2 500 000 25 137 581 145 126 3031. The unconverted sponsor shares  and the treasury shares  do not form part of the Basic total number of ordinary shares outstanding. The sponsor shares derive their economic rights from their conversion to ordinary shares. The redemptions by ordinary shareholders prior to the Transaction taking place were transferred into treasury to be subsequently used to satisfy equity awards or be cancelled.A loss  however  cannot be further diluted beyond the basic per share calculation. As such  the loss per share is an equal value for both a basic and diluted view.8Trade and other payables30 June 2023£’000 31 December 2022£’000 Trade payables 2 318 3 578 Taxation and social security 1 234 964 Other payables 427 503 Accruals 6 895 9 832 10 874 14 8779ProvisionsDilapidation onleased officepremises£’000 Liquidation ofOdysseyAcquisition B.V.£’000 Tax related toSBP£’000 Restructuringprogramme£’000 Total£’000 Balance at 31 December 2022 324 3 6 170 - 6 497 Current 324 3 5 544 - 5 871 Non-current - - 626 - 626 Balance at 1 January 2023 324 3 6 170 - 6 497 Provisions made/(released) during the period 37 (3) (3 611) 5 290 1 713 Provisions utilised during the period - - - (455) (455) Balance at 30 June 2023 361 - 2 559 4 835 7 755 Current 361 - 2 337 4 835 7 533 Non-current - - 222 - 222The provision related to the employer tax arising from share-based payments is recognised in line with the relative portion of fair value charged for each tranche as at the balance sheet date under the two share incentive schemes  as a function of the share price and prevailing tax rates. The non-current portion relates to tranches which have an expected vesting date greater than twelve months from the end of the period. These two share incentive schemes are discussed further in note 10.As part of the strategic plan announced on 25 May 2023  the Group considered its cost base and organisational structure and commenced a collective consultation process around proposed headcount reductions  adhering to the UK Collective Consultation for Redundancy Rules and Procedures. The restructuring programme provision reflects all expected expenditure  both cash and non-cash  necessarily entailed by the restructuring that does not relate to the ongoing activities of the Group  including costs associated with contractual obligations that no longer provide economic benefit to the Group.10Share based payments (“SBP”)10.1BenevolentAI Equity Incentive Scheme (“BEIS”)Under the BEIS  all employees were offered options or restricted stock units (“RSU”s) upon joining. RSUs operate in such a way as to give the same economic benefit as options  reflecting the requirements of certain jurisdictions.This scheme is now in run off since the closing of the Transaction in 2022 and is effectively closed to new entrants  with the only vesting continuing for awards already granted. During the six months to 30 June 2023  therefore  no awards were granted. 280 151 options and 6 158 RSUs under the BEIS were forfeited over the course of the period. No options were exercised  nor RSU agreements settled  during the period.10.2 Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)Under the LTIP  RSUs and performance stock units (“PSU”s) are granted to eligible employees and may be subject to one or more performance conditions.During the period  326 316 RSUs were granted under the LTIP. 54 700 RSUs and 65 905 PSUs were forfeited due to the grantees no longer being employed by the Group or forfeiting their awards.BEIS LTIP Equity awards held in BenevolentAI Number of Awards Weighted averageexercise price (£) Number of Awards Weighted average exercise price (£) Awards outstanding at 1 January 2022 19 043 911 0.1 - - Granted during the period 1 677 833 - - - Exercised during the period - - - - Lapsed/forfeited during the period (642 718) - - - Outstanding at 30 June 2022 20 079 026 0.1 - - Exercisable at 30 June 2022 - - - - Awards outstanding at 1 January 2023 19 371 596 0.1 1 759 581 - Granted during the period - - 326 316 - Exercised during the period - - - - Lapsed/forfeited during the period (286 309) 0.0 (120 605) - Outstanding at 30 June 2023 19 085 287 0.1 1 965 292 - Exercisable at 30 June 2023 - - - -For the six months ended 30 June Employee-related share based payment 2023£’000 2022restated£’000 SBP expenses 6 211 19 961 Transaction-related SBP expenses - 3 569 6 211 23 530 (Credit)/charge for social security provision in relation to equity-settled SBP (3 611) (92) Transaction-related social security provision in relation to SBP - 314 (3 611) 22211Related party transactionsIdentity of related parties with which the Group has transactedThere have been no material related party transactions in the first six months of 2023 and no material change in related parties from those described in the Annual Report 2022.Transactions with key management personnel (“KMPs”)The remuneration of the KMPs of the Group  defined as the Board of Directors inclusive of CEO  include remuneration paid by subsidiary undertakings in the current and prior financial periods.

Significant progress has been achieved since the merger to build on team synergies and accelerate PHAXIAM’s strategy deployment on key therapeutic programs  particularly with its lead program targeting resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.b) Clinical development: significant progress on Clinical and Regulatory strategytoward a registration study in PJIStaphylococcus a ureus ( S. a ureus ) programWith its lead S. aureus program  PHAXIAM pursues the ambition to propose a therapeutic solution to patients who failed traditional antimicrobial treatments in complex mono-bacterial S. aureus infections in different high-value indications.Leveraging on promising activity signals from real-life treatments of compassionate patients  PHAXIAM is preparing the initiation of the first global (EU/US)  pivotal randomized Phase 2b/3 study for PJI patients having an open-surgery debridement (DAIR) in combination with antibiotics.While developing the clinical protocol of the study  PHAXIAM has requested this summer a pre-IND meeting with the U.S. FDA and a Scientific Advice meeting with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Meetings are expected to happen in Q4 2023. This global pivotal study is paving the way for a potential Early access pathway in Europe  if associated with positive phase 2b data.PHAXIAM is also preparing a phase 1 trial (PK data) in Endocarditis Infections (EI)  to demonstrate intravenous administration of phages for EI and other indications.Program Status and Progress Prosthetic Joint Infections(Hip / Knee)New Phase 2b/3And PhagoDAIR PJI patients having a DAIR in combination with SOC antibioticsPhages administered locallySafety evidence already demonstrated in current PhagoDAIR studyPlan to launch ambitiousefficacy study in a large global registration Phase 2b / 3 trialRecent updatesPhase 2b/3Pre-IND meeting (FDA) and a Scientific Advice (EMA) expected to happen in Q4 2023Potential Phase 2b/3 study launch expected in H2 2024 PhagoDAIR pilot study Additional supportive clinical data expected in 2024 Endocarditis Infections (EI)Phase 1 PKEI patients having resistant infections in the cardiac chambers and valvesPhages administered intravenouslyExpected assessment of the PK and PD of the IV route in the EI indication   potentially leading to the registration in EI and other indications where the IV route is the recommended mode of administrationRecent updates First Patient-In expected in Q4 2023Escherichiacoli (E. coli) programThe objective of this program is to propose a therapeutic solution to patients having failed traditional antimicrobial treatment in complex mono-bacterial E. coli infections in the urinary tract.Complex Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI)Phase 1 PK cUTI patients with resistant E.

Data from the first 50 PJI patients evaluated show promising clinical data for infection control at 3 months  considered as a significant improvement over standard of care in this hard-to-treat patient population with severe resistant infections.In June 2022  PHAXIAM has received a first regulatory validation from the French ANSM with the granting of an AAC (Authorisation d’Accès Compassionnel – early access program) for PJI patients  associated with S. aureus resistance. The company is awaiting a second AAC regulatory validation for PJI patients  associated with P. aeruginosa resistance from the ANSM.Investigator-sponsored trialsIn addition to PHAXIAM’s clinical activities  two French clinical centers are considering Investigator-Sponsored Trials (IST) with PHAXIAM’s products. These studies are the opportunity for PHAXIAM to potentially deliver additional clinical POC data in other high-value indications:Phase 1/2 IST in complex Respiratory Tract Infections (cUTI): this clinical study by La Pitié Salpétrière Hospital in Paris  is targeting nosocomial pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonasaeruginosa  including patients with ventilator-associated pneumopathies (VAP)  a growing concern in hospital environments.Phase 1/2 IST in Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU): this clinical study by Nîmes Hospitals  is targeting DFU infections due to mono-bacterial Staphylococcus aureus infection.c) Preclinical research programs initiated to reinforce PHAXIAM’s phage therapy platformPHAXIAM has launched several strategic research programs to reinforce its current clinical programs and prepare future developments  including the extension of the current phage bank for E. coli and P. aeruginosa to increase patient resistant infections coverage  and the demonstration a Pre-clinical POC for Endolysins.On September 19  2023  the company announced the extension of its portfolio to Klebsiella pneumoniae  a new resistant aggressive bacterial target.A strategic research program  PhageBac  targeting Bacteremia  has been initiated. Currently at preclinical stage  this program is aiming at controlling blood infection and the risk of secondary infection with mono-bacterial infection due to S. aureus  P. aeruginosa  or E. coli. Pre-clinical data are expected for mid-2024.1H 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTSKey financial figures for the first half of 2023 compared with the same period of the previous year are summarized below. In the context of the Erytech-Pherecydes merger  PHAXIAM’s consolidated financial statements in IFRS standards include ex-Pherecydes financial results as of the date of the merger  i.e. June 23  2023. Consequently  PHAXIAM’s P&L information for the first 6 months of 2023 are mostly related to ex-Erytech activities only  while PHAXIAM’s consolidated balance sheet as of June 30  2023  includes the financial positions of both merged companies.The full Financial Statements of PHAXIAM Therapeutics as of June 30 2023 will be filed with the AMF and the SEC on Monday  September 25  2023  and will be available on the company’s website at that date.In thousands of euros 1H 2023(6 months) 1H 2022(6 months) Revenues — — Other income 278 954 Net gain on asset sale — 24 351 Operating income 278 25 304 Research and development (3 431) (17 300) General and administrative (9 245) (7 911) Operating expenses (12 676) (25 211) Operating income (loss) (12 398) 93 Financial income 331 3 370 Financial expenses (342) (750) Financial income (loss) (11) 2 620 Income tax 203 (3 737) Net loss (12 201) (1 024)Operating expenses of €12.7 million in the first half of 2023 were 50% lower (i.e. a €12.5 million reduction) than in the previous year  the decrease being driven by the 80% reduction of R&D expenses  with the closing of Princeton operations and the termination of ex-Erytech clinical development activities. PHAXIAM’s G&A expenses in the first half of 2023 increased by €1.3 million (+17%) versus the previous year  an increase related to the merger transaction and other merger-related costs. Net loss for the first half of 2023 was €12.2 million  compared with a net loss of €1 million for the same period of 2022  which benefited from the €24.4 million net gain on the sale of the Princeton facility in April 2022.As of June 30  2023  PHAXIAM had cash and cash equivalents totaling €25.2 million (approximately $27.5 million)  compared with €38.8 million as of December 31  2022. The €13.6 million decrease in cash position during the first half of 2023 was the result of a €12.1 million net cash utilization in operating activities and investing activities and €1.6 million used in financing activities  mostly related with the start in 2023 of the reimbursement of the ‘PGE’  Covid-loan  while the variation of the U.S. dollar against the euro led to a €0.3 million negative currency exchange impact.The Company believes that its current cash position can fund its current programs and planned operating expenses into the second quarter of 2024.COMPLETION OF THE REVERSE SHARE SPLITOn September 18  2023  PHAXIAM announced the completion of its reverse share split on ordinary shares and ADRs. The reverse share split involved the exchange of ten (10) existing shares with a par value of ten-euro cents (€0.10) for one (1) new share with a par value of one euro (€1). This reverse share split has no impact on the Company's share capital and results in the division of the number of shares outstanding by ten  and a multiplication by ten of the par value of each share. With this reverse stock split now effective  the Company intends to regain compliance with The Nasdaq Global Select Market minimum $1 bid price requirement.KEY NEWSFLOW AND MILESTONES EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHSRegulatory feedbacks on the Ph 2b/3  pivotal trial in PJI (S. aureus) from the FDA (Q4 2023) and the EMA (Q1 2024) and expected trial initiation in 2H 2024Initiation of the Endocarditis study (S. aureus) in Q4 2023PhagoDAIR clinical data: 2H 2024FIRST HALF 2023 CONFERENCE CALL DETAILSPHAXIAM management will hold a conference call and webcast on Monday  September 25  2023  at 8:30am ET / 2:30pm CEST on the business highlights and financial results for the first half 2023.
