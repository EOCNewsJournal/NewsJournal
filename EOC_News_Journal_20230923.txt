Decoding the impact of JPMorgan's inclusion of Indian bonds in global index,India will enter the global bond index with a 10% weight cap and other smaller JPM EM indices in a staggered manner over a 10-month period beginning June 28  2024. According to market experts  this could prompt around $30 billion of passive inflows.,"After keeping India on the watchlist for nearly two years  JPMorgan has finally decided to include India in the Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) index . The much-anticipated decision will reduce India's cost of borrowing as well as lead to passive inflows worth nearly $30 billion into the domestic debt market.India's inclusion in one of the widely-followed bond indices will also help in making rupee more stable  keep interest rates lower  reduce bond yields and a resultant decline in the cost of borrowing will boost the bottomline of companies.""This will reset the base rate for India and the yield should come down sharply. India's cost of borrowing will come down. Since Covid  the fiscal deficit in India has remained elevated due to higher borrowing. This event will ease borrowing pressure as a large part of the borrowing will be observed by this route. Banks' Treasury will be flushed with mark-to-market gains "" said Mukesh Kochar  National Head - Wealth  AUM Capital.The Indian rupee also stands to gain from the move due to a big dollar inflow due to buying of government securities.""As far as the equity market is concerned it is positive for banks  NBFCs  leveraged companies etc. By and large it is a big macro positive for India "" Kochar said.India will enter the global bond index with a 10% weight cap and other smaller JPM EM indices in a staggered manner over a 10-month period beginning June 28  2024. According to market experts  this could prompt around $30 billion of passive inflows.Structurally  this will lower India’s risk premia/cost of funding  enhance the liquidity and ownership base of G-Secs and help India finance its fiscal and CAD  said Emkay Global 's lead economist Madhavi Arora.Most of the corporate bonds yields are benchmarked to the yields on government bonds. ""Therefore  yields will decline pan India  across industries. The decline in the cost of capital will translate into higher profits for the corporate sector  which  in turn  will boost stock prices enabling the stock market to scale higher levels "" said Dr. V K Vijayakumar  Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.The passive inflow is likely to boost India’s profile on the world stage and further strengthen local fundamentals. ""We believe the RBI could conduct sterilization operations during this inclusion period buffeting forex reserves and the currency. Based on this success  the government could notify additional bond series opening avenues forlong-term debt capital to fund India’s vast infrastructure and development needs "" Axis Mutual Fund said.India's bond market is the third largest after China among EMs  with a market cap of more than $1.2 trillion  nearly triple of Indonesia's and almost similar to Brazil's. FPI ownership of India G-Secs is <2% (3% FPI holdings in FARs)  significantly lower than EM peers.With the exclusion of Russia and troubles in China  options for global debt investors have narrowed down  analysts say.The inclusion will also boost India's foreign exchange reserves. ""Our forex reserves were at one time nearly $600 billion and they came down to about $550 billion odd a few months ago. But in the last six months or so  we recouped all those losses and we have come back to a reserve position close to $600 billion. So this would only further improve that "" said banking industry veteran Keki Mistry.However  JPMorgan's inclusion doesn't immediately pave the way for inclusion in FTSE and Bloomberg indexes  which have more stringent conditions related to FPI taxation and Euroclear.""Changes to laws for taxing FPI capital gains  which would have helped India adhere to Euroclear requirements  were not a major impediment for India’s inclusion in the JPM index. However  this is still a major stumbling block for the Bloomberg indices  though not so much for the FTSE indices "" Arora said.The recent progress on resolving operational issues  such as posting margin requirements and extended settlement times  have been instrumental in India securing JPM GBI-EM inclusion. This was further bolstered by Russia’s removal  which made the index slightly more concentrated  with India’s inclusion helping to diversify holdings  the economist said.",negative,0.25,0.31,0.44,mixed,0.37,0.36,0.27,True,English,"['Indian bonds', 'global index', 'impact', 'JPMorgan', 'inclusion', 'other smaller JPM EM indices', 'Dr. V K Vijayakumar', 'lead economist Madhavi Arora', 'Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets', 'big macro positive', 'Chief Investment Strategist', 'Geojit Financial Services', 'Axis Mutual Fund', 'last six months', 'banking industry veteran', 'additional bond series', 'global debt investors', 'big dollar inflow', 'major stumbling block', 'posting margin requirements', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'domestic debt market', 'global bond index', 'JPM GBI-EM inclusion', 'corporate bonds yields', 'FPI capital gains', 'EM peers', 'bond indices', 'JPM index', 'bond market', 'government bonds', 'Bloomberg indices', 'Emkay Global', 'market gains', 'GBI-EM) index', 'corporate sector', 'passive inflow', 'major impediment', 'bond yields', 'forex reserves', 'government securities', 'FPI ownership', 'FPI taxation', 'FTSE indices', 'equity market', 'market experts', 'stock market', 'market cap', 'two years', 'interest rates', 'base rate', 'large part', 'National Head', 'AUM Capital', '10% weight cap', '10-month period', 'risk premia', 'ownership base', 'higher profits', 'stock prices', 'higher levels', 'world stage', 'local fundamentals', 'sterilization operations', 'vast infrastructure', 'development needs', 'one time', 'reserve position', 'Keki Mistry', 'Bloomberg indexes', 'stringent conditions', 'Euroclear requirements', 'recent progress', 'operational issues', 'settlement times', '3% FPI holdings', 'resultant decline', 'fiscal deficit', ""Banks' Treasury"", 'Mukesh Kochar', 'Indian rupee', 'inclusion period', 'higher borrowing', 'borrowing pressure', 'pan India', 'India G-Secs', 'watchlist', 'JPMorgan', 'decision', 'cost', 'bottomline', 'companies', 'Covid', 'event', 'route', 'Wealth', 'move', 'NBFCs', 'June', 'funding', 'liquidity', 'CAD', 'industries', 'turn', 'profile', 'RBI', 'currency', 'success', 'avenues', 'China', 'EMs', 'Indonesia', 'Brazil', 'FARs', 'exclusion', 'Russia', 'troubles', 'options', 'analysts', 'losses', 'way', 'Changes', 'laws', 'extended', 'removal']",2023-09-22,2023-09-23,economictimes.indiatimes.com

But the triangle in the global bond index universe won't be complete till FTSE and Bloomberg change their minds.Other than JPMorgan's GBI-EM Global Diversified Index  FTSE runs the World Government Bond Index (WGBI) while Bloomberg has the Global Aggregate Index.A review by FTSE is due before the end of this month. While JPMorgan's decision does not immediately pave the way for inclusion in the FTSE and Bloomberg indexes  it increases hope and can also have a demonstration effect in the medium term as the lower risk premia could trigger positive externalities.For inclusion in Bloomberg indices  the major stumbling block is Euroclear requirements related to changes in laws for taxing FII capital gains.""We do not think India will be in a rush to become Euroclear-compliant in the near future. India meets the minimum credit rating requirement for the FTSE EMGBI (C/Ca)  but is not compliant with the requirement for the broader FTSE GMBI (A-/A3) "" said Emkay Global 's Lead Economist Madhavi Arora.As against $15 billion of FII support in equities  the debt market got close to $3 billion so far in 2023. India’s current outstanding government debt is close to $11 trillion and is planning to issue another $200 billion this year.""Although the flow is small when you so consider the total market size  but this is going to open gates for India’s inclusion in other bond indices making the bond markets in India deeper  more liquid and potentially easy for retail investors to invest in "" said Kotak Cherry's Srikanth Subramanian.Although India’s bond market is the third-largest after China among emerging markets with a market capitalisation of more than $1.2 trillion  nearly triple Indonesia’s and almost similar to Brazil's  FII ownership of Indian government securities is significantly lower than EM peers at 2-3%.With the exclusion of Russia and troubles in China  the options for global debt investors have narrowed down. “Hopefully rating agencies will respect investor viewpoints and give up on their moody and poor standards ” said Kotak Mahindra AMC’s MD Nilesh Shah.In the 2020 Budget  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman allowed FIIs to invest in certain government bonds without restrictions by introducing a Fully Accessible Route (FAR). About 35% of outstanding government securities are FAR bonds and  incrementally  75-80% of new issuances are FAR bonds. At present  23 FAR bonds with a combined value of $330 billion are eligible for inclusion in the index.This phased inclusion in the JPMorgan index will begin from June 2024 onwards and will be completed in March 2025  where India will account for 10% of the index weight. As Indian bonds become more accessible to foreign investors  it could attract significant inflows of $25-30 billion from JPMorgan’s inclusion  and if the other two index providers also add India inflows could go up to $50 billion.""In the medium to long term  enhanced foreign participation could result in reduced yields on government bonds. Gradually  yields on corporate bonds may also reduce which in turn could lead to the reduction in cost of capital and cost of borrowing over the long-term "" said Shantanu Bhargava of Waterfield Advisors.The Indian rupee also stands to gain from the move due to a big dollar inflow due to the buying of government securities.",neutral,0.35,0.62,0.02,negative,0.02,0.34,0.64,True,English,"['global bond market triangle', 'JPMorgan', 'heart', 'India', 'Lead Economist Madhavi Arora', 'Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman', 'other two index providers', 'minimum credit rating requirement', 'current outstanding government debt', 'global bond index universe', 'GBI-EM Global Diversified Index', 'World Government Bond Index', 'outstanding government securities', 'Global Aggregate Index', 'major stumbling block', 'other bond indices', 'MD Nilesh Shah', 'Fully Accessible Route', 'big dollar inflow', 'global bond markets', 'lower risk premia', 'global debt investors', 'Kotak Mahindra AMC', 'enhanced foreign participation', 'total market size', 'Indian government securities', 'stable capital inflows', 'FII capital gains', 'broader FTSE GMBI', 'GBI-EM index', 'debt market', 'Emkay Global', 'rating agencies', 'index weight', 'government bonds', 'foreign investors', 'Kotak Cherry', 'Indian bonds', 'Indian rupee', 'FII support', 'retail investors', 'emerging markets', 'FII ownership', 'significant inflows', 'market capitalisation', 'lower yields', 'JPMorgan index', 'higher allocation', 'stronger rupee', 'demonstration effect', 'positive externalities', 'Bloomberg indices', 'Euroclear requirements', 'near future', 'Srikanth Subramanian', 'EM peers', 'investor viewpoints', 'poor standards', 'new issuances', 'combined value', 'long term', 'corporate bonds', 'Shantanu Bhargava', 'Waterfield Advisors', 'FAR bonds', 'reduced yields', 'Bloomberg indexes', 'medium term', 'FTSE EMGBI', 'India inflows', 'FIIs', 'journey', 'inclusion', 'triangle', 'minds', 'WGBI', 'review', 'end', 'month', 'decision', 'way', 'hope', 'changes', 'laws', 'C/Ca', 'equities', 'gates', 'China', 'Indonesia', 'Brazil', 'exclusion', 'Russia', 'troubles', 'options', 'moody', '2020 Budget', 'restrictions', 'June', 'March', 'turn', 'reduction', 'cost', 'borrowing', 'long-term', 'move', 'buying']",2023-09-22,2023-09-23,economictimes.indiatimes.com

This could contribute to India's $5T economy  but also bring heightened vulnerability to global market fluctuations. Inclusion to be …,The inclusion of Indian bonds in JPMorgan’s emerging-market index is expected to attract foreign investments  and help bolster the Indian currency  according to market watchers.JPM Government Bond Index-EM Global diversified Index has assets under management of about $200 billion. A 10 per cent weightage on the index will mean that about $20 billion dollar will flow into these bonds.“India’s inclusion in the global bond index is a pivotal step towards international recognition and access to vital capital for growth. This move promises increased demand for the Indian rupee  potentially buffering against depreciation. Lower borrowing costs can fuel essential infrastructure projects  while heightened liquidity may foster more efficient trading conditions ” said Suresh Swamy  partner  Price Waterhouse & Co.Also read: Rupee rallies on JPMorgan’s move to include India in its indexThis would also contribute to the roadmap for India’s growth of $5 trillion economy. However  the inclusion may also entail heightened vulnerability to global market fluctuations  as India becomes subject to shifts in sentiment  economic conditions  and policies in major economies  influencing bond prices and yields.“Navigating these dynamics will be key to India’s success ” said Swamy.The much-anticipated inclusion of India in JPMorgan GBI-EM index  which has been in the works for over 10 years now  will be effective from June 28  2024  accounting for post-announcement operational lags.Also read: The big deal about global bonds and India’s inclusionIndia’s weight of 10 per cent will be staggered over 10 months  leading to passive inflows of $22 billion. The actual flows though may be higher  contingent on market dynamics and active flows.Reliance SecuritiesA big long-term positive in the domestic market after the news that the JPMorgan Chase & Co. will add Indian government bonds to its benchmark emerging-market index  a keenly awaited event that could drive billions of foreign inflows to the nation’s debt market  starting from June 28 2024.Nilesh Shah  Managing Director  Kotak Mahindra AMCIndia’s inclusion in bond index is a step in the right direction. With exclusion of Russia and troubles in China  the options for global debt investors have narrowed down. Hopefully rating agencies will respect investors view point and give up on their moody and poor standards. This inclusion will deepen bond market in India.HSBC Holdings PlcThe inclusion may also prompt flows of as much as $30 billion. We expect this as a positive for PSU Banks.DBSForeign bank DBS said there was also high demand amongst benchmark investors for India’s inclusion in the index and that a final 10% weightage in the JPM index could lead to inflows of $25 billion to $30 billion into India after the inclusion is complete.Rakeshh Mehta chairman of Mehta Equities LtdIndia’s inclusion in JP Morgan emerging markets bond index is great news which would give a booster access to global investors to participate in the world’s fastest-growing large economy that would offer them the highest alpha returns in the emerging region.I believe it is after waiting for 10 odd years India has finally been included in the JP Morgan EM Bond Index today effective 28th June 2024. The credit goes to the Govt of India  regulator as well as various government organisations who made this possible in the current scenario.The news has come at the right time when the market is under pressure and hereafter the possibility of larger FPI flows could be seen ahead of this inclusion. The Rupee would also benefit from this news. We continue to remain optimistic on a great Indian long term story. Equity markets would take this as a welcome note at the right time.Madhavi Arora  Economist at Emkay Global FinancialThe much-anticipated inclusion of India in JP Morgan GBI-EM index will be effective from 28th Jun’24  accounting for post-announcement operational lags. India’s weight of 10% will be staggered over 10 months  leading to passive inflows of $22bn ($26bn accounting for addition in other smaller indices).The actual flows though may be higher  contingent on market dynamics and active flows. Structurally  this will lower India’s risk premia/cost of funding  enhance the liquidity and ownership base of G-Secs and help India finance its fiscal and CAD.This does not immediately pave way for inclusion in FTSE and Bloomberg indexes  which have more stringent conditions (FPI taxation/Euroclear). But it could have a demonstration effect in the medium term as the lower risk premia could trigger positive externalities.Near-term  we expect bond yields and INR to reverse gains after the initial euphoria  tracking global markets. However  the trend will again reverse in favour of bonds by end-Mar’24  with 10-yr yield coming off well below 7%.For 2H FY24  we see USD-INR ranging 82.25-84.25  with tactical RBI intervention keeping it middle of EM Asia pack.VK Vijayakumar  Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial ServicesJP Morgan’s inclusion of India in its Emerging Market Bond Index will reduce bond yields and the consequent decline in the cost of borrowing will boost the bottom line of companies.HDFC BankThe inclusion could lead to passive inflows as index tracking funds increase their holdings in Indian bonds. According to estimates this could be anywhere between $25-30 billion in the first year. As of now  23 bonds worth a notional value of $330 billion are eligible to be added in the index in a staggered way over 10 months – 10% of this (maximum weightage) could therefore lead to close to $30 billion passive inflows.This is a structural change that could rerate Indian bonds and could have positive medium-term implications for bonds  the rupee  and the balance of payment situation. Even with the same supply of bonds  bond yields could trade in a lower range. This could also have spillover effects to cost of borrowing for Indian corporates as well (for instance for the ECB market).While there appears to be some short-term decoupling with the US yields and oil movements (the recent increase)  the bond yield could continue to respond to global movement once the immediate knee-jerk reaction plays out. Moreover  over the medium term  index inclusion does not imply a permanent insulation from global and domestic vulnerabilities. Moreover  the rise in external debt could also bring about another set of macro stability issues.The announcement is likely to cause an immediate rally in the domestic bond market today  with the possibility of the 10Y benchmark moving towards 7.05% (closed at 7.15% yesterday and opened at 7.088% today). The USD/INR pair could also see some relief and might move towards 82.80 levels  after closing at 83.09 yesterday. We expect the pair to trade in the range of 82.70-83.00 today.Ajay Seth  Secretary  DEA  Ministry of FinanceIt is a welcome development showing confidence in Indian Economy.Anantha Nageswaran  Chief Economic AdvisorWe welcome this development. JPMorgan has made this decision on their own. It attests to the confidence that financial market participants and financial markets  in general  have on India’s potential and growth prospects and its macroeconomic and fiscal policies.

Despite the negativity around global bond yields  we believe our markets will remain quite resilient after this inclusion. In the medium term  our target for the benchmark 10-year bond yields at 6.75% remains on track.For the medium term  once this entire noise around Fed hikes and global yields stabilizes  we believe peak market rates are behind us and market yields could gradually soften. From a demand perspective  markets could see incremental buying from active foreign funds.

That it has come about while access to the Euroclear settlement system is still pending and with almost no concessions on withholding and capital gains taxes is noteworthy.India will be included in at least one of the JPMorgan Emerging Markets bond indices (and significantly in their JESG variants)  the GBI-EM Global Diversified Index suite  beginning 28 June 2024  and thereafter reach 10% of the index weight in a staggered manner over 10 months.The JPM bond index is one of the three larger global bond indices. The others are the FTSE Russell and Bloomberg Barclays indices.Given the attractiveness of India’s sovereign bond market (in terms of relatively high yields and a stable exchange rate)  it is likely that these indices will also eventually consider including India in their respective indices  if capital account controls are further eased.A de facto partial easing of capital controls began when the Voluntary Retention Route (VRR) was introduced for foreign portfolio investors in 2019. It gave them more choices of investment instruments and exemptions from some regulatory norms. The scope was then significantly expanded with the introduction of the Fully Accessible Route (FAR) series of bonds in April 2020  which allowed non-residents to invest in specified Government of India securities (G-Secs) without being subject to any investment ceilings.Twenty-three Indian government bonds (IGBs) with a combined notional value of $330 billion ( ₹27.37 trillion) are eligible for inclusion in the JPMorgan indices. The total notional value outstanding of IGBs is over ₹96 trillion. Of this  the FAR bonds have a notional outstanding of ₹27 trillion. FPIs’ exposure in the FAR bonds is reportedly about ₹95 000 crore.Details are still awaited  but the following are some potential implications.It is estimated that investors in the JPM GBI-EM Index have $236 billion invested in the index bonds. Accounting for the assets under management of the various sub-indices  IGB bond buys by FPIs might be in the range of $20-23 billion. Inclusion in associated indices will add to this. These are passive flows which are allocated from investors’ portfolios to the index weight.In addition  there are likely to be significant active funds flows  where other investors  in anticipation of a drop in bond yields given the additional expected demand from index investors  might take long positions in some of these securities. We are therefore likely to see an even larger balance of payments surplus in FY24 than our earlier anticipation of $17 billion. Consequently  even in the run-up to the start of the index inclusion  we will probably see a gradual and continuing drop in yields of the bonds included in the FAR list.Note that we expect the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) monetary policy committee to begin cutting the repo rate in the second half of FY25  reinforcing the effects on yields of additional demand.Depending on the magnitudes of these inflows  if the RBI were to intervene in the spot foreign exchange markets to manage volatility in the event of a sharp appreciation of the Indian rupee  there will be a large increase in domestic system liquidity.Assuming an inflow of around $40 billion via portfolio investments in bonds over the course of the next couple of years  and assuming a clean spot buy by the RBI without swapping into forwards of half the amount  would add around ₹1.7 trillion to system liquidity. This will necessitate some sterilization. While open market operation securities will absorb part of this  an increase in the cash reserve ratio will probably be required.Over and above this  a fall in yields  being a growth driver and other things being equal  is also likely to increase portfolio flows into equities  thus boosting the stock markets as well.Saugata Bhattacharya is executive vice-president at Axis Bank.

While foreigners play a small role in the Indian bond market  inflows have been picking up in recent years and the country's assets have proven resilient to financial turbulence that has roiled other developing-nations.The index provider will add Indian securities to the JPMorgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets starting June 28  2024. The South Asian nation will have a maximum weight of 10% on the index  according to a statement Thursday.Index inclusion follows ""the Indian government's introduction of the FAR program in 2020 and substantive market reforms for aiding foreign portfolio investments "" the team led by the firm's global head of index research  Gloria Kim  said in a statement. Almost three-quarters of benchmark investors surveyed were in favor of India's inclusion in to the index  they said.India's milestone is a stark contrast to many emerging-market peers  not least neighboring China  whose economic woes and struggling financial markets have become a source of frustration for global investors. In fact  those troubles have only burnished India's appeal.Foreign investors have bought $3.5 billion worth of Indian government debt this year  according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Giving global investors greater access may prompt flows of as much as $30 billion  according to HSBC Holdings Plc in a recent note.On the equities side  India has been as one of the top investment destintions among major emerging markets this year  with its fast-growing economy and solid corporate earnings pushing the nation's equity benchmark near an all-time high. Developing-market money managers are most overweight on India in their Asia portfolios  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts wrote in a report earlier this month.While concerns over rising oil prices and higher-for-longer US interest rates have spurred outflows from local shares in September  overseas investors have bought almost $16 billion on a net basis this year. That's set to be the biggest annual inflow since 2020.""With inflation coming under control  the inclusion will open more gates for foreign capital to flow into India "" said Charu Chanana  a strategist at Saxo Markets in Singapore.Expectations that India may be added to international gauges had been rising in recent months as providers look to diversify index constituents. Russia's invasion of Ukraine had seen it drop off indexes  while China's worsening economic woes have taken the shine off the country's sovereign debt.That left India as the world's last big emerging market that hasn't joined others like China on the global debt indexes. Assets worth $236 billion track the JPMorgan emerging market bond indexes  the company said.Still  authorities in India have been largely uncompromising in making changes to tax policies that would make it easier for the securities to be added to global indexes. Korea  another large emerging market  signed an agreement to open an omnibus account with Euroclear Bank SA  facilitating foreigners' access.Currently  23 bonds worth a combined notional $330 billion are eligible to be added into the index  JPMorgan said. Inclusion will be staggered over 10 months at roughly 1% weight per month  it said.Foreigners have raised their holdings of such bonds to almost $12 billion  from $7.4 billion at end of 2022  in anticipation of the inclusion  according to Clearing Corp. of India data. The rupee was trading 0.4% higher in offshore trading early Friday  with the bond market yet to start trading.FTSE Russell  another major index provider  has the nation's bonds on index watch for inclusion in its emerging market gauge.Elsewhere  Egypt has been placed on negative watch due to the material currency repatriation hurdles reported by investors  JPMorgan said. The country's index eligibility will be assessed over the next three to six months  it said.Bloomberg LP is the parent company of Bloomberg Index Services Ltd  which administers indexes that compete with those from other service providers.(Except for the headline  this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",neutral,0.11,0.89,0.01,negative,0.02,0.29,0.69,True,English,"['Emerging-Markets Bond Index', 'JPMorgan', 'India', 'next three to six months', 'JPMorgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets', 'longer US interest rates', 'material currency repatriation hurdles', 'JPMorgan emerging market bond indexes', 'Goldman Sachs Group Inc.', 'last big emerging market', 'The South Asian nation', 'Bloomberg Index Services Ltd', 'large emerging market', 'emerging market gauge', 'major emerging markets', 'Indian bond market', 'substantive market reforms', 'top investment destintions', 'solid corporate earnings', 'rising oil prices', 'biggest annual inflow', 'Euroclear Bank SA', 'Indian government debt', 'foreign portfolio investments', 'many emerging-market peers', 'HSBC Holdings Plc', 'worsening economic woes', 'major index provider', 'other service providers', 'benchmark emerging-market index', 'Indian government bonds', 'global debt indexes', 'debt market', 'Apple Inc', 'financial markets', 'Saxo Markets', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'recent months', 'sovereign debt', 'global indexes', 'other developing-nations', 'economic growth', 'equity benchmark', 'Bloomberg LP', 'benchmark investors', 'foreign capital', 'global companies', 'Indian securities', 'global head', 'index research', 'index constituents', 'index watch', 'index eligibility', 'Foreign investors', 'global investors', '$3.5 billion worth', 'latest sign', 'geopolitical influence', 'small role', 'recent years', 'financial turbulence', 'FAR program', 'Gloria Kim', 'stark contrast', 'greater access', 'recent note', 'equities side', 'growing economy', 'Asia portfolios', 'local shares', 'net basis', 'Charu Chanana', 'international gauges', 'tax policies', 'omnibus account', 'Clearing Corp.', 'FTSE Russell', 'negative watch', 'NDTV staff', 'syndicated feed', 'international investors', 'overseas investors', 'foreign inflows', 'growing appeal', 'maximum weight', 'offshore trading', 'parent company', ""foreigners' access"", 'Index inclusion', 'neighboring China', '10 months', 'India data', '23 bonds', '1% weight', 'Co.', 'event', 'billions', 'decision', 'country', 'alternatives', 'assets', 'June', 'statement', 'introduction', 'team', 'firm', 'three-quarters', 'favor', 'milestone', 'source', 'frustration', 'fact', 'troubles', 'analysts', 'report', 'concerns', 'outflows', 'September', 'inflation', 'control', 'gates', 'strategist', 'Singapore', 'Expectations', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'shine', 'world', 'others', 'authorities', 'changes', 'Korea', 'agreement', 'notional', 'end', 'anticipation', 'rupee', 'Egypt', 'headline', 'story']",2023-09-22,2023-09-23,ndtv.com

Rating ag…,JPMorgan on Friday said it will include India in its widely tracked emerging market debt index  setting the stage for billions of dollars of inflows into the world’s fifth-largest economy.India’s local bonds will be included in the Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) index and the index suite  benchmarked by about $236 billion in global funds according to JPMorgan  per a Reuters report.The inclusion will begin on June 28  2024  and extend over 10 months with 1% increments on its index weighting  as India is expected to reach the maximum weighting of 10%  JPMorgan said.Here’s what analysts said on the impact of JPMorgan’s move on Indian markets.Reliance SecuritiesA big long-term positive in the domestic market after the news that the JPMorgan Chase & Co. will add Indian government bonds to its benchmark emerging-market index  a keenly awaited event that could drive billions of foreign inflows to the nation’s debt market  starting from June 28 2024.Nilesh Shah  Managing Director  Kotak Mahindra AMCIndia’s inclusion in bond index is a step in the right direction. With exclusion of Russia and troubles in China  the options for global debt investors have narrowed down. Hopefully rating agencies will respect investors view point and give up on their moody and poor standards. This inclusion will deepen bond market in India.HSBC Holdings PlcThe inclusion may also prompt flows of as much as $30 billion. We expect this as a positive for PSU Banks.DBSForeign bank DBS said there was also high demand amongst benchmark investors for India’s inclusion in the index and that a final 10% weightage in the JPM index could lead to inflows of $25 billion to $30 billion into India after the inclusion is complete.Rakeshh Mehta chairman of Mehta Equities LtdIndia’s inclusion in JP Morgan emerging markets bond index is great news which would give a booster access to global investors to participate in the world’s fastest-growing large economy that would offer them the highest alpha returns in the emerging region.I believe it is after waiting for 10 odd years India has finally been included in the JP Morgan EM Bond Index today effective 28th June 2024. The credit goes to the Govt of India  regulator as well as various government organisations who made this possible in the current scenario.The news has come at the right time when the market is under pressure and hereafter the possibility of larger FPI flows could be seen ahead of this inclusion. The Rupee would also benefit from this news. We continue to remain optimistic on a great Indian long term story. Equity markets would take this as a welcome note at the right time.Madhavi Arora  Economist at Emkay Global FinancialThe much-anticipated inclusion of India in JP Morgan GBI-EM index will be effective from 28th Jun’24  accounting for post-announcement operational lags. India’s weight of 10% will be staggered over 10 months  leading to passive inflows of $22bn ($26bn accounting for addition in other smaller indices).The actual flows though may be higher  contingent on market dynamics and active flows. Structurally  this will lower India’s risk premia/cost of funding  enhance the liquidity and ownership base of G-Secs and help India finance its fiscal and CAD.This does not immediately pave way for inclusion in FTSE and Bloomberg indexes  which have more stringent conditions (FPI taxation/Euroclear). But it could have a demonstration effect in the medium term as the lower risk premia could trigger positive externalities.Near-term  we expect bond yields and INR to reverse gains after the initial euphoria  tracking global markets. However  the trend will again reverse in favour of bonds by end-Mar’24  with 10-yr yield coming off well below 7%.For 2H FY24  we see USD-INR ranging 82.25-84.25  with tactical RBI intervention keeping it middle of EM Asia pack.VK Vijayakumar  Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial ServicesJP Morgan’s inclusion of India in its Emerging Market Bond Index will reduce bond yields and the consequent decline in the cost of borrowing will boost the bottom line of companies.,neutral,0.03,0.93,0.05,mixed,0.48,0.27,0.25,True,English,"['emerging market debt index', 'JPMorgan', 'India', 'analysts', 'JP Morgan emerging markets bond index', 'great Indian long term story', 'JP Morgan EM Bond Index', 'JP Morgan GBI-EM index', 'Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets', 'Emerging Market Bond Index', 'emerging market debt index', 'EM Asia pack', 'various government organisations', 'Kotak Mahindra AMC', 'HSBC Holdings Plc', 'Rakeshh Mehta chairman', 'Mehta Equities Ltd', 'highest alpha returns', 'post-announcement operational lags', 'other smaller indices', 'tactical RBI intervention', 'Chief Investment Strategist', 'Geojit Financial Services', 'Indian government bonds', 'benchmark emerging-market index', 'investors view point', 'growing large economy', 'Emkay Global Financial', 'big long-term positive', 'lower risk premia', 'global debt investors', 'Foreign bank DBS', 'larger FPI flows', 'Indian markets', 'GBI-EM) index', 'emerging region', 'bond market', 'global markets', 'medium term', 'debt market', 'bond yields', 'Equity markets', 'index suite', 'index weighting', 'JPM index', 'benchmark investors', 'global investors', 'great news', 'largest economy', 'FPI taxation', 'domestic market', 'market dynamics', 'global funds', 'local bonds', 'Reuters report', 'maximum weighting', 'Reliance Securities', 'foreign inflows', 'Nilesh Shah', 'Managing Director', 'right direction', 'rating agencies', 'poor standards', 'PSU Banks', 'high demand', 'final 10% weightage', 'booster access', '10 odd years', 'current scenario', 'right time', 'The Rupee', 'welcome note', 'Madhavi Arora', '28th Jun', 'actual flows', 'active flows', 'ownership base', 'Bloomberg indexes', 'stringent conditions', 'demonstration effect', 'positive externalities', 'initial euphoria', '10-yr yield', '2H FY24', 'VK Vijayakumar', 'consequent decline', 'bottom line', 'passive inflows', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'Friday', 'stage', 'billions', 'dollars', 'world', 'fifth', 'inclusion', 'June', '10 months', '1% increments', 'analysts', 'impact', 'move', 'Co.', 'event', 'nation', 'step', 'exclusion', 'Russia', 'troubles', 'China', 'options', 'moody', 'credit', 'Govt', 'regulator', 'pressure', 'possibility', 'Economist', 'addition', 'cost', 'funding', 'liquidity', 'G-Secs', 'fiscal', 'CAD', 'way', 'FTSE', 'INR', 'gains', 'trend', 'favour', 'end-Mar', 'USD', 'borrowing', 'companies']",2023-09-22,2023-09-23,thehindubusinessline.com
30524,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/finding-a-trading-edge-in-a-bear-market:-interview-with-bitmexs-stephan-lutz,Finding a Trading Edge in a Bear Market: Interview with BitMEX’s Stephan Lutz,"BitMEX is an ""OG"" in the crypto space  as it was the first derivatives exchange to reach serious traction in 2018-2019 and is an innovator in the derivatives space. The exchange is often credited for popularizing perpetual swaps  which closely resemble futures but remove the inconvenient expiry mechanic by introducing a continuous funding rate.","BitMEX is an ""OG"" in the crypto space  as it was the first derivatives exchange to reach serious traction in 2018-2019 and is an innovator in the derivatives space. The exchange is often credited for popularizing perpetual swaps  which closely resemble futures but remove the inconvenient expiry mechanic by introducing a continuous funding rate.BitMEX was also born in an era when stablecoins were nowhere near as prominent  and that meant accepting Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ether (ETH-USD  Ethereum) as collateral. In a nutshell  users could long and short BTC while holding BTC collateral  which sounds a bit like dark magic — but it works.Since its early days  BitMEX has grown and changed  including fresh new leadership with Stephan Lutz  who became CEO in November 2022. As a seasoned veteran of PwC  Deutsche Börse  and other financial institutions  he brings a balanced approach of tradition and innovation to the company.We sat down with him to learn more about how he sees the market evolving  how traders can navigate the quiet markets of this year  and talk about BitMEX’s plans and vision.How would you characterize 2023 in markets? Major assets definitely look quite “stable ” but are you seeing some underlying trends emerging that might explode later on?SL: Market volatility and the risk-reward ratio are low  as is the appetite of traders and institutional investors. This is largely due to events in 2022 and regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. Price action today closely follows the news cycle  indicating that interest in crypto remains high  with people eagerly awaiting the next significant development.So far this year  we have yet to see a killer crypto adoption use case that would generate the buzz and news cycle that attracts new inflows. One example may be liquid staking  as we’re seeing more and more liquid staking protocols available after the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade in April. The sector has seen significant growth and is expected to continue to expand next year.What’s your take on the crypto cycles? With the halving coming up next year  some people see it as an inevitability that another bull market will come in 2025-2026.SL: Cyclical patterns in the crypto market are not too dissimilar from traditional financial markets. Based on previous halving events  volatility is expected before and after  with the potential for upward momentum. The upcoming halving in April is highly anticipated  especially since interest rates are reportedly expected to be lowered starting in Q2 2024.As much as we hope Bitcoin could become an effective inflation hedge  thus building up the next bull run  I believe it could only be further elevated if there's a strong crypto adoption use case for mass retail  such as ETFs.In Twitter discussions  a lot of people describe bull markets as PvE (player vs. environment)  while bear markets become PvP (player vs. player). What does this mean in practice?SL: PvE traders who primarily profit from the overall market trend are usually observed during bull markets. In contrast  PvP traders compete against each other instead of betting on the market environment — a phenomenon more commonly seen during bear markets.I won’t judge on who are the more advanced traders  but at BitMEX  we can see that our volumes in the bear market are relatively stable compared to our competitors  indicating we have a larger group of PvP traders.BitMEX was synonymous with “degen” retail trading in the 2018-2019 bear market. Would you say the same thing in 2023?SL: The story of BitMEX mirrors the overall evolution of the crypto market — explosive beginning  then challenges  and now a transformation with a more diversified product portfolio.The perpetual swap we invented was a blessing for this industry and remains one of the greatest innovations in finance. It was the right product when users wanted to participate in the market upwinds but were worried about the security of their token. That’s why we have put so much emphasis on our wallet security and risk management system.For some time in 2021 and 2022  this looked like a competitive disadvantage when other platforms were listing every s...coin under the moon. Come late 2022  we have proven that BitMEX is the exchange for experienced and professional traders.Whilst others worry about a stablecoin depeg  our traders enjoy trading Bitcoin-margined contracts. To me  this proves that our traders have shifted from a practice of speculative trading to clearly defined strategies with long-term PnL (profit and loss) in Bitcoin.Traders usually make money on volatility  be it upward or downward. It’s likely that many smart traders profited greatly from the dramatic events of 2022  but in a period such as right now  what can traders do?SL: Opportunities are available if you are a skilled trader  and it’s just as important to diversify your portfolio and manage your risk exposure  especially in times of a quiet market. At BitMEX  we are launching several products to support our traders in this environment  such as our recent pre-IEO futures contracts like SEI futures that enable traders to capitalize on price fluctuations around listings through derivatives.What are the advantages of using derivatives such as perpetual swaps compared to spot margin trading?SL: Derivatives such as perpetual swaps allow traders to reduce their capital exposure on an exchange whilst amplifying profit and loss through leverage as opposed to spot margin trading  where full capitalization is required for traders to trade the desired position size.Meanwhile  derivatives products can minimize traders’ risks through limited exposure to the underlying asset  compared with spot margin trading that involves direct trading of the actual asset in the spot market  with all the custody dangers that brings.A second  often underestimated benefit of perps and futures over spot or spot margin is that futures can be used to trade varying price expectations even before a spot market is available. This is particularly valuable for Pre-IEO projects.BitMEX is the creator of Perpetual Swap  the most traded crypto product of all time. To date  that has generated over 3 trillion in total volume on BitMEX alone  suggesting it is the product that our traders find most profitable and desirable.Do you see option derivatives as an interesting tool in this environment? What else is BitMEX working on for its products?SL: In the past few months  BitMEX has made great progress in ramping up products and tools to help our traders profit from the current market and improve their trading skills.It is very possible for us to list options if we see market demand  and we do recognize its potential for professional traders.Recently  we launched a few other innovative features -- for example  Guilds  a social trading feature that has generated over $400 million [in] trading volume in less than a month since its launch. Guilds users are incentivized to level up their skills by learning from their peers whilst making a profit through competing against other Guilds and participating in our weekly competitions.We also launched the aforementioned pre-listing futures contracts for SEI and others and a few other products for traders  such as XBTETH  a perp for trading the ETH/BTC ratio collateralized with Bitcoin.DisclosureThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq  Inc.",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.34,0.21,0.45,True,English,"['Trading Edge', 'Bear Market', 'Stephan Lutz', 'Interview', 'BitMEX', 'killer crypto adoption use case', 'strong crypto adoption use case', 'U.S. Price action', 'recent pre-IEO futures contracts', 'inconvenient expiry mechanic', 'continuous funding rate', 'Deutsche Börse', 'effective inflation hedge', 'fresh new leadership', 'other financial institutions', 'next significant development', 'risk management system', 'next bull run', 'liquid staking protocols', 'Ethereum Shanghai upgrade', 'traditional financial markets', 'overall market trend', 'many smart traders', 'degen” retail trading', 'diversified product portfolio', '2018-2019 bear market', 'first derivatives exchange', 'previous halving events', 'Bitcoin-margined contracts', 'crypto market', 'crypto space', 'crypto cycles', 'derivatives space', 'new inflows', 'significant growth', 'mass retail', 'overall evolution', 'right product', 'other platforms', 'risk exposure', 'bull market', 'bear markets', 'market upwinds', 'quiet market', 'serious traction', 'perpetual swaps', 'dark magic', 'early days', 'Stephan Lutz', 'seasoned veteran', 'balanced approach', 'Major assets', 'underlying trends', 'risk-reward ratio', 'institutional investors', 'regulatory uncertainty', 'news cycle', 'One example', 'Cyclical patterns', 'upward momentum', 'upcoming halving', 'Twitter discussions', 'larger group', 'same thing', 'greatest innovations', 'competitive disadvantage', 'stablecoin depeg', 'speculative trading', 'long-term PnL', 'dramatic events', 'skilled trader', 'several products', 'PvP traders', 'advanced traders', 'professional traders', 'interest rates', 'wallet security', 'Market volatility', 'market environment', 'PvE traders', 'BTC collateral', 'BitMEX', 'OG', 'innovator', 'stablecoins', 'BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD', 'users', 'CEO', 'November', 'PwC', 'company', 'year', 'plans', 'vision', 'SL', 'appetite', 'people', 'buzz', 'April', 'sector', 'inevitability', 'potential', 'Q2', 'ETFs', 'lot', 'player', 'practice', 'contrast', 'phenomenon', 'volumes', 'competitors', 'story', 'challenges', 'transformation', 'blessing', 'industry', 'finance', 'token', 'emphasis', 'time', 'moon', 'experienced', 'others', 'strategies', 'profit', 'loss', 'money', 'period', 'Opportunities', '2022', '2023', '2021']",2023-09-23,2023-09-23,nasdaq.com

Instead of meeting with the Company to express their views and obtain answers  these shareholders decided to publicize them in the media  ignoring market recommendations regarding shareholder-company dialogue.The Board of Directors responded to these letters  firmly rejecting their allegations and emphasizing that it had always acted solely in the interests of Atos. In particular  it was pointed out that:the contemplated sale of Tech Foundations announced on August 1  2023  would enable the planned separation of Eviden and Tech Foundations  which was announced on June 14  2022  in the best possible conditions given the current circumstances Atos entered into exclusive negotiations with EP Equity Investment on August 1  2023. It was not possible to announce earlier  at the time of the Annual General Meeting  held on June 28  2023  nor during the Company’s first half-year results on July 28  2023  an entry into exclusive negotiations which did not exist. In addition  it was pointed out that the market had already been informed since October 2022 of the existence of marks of interest concerning a potential acquisition of its Tech Foundations business what the Company announced on August 1  2023  was that it had entered into exclusive negotiations for the contemplated sale of Tech Foundations: the project is subject to a number of conditions. The Company has committed to submit this contemplated sale to shareholders for approval  going further than the recommendation of the Autorité des marchés financiers which only provides for a non-binding vote in this matter in such case  shareholders will be able to vote on the contemplated sale as well as on the associated capital increases  on the basis of information that will be supplemented if and when the final agreements are signed and prior to a general meeting. At this stage  the Company communicated on the contemplated sale on August 1  2023  which it considers to be appropriate the mention of the absence of a capital increase during the Annual General Meeting on June 28  2023  was referring to the implementation of the plan announced on June 14  2022  which was the scenario the Company was working on. This statement could not have applied to a contemplated transaction that only became concrete on August 1  2023 in this context  the recent personal accusations made against executives and directors are unfair and unjustified. In particular  the proposed management package  which was offered to the entire future management team of Tech Foundations  and not just to certain executives  is usual in this type of transaction. In addition  this management package would be borne exclusively by EP Equity Investment if the transaction is finalized furthermore  during the negotiations  the Board of Directors has always ensured it upheld to best practices and acted in the best interests of the Company  supported by Finexsi and BTSG on a number of topics which were specified in the August 1  2023  press release.The systematic and unjustified criticism of the Company  as well as its orchestrated mediatization  are detrimental to the Company  its teams  employees  long-term shareholders and customers. It plays into the hands of short-sellers and others with an interest in seeing Atos’ share price fall. If the Company deems it appropriate  it will not hesitate to take legal action against any maneuvers aimed at destabilizing the Company.Despite unfounded criticism  the Company and its Board of Directors remain convinced of the importance of shareholder dialogue and are always open to constructive exchanges.***About AtosAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with 107 000 employees and annual revenue of c. € 11 billion.

(the Company) announces that the number of Ordinary Shares tendered for repurchase during the repurchase period is 4 188 326  and that the gross repurchase Price per Ordinary Share is €10.69.Further to the shareholder circular dated 1 August 2023 (the Shareholder Circular)  the acceptance period for the repurchase of Ordinary Shares by the Company under the Revised Share Repurchase Arrangement ended on 22 September 2023. The number of Ordinary Shares tendered for repurchase by the Company during the repurchase period is 4 188 326  equating to EUR 44.8 million of capital based on the gross repurchase price per Ordinary Share of €10.69.The gross repurchase price per Ordinary Share of €10.69 is calculated as a pro rata share of funds in the Escrow Account as determined three business days on which the banks in the Netherlands and Euronext Amsterdam are generally open for normal business prior to the EGM to be held on 27 September 2023 at 15:00 CET.The repurchase of Ordinary Shares under the Revised Share Repurchase Arrangement is subject to Completion of the Business Combination. Redeeming Shareholders will receive the gross repurchase price within two trading days after the Business Combination Completion Date (2 October 2023) from their bank or stockbroker.1SPEAR can only repurchase Ordinary Shares to the extent allowed under applicable law and repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable law. The repurchase of the Ordinary Shares held by an Ordinary Shareholder does not trigger the repurchase of the Warrants held by such Ordinary Shareholder (if any). Accordingly  Ordinary Shareholders whose Ordinary Shares are repurchased by the Company will retain all rights to any Warrants that they may hold at the time of repurchase.For the avoidance of doubt  a Shareholder can vote on its Ordinary Shares at the EGM on 27 September 2023 at 15:00 CET irrespective of whether it has elected to exercise its rights to have such Ordinary Shares repurchased under the Revised Share Repurchase Arrangement.In accordance with the Prospectus  the Board may resolve  within one month following repurchase  to place any or all of the Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company with existing Shareholders or with third parties seeking to obtain Ordinary Shares or  alternatively  to cancel any or all the Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company under the Revised Share Repurchase Arrangement.Further  in relation to the proposed distribution of redemption premium to non-redeeming shareholders (see proposal 2i in the agenda to the EGM  as contained in the Shareholder Circular)  the distribution itself is subject to completion of the Business Combination. As such  the dates contemplated in the aforementioned proposal are not possible; accordingly  the Company will as soon as possible publish revised dates for the ex-distribution date  record date and payment date  but in any event payment will take place as soon as possible after completion of the Business Combination.1 This does not account for any delay attributable to the processes of your bank or stockbroker.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,negative,0.02,0.31,0.67,True,English,"['SPEAR Investments I B', 'repurchase period', 'repurchase price', 'results', 'September', '04', '18', 'SPEAR Investments I B.V.', 'Revised Share Repurchase Arrangement', 'Business Combination Completion Date', 'pro rata share', 'two trading days', 'three business days', 'gross repurchase Price', 'Ordinary Share', 'revised dates', 'normal business', 'ex-distribution date', 'record date', 'repurchase period', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'acceptance period', 'Escrow Account', 'Redeeming Shareholders', 'applicable law', 'one month', 'existing Shareholders', 'third parties', 'redemption premium', 'payment date', 'shareholder circular', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'results', 'Company', 'number', 'August', '22 September', 'capital', 'funds', 'banks', 'Netherlands', 'EGM', '27 September', '15:00 CET', 'stockbroker', 'extent', 'repurchases', 'accordance', 'Warrants', 'rights', 'time', 'avoidance', 'doubt', 'Prospectus', 'Board', 'relation', 'proposal', 'agenda', 'event', 'place', 'delay', 'processes']",2023-09-22,2023-09-23,marketscreener.com

In this case  the Offer is not subject to Section 14(d)(1) of  or Regulation 14D promulgated under  the Exchange Act. Accordingly  the Offer is subject to disclosure requirements that may be different than those under applicable U.S. law  procedures and practice.

Tilbudsdokumentet relateret til Tilbuddet blev offentliggjort den 25. maj 2023 (""Tilbudsdokumentet"") og tillæg hertil blev offentliggjort og godkendt af Finanstilsynet henholdsvis den 7. juli 2023 og den 28. juli 2023 (""Tillæggene"").Deutsche Börse offentliggør i dag det endelige resultat af Tilbuddet.I overensstemmelse med vilkår og betingelser for Tilbuddet som fremsat i Tilbudsdokumentet og Tillæggene  er Tilbudsperioden udløbet den 19. september 2023 kl. 23:59 (CEST).

Hvis en SimCorp aktionærs angivne konto er i en anden bank end det depot  hvor den pågældende SimCorp aktionærs SimCorp aktier opbevares  vil det kontante vederlag til hver SimCorp aktionær  som har accepteret Tilbuddet  blive udbetalt til dennes pågældende konto cirka to (2) hverdage senere svarende til overførselstiden for betalinger mellem banker.Tvangsindløsning og afnoteringDa Deutsche Börse som resultat af Tilbuddet har opnået mere end 90 procent af SimCorp aktierne og de tilknyttede stemmerettigheder (eksklusive egne aktier)  vil Deutsche Börse snarest muligt indlede og gennemføre en tvangsindløsning af de resterende SimCorp aktier  som SimCorp minoritetsaktionærerne besidder  i overensstemmelse med lovbekendtgørelse nr. 1451 af 9. november 2022 om aktie- og anpartsselskaber og VP regelbogen udstedt af Euronext Securities Copenhagen.Herudover vil Deutsche Börse anmode om  at SimCorp aktierne bliver slettet fra handel og officiel notering på Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S  og Deutsche Börse vil i forlængelse heraf foreslå passende ændringer til SimCorps vedtægter for at afspejle en sådan afnotering.Information vedrørende tvangsindløsningen af de resterede SimCorp minoritetsaktionærer og sletningen fra handel og officiel notering af SimCorp aktierne vil følge i separate meddelelser.KontakterIngrid HaasGroup CommunicationsDeutsche Börse AGTelefon: +49 69 21113217Jan StreckerInvestor RelationsDeutsche Börse AGTelefon: +49 69 21111670Om Deutsche BörseDeutsche Börse sikrer  som en international børsorganisation og innovativ udbyder af markedsinfrastruktur  markeder karakteriseret af integritet  gennemsigtighed og stabilitet.

Disse udsagn er underlagt kendte og ukendte risici og usikkerheder  som kan medføre  at de faktiske resultater  præstationer eller begivenheder afviger væsentligt fra de udtrykte eller antydede  og som ligger uden for Deutsche Börses evne til at kontrollere eller vurdere præcist. Udover udsagn  der er fremadrettede på grund af sammenhængen  kan fremadrettede udsagn identificeres ved brug af fremadrettede terminologier  herunder ordene ""mener""  ""forudser""  ""har til hensigt""  ""forventer""  ""kan""  ""vil""  ""skal""  ""potentielt""  ""fortsætter"" og lignende udtryk. Fraværet af en sådan terminologi betyder ikke nødvendigvis  at et udsagn ikke er fremadrettet. Faktiske resultater  præstationer eller begivenheder kan afvige væsentligt fra disse udsagn  uden begrænsning  på grund af (i) generelle økonomiske forhold  (ii) de finansielle markeders fremtidige resultater  (iii) renteniveauer  (iv) valutakurser  (v) andre markedsdeltageres adfærd  (vi) generelle konkurrencefaktorer  (vii) ændringer i Love og bestemmelser  (viii) ændringer i centralbankernes politik  statslige tilsynsmyndigheder og/eller (udenlandske) regeringer  (ix) evnen til at integrere erhvervede og fusionerede virksomheder med succes og opnå forventede synergier  (x) reorganiseringsforanstaltninger  i hvert enkelt tilfælde på lokalt  nationalt  regionalt og/eller globalt plan  og (xi) tvister og andre retssager.

Personer  der modtager denne meddelelse og/eller kommer i besiddelse af denne meddelelse  er forpligtet til at tage behørigt hensyn til og overholde alle sådanne restriktioner og indhente alle nødvendige tilladelser  godkendelser eller samtykker. Hverken Deutsche Börse eller nogen af dets rådgivere påtager sig noget ansvar for nogen overtrædelse af sådanne restriktioner fra nogen person. Enhver person (herunder  men ikke begrænset til  depotforvaltere  nominees  og trustees)  der har til hensigt at videresende denne meddelelse til en jurisdiktion uden for Danmark bør orientere sig om Lovgivningen i den relevante jurisdiktion  inden de foretager sig noget. Distributionen af denne meddelelse i andre jurisdiktioner end Danmark kan være begrænset ved Lov  og derfor bør personer  der kommer i besiddelse af denne meddelelse  informere sig om og overholde sådanne restriktioner. Enhver manglende overholdelse af sådanne restriktioner kan udgøre en overtrædelse af lovgivning om værdipapirer og regler i en sådan jurisdiktion.Information til SimCorp aktionærer i USATilbuddet er underlagt dansk Lovgivning. Tilbuddet vedrører værdipapirer i et dansk selskab og er underlagt oplysningsforpligtelserne i henhold til dansk Lovgivning  som på væsentlige områder kan være forskellige fra dem  der gælder i USA.Tilbuddet fremsættes i USA i overensstemmelse med Section 14(e) og gældende bestemmelser i Regulation 14E bekendtgjort i U.S. Securities Exchange Act af 1934  som senere ændret (""Exchange Act"")  med forbehold for ""Tier II"" undtagelser  der fremgår af rule 14-1(d) i Exhange Act og i øvrigt i henhold til danske Lovkrav. I dette tilfælde  er Tilbuddet ikke underlagt Section 14(d)(1) i eller Regulation 14D bekendtgjort i Exchange Act. Tilbuddet er derfor underlagt oplysningskrav  som kan være anderledes end dem  der gælder i henhold til gældende amerikansk Lovgivning  procedurer og praksis. Herudover er de finansielle oplysninger i denne meddelelse ikke udarbejdet i overensstemmelse med almindeligt anerkendte regnskabsprincipper i USA og kan derfor ikke nødvendigvis sammenlignes med finansielle oplysninger vedrørende amerikanske virksomheder.Tilbuddet fremsættes til SimCorp aktionærer hjemmehørende i USA på samme vilkår og betingelser som dem  der gælder for andre SimCorp aktionærer  til hvem Tilbuddet fremsættes. Alle dokumenter  inklusive denne meddelelse  formidles til SimCorp aktionærer  der er hjemmehørende  har hjemsted eller har sædvanligt opholdssted i USA (""Amerikanske SimCorp Aktionærer"")  på et grundlag  der med rimelighed kan sammenlignes med den metode  hvormed sådanne dokumenter er udleveret til andre SimCorp aktionærer.Amerikanske SimCorp Aktionærer skal være opmærksomme på  at Tilbudsdokumentet og Tillæggene og andre dokumenter vedrørende Tilbuddet  inklusive bilag  er udarbejdet i overensstemmelse med danske Love og danske standarder  som kan afvige fra amerikanske Love og amerikanske standarder. Herudover vil fremgangsmåden for at tilbyde værdipapirer og afregne vederlag  der skal betales til hver enkelt SimCorp aktionær  der accepterer Tilbuddet  være i henhold til gældende danske regler  der på væsentlige områder kan være forskellige fra de regler og fremgangsmåder  der er gældende for et købstilbud vedrørende værdipapirerne i et amerikansk indregistreret selskab  særligt for så vidt angår tilbagekaldelsesret  tidsplan for købstilbuddet  afviklingsprocedurer og betalingstidspunkt for værdipapirerne.Det kan være vanskeligt for Amerikanske SimCorp Aktionærer at håndhæve visse rettigheder og krav  de måtte have i forbindelse med Tilbuddet i medfør af den amerikanske værdipapirlovgivning  idet Deutsche Börse og SimCorp er placeret i jurisdiktioner uden for USA  og nogle af eller alle deres respektive bestyrelses- og direktionsmedlemmer er hjemmehørende i jurisdiktioner uden for USA. Amerikanske SimCorp Aktionærer vil muligvis ikke kunne anlægge sag mod Deutsche Börse eller SimCorp og/eller deres respektive direktions- og bestyrelsesmedlemmer ved en ikke-amerikansk domstol for overtrædelse af amerikansk værdipapirlovgivning. Desuden kan det være  at det ikke er muligt at tvinge Deutsche Börse og SimCorp eller deres koncernforbundne selskaber til at underkaste sig en amerikansk domstols afgørelse.I henhold til sædvanlig dansk praksis og i det omfang  det er tilladt i henhold til gældende lovgivning  herunder Rule 14e-5(b) i Exchange Act kan Deutsche Börse eller et af Deutsche Börses koncernforbundne selskaber eller nominees eller mæglere for forannævnte (der agerer som agenter eller i lignende egenskab) til enhver tid foretage visse køb eller indgå aftale om køb af SimCorp aktier uden for USA ud over i henhold til Tilbuddet. Dette kan ske før eller i løbet af den periode  hvor Tilbuddet er åbent for accept. Sådanne køb kan ske enten i markedet til gældende kurser eller i private transaktioner til forhandlede priser. Hvis Deutsche Börse  eller et af Deutsche Börses koncernforbundne selskaber eller nominees eller mæglere for forannævnte  inden gennemførelsen  erhverver SimCorp aktier til en højere pris end Tilbudsprisen  vil Deutsche Börse forhøje Tilbudsprisen tilsvarende som krævet i henhold til gældende lovgivning. Eventuelle oplysninger om sådanne køb vil blive offentliggjort gennem Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S og relevante elektroniske medier  hvis og i det omfang en sådan offentliggørelse kræves i henhold til gældende lovgivning.
