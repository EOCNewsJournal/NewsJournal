30555,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/editorial/bond-index-inclusion-is-a-boost-but-can-cause-volatility/article67341677.ece,Editorial. Bond index inclusion is a boost  but can cause volatility,It will have a positive impact on bond yields and support the government borrowing programme,The inclusion of India’s sovereign bonds in JP Morgan’s emerging market index after a prolonged wait points to how India’s financial markets cannot be ignored by foreign investors  especially given the geopolitical compulsions making them move away from Russian sovereign securities. Significantly  this has happened without India becoming a member of Euroclear or other global clearing houses; or giving any immediate tax concessions to global investors.It is good that the government has been working on improving accessibility of Indian bonds by introducing the Fully Automated Route  which has made the inclusion possible. Twenty three government bonds valued at $330 billion are now eligible for inclusion in global indices. The inclusion in JP Morgan’s index is a good first step and the additional inflows due to this will certainly buttress the rupee and the external account  have a positive impact on bond yields and support the government borrowing programme. The bond market in India however did not react much to this development; the 10-year government bond yield hardened slightly on Friday. Main reason for this is that the move was already known to bond markets with foreign investors turning net buyers in Indian sovereign bonds in September. It is due to this reason that Indian government bond yields have stayed stable this month even as bond yields in other regions spiked higher due to the US Fed’s hawkish stance in the recent policy meeting. Also  short-term impact could be less since the bulk of the inflows are expected after a year since the weight for India in the JP Morgan emerging market index will be increased to 10 per cent over 10 months commencing from July 2024.While high projections for potential inflows are being given by some brokerages  we need to wait for a year to see if these projections are met. Active funds benchmarked against the index are free to buy Indian government bonds to the extent they want. With FPIs utilising only 24 per cent of the limit in Indian sovereign bonds currently  it is apparent that they are likely to go slow in ploughing money into G-secs. The high yields in sovereign bonds of advanced economies  especially the US  combined with the high inflation and fiscal deficit of India is likely to influence their investment decisions.Also  while passive fund inflows can come next year  sustainable inflows every year is possible only if the emerging market funds keep getting investments. On the other hand  if these funds witness outflows due to geopolitical factors  central bank actions and so on  Indian government bonds will also face selling pressure  pushing yields higher. The RBI will have to be ready with its arsenal to defend the rupee and bonds  in such conditions. Along with trying to get inclusion in global bond indices  the Centre should also focus on increasing participation of domestic retail investors in G-secs  so that they can counter any future volatility caused by foreign investors.,neutral,0.02,0.87,0.11,mixed,0.36,0.25,0.39,True,English,"['Bond index inclusion', 'Editorial', 'boost', 'volatility', 'JP Morgan emerging market index', 'Twenty three government bonds', 'other global clearing houses', 'Indian government bond yields', 'prolonged wait points', 'immediate tax concessions', 'Fully Automated Route', 'good first step', 'government borrowing programme', 'recent policy meeting', 'central bank actions', 'emerging market funds', 'Russian sovereign securities', '10-year government bond', 'Indian government bonds', 'domestic retail investors', 'Indian sovereign bonds', 'passive fund inflows', 'global bond indices', 'bond market', 'Indian bonds', 'global indices', 'global investors', 'other regions', 'other hand', 'foreign investors', 'high yields', 'financial markets', 'geopolitical compulsions', 'additional inflows', 'external account', 'positive impact', 'net buyers', 'short-term impact', '10 per cent', 'potential inflows', 'Active funds', '24 per cent', 'advanced economies', 'high inflation', 'fiscal deficit', 'investment decisions', 'sustainable inflows', 'geopolitical factors', 'selling pressure', 'The RBI', 'increasing participation', 'future volatility', 'Main reason', 'US Fed', 'high projections', 'inclusion', 'member', 'Euroclear', 'accessibility', 'rupee', 'development', 'Friday', 'move', 'September', 'stance', 'bulk', 'weight', '10 months', 'July', 'brokerages', 'extent', 'FPIs', 'limit', 'money', 'G-secs', 'investments', 'outflows', 'arsenal', 'conditions', 'Centre']",2023-09-24,2023-09-25,thehindubusinessline.com

Its revenues last year were $32.7bn.“We believe a US primary listing will bring increased commercial  operational and acquisition opportunities for our business  further accelerating our successful integrated solutions strategy and delivering even higher levels of profitability  returns and cash for our shareholders ” noted the company on Monday.CRH  whose chief executive is Albert Manifold  has previously noted that the US is expected to be a key driver of future growth for the building materials giant.“Today marks an important milestone in CRH’s development which will enable us to fully participate in the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead for our business ” he said.Billionaire investors George Soros and Seth Klarman established positions in CRH during the summer. More than two dozen hedge funds disclosed new or increased positions in CRH’s American Deposit Receipts on the Nasdaq in recent months.CRH’s departure has heightened concerns for Euronext  the owner of the Dublin bourse.

30562,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/09/25/how-to-save-the-irish-stock-exchange/,How to save the Irish Stock Exchange,A focus on small cap IPOs could help Euronext Dublin to reinvent itself and provide a platform to build the next Flutter  Kingspan or CRH,The Irish Stock Exchange (now Euronext Dublin) in its heyday  with then minister for finance Charlie McCreevy and chairman of Telecom Éireann (now Eir) Ray MacSharry: In the past 20 years  floating small-cap companies in Ireland has become very difficult. Photograph: Frank MillerThere has been a lot of negative talk recently about the future of the Irish Stock Exchange. Officials in the Department of Finance even wrote a memo for Minister for Finance Michael McGrath  speculating that the Irish exchange could be entering a “phase of long-term decline”.In this newspaper last month  Arthur Beesley reported that these concerns were based on what could happen when large companies like CRH (whose shares ceased trading in Dublin this week)  Flutter or Kingspan left the Dublin exchange. In my opinion  the Irish stock market is entering a phase of terminal decline  unless it can replace these large-cap departures with a host of new  small capital IPOs (initial public offerings of shares).Unfortunately  in the past 20 years  floating small-cap companies in Ireland has become extremely difficult.Most people  including myself  have listed our companies on the London Stock Exchange  where there is a vibrant IPO market for small and medium-sized companies. I work with a range of legal and financial advisers in London. What I see is an adviser infrastructure that is open to small-cap IPOs. There are dozens of brokers and advisers who are enthusiastic for these investment opportunities.READ MORE[ CRH bids farewell to Irish stock market ][ Smurfit Kappa’s Irish stock market exit compounds existential crisis ]This positive atmosphere is why London is a world leader for the listing of small-cap companies. There is no reason why Ireland shouldn’t try to emulate that success.Not so many years ago  bookmaker Paddy Power  which later became Flutter  and Kingspan floated as small-cap companies in Dublin  as did other leading Irish businesses  including Ryanair. These successful stock market listings allowed these companies to grow extremely rapidly.A vibrant stock exchange is a critical element for a country’s success. Many would argue that the economic success of the United States has a lot to do with its vibrant stock exchange and positive investment environment. Publicly listed companies historically generate more wealth for investors but they also tend to stay more grounded in the country they list in.The senior management team and much of the central business activity tends to remain in the country of IPO. If it is no longer possible to IPO small-cap companies in Ireland then that will have lasting knock-on implications for our long-term indigenous job creation.Many people will be surprised to know that the Irish Stock Exchange is already the world leader in listed bond investments. Euronext Dublin (as the Irish exchange is now known) is the number-one bond- and fund-listing location globally  with more than 40 000 bond securities and 4 600 fund securities all listed on the Dublin exchange. This activity is hugely impressive.There is no reason why this success could not be replicated to turn Dublin into a European leader for SME IPOs.With the right steps  up to 15 IPOs could be done in Dublin every year. I have launched four successful IPOs in the past nine years: Fastnet Oil & Gas plc  Amryt Pharma plc  Open Orphan (now hVIVO plc) and Poolbeg Pharma plc. I am about to launch a fifth IPO in 2023 called European Green Metals  a natural resource company focused on the production of critical metals in Europe for the energy transition economy.[ Global stocks advance as investors see interest rates nearing a peak ][ Smurfit Kappa eyes Irish market exit amid $19bn merger talks ]It is a very exciting venture. Unfortunately  this latest IPO  like those I have been involved in previously  is being run out of London. I would be very interested in doing this IPO work out of Dublin  as would many others.Action needs to be taken to create an environment in Dublin similar to that in London. We need to create a pipeline of new IPOs on the Irish exchange. By not taking advantage of the opportunities offered by small capital IPOs  Ireland Inc is missing a real trick. The officials in the Department of Finance could get the ball rolling by looking at any regulatory blockages that are preventing the Dublin exchange from becoming a leader in small-cap IPOs.Dublin used to have the type of infrastructure needed. Twenty years ago  the likes of Merrion  Dolmen  NCB  Goodbody  Davy and the other stockbrokers were actively encouraging small-cap IPOs. We need to get back there. In the short term  the main stockbroking firms could more actively introduce their high-net-worth and family office investors to small-cap IPOs. They offer high growth and the prospect of returns well in excess of what large-cap companies provide.There are downsides. Some of these small-cap IPOs won’t be as successful as expected and people risk losing part of their investment. Hence my view is that investing in small-cap IPOs is not something that retail investors should be getting involved in. But I’m certain that the vibrant Irish high-net-worth and family office ecosystem would love the opportunity to invest.In my four successful IPOs  virtually all of the funds raised came from investors in London. Irish investors are not getting the opportunities in these IPOs. The investment community in Dublin needs to work together to make sure that Irish investors aren’t losing out. There is no reason why we could not have a vibrant IPO market alongside the current business in listings for bonds and debt. Having a pipeline of IPOs is also the best way to build the next Flutter  Kingspan or CRH. That’s how we save the Irish Stock Exchange.Cathal Friel is co- founder and chairman of both Poolbeg Pharma plc and hVIVO plc (formerly Open Orphan),neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,mixed,0.33,0.22,0.46,True,English,"['Irish Stock Exchange', 'long-term indigenous job creation', 'successful stock market listings', 'other leading Irish businesses', 'Irish stock market exit', 'The Irish Stock Exchange', 'new, small capital IPOs', 'Irish market exit', 'initial public offerings', 'senior management team', 'natural resource company', 'energy transition economy', '$19bn merger talks', 'main stockbroking firms', 'vibrant stock exchange', 'four successful IPOs', 'Amryt Pharma plc', 'Poolbeg Pharma plc', 'vibrant IPO market', 'central business activity', 'past nine years', 'family office investors', 'Finance Michael McGrath', 'London Stock Exchange', 'floating small-cap companies', 'positive investment environment', 'Irish exchange', 'new IPOs', 'long-term decline', 'other stockbrokers', 'past 20 years', 'positive atmosphere', 'Gas plc', 'hVIVO plc', 'small-cap IPOs', 'SME IPOs', 'to 15 IPOs', 'Charlie McCreevy', 'Telecom Éireann', 'Ray MacSharry', 'Frank Miller', 'negative talk', 'Arthur Beesley', 'Dublin exchange', 'terminal decline', 'large-cap departures', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'existential crisis', 'Paddy Power', 'critical element', 'United States', 'lasting knock', 'bond investments', 'fund-listing location', '40,000 bond securities', '4,600 fund securities', 'right steps', 'Fastnet Oil', 'Open Orphan', 'critical metals', 'Global stocks', 'interest rates', 'exciting venture', 'many others', 'real trick', 'regulatory blockages', 'short term', 'high growth', 'large companies', 'medium-sized companies', 'large-cap companies', 'fifth IPO', 'latest IPO', 'world leader', 'European leader', 'Most people', 'Many people', 'financial advisers', 'adviser infrastructure', 'investment opportunities', 'Euronext Dublin', 'economic success', 'Ireland Inc', 'heyday', 'chairman', 'Eir', 'Photograph', 'lot', 'future', 'Officials', 'Department', 'memo', 'Minister', 'phase', 'newspaper', 'concerns', 'CRH', 'shares', 'Flutter', 'Kingspan', 'opinion', 'host', 'range', 'legal', 'dozens', 'READ', 'farewell', 'reason', 'bookmaker', 'Ryanair', 'country', 'wealth', 'implications', 'production', 'peak', 'Action', 'pipeline', 'advantage', 'ball', 'type', 'likes', 'Merrion', 'Dolmen', 'NCB', 'Goodbody', 'Davy', 'high-net', 'worth', 'prospect', 'returns', 'excess', 'downsides', 'view', 'something']",2023-09-25,2023-09-25,irishtimes.com
