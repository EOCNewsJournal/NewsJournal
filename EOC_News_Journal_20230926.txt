The name of the company has not been disclosed.The amount of unblocked funds totaled over $33 million  which included foreign bonds and shares  depositary receipts  structured notes and cash  the co-head of Delcredere's sanctions practice  Andrey Timchyuk  revealed.""Some of the clients have EU residence permits and accounts in European financial institutions. Permission from the Belgian Treasury was obtained to transfer all assets to accounts in a Cypriot broker. Further disposal of assets will depend on the will of the management company and its clients "" he said.Private investors used to hold funds within European clearing houses through Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD). Both Euroclear and Clearstream ceased transactions with NSD and blocked its accounts amid sanctions against the Russian depository in mid-2022. This deprived Russian investors of the opportunity to retrieve their assets. In January  the Bank of Russia estimated that Russian assets stuck at Euroclear and Clearstream amounted to about 5.7 trillion rubles ($59.2 billion).Euroclear had previously authorized the release of frozen funds owned by Russian investors but only under individual requests. The latest such case took place last week when the Belgian regulator unlocked assets held in Euroclear and allowed the transfer of the money to a foreign bank account.According to Timchyuk  class action lawsuits are more difficult to win due to a large number of participants.""One of the requirements [for obtaining a license] is that the assets should remain within the EU. It is much easier for one individual to open an account in the EU than to do this for all participants in a collective application "" he noted.So far  most collective claims by Russian investors were either rejected or are still pending a decision from EU regulators. However  experts are optimistic about the investors' chances of recovering their funds following the latest precedent saying that with the right approach group applications now have more chances for success.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section",neutral,0.03,0.74,0.23,mixed,0.11,0.24,0.65,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU state', 'precedent-setting decision', 'Kommersant', 'right approach group applications', 'large Russian management company', 'class action lawsuit', 'European financial institutions', 'European clearing houses', 'Kommersant business daily', 'National Settlement Depository', 'most collective claims', 'The Belgian Treasury', 'first time funds', 'EU residence permits', 'foreign bank account', 'large number', 'European Union', 'Russian depository', 'foreign bonds', 'business section', 'largest depository', 'collective application', 'Belgian regulator', 'Russian investors', 'attorney association', 'depositary receipts', 'Cypriot broker', 'Further disposal', '5.7 trillion rubles', 'individual requests', 'one individual', 'Private investors', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'unblocked funds', 'sanctions practice', 'frozen funds', 'EU regulators', 'Russian assets', 'early January', 'Andrey Timchyuk', 'latest precedent', 'frozen assets', '250 investors', 'part', 'Moscow', 'Monday', 'Delcredere', 'permission', 'Euroclear', 'license', 'outlet', 'behalf', 'individuals', 'entities', 'name', 'amount', 'shares', 'notes', 'cash', 'head', 'clients', 'accounts', 'will', 'NSD', 'Clearstream', 'transactions', 'mid-20', 'opportunity', 'release', 'case', 'place', 'transfer', 'money', 'requirements', 'decision', 'experts', 'chances', 'success', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-09-25,2023-09-26,rt.com

Typically  overseas investments into instruments featuring on the gauge begin around nine months after the index inclusion is announced.If included  India could be given a 0.8% weightage in the Bloomberg Barclays EM index  which has assets under management (AUM) of around $3 trillion. Such a weightage would imply overseas funds worth around $24 billion flowing into India's government bond market.""The push from the investors' side is for the review to take place in early October.

30567,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/583532-eu-russia-frozen-assets-release/,EU state makes precedent-setting decision on frozen Russian assets – Kommersant,Russian investors have recovered $33 million of frozen funds from Euroclear under class action  Kommersant says Read Full Article at RT.com,"This marks the first time funds have been released following a class action lawsuitA group of Russian investors have managed to recover funds blocked in the European Union as part of Ukraine-related sanctions on Moscow  Kommersant business daily reported on Monday  citing the attorney association Delcredere.The Belgian Treasury issued permission to unlock frozen assets at the EU's largest depository  Euroclear  setting a precedent for granting such a license based on a collective application  the outlet wrote.The claim was submitted by a large Russian management company in early January this year on behalf of a group of more than 250 investors  including individuals and entities. The name of the company has not been disclosed.The amount of unblocked funds totaled over $33 million  which included foreign bonds and shares  depositary receipts  structured notes and cash  the co-head of Delcredere's sanctions practice  Andrey Timchyuk  revealed.""Some of the clients have EU residence permits and accounts in European financial institutions. Permission from the Belgian Treasury was obtained to transfer all assets to accounts in a Cypriot broker. Further disposal of assets will depend on the will of the management company and its clients "" he said.Private investors used to hold funds within European clearing houses through Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD). Both Euroclear and Clearstream ceased transactions with NSD and blocked its accounts amid sanctions against the Russian depository in mid-2022. This deprived Russian investors of the opportunity to retrieve their assets. In January  the Bank of Russia estimated that Russian assets stuck at Euroclear and Clearstream amounted to about 5.7 trillion rubles ($59.2 billion).Euroclear had previously authorized the release of frozen funds owned by Russian investors but only under individual requests. The latest such case took place last week when the Belgian regulator unlocked assets held in Euroclear and allowed the transfer of the money to a foreign bank account.According to Timchyuk  class action lawsuits are more difficult to win due to a large number of participants.""One of the requirements [for obtaining a license] is that the assets should remain within the EU. It is much easier for one individual to open an account in the EU than to do this for all participants in a collective application "" he noted.So far  most collective claims by Russian investors were either rejected or are still pending a decision from EU regulators. However  experts are optimistic about the investors' chances of recovering their funds following the latest precedent saying that with the right approach group applications now have more chances for success.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section",neutral,0.03,0.74,0.23,mixed,0.11,0.24,0.65,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU state', 'precedent-setting decision', 'Kommersant', 'right approach group applications', 'large Russian management company', 'class action lawsuit', 'European financial institutions', 'European clearing houses', 'Kommersant business daily', 'National Settlement Depository', 'most collective claims', 'The Belgian Treasury', 'first time funds', 'EU residence permits', 'foreign bank account', 'large number', 'European Union', 'Russian depository', 'foreign bonds', 'business section', 'largest depository', 'collective application', 'Belgian regulator', 'Russian investors', 'attorney association', 'depositary receipts', 'Cypriot broker', 'Further disposal', '5.7 trillion rubles', 'individual requests', 'one individual', 'Private investors', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'unblocked funds', 'sanctions practice', 'frozen funds', 'EU regulators', 'Russian assets', 'early January', 'Andrey Timchyuk', 'latest precedent', 'frozen assets', '250 investors', 'part', 'Moscow', 'Monday', 'Delcredere', 'permission', 'Euroclear', 'license', 'outlet', 'behalf', 'individuals', 'entities', 'name', 'amount', 'shares', 'notes', 'cash', 'head', 'clients', 'accounts', 'will', 'NSD', 'Clearstream', 'transactions', 'mid-20', 'opportunity', 'release', 'case', 'place', 'transfer', 'money', 'requirements', 'decision', 'experts', 'chances', 'success', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-09-25,2023-09-26,rt.com

At the hybrid event held at the company's headquarters in Brunnthal near Munich  Germany  the Management gave the more than 100 investors  analysts and journalists present and virtually connected insight into the company's business model  technology and roadmap as well as the implementation of its growth strategy  which is based on the three pillars of regional and technological expansion  acceleration of R&D activities and inorganic growth opportunities. Highlight of the event was the presentation of the prototype HIGH Power platform up to 200 kW and the strategy to expand technology and market leadership with proprietary membrane technology. The focus was also on the next steps in internationalization  which reached an important milestone this year with the opening of its own production facility in India. A tour of the production facility rounded off the program  during which the participants present were able to gain a personal impression and get a detailed explanation on the construction of a fuel cell.Dr Peter Podesser  CEO of SFC Energy:""Clean energy for generations - anytime and anywhere - sums up our conviction. We are not only fuel cell pioneers  we are also thought leaders and forerunners - and profitable. Day in  and day out  we are committed to our pioneering fuel cell technology with passion  enormous dedication  innovative strength  and efficiency. In this way  we are making our contribution on the road to climate neutrality. We are dedicated to environmentally friendly power generation - self-sufficient  reliable  low-noise and without environmentally harmful emissions. This is our corporate DNA as a medium-sized technology provider  which we have been implementing sustainably and responsibly for more than 20 years in the interests of people and the environment. The HIGH Power platform is now the next level of our innovations.""Next innovation steps - prototype HIGH Power platform for fuel cells up to 200 kW and proprietary membrane technologyWith the EFOY methanol fuel cell  launched in 2003  and the EFOY hydrogen fuel cell  which has been on the market since 2020  SFC Energy already covers the needs of low and medium power supply. The aim is to serve the market with more powerful fuel cells - up to 200 kW output - in the future  thus opening up new market segments for the Group. At the Capital Markets Day  the innovative SFC hydrogen fuel cell solution with a nominal power of 50 kW and a modular design of up to 200 kW was presented. Prototype tests are underway and the first customer tests will take place in 2024. The start of series production is planned for the end of 2024.Another important step in securing market and technology leadership is the acquisition of equipment and technologies from Johnson Matthey for the production of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for direct methanol fuel cells. For this purpose  a new development and production facility is being built near Swindon  UK. SFC Energy is thus expanding its core competencies to include membrane technology and will in future be able to produce the key fuel cell components itself. In this way  SFC Energy secures a stable supply chain and significantly increases the value-added share of methanol fuel cells by integrating component production. SFC Energy thus also takes over the upcoming developments of its own membrane technology in order to make processes more efficient and to implement material savings and cost efficiencies.Status and next steps of internationalizationTrue to the motto ""Promised and delivered""  SFC Energy has consistently worked through key focal points of its growth strategy in the current year: with the foundation of the subsidiary SFC Energy India Pvt. Ltd. and the opening of the first production site in Gurgaon  the high-tech center of Delhi in India  SFC Energy has significantly expanded its footprint in the Asian region. The site is not only expected to meet the demand for environmentally friendly and sustainable power generators in the world's most populous country  such as SFC's hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for residential  industrial and government use  but also to act as a springboard for the entire region.SFC has also expanded its presence in the UK with the foundation of the subsidiary SFC Energy UK Ltd. With regard to further expansion  a decision on its own site in the USA will be made in the fourth quarter of 2023. Furthermore  additional capacity expansion is underway with the establishment of a new production site in Romania. With the above steps  SFC Energy will have six production sites on three continents as of 2024 and will be represented worldwide with its own sales and service units as well as through established partnerships.Strong operating performance - significant growth and margin expansionThe first half of the year was characterized by strong operating figures. The significant organic sales growth of 49.5% to EUR 57.1 million compared to the previous year (EUR 38.2 million) together with an expansion of margins (EBITDA margin in H1/2023 increased to 12.8% after 8.2% in H1/2022) underlines the increasing market penetration of SFC Energy's products  both internationally and technologically.""We look back on the best half-year in the Company's history and are confident that we will achieve the targets we have set ourselves for 2023. We have again succeeded in achieving dynamic organic growth while significantly expanding our margins. This is also a key element of our differentiation in the sector: we combine ambitious growth targets with a continuous and sustainable improvement in earnings. We intend to continue on this path  which  in our opinion  we are the only company in the industry to pursue consistently so far "" Daniel Saxena  CFO of SFC Energy  summarized his remarks.The current year is characterized by numerous incoming orders from different markets and regions. These include major orders in the area of public safety with a volume of more than EUR 33 million for fuel cells to supply energy in India as well as large orders from Poland  the Netherlands  the USA and Canada. In cooperation with Deutsche Telekom  the use of a mobile hydrogen fuel cell from SFC Energy as a power source for temporary mobile communications during a music festival was tested for the first time with SFC Energy's H 2 Genset. Demand in the Clean Energy and Clean Power Management segments continues to be dynamic.Implementation of growth strategy - focus on further M&A issuesDuring the event  the Management Board reaffirmed the forecast for fiscal year 2023  which was specified in the half-year report and now envisages consolidated sales of between EUR 107 million and EUR 111 million in 2023. For adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT  the Management Board expects a range of EUR 10.5 million to EUR 14.1 million and EUR 5.0 million to EUR 8.6 million  respectively.Fuel cell technology has established itself on the market. As a technology leader and first mover  SFC is benefiting from this in particular. ""With our technologies  we hold a key to making energy supply more ecological  more environmentally friendly and still reliable. We will continue this development and further accelerate it with targeted investments and acquisitions. The focus will be on companies that give us access to markets that have so far been untapped or underdeveloped. However  we are also keeping our eyes open along our value chain for complementary technologies. Our know-how and experience in the development and integration of new technologies provide us with synergies and competitive advantages. This offers SFC Energy enormous opportunities to secure further market shares  to drive innovation and to accelerate its growth course in the long term "" Dr Peter Podesser rounded off his remarks.For more information on SFC Energy's Clean Energy and Clean Power Management solutions  visit sfc.com.About SFC Energy AGSFC Energy AG is a leading provider of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions.

Deliveries will commence immediately.Dipal Patel  Chief Commercial Officer of Valneva commented  “We are excited to continue our long-term relationship with the DoD. The U.S. military has trusted IXIARO® for over ten years to help protect military personnel  their families  civilian government service personnel  and government contractors from this potentially deadly disease.”IXIARO® is the only JE vaccine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  having been developed through a cooperative research and development agreement with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. In the U.S.  Valneva markets and distributes IXIARO® directly to the military and private travel market.About IXIARO®/JESPECT®Valneva’s Japanese encephalitis vaccine is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of the disease for people who travel to  or live in  endemic areas. It has received marketing approval in the U.S.  Europe  Canada  Hong Kong  Singapore  and Israel under the trade name IXIARO® and in Australia and New Zealand where it is marketed as JESPECT®. It is the only vaccine available to the U.S. military for Japanese Encephalitis.

In all other licensed territories  IXIARO®/JESPECT® is indicated for use in persons aged 18 years or more.About Japanese EncephalitisJapanese encephalitis is a deadly infectious disease found mainly in Asia. About 70 000 cases of JE are estimated to occur in Asia each year  although the actual number of cases is likely much higher due to underreporting in rural areas. JE is fatal in approximately 30 percent of those who show symptoms  and leaves half of survivors with permanent brain damage. The disease is endemic in Southeast Asia  India and China  a region with a population of more than three billion. In 2005  JE killed more than 1 200 children in only one month during an epidemic outbreak in Uttar Pradesh  India  and Nepal.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases.

Photograph: Frank MillerThere has been a lot of negative talk recently about the future of the Irish Stock Exchange. Officials in the Department of Finance even wrote a memo for Minister for Finance Michael McGrath  speculating that the Irish exchange could be entering a “phase of long-term decline”.In this newspaper last month  Arthur Beesley reported that these concerns were based on what could happen when large companies like CRH (whose shares ceased trading in Dublin this week)  Flutter or Kingspan left the Dublin exchange. In my opinion  the Irish stock market is entering a phase of terminal decline  unless it can replace these large-cap departures with a host of new  small capital IPOs (initial public offerings of shares).Unfortunately  in the past 20 years  floating small-cap companies in Ireland has become extremely difficult.Most people  including myself  have listed our companies on the London Stock Exchange  where there is a vibrant IPO market for small and medium-sized companies. I work with a range of legal and financial advisers in London. What I see is an adviser infrastructure that is open to small-cap IPOs. There are dozens of brokers and advisers who are enthusiastic for these investment opportunities.READ MORE[ CRH bids farewell to Irish stock market ][ Smurfit Kappa’s Irish stock market exit compounds existential crisis ]This positive atmosphere is why London is a world leader for the listing of small-cap companies. There is no reason why Ireland shouldn’t try to emulate that success.Not so many years ago  bookmaker Paddy Power  which later became Flutter  and Kingspan floated as small-cap companies in Dublin  as did other leading Irish businesses  including Ryanair. These successful stock market listings allowed these companies to grow extremely rapidly.A vibrant stock exchange is a critical element for a country’s success. Many would argue that the economic success of the United States has a lot to do with its vibrant stock exchange and positive investment environment. Publicly listed companies historically generate more wealth for investors but they also tend to stay more grounded in the country they list in.The senior management team and much of the central business activity tends to remain in the country of IPO. If it is no longer possible to IPO small-cap companies in Ireland then that will have lasting knock-on implications for our long-term indigenous job creation.Many people will be surprised to know that the Irish Stock Exchange is already the world leader in listed bond investments. Euronext Dublin (as the Irish exchange is now known) is the number-one bond- and fund-listing location globally  with more than 40 000 bond securities and 4 600 fund securities all listed on the Dublin exchange. This activity is hugely impressive.There is no reason why this success could not be replicated to turn Dublin into a European leader for SME IPOs.With the right steps  up to 15 IPOs could be done in Dublin every year. I have launched four successful IPOs in the past nine years: Fastnet Oil & Gas plc  Amryt Pharma plc  Open Orphan (now hVIVO plc) and Poolbeg Pharma plc. I am about to launch a fifth IPO in 2023 called European Green Metals  a natural resource company focused on the production of critical metals in Europe for the energy transition economy.[ Global stocks advance as investors see interest rates nearing a peak ][ Smurfit Kappa eyes Irish market exit amid $19bn merger talks ]It is a very exciting venture. Unfortunately  this latest IPO  like those I have been involved in previously  is being run out of London. I would be very interested in doing this IPO work out of Dublin  as would many others.Action needs to be taken to create an environment in Dublin similar to that in London. We need to create a pipeline of new IPOs on the Irish exchange. By not taking advantage of the opportunities offered by small capital IPOs  Ireland Inc is missing a real trick. The officials in the Department of Finance could get the ball rolling by looking at any regulatory blockages that are preventing the Dublin exchange from becoming a leader in small-cap IPOs.Dublin used to have the type of infrastructure needed. Twenty years ago  the likes of Merrion  Dolmen  NCB  Goodbody  Davy and the other stockbrokers were actively encouraging small-cap IPOs. We need to get back there. In the short term  the main stockbroking firms could more actively introduce their high-net-worth and family office investors to small-cap IPOs. They offer high growth and the prospect of returns well in excess of what large-cap companies provide.There are downsides. Some of these small-cap IPOs won’t be as successful as expected and people risk losing part of their investment. Hence my view is that investing in small-cap IPOs is not something that retail investors should be getting involved in. But I’m certain that the vibrant Irish high-net-worth and family office ecosystem would love the opportunity to invest.In my four successful IPOs  virtually all of the funds raised came from investors in London. Irish investors are not getting the opportunities in these IPOs. The investment community in Dublin needs to work together to make sure that Irish investors aren’t losing out. There is no reason why we could not have a vibrant IPO market alongside the current business in listings for bonds and debt. Having a pipeline of IPOs is also the best way to build the next Flutter  Kingspan or CRH. That’s how we save the Irish Stock Exchange.Cathal Friel is co- founder and chairman of both Poolbeg Pharma plc and hVIVO plc (formerly Open Orphan),neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,mixed,0.33,0.22,0.46,True,English,"['Irish Stock Exchange', 'long-term indigenous job creation', 'successful stock market listings', 'other leading Irish businesses', 'Irish stock market exit', 'The Irish Stock Exchange', 'new, small capital IPOs', 'Irish market exit', 'initial public offerings', 'senior management team', 'natural resource company', 'energy transition economy', '$19bn merger talks', 'main stockbroking firms', 'vibrant stock exchange', 'four successful IPOs', 'Amryt Pharma plc', 'Poolbeg Pharma plc', 'vibrant IPO market', 'central business activity', 'past nine years', 'family office investors', 'Finance Michael McGrath', 'London Stock Exchange', 'floating small-cap companies', 'positive investment environment', 'Irish exchange', 'new IPOs', 'long-term decline', 'other stockbrokers', 'past 20 years', 'positive atmosphere', 'Gas plc', 'hVIVO plc', 'small-cap IPOs', 'SME IPOs', 'to 15 IPOs', 'Charlie McCreevy', 'Telecom Éireann', 'Ray MacSharry', 'Frank Miller', 'negative talk', 'Arthur Beesley', 'Dublin exchange', 'terminal decline', 'large-cap departures', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'existential crisis', 'Paddy Power', 'critical element', 'United States', 'lasting knock', 'bond investments', 'fund-listing location', '40,000 bond securities', '4,600 fund securities', 'right steps', 'Fastnet Oil', 'Open Orphan', 'critical metals', 'Global stocks', 'interest rates', 'exciting venture', 'many others', 'real trick', 'regulatory blockages', 'short term', 'high growth', 'large companies', 'medium-sized companies', 'large-cap companies', 'fifth IPO', 'latest IPO', 'world leader', 'European leader', 'Most people', 'Many people', 'financial advisers', 'adviser infrastructure', 'investment opportunities', 'Euronext Dublin', 'economic success', 'Ireland Inc', 'heyday', 'chairman', 'Eir', 'Photograph', 'lot', 'future', 'Officials', 'Department', 'memo', 'Minister', 'phase', 'newspaper', 'concerns', 'CRH', 'shares', 'Flutter', 'Kingspan', 'opinion', 'host', 'range', 'legal', 'dozens', 'READ', 'farewell', 'reason', 'bookmaker', 'Ryanair', 'country', 'wealth', 'implications', 'production', 'peak', 'Action', 'pipeline', 'advantage', 'ball', 'type', 'likes', 'Merrion', 'Dolmen', 'NCB', 'Goodbody', 'Davy', 'high-net', 'worth', 'prospect', 'returns', 'excess', 'downsides', 'view', 'something']",2023-09-25,2023-09-26,irishtimes.com

Its revenues last year were $32.7bn.“We believe a US primary listing will bring increased commercial  operational and acquisition opportunities for our business  further accelerating our successful integrated solutions strategy and delivering even higher levels of profitability  returns and cash for our shareholders ” noted the company on Monday.CRH  whose chief executive is Albert Manifold  has previously noted that the US is expected to be a key driver of future growth for the building materials giant.“Today marks an important milestone in CRH’s development which will enable us to fully participate in the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead for our business ” he said.Billionaire investors George Soros and Seth Klarman established positions in CRH during the summer. More than two dozen hedge funds disclosed new or increased positions in CRH’s American Deposit Receipts on the Nasdaq in recent months.CRH’s departure has heightened concerns for Euronext  the owner of the Dublin bourse. The exchange has seen an exodus of A-listers in the past number of years  including Greencore  DCC  Aryzta and Grafton Group.With CRH now gone  Flutter is also weighing up its future presence on the Dublin exchange as it moves its primary listing to New York later this year or early in 2024.Packaging giant Smurfit Kappa is planning to merge with US-based WestRock and has already noted that if the deal goes ahead  it will also delist from Dublin.Perhaps the exits might slow then  given that most of the Irish remainers have significant exposure to Europe and Ireland  such as insulation maker Kingspan  the banks  hotel group Dalata and Irish Continental.Siobhan Talbot  the chief executive of Glanbia  which generates a significant amount of revenue in the US  said during the summer that the group has no intention of quitting its Dublin listing for the US.,neutral,0.09,0.9,0.01,negative,0.03,0.27,0.71,True,English,"['Paddy Power owner', 'biggest Irish firm', 'CRH exit', 'Dublin exchange', 'successful integrated solutions strategy', 'two dozen hedge funds', 'Packaging giant Smurfit Kappa', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'building materials giant', 'American Deposit Receipts', 'broader investor base', 'Paddy Power owner', 'biggest Irish company', 'significant growth opportunities', 'US primary listing', 'investor presentation', 'acquisition opportunities', 'future growth', 'Irish remainers', 'Irish Continental', 'significant exposure', 'significant amount', 'North America', 'commercial, operational', 'higher levels', 'chief executive', 'Albert Manifold', 'key driver', 'important milestone', 'Billionaire investors', 'George Soros', 'Seth Klarman', 'recent months', 'past number', 'future presence', 'US-based WestRock', 'insulation maker', 'Siobhan Talbot', 'Dublin listing', 'group earnings', 'Grafton Group', 'hotel group', 'US market', 'Dublin bourse', 'Dublin exchange', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'early trading', 'CRH shares', 'Euronext', 'Monday', 'debut', '75pc', 'interest', 'tax', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'Ebitda', 'revenues', 'increased', 'business', 'profitability', 'returns', 'cash', 'shareholders', 'Today', 'development', 'positions', 'summer', 'More', 'Nasdaq', 'departure', 'concerns', 'exodus', 'A-listers', 'years', 'Greencore', 'DCC', 'Aryzta', 'deal', 'exits', 'Europe', 'Ireland', 'Kingspan', 'banks', 'Dalata', 'Glanbia', 'intention']",2023-09-25,2023-09-26,independent.ie

In the U.S.  Valneva markets and distributes IXIARO® directly to the military and private travel market.About IXIARO®/JESPECT®Valneva’s Japanese encephalitis vaccine is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of the disease for people who travel to  or live in  endemic areas. It has received marketing approval in the U.S.  Europe  Canada  Hong Kong  Singapore  and Israel under the trade name IXIARO® and in Australia and New Zealand where it is marketed as JESPECT®. It is the only vaccine available to the U.S. military for Japanese Encephalitis.

About 70 000 cases of JE are estimated to occur in Asia each year  although the actual number of cases is likely much higher due to underreporting in rural areas. JE is fatal in approximately 30 percent of those who show symptoms  and leaves half of survivors with permanent brain damage. The disease is endemic in Southeast Asia  India and China  a region with a population of more than three billion. In 2005  JE killed more than 1 200 children in only one month during an epidemic outbreak in Uttar Pradesh  India  and Nepal.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases.

Why digital transformation is essential for organizations that want to cut through new levels of data complexity  mitigate evolving risks  and comply with the ever-changing regulatory environment.Globally  multinational companies are already trying to make sense of the more than 600 different pieces of ESG regulation that are currently in play. This paper is released ahead of expected moves by regulators in the European Union (EU)  Japan  the UK  the US  and other countries that are actively considering the implementation of new mandatory disclosure requirements  as part of broader efforts to align reporting comparability and transparency for investors.While the EU is taking a leading role in implementing ESG reporting requirements  with policies including the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) – which mandates ESG disclosure for asset managers across the 27-nation bloc – Wolters Kluwer experts acknowledge that other regulatory reporting requirements are poised to follow suit.

This shift is creating a true sea change in the complexity of corporate reporting  which cannot be addressed with manual processes or legacy technologies alone. There will undoubtedly be regional nuance and points of difference  but most significant regulatory frameworks will be complex and robust. This new reality will require smart  agile data management solutions. The businesses that digitally transform the way they collect  report  analyze  and assure the accuracy of their financial and ESG data and reporting will create a distinct competitive advantage.”Wolters Kluwer established its CP & ESG division in March 2023 to meet the growing demand from corporations and banks for integrated financial  operational  and ESG performance management and reporting solutions.

Photo: Aidan CrawleyRyanair boss Michael O’Leary has said that the airline is considering a move to the Brussels stock exchange  according to a report in the Sunday Times.The airline’s group chief executive said that the high level of stamp duty on share trading here was a factor in any potential move away from the Irish Stock Exchange.Mr O’Leary also said that he felt that Euronext Dublin was still too closely aligned to the London Stock Exchange’s governance rules  pointing to “simpler” regulation on other European exchanges.“There is no reason why we should be in Dublin  rather than Brussels ” he told the Sunday Times  calling for changes to be made at both Euronext and government level.However  he said the airline remained committed to the Irish Stock Exchange at present. There are reportedly no formal plans to review the listing here.A number of other large Irish companies have also announced their intentions to cease trading on the Euronext Dublin exchange.This includes building materials giant CRH.Shares in the group will be delisted from Euronext Dublin today.Smurfit Kappa confirmed earlier this month that it will merge with US company WestRock  with shares of the combined group set to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.Smurfit Kappa said it will delist from Euronext Dublin following the merger.Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment said last month that it is still assessing its presence on the Irish stock exchange as it advances plans for a US listing.Earlier this week  Ryanair also announced that it will cut its winter schedule at Dublin Airport  blaming rising airport passenger charges and the capital expenditure programme for the move.The airline has cancelled 17 routes and says it has moved its entire Dublin-based fleet of 19 aircraft  which it says burns 16pc less fuel  to alternative EU airports that “incentivise growth and low-emission aircraft”.The cuts will mean loss of connections to cities in Italy and Germany  as well as eastern Europe.The operatior  DAA  has rejected the airline's suggestion that charges at Dublin Airport will rise by 45pc.The DAA said that charges had been set by the aviation regulator  the IAA  adding that these charges were anticipated to rise by 6pc next year.,neutral,0.05,0.95,0.01,negative,0.01,0.25,0.73,True,English,"['Michael O’Leary', 'Ryanair', 'listing', 'Brussels', 'Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary', 'building materials giant CRH', 'other large Irish companies', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'rising airport passenger charges', 'Mr O’Leary', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'other European exchanges', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Paddy Power owner', 'capital expenditure programme', 'entire Dublin-based fleet', '16pc less fuel', 'alternative EU airports', 'US company WestRock', 'Brussels stock exchange', 'group chief executive', 'Euronext Dublin exchange', 'Ryanair boss', 'Dublin Airport', 'Sunday Times', 'Aidan Crawley', 'high level', 'stamp duty', 'governance rules', 'simpler” regulation', 'government level', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'winter schedule', 'eastern Europe', 'aviation regulator', 'US listing', 'share trading', 'formal plans', 'low-emission aircraft', 'The DAA', 'potential move', '19 aircraft', 'airline', 'Photo', 'report', 'factor', 'reason', 'present', 'number', 'intentions', 'Shares', 'merger', 'presence', '17 routes', 'growth', 'cuts', 'loss', 'connections', 'cities', 'Italy', 'Germany', 'operatior', 'suggestion', '45pc', 'IAA']",2023-09-25,2023-09-26,independent.ie

The simple recommended dose of 50 IU/kg is intended for all patients and for different clinical scenarios.Brian FoardExecutive Vice President  Global Head of Specialty Care ad interim  Sanofi“The approval of ALTUVIIIO in Japan and Taiwan represents amajor step forward forpeople living with hemophilia Ain those countries. The high-sustained factor activity levels will enable patients and physicians to reimagine living with hemophilia.ALTUVIIIO is a testament to Sanofi’s promise to deliver first-in-class best-in-class therapies that can redefine the treatment paradigm and transform the standard of care for people around the world living with hemophilia.”Hemophilia A is a rare  lifelong condition in which the ability of a person’s blood to clot properly is impaired  leading to excessive bleeds and spontaneous bleeds into joints that can result in joint damage and chronic pain  and potentially impact quality of life. The severity of hemophilia is determined by the level of clotting factor activity in a person’s blood  and there is a negative correlation between risk of bleeding and factor activity levels.The MHLW approval is based on positive data from patients with severe hemophilia A  including the pivotal XTEND-1 trial in adults and adolescents and data from the XTEND-Kids trial in children under 12 years of age. In the XTEND-1 study  once-weekly ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) met the primary endpoint  providing significant bleed protection for people with severe hemophilia A with a mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.52 - 0.97) and a median ABR of 0.00 (Q1  Q3: 0.00  1.04). ALTUVIIIO met the key secondary endpoint with a significant reduction of 77% in ABR versus prior factor VIII prophylaxis based on an intra-patient comparison (95% CI: 58%  87%).Data from XTEND-Kids  showed that children younger than 12 years of age receiving once-weekly ALTUVIIIO (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks (n=73) experienced a mean ABR of 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4 - 0.9) and a median ABR of 0 (Q1  Q3: 0.0 - 1.0). Safety results were consistent with data from the XTEND-1 trial.Across these studies  ALTUVIIIO has an established safety profile and there were no reports of factor VIII inhibitor development  although inhibitor formation is possible following administration of ALTUVIIIO. The most common side effects (>10%) of ALTUVIIIO are headache and arthralgia.ALTUVIIIO was first approved in February 2023 by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA previously granted Breakthrough Therapy designation in May 2022 — the first factor VIII therapy to receive this designation — Fast Track designation in February 2021  and Orphan Drug designation in 2017. The European Commission granted Orphan Drug designation in June 2019  and the European Medicines Agency accepted the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for efanesoctocog alfa in May 2023.AboutALTUVIIIO®ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein] is a first-in-class high-sustained factor VIII therapy that is designed to extend protection from bleeds with once-weekly prophylactic dosing for adults and children with hemophilia A. In adults and adolescents  ALTUVIIIO has a 3- to 4-fold longer half-life relative to standard and extended half-life factor VIII products  providing high-sustained factor activity levels within normal to near-normal range for most of the week  allowing for once-weekly administration. ALTUVIIIO is the first factor VIII therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which imposes a half-life limitation on earlier generation factor VIII therapies. ALTUVIIIO builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN polypeptides to extend its time in circulation.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialization of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®.

This means Japanese physicians and their patients will be the first to have choice of two new targeted therapies to treat gMG from one company  delivering unique optionality and versatility.Combined with UCB's highly regarded team of Japanese medical and scientific experts  and the company's long-established heritage in neurology  UCB has an opportunity to deliver individualized and transformational patient value for adult patients in Japan living with gMG.""With the approval in Japan of zilucoplan and rozanolixizumab  we are very proud and excited to expand our support to the gMG community and to offer new and additional choices allowing treatment to be tailored according to patient needs.' said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. ""I am confident that UCB will be the only company able to deliver a portfolio of two targeted therapies with different mechanisms of action and the experience to provide truly individualized transformational patient value in managing this often-debilitating rare disease  both at home and in the healthcare setting.""Today's announcement marks the first approval worldwide of zilucoplan  the first once-daily subcutaneous (SC)  targeted peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) and the only gMG target therapy for self-administration by adult patients with AChR antibody-positive gMG.4 In September 2023  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion recommending granting marketing authorization for zilucoplan in the European Union (EU) as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.5 A final decision on approval in the EU is expected before the end of the year  in line with the EMA's standard review timeline.As a C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted dual mechanism of action.4 Benefits of SC self-injection can include reduced traveling time to and from hospitals  decreased interference with work obligations  and increased independence. Unlike monoclonal antibody C5 inhibitors  as a peptide  zilucoplan can be used concomitantly with intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange  without the need for supplemental dosing.4The Japanese MHLW approval of rozanolixizumab  for treatment of adults with generalized Myasthenia Gravis (only for patients who inadequately respond to steroids or other immunosuppressants)1 is the second approval worldwide for this medicine  following approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2023 for the treatment of gMG in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive.6 Rozanolixizumab injection by subcutaneous infusion is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG.7""With the approval of these two new medicines  we are very happy to take an additional step forward in contributing to gMG community - a new area for UCB in Japan""  explained Kanako Kikuchi  Head of Neurology and Country Operations  UCB Japan. ""Developing and providing solutions for rare diseases  for which treatment options are often limited  is a very important commitment for our UCB team in Japan. Zilucoplan and rozanolixizumab are an important addition to our portfolio. By providing these two medicines  each with their own mechanism of action  and way of administration  we are excited to support patients and physicians as they strive to manage the symptoms of gMG and to improve quality of life.""Zilucoplan: Supporting dataApproval of zilucoplan in Japan for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients (only for patients who inadequately respond to steroids or other immunosuppressants) is supported by safety and efficacy data from the Phase 3 RAISE study (NCT04115293)  published in The Lancet Neurology in May 2023.4The primary endpoint for the RAISE study was change from baseline to Week 12 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score.4 MG-ADL is a measurement tool that assesses the impact of gMG on daily functions of 8 signs or symptoms that are typically affected in gMG. These include activities such as breathing  talking  swallowing  and being able to rise from a chair.3 Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 3 represents loss of ability to perform that function. A total score ranges from 0 to 24  with the higher scores indicating more impairment.A statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference favoring zilucoplan in comparison to placebo was observed in the MG-ADL total score change from baseline: least squares mean change −4.39 [95% CI -5.28 to -3.50] vs −2.30 [-3.17 to -1.43]  least squares mean difference −2.09 [−3.24 to −0.95]; p=0.0004. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline to Week 12 in QMG  MGC and MG-QoL15r*.4A statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference favoring zilucoplan compared to placebo was observed in the QMG total score change from baseline to Week 12 (p<0.0001)  least squares mean change −6.19 [95% CI −7.29 to −5.08] vs −3.25 [−4.32 to −2.17].4Change from baseline to Week 12 in MGC in comparison to placebo was clinically meaningful and statistically significant. MG-QoL 15r change from baseline to Week 12 compared to placebo was also statistically significant*.4Additionally  improvements in fatigue were observed as an exploratory endpoint. Change from baseline to week 12 in the Neuro-QoL short-form fatigue scale was an exploratory end point  therefore  p value was nominal  not multiplicity controlled.4The most common adverse events (reported in at least 10% of patients treated with zilucoplan within the RAISE study) were injection-site bruising  headache  diarrhea and MG worsening.4*The threshold for clinical meaningfulness for MG-QoL 15r has not been established.Rozanolixizumab: Supporting dataApproval of rozanolixizumab in Japan for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients (only for patients who inadequately respond to steroids or other immunosuppressants) is supported by safety and efficacy data from the pivotal Phase 3 MycarinG study (NCT03971422)  also published in The Lancet Neurology in May 2023.3The primary efficacy endpoint was the comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the MG-ADL total score at Day 43.3Reductions in MG-ADL score from baseline to day 43 were greater in the rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg group (least-squares mean change -3.37 [SE 0·49]) and in the rozanolixizumab 10 mg/kg group (-3.40 [0.49]) than with placebo (-0.78 [0.49]; for 7 mg/kg  least-squares mean difference −2.59 [95% CI −4.09 to −1.25]  p<0.0001; for 10 mg/kg  −2.62 [−3.99 to −1.16]  p<0.0001).3Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline to day 43 in the QMG. The QMG is a 13-item categorical grading system that assesses muscle weakness. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents no weakness and a score of 3 represents severe weakness. A total possible score ranges from 0 to 39  where higher scores indicate more severe impairment. A statistically significant difference favoring rozanolixizumab compared to placebo was observed in the QMG total score change from baseline to day 43 [least squares mean difference -3.48 (95% CI (−5.61 to −1.58)  p<0.0001 for rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg; least-squares mean difference −4.76 (95% CI −6.82 to −2.86)  p<0.0001 for rozanolixizumab 10mg/kg.3The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of patients treated with rozanolixizumab within the MycarinG study) were headache  infections  diarrhea  pyrexia  hypersensitivity reactions  and nausea.3About generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)gMG is a rare autoimmune disease with a global prevalence of 100-350 cases per every 1 million people.8 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including severe muscular weakness that can result in double vision  drooping eyelids  difficulty with swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.9 10In gMG  pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane.11 This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the skeletal muscle and results in a weaker contraction. gMG can occur in any race  gender or age.9 10About the MycarinG study3The MycarinG study (NCT03971422) was a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab in adult patients with gMG  with an ongoing open-label extension.The primary endpoint for the MycarinG study was change in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score at day 43  an eight-item patient-reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities. Additional endpoints include changes in the Myasthenia Gravis composite (MGC) score  the Quantitative MG (QMG) score  patient-reported outcomes at Day 43 and adverse events (AEs).The majority of patients taking part in the MycarinG study opted to enroll in any future extensions to this clinical trial. As a result  UCB is exploring the potential for further extension studies into this treatment.For more information about the trial  visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03971422.About the RAISE study4The RAISE study (NCT04115293) was a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study to confirm the efficacy  safety profile  and tolerability of zilucoplan in adult patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive gMG. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily subcutaneous (SC) injections of 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo for 12 Weeks.The primary endpoint for the RAISE study was change from baseline to Week 12 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score.Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score  the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15 revised (MG-QoL15r) score from baseline to Week 12  time to first rescue therapy  the proportion of patients with minimal symptom expression (MSE) (defined as MG-ADL of 0 or 1 without rescue therapy)  the proportion with a ≥3-point reduction in MG-ADL without rescue therapy and the proportion with a ≥5-point reduction in QMG without rescue therapy  all measured at Week 12. Safety was assessed by the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Patients who completed the RAISE trial had the possibility to enter the open-label extension study  RAISE-XT (NCT04225871).4For more information about the trial visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT04115293.About rozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is a subcutaneous administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.7Rozanolixizumab-noli** was approved by the FDA in June  for the treatment of gMG in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive 12 having been granted Priority Review for its Biologic License Application (BLA). Rozanolixizumab is also under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and Health Canada for the treatment of adults with gMG. Responses from regulatory agencies to these submissions are expected during H2 2023 and H1 2024.***In the U.S.  the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for rozanolixizumab is 'rozanolixizumab-noli' following the FDA's 'Non-proprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance'. This guidance advises that the nonproprietary name designated for originator biological products should be a proper name that is a combination of the core name and a distinguishing suffix that is devoid of meaning and composed of four lowercase letters. This nomenclature only applies in the U.S.About zilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily SC  self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor). As a C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted dual mechanism of action.4In September 2023  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion recommending granting marketing authorization for zilucoplan in the European Union (EU) as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.5 Zilucoplan is also currently under review by the U.S. FDA  the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and Health Canada for the treatment of adults with gMG. Responses from regulatory agencies to these submissions are expected during H2 2023 and H1 2024.For further information  contact UCB:Global Rare Disease CommunicationsJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01jim.baxter@ucb.comUCB Rare Disease Communications (Japan)T +81.03.6864.7650Corporate Communications  Media RelationsLaurent SchotsT+32.2.559.92.64Laurent.schots@ucb.comInvestor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14antje.witte@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

The French government has decided to maintain the VAT rate at 5.5% for initial sales and imports of artworks from countries outside the European Union  proof that the two French Ministers  (Rima Abdul Malak for culture and Bruno Le Maire for the economy) succeeded in making their case against strong headwinds from Brussels.[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/09/image1-Rima-Abdul-Malak-Culture-Bruno-Lemaire-Economy-Finance.jpg ]On the left  Rima Abdul Malak  Minister of CultureOn the right  Bruno Le Maire  Minister of the Economy  Finance and Industrial & Digital Sovereigntycopyright ShutterstockIf they had failed  there was a high risk that VAT would be raised to 20% before 1 January 2025  which would undoubtedly have broken the dynamics of the French art market  now the fourth largest national art market in the world according to Artprice.com by Artmarket.Over recent years France has been accumulating a number of very positive signals for the re-emergence of its art market. These include the presence of large private foundations such as the Fondation Louis Vuitton and the Pinault Collection  the replacement of the FIAC with Paris+ (organized by Art Basel)  the arrival and/or expansion of major international galleries such as the Gagosian  Zwirner  Skarstedt  Max Hetzler  Thaddaeus Ropac  Continua  Marian Goodman  and Bonhams' recent acquisition of the French auction house Cornette de Saint Cyr  not to mention the rise of the two major global auction houses  Christie's and Sotheby's  both owned by French business tycoons (François Pinault and Patrick Drahirespectively)  and  the successful transformation of Drouot  and Arcurial (Dassault family)  France's leading auction house in terms of turnover which now ranks 14th among the world's top 20 auction houses.Since Brexit  the French art market has been the main beneficiary being the main gateway to the European Union.A VAT rate hike to 20% would have a negative impact not just on artists  antique dealers  art dealers  and auction houses  but also on the entire art market ecosystem which includes tens of thousands of people employed in related fields ranging from frame-building to journalism  from restoration to transport  from logistics to security and from tourism to insurance.In March 2023 the Parisian gallery owner Kamel Mennour told the Le Monde newspaper (interview by Harry Bellet) “If the increase makes it difficult for me to sell their works  I will obviously be less inclined to sign new artists”. Now that the VAT has been maintained at 5.5%  Kamel Mennour can breathe a sigh of relief...Artprice.com by Artmarket congratulates the government's decision.VAT at 20% would have harmed the art market in France as a whole  and  as a result  would have damaged the confidence and dynamism of Artprice.com by Artmarket's French clientele. Incidentally – as the World Leader in Art Market Information for more than 25 years – Artprice notes that its French clients  who represented less than 5% of their total clientele a few years ago  now represent more than 10% (see Artmarket.com's universal reference document registered with the AMF  France's Financial Markets Authority)  showing that French collector participation has doubled.The reduced VAT rate of 5.5% will therefore continue to apply as of 2025 to initial sales as well as to imports of artworks from outside the EU. The rate will apply to the total price and not just to the margin  which will penalize low-margin sales very slightly.“A VAT rate at 20% would  for example  prevents the return to our country of Impressionist paintings or even masterpieces of Modern art by the likes of Picasso  Matisse and Manet  which are no longer in France although they were created in France and are adored by French collectors. Art is not a common consumer good: a State is enriched by its imports as well as the production of its ‘home-grown' artists. Inversely  the departure en masse of its national treasures has an impoverishing impact on the State that loses them.” This idea was expressed with courage by journalist Martine Robert who became the ‘whistleblower' for this cause for the French economics newspaper Les Échos in February 2023.thierry Ehrmann – founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com and himself a sculptor (see his biography in Who's Who In France ) – made the following observation: “This decision by the government will ensure that the dynamism of the French Art Market is not disrupted. We can only rejoice at this courageous decision by our Ministers Rima Abdul Malak and Bruno Le Maire. Artprice.com by Artmarket has worked for more than 25 years with all the players in the French art market  and it knows how much the VAT rate can impact the good performance of the art market. As a sculptor  I have been passionately following artistic creation in France for 40 years  and it is once again resonating around the world. This move will give substantial reassurance to French artists.”Faced with an increasingly globalized art market  France remains a strong and competitive market.Geographical distribution of Fine Art auction turnover in H1 2023[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/09/image2-geographical-distribution-fine-art-auction-turnover-H1-2023.png ]France's place in the global and European art marketIn the first half of 2023  French auction houses sold 54 000 fine art lots  generating a total turnover of $384.3 million. Artprice.com 's econometrics department has calculated that France therefore accounts for 5.9% of the overall value of global art auction sales  (giving it 4th place in the world) and 50% of the European art market. And it is creeping ever closer to the Top 3 podium.Several other European Union countries also play significant roles in the global art market  albeit on smaller scales: Germany (2.8% of global art auction turnover)  Italy (1.5 %)  Switzerland (1.3%)  Austria (0.8%)  Poland (0.6%)  Belgium (0.6%). Much less centralized than France  the German market is the strongest neighboring country  and Sotheby's has recently launched new sales sessions in Cologne. Read Artprice by Artmarket reports on the art market: https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-art-market-in-2022Competition with the United KingdomDespite Brexit  the United Kingdom still accounts for 17% of global art auction turnover with 5% VAT. The competition between London and Paris is particularly palpable every year in October.In a few weeks  Frieze London and Paris+ by Art Basel will take place in short succession. For the first time ever  the latter will be hunting on an equal footing with the Frieze  thanks to the power of Art Basel. In all  October is an intense period with the most prestigious galleries deciding whether or not to make the trip across the Channel. It is also a key time with auction houses hosting major sales and several organizations choosing to make major announcements to the world press. The Marcel Duchamp prize  for example  is awarded every October by the ADIAF (of which Artprice.com by Artmarket is a patron) to an artist from the French art scene at the Pompidou Center in Paris.According to Artprice.com 's econometrics department  in 1960  France's share of the global art market was 62%. The old stock market adage “a price once attained always comes back sooner or later ” also works in economics...More than 23 years ago  when Artprice definitively became the World Leader in Art Market Information following the spectacular and unexpected acquisition of the American leader Sound View Press NY  there was a widely held belief in financial and economic circles that Artprice's head office would inevitably migrate to its New York offices. The decision to stay in France was indeed a daring one. Today  France can rest assured that the World Leader in Art Market Information  Artprice.com by Artmarket  will remain in France.Images: [ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/09/image1-Rima-Abdul-Malak-Culture-Bruno-Lemaire-Economy-Finance.jpg ] [ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/09/image2-geographical-distribution-fine-art-auction-turnover-H1-2023.png ]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

AP commissioned the Ipsos study  which included interviews with 916 recent graduates of 25 partner universities  amidst the national conversation about the cost and value of higher education.The survey found that recent graduates of AP-supported programs averaged double-digit salary increases  a short tuition payback period of 1.2 years  and overwhelmingly affirmed the value of their degrees.Key findings from the Ipsos study include:Average total tuition for a full degree program was $16 600 .. Graduates of AP-supported programs average a first-year salary increase of nearly $14 000   allowing them to the ability to pay back tuition in just over a year (1.2 years)  allowing them to the ability to pay back tuition in just over a year (1.2 years) After three years  graduates reached an average salary increase of $18 400 .. 54% did not have to take out loans; student debt averaged out to be just over $6 000 .. Affordability (69%) and time to complete the degree (41%) were the top reasons graduates chose their universities.85% consider their degree worth the investment  and 81% would recommend their program to a friend or colleague.More than 90% graduated from degree programs in the high-demand fields of nursing  teaching  and business.""The rising costs of higher education and the resulting student debt have created a crisis "" said Fernando Bleichmar  CEO of Academic Partnerships. ""At AP  we have made it a priority to work with universities committed to developing high-quality online degree programs at an affordable cost  and the results of this survey show tremendous progress and success.

We look forward to continuing to expand this model to help address the current crisis.""""Higher education is a significant investment of both time and money "" said Jennifer Berg  Vice President from Ipsos.

The French government has decided to maintain the VAT rate at 5.5% for initial sales and imports of artworks from countries outside the European Union  proof that the two French Ministers  (Rima Abdul Malak for culture and Bruno Le Maire for the economy) succeeded in making their case against strong headwinds from Brussels.Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2219463/Artmarket_1.jpgOn the left  Rima Abdul Malak  Minister of Culture  On the right  Bruno Le Maire  Minister of the Economy  Finance and Industrial & Digital Sovereignty. Copyright Shutterstock Geographical distribution of Fine Art auction turnover in H1 2023If they had failed  there was a high risk that VAT would be raised to 20% before 1 January 2025  which would undoubtedly have broken the dynamics of the French art market  now the fourth largest national art market in the world according to Artprice.com by Artmarket.Over recent years France has been accumulating a number of very positive signals for the re-emergence of its art market. These include the presence of large private foundations such as the Fondation Louis Vuitton and the Pinault Collection  the replacement of the FIAC with Paris+ (organized by Art Basel)  the arrival and/or expansion of major international galleries such as the Gagosian  Zwirner  Skarstedt  Max Hetzler  Thaddaeus Ropac  Continua  Marian Goodman  and Bonhams' recent acquisition of the French auction house Cornette de Saint Cyr  not to mention the rise of the two major global auction houses  Christie's and Sotheby's  both owned by French business tycoons (François Pinault and Patrick Drahi respectively)  and  the successful transformation of Drouot  and Arcurial (Dassault family)  France's leading auction house in terms of turnover which now ranks 14th among the world's top 20 auction houses.Since Brexit  the French art market has been the main beneficiary being the main gateway to the European Union.A VAT rate hike to 20% would have a negative impact not just on artists  antique dealers  art dealers  and auction houses  but also on the entire art market ecosystem which includes tens of thousands of people employed in related fields ranging from frame-building to journalism  from restoration to transport  from logistics to security and from tourism to insurance.In March 2023 the Parisian gallery owner Kamel Mennour told the Le Monde newspaper (interview by Harry Bellet) ""If the increase makes it difficult for me to sell their works  I will obviously be less inclined to sign new artists"". Now that the VAT has been maintained at 5.5%  Kamel Mennour can breathe a sigh of relief...Artprice.com by Artmarket congratulates the government's decision.VAT at 20% would have harmed the art market in France as a whole  and  as a result  would have damaged the confidence and dynamism of Artprice.com by Artmarket's French clientele. Incidentally – as the World Leader in Art Market Information for more than 25 years – Artprice notes that its French clients  who represented less than 5% of their total clientele a few years ago  now represent more than 10% (see Artmarket.com's universal reference document registered with the AMF  France's Financial Markets Authority)  showing that French collector participation has doubled.The reduced VAT rate of 5.5% will therefore continue to apply as of 2025 to initial sales as well as to imports of artworks from outside the EU. The rate will apply to the total price and not just to the margin  which will penalize low-margin sales very slightly.""A VAT rate at 20% would  for example  prevents the return to our country of Impressionist paintings or even masterpieces of Modern art by the likes of Picasso  Matisse and Manet  which are no longer in France although they were created in France and are adored by French collectors. Art is not a common consumer good: a State is enriched by its imports as well as the production of its 'home-grown' artists. Inversely  the departure en masse of its national treasures has an impoverishing impact on the State that loses them."" This idea was expressed with courage by journalist Martine Robert who became the 'whistleblower' for this cause for the French economics newspaper Les Échos in February 2023.thierry Ehrmann – founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com and himself a sculptor (see his biography in Who's Who In France) – made the following observation: ""This decision by the government will ensure that the dynamism of the French Art Market is not disrupted. We can only rejoice at this courageous decision by our Ministers Rima Abdul Malak and Bruno Le Maire. Artprice.com by Artmarket has worked for more than 25 years with all the players in the French art market  and it knows how much the VAT rate can impact the good performance of the art market. As a sculptor  I have been passionately following artistic creation in France for 40 years  and it is once again resonating around the world. This move will give substantial reassurance to French artists.""Faced with an increasingly globalized art market  France remains a strong and competitive market.Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2219464/Artmarket_2_Infographic.jpgFrance's place in the global and European art marketIn the first half of 2023  French auction houses sold 54 000 fine art lots  generating a total turnover of $384.3 million. Artprice.com's econometrics department has calculated that France therefore accounts for 5.9% of the overall value of global art auction sales  (giving it 4th place in the world) and 50% of the European art market. And it is creeping ever closer to the Top 3 podium.Several other European Union countries also play significant roles in the global art market  albeit on smaller scales: Germany (2.8% of global art auction turnover)  Italy (1.5 %)  Switzerland (1.3%)  Austria (0.8%)  Poland (0.6%)  Belgium (0.6%). Much less centralized than France  the German market is the strongest neighboring country  and Sotheby's has recently launched new sales sessions in Cologne. Read Artprice by Artmarket reports on the art market: https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-art-market-in-2022Competition with the United KingdomDespite Brexit  the United Kingdom still accounts for 17% of global art auction turnover with 5% VAT. The competition between London and Paris is particularly palpable every year in October.In a few weeks  Frieze London and Paris+ by Art Basel will take place in short succession. For the first time ever  the latter will be hunting on an equal footing with the Frieze  thanks to the power of Art Basel. In all  October is an intense period with the most prestigious galleries deciding whether or not to make the trip across the Channel. It is also a key time with auction houses hosting major sales and several organizations choosing to make major announcements to the world press. The Marcel Duchamp prize  for example  is awarded every October by the ADIAF (of which Artprice.com by Artmarket is a patron) to an artist from the French art scene at the Pompidou Center in Paris.According to Artprice.com's econometrics department  in 1960  France's share of the global art market was 62%. The old stock market adage ""a price once attained always comes back sooner or later "" also works in economics...More than 23 years ago  when Artprice definitively became the World Leader in Art Market Information following the spectacular and unexpected acquisition of the American leader Sound View Press NY  there was a widely held belief in financial and economic circles that Artprice's head office would inevitably migrate to its New York offices. The decision to stay in France was indeed a daring one.

EBITDA was positive at + ¬230 K  thanks to a firm grip on operating expenses and overheads. The operating loss was - ¬5 004 K  mainly due to a capital loss on the disposal of the subsidiary AS Resorts  which was responsible for the construction of a five-star hotel on Agios Stefanos beach in Mykonos. The Azur Selection chose not to develop this project for several reasons:The current rise in interest rates  which has increased the expected cost of financing the project  60% of which is based on borrowing;The soaring cost of building materials over the past two years  which has impacted on the project's profitability as planned in the initial business plan;A change in building regulations on the island of Mykonos  delaying completion of the project and generation of the first cash flows.Thanks to the disposal of AS Resorts  The Azur Selection recorded tax income of ¬ 1 277 K  which explains the change from pre-tax income of - ¬5 082 K to net income of - ¬3 805 K. The transaction also had a positive impact on cash flow  generating free cash flow of ¬1 345 K  taking the cash position to ¬1 087 K  despite a cash outflow linked to the repayment of finance lease obligations.On the balance sheet  the ratio of non-current assets to total assets was 69% at June 30  2023  compared with 82% at December 31  2022.The 2023 half-year financial report is available in the investor section of the company's website: https://www.azurselection.com/investor-relationsUpdate on the construction of a 5-star hotel complex in GreeceThe Azur Selection has begun preliminary work on the construction of its 300-room hotel complex with a wide range of facilities  on its coastal site between Patras and Aigio in the Peloponnese region.

The new information includes estimated ranges for each 2024 tax bracket as well as projections for a growing number of inflation-sensitive tax figures ,Go-to guidance on latest figures now availableNEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–An early glimpse of the U.S. income tax picture for 2024  as projected under current tax law  is now available from Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting (TAA). The new information includes estimated ranges for each 2024 tax bracket as well as projections for a growing number of inflation-sensitive tax figures  such as the standard deduction. These annual projections are based on the relevant inflation data recently reported by the U.S. Department of Labor.Key Tax Savings  Inflation-Adjusted Projections for 2024Projections based on the Department of Labor’s inflation figures for the 12-month period between August 31  2022 and August 31  2023 suggest most taxpayers will experience significant inflation-driven “tax cut” savings in comparison to their 2023 tax return filings. An example of how taxpayers will benefit on 2024 tax returns  when compared to 2023 tax returns based on the inflation adjustments provided under the current tax code  follows:Because of the income ranges bracketing  the inflation adjustments will provide an effective “tax cut” by taxing more income at lower marginal tax rates. A single filer with taxable income of $50 000 should owe $254.50 less next year due to the adjustments to the income tax rate brackets between 2023 and 2024.A married couple filing jointly with a total taxable income of $130 000 should pay $509 less income taxes for 2024 tax returns than they will on the same income for 2023 because of indexing of their tax brackets for 2024.The additional standard deduction for those 65-years-old and older or who are blind will increase $50 to $1 550 for 2024 tax returns  with an increase of $100 to $1 950 for single aged 65 or older or blind filers.Other Inflation-adjusted Tax Estimates for 2024The standard deduction for single  married filing jointly  and married filing separately filers is expected to rise for 2024: at $14 600  $29 200 and $14 600  respectively  up from $13 850  $27 700 and $13 850. The standard deduction for heads of household is expected to rise $1 100 to $21 900 for 2024. Any increase in the standard deduction  of course  can produce lower taxes by decreasing the taxpayer’s taxable income.The estate and gift tax applicable exemption was increased by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amount has been adjusted for inflation by Congress and is now projected at $13 610 000 for 2024. A spousal portability election can now effectively protect double that amount against estate and gift tax ($27 220 000 for 2024). The annual gift tax exclusion for 2024 is projected to increase to $18 000 for gifts to each recipient.The 2024 foreign earned income exclusion will increase to $126 500 for 2024  up from $120 000 for 2023.Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting 2024 Tax Projections*As cited earlier  Wolters Kluwer TAA projections for indexed amounts are based on the relevant inflation data released by the U.S. Department of Labor.

For example  the Code now requires over 50 other inflation-driven computations to determine deduction  credit and exclusion amounts in addition to the 50 separate computations needed to inflation-adjust the tax bracket schedules each year. Estimates for any of the inflation-adjusted tax figures for 2024  of course  are also necessarily subject to any changes to the tax law that may be made by Congress over the course of the next year.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG.

Yahoo Finance examines the stock action surrounding the beauty brand and its offering of 33 million shares ,Shares of beauty company Coty  Inc. (COTY) trend lower in the pre-market trading session after pushing forward with plans to seek a dual listing on the Euronext Paris stock exchange. Yahoo Finance examines the stock action surrounding the beauty brand and its offering of 33 million shares  live from the Nasdaq MarketSite.For more expert insight and the latest market action  click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video transcript- Well  let's pivot to the beauty industry. You can't eat this. Coty shares there are-- and if you are  that's just wrong. Cody shares moving lower this morning by about 3.4%. This comes after the company pushes ahead with selling 33 million new shares as part of a seeking of a dual listing on the Paris Euronext exchange.Now this is subject to France's market regulator approval. The past couple of years for Coty has been plagued with some management churn and heavy debt as well. The company hoping that this is going to solve their cash flow issues here. And so we're taking a look at shares here on perhaps the just dilution and offering of more shares that are moving lower here  at least in US trading as of right now.- Yeah  certainly  so we're seeing some movement here on the stock this morning. And it's important to point out that we've seen a similar type of move from other luxury goods producers within the space. When you take a look at LVMH  L'Oreal  Hermes  all trading on Euronext Paris. So Coty certainly following suit there with that selling 33 million shares like you said  worth about $389 million.Now in terms of what they plan to do with this  they're going to hold a call later on this morning talking about the price  talking about I guess their plans here going forward. But then of course  we're going to get the price in terms of the offering before the market opens on Thursday. Some speculation just about what they're going to do with it when it comes to debt  when it comes to future CapEx plans  when it comes to future investment opportunities within the space because it certainly is very competitive. I was just listing off some of the other names that are already listed on Euronext Paris. When you're taking a look at LVMH  L'Oreal  Hermes  it's a crowded space. Yes  consumers are still spending  especially luxury consumers. But of course  you always have the overhang as to how long that could really last.Story continues- Absolutely  there's some of the context around this too for Coty here. It's actually been a pretty good story as of right now for them raising most recently. And it was actually just last week that we heard from them. This time last week  they had raised their outlook for fiscal year 2024. They were pointing to some of the momentum in their prestige business  strong beauty demand.Hey  it's me. Prestige fragrances as well. So people out there just wanting to smell good and not funky. And Coty's blockbuster innovation drive upside to the first half of 2024. And their fiscal 24 outlook  that was some of the catalysts that they were pointing to when we heard from them this time last week  perhaps taking some of that momentum as well over to the Euronext exchange.- Yeah  fragrance is certainly a massive hit there for Coty recently.,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.34,0.17,0.49,True,English,"['global offering', '33 million shares', 'Coty', 'eyes', 'Paris', 'other luxury goods producers', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'cash flow issues', 'future investment opportunities', 'pre-market trading session', 'Paris Euronext exchange', 'market regulator approval', 'strong beauty demand', 'Yahoo Finance Live', 'latest market action', 'future CapEx plans', '33 million new shares', 'other names', 'stock action', 'US trading', 'luxury consumers', 'beauty brand', 'beauty industry', '33 million shares', 'dual listing', 'Nasdaq MarketSite', 'expert insight', 'full episode', 'Video transcript', 'past couple', 'similar type', ""L'Oreal"", 'fiscal year', 'prestige business', 'Prestige fragrances', 'blockbuster innovation', 'first half', 'fiscal 24 outlook', 'massive hit', 'Cody shares', 'beauty company', 'heavy debt', 'good story', 'crowded space', 'So Coty', 'Coty shares', 'Inc.', 'offering', 'part', 'seeking', 'France', 'years', 'management', 'dilution', 'right', 'movement', 'LVMH', 'Hermes', 'suit', 'terms', 'call', 'morning', 'price', 'course', 'Thursday', 'speculation', 'overhang', 'context', 'momentum', 'people', 'catalysts']",2023-09-26,2023-09-26,uk.news.yahoo.com

The company has been trading in Dublin for over 80 years.,"CRH (NYSE:CRH)  the building materials giant  debuted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) today  Monday  after being delisted from the Irish Stock Exchange. The company has been trading in Dublin for over 80 years. CRH had completed the necessary changes to transfer its primary listing from Euronext Dublin to NYSE. The company's shares were 2% higher in early trading in New York today.The decision to shift its primary listing to New York was made earlier this year  with a secondary listing in London also chosen. CRH will still maintain its headquarters and tax residency in Ireland. The move was approved by CRH shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) in June.Albert Manifold  CEO of CRH  said that the move would allow the company to leverage large US government spending programs and future tax advantages in mergers and acquisitions. This could facilitate a ""higher vector of growth"". He noted that being recognized as an American company would put them on a level playing field with their competitors in a very competitive market.Last year  the US market accounted for about 75% of CRH's core earnings  making it the largest building materials supplier in the country. In 2022  CRH reported group earnings before interest  tax  depreciation  and amortization (EBITDA) of $1.4bn and revenues of $32.7bn.Notably  billionaire investors George Soros and Seth Klarman established positions in CRH during the summer. Over two dozen hedge funds disclosed new or increased positions in CRH’s American Deposit Receipts on Nasdaq recently.Following CRH's departure from Euronext Dublin  Flutter Entertainment  owner of Paddy Power and Betfair  became the largest Irish company listed on the exchange. Flutter is also considering moving its primary listing to New York later this year or early in 2024  following a majority of its investors backing the plan. However  Flutter has not yet confirmed this move.Additionally  paper and packaging giant Smurfit Kappa is planning to merge with US-based WestRock (NYSE:WRK). If the deal proceeds  it will also delist from Dublin and be listed on the NYSE. The merged entity  Smurfit WestRock  would be a $20 billion paper and packaging giant  still headquartered in Ireland.Story continuesThe departure of CRH and the potential exits of other companies have raised concerns for Euronext Dublin  which has seen several A-listers leave in recent years. However  Siobhan Talbot  CEO of Glanbia  reassured that the group has no intention of leaving its Dublin listing for the US.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
