The inclusion is expected to attract billions in foreign capital and enhance currency market stability by bringing more mid-to-long-term bond funds into the market.FTSE Russell's country reclassification announcement is due at the end of September. South Korea has been striving for inclusion since last year when it reduced taxes on overseas investment in Korean Treasury bonds.In February  South Korea introduced several measures to meet the WGBI's requirements. These included extending forex trading hours to include London trading hours  simplifying registration procedures for foreign equity investors  and planning to open its onshore currency market to registered foreign institutions in the latter half of 2024.An essential step towards inclusion was achieved last month when Euroclear Bank and Clearstream agreed with the Korea Securities Depository to open an omnibus account for Korea Treasury bonds. This move meets another WGBI requirement: enabling bond market transactions via international securities depositories.South Korean officials estimate that WGBI-related inflows into Korean Treasury bonds could reach up to Won90tn ($67bn)  considering that approximately $2.5tn worth of global bond funds follow the WGBI. If included  Korean Treasury bonds are likely to join the index with a weighting of about 2-2.5 per cent.However  South Korea still faces challenges in its quest for promotion to developed market status by MSCI. One significant hurdle is restrictions on offshore trading of the won  reflecting concerns over unregulated forex markets rooted in memories of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. While South Korean authorities are not currently considering allowing offshore trading of the currency  they anticipate achieving developed market status by 2024 or 2025.Another condition for the MSCI upgrade is the complete removal of the country's short-selling ban  introduced at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic to curb market volatility. In 2021  the government partially lifted this ban  allowing sales of borrowed large-cap shares in the Kospi 200 and Kosdaq 150 indices.

All the constituents of the JPMorgan index are usually tax exempt  we have not relented on that. So as and when passive investors encounter tax implications  they will think twice "" one of the sources said.""We are also not in Euroclear  so they cannot settle via that"".Even if flows are lower than predicted  they would still add to market volatility. Foreign portfolio investors have bought an average $6 billion in stocks and bonds on a net basis over the last five years  with 2019 seeing the largest dollar inflows in recent years at around $18 billion.The RBI did not respond to a request for comment.The Reserve Bank of India can buy dollars in the spot market or forwards to prevent the currency from overshooting and further build its foreign exchange reserves kitty while using the standing deposit facility  a collateral-free  low-interest bearing overnight liquidity withdrawal tool  to mop up the resultant rupee liquidity  the two sources said.To manage any distortions in the bond yield curve  the central bank can use open market operations (OMOs) or any other tools as and when required  the sources added.""From a macro management perspective  the rise in domestic liquidity will have to be counterbalanced by appropriate macro prudential measures from the central bank "" Morgan Stanley said in a recent note.The central bank could use market stabilisation scheme (MSS)bonds  open market sales  and longer-term reverse repo auctions to ensure that it does not translate into macro stability risk in the form of higher inflation  the investment bank added.The RBI  however  does not prefer MSS and would opt for OMOs as the latter gives it more direct control on the securities  one of the sources said.The initial inflows may not be as large as the $23-$25 billion being anticipated  according to R. Gandhi  a former deputy governor at the central bank  who said that active funds may take some time to increase positions.These flows however should be manageable through ""standard tools""  Gandhi added.The inclusion will also sharpen the focus on government finances and macro numbers  requiring more transparency and alignment with international norms  said G.

30625,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/thought-leadership/the-evolution-of-data-in-the-fixed-income-market/,The evolution of data in the fixed income market,With ongoing regulatory changes and the continuous push for digitalisation  the fixed income market is poised for further evolution in the coming years says Anya van den Berg  VP of data and analytics at Deutsche Börse.,Over the past few years  the fixed income market has experienced a remarkable evolution in both product offerings and the utilisation of data-driven insights. As the financial landscape rapidly changes  driven by technological advancements  shifting investor preferences  and regulatory changes  the fixed income market has adapted to these dynamics to better serve market participants.The integration of ESG factors into the fixed income market has been one of the most notable trends. With climate change becoming a pressing issue globally  there has been a surge in the issuance of ESG-centric bonds  including green  social  and sustainability bonds. These all serve as a means for issuers to raise capital for projects aligned with ESG objectives  while catering to the growing demand from investors who seek to align their investments with sustainability goals.In addition to this  fixed income issuers have increasingly embraced innovation by structuring bonds tailored to specific investor needs. Structured bonds  with features such as adjustable coupon rates or embedded options  allow investors to better manage risk and exposure to the ever-fluctuating interest rate adjustments we have all experienced in recent times.Lastly  exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the fixed income space have also continued to proliferate  as they provide exposure to niche fixed income segments such as emerging markets  high yield  and municipal bonds. These ETFs offer investors a convenient way to access a diversified portfolio of bonds while benefiting from intraday trading and transparency.Aside from the above trends  the value of alternative data sources within the fixed income market are also worth noting. Over the past few years  market participants have started incorporating non-traditional data like satellite imagery  social media sentiment  supply chain data sentiment and online transaction data into their analysis. These alternative datasets offer unique insights into credit risk  issuer performance  and macroeconomic trends  enabling investors to make more informed decisions. Deutsche Börse has thrown its hat into the ring in this regard and developed datasets in partnership with Clearstream who are a leading International central securities depository that has unique visibility into security holdings and transactional data. Clearstream Bond Liquidity provides unique post-trade settlement and transaction data by shining a light on the Eurobond market on a T+1 basis. The data feed can be used to fairly value fixed income assets and portfolios as well as generate unique liquidity scores in addition to measuring liquidity and systemic risk of bond issuers.On top of alternative data sources  the application of machine learning and AI in the fixed income market has also gained traction. Financial institutions are leveraging these technologies to analyse large volumes of data and extract actionable insights. AI-driven tools have the potential to enhance trading strategies and risk management and it is for this reason that Deutsche Börse has partnered with Overbond to leverage their AI technology. Through the partnership with Deutsche Börse and Clearstream  Overbond’ s customers can gain access to settlement-level fixed-income transaction data derived from the 170 million transactions that Clearstream processes annually across 100 currencies and 60 domestic markets.Regulatory changes have also played a pivotal role in shaping the fixed income landscape in recent years. Evolving regulations such as Mifid II in Europe and SEC reporting requirements in the US have placed greater emphasis on transparency  reporting  and investor protection. These reforms have driven market participants to adopt advanced technologies for compliance and reporting.Another important factor influencing the fixed income market has been the intensity of efforts to standardise and consolidate data as it has historically suffered from fragmentation and lack of uniformity. Initiatives  such as the plan to build a consolidated tape in Europe  aims to address these issues by creating a centralised source of bond trade data. The European Union aims to enhance price discovery  enable better analysis of liquidity  and facilitate post-trade reporting. Moreover  the EU is intent on levelling the playing field for all market participants  from institutional investors to retail traders. The tape would aggregate data from various trading venues  providing easier monitoring of market trends  assessing market depth  and evaluating the true cost of trading.Lastly  a predominant factor shaping the market has been the digital transformation of fixed income processes in recent years. Market participants are embracing electronic trading platforms  primary issuance workflow tools  automation tools  and digital settlement processes. These advancements streamline trade execution  reduce operational risks  and enhance efficiency throughout the trade lifecycle. A recent example of this at Deutsche Börse was when KfW launched the first digital fixed income bond in the form of a central register security on the German Electronic Securities Act (eWpG). The issue was carried out by Clearstream on Deutsche Börse’s D7 digital post-trade platform.In conclusion  the fixed income market has undergone a significant transformation in product offerings and the utilisation of data-driven insights over the past two years. The integration of ESG considerations  the expansion of innovative bond structures  and the growing importance of alternative data sources reflect the market’s responsiveness to evolving investor preferences. Additionally  advancements in data analytics  AI  and machine learning have empowered investors and market participants with more sophisticated tools for analysis and decision-making. With ongoing regulatory changes and the continuous push for digitalisation  the fixed income market is poised for further evolution in the coming years  catering to the changing demands of investors and the broader financial ecosystem.For further information on Deutsche Börse’s fixed income analytics offerings  please visit: https://www.mds.deutsche-boerse.com/mds-en/analytics or email analytics@deutsche-boerse.com,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.28,0.25,0.46,True,English,"['fixed income market', 'evolution', 'data', 'leading International central securities depository', 'first digital fixed income bond', 'fluctuating interest rate adjustments', 'supply chain data sentiment', 'settlement-level fixed-income transaction data', 'primary issuance workflow tools', 'digital settlement processes', 'fixed income space', 'fixed income segments', 'fixed income assets', 'fixed income processes', 'adjustable coupon rates', 'exchange traded funds', 'Deutsche Börse', 'The European Union', 'fixed income landscape', 'fixed income market', 'social media sentiment', 'online transaction data', 'specific investor needs', 'fixed income issuers', 'various trading venues', 'electronic trading platforms', 'alternative data sources', 'unique post-trade settlement', 'bond trade data', 'SEC reporting requirements', 'unique liquidity scores', 'Clearstream Bond Liquidity', 'central reg', 'digital transformation', 'bond issuers', 'AI-driven tools', 'automation tools', 'financial landscape', 'unique insights', 'unique visibility', 'non-traditional data', 'transactional data', 'data feed', 'investor preferences', 'market participants', 'Eurobond market', 'investor protection', 'market depth', 'trade execution', 'trade lifecycle', 'post-trade reporting', 'intraday trading', 'trading strategies', 'alternative datasets', 'market trends', 'remarkable evolution', 'product offerings', 'data-driven insights', 'regulatory changes', 'ESG factors', 'climate change', 'pressing issue', 'ESG objectives', 'growing demand', 'sustainability goals', 'embedded options', 'recent times', 'emerging markets', 'high yield', 'convenient way', 'diversified portfolio', 'satellite imagery', 'issuer performance', 'informed decisions', 'security holdings', 'T+1 basis', 'machine learning', 'Financial institutions', 'large volumes', 'actionable insights', '170 million transactions', '60 domestic markets', 'pivotal role', 'Evolving regulations', 'Mifid II', 'greater emphasis', 'important factor', 'centralised source', 'price discovery', 'playing field', 'retail traders', 'easier monitoring', 'true cost', 'predominant factor', 'operational risks', 'recent example', 'notable trends', 'credit risk', 'macroeconomic trends', 'systemic risk', 'risk management', 'ESG-centric bonds', 'sustainability bonds', 'Structured bonds', 'municipal bonds', 'technological advancements', 'AI technology', 'recent years', 'advanced technologies', 'consolidated tape', 'institutional investors', 'past', 'utilisation', 'dynamics', 'integration', 'surge', 'means', 'capital', 'projects', 'investments', 'addition', 'innovation', 'features', 'exposure', 'ETFs', 'transparency', 'value', 'analysis', 'hat', 'regard', 'partnership', 'light', 'portfolios', 'top', 'application', 'potential', 'reason', 'Overbond', 'customers', 'access', '100 currencies', 'reforms', 'compliance', 'intensity', 'efforts', 'fragmentation', 'lack', 'uniformity', 'Initiatives', 'plan', 'issues', 'efficiency', 'KfW']",2023-09-27,2023-09-27,thetradenews.com

Structured bonds  with features such as adjustable coupon rates or embedded options  allow investors to better manage risk and exposure to the ever-fluctuating interest rate adjustments we have all experienced in recent times.Lastly  exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the fixed income space have also continued to proliferate  as they provide exposure to niche fixed income segments such as emerging markets  high yield  and municipal bonds. These ETFs offer investors a convenient way to access a diversified portfolio of bonds while benefiting from intraday trading and transparency.Aside from the above trends  the value of alternative data sources within the fixed income market are also worth noting. Over the past few years  market participants have started incorporating non-traditional data like satellite imagery  social media sentiment  supply chain data sentiment and online transaction data into their analysis. These alternative datasets offer unique insights into credit risk  issuer performance  and macroeconomic trends  enabling investors to make more informed decisions. Deutsche Börse has thrown its hat into the ring in this regard and developed datasets in partnership with Clearstream who are a leading International central securities depository that has unique visibility into security holdings and transactional data. Clearstream Bond Liquidity provides unique post-trade settlement and transaction data by shining a light on the Eurobond market on a T+1 basis. The data feed can be used to fairly value fixed income assets and portfolios as well as generate unique liquidity scores in addition to measuring liquidity and systemic risk of bond issuers.On top of alternative data sources  the application of machine learning and AI in the fixed income market has also gained traction. Financial institutions are leveraging these technologies to analyse large volumes of data and extract actionable insights. AI-driven tools have the potential to enhance trading strategies and risk management and it is for this reason that Deutsche Börse has partnered with Overbond to leverage their AI technology. Through the partnership with Deutsche Börse and Clearstream  Overbond’ s customers can gain access to settlement-level fixed-income transaction data derived from the 170 million transactions that Clearstream processes annually across 100 currencies and 60 domestic markets.Regulatory changes have also played a pivotal role in shaping the fixed income landscape in recent years. Evolving regulations such as Mifid II in Europe and SEC reporting requirements in the US have placed greater emphasis on transparency  reporting  and investor protection. These reforms have driven market participants to adopt advanced technologies for compliance and reporting.Another important factor influencing the fixed income market has been the intensity of efforts to standardise and consolidate data as it has historically suffered from fragmentation and lack of uniformity. Initiatives  such as the plan to build a consolidated tape in Europe  aims to address these issues by creating a centralised source of bond trade data. The European Union aims to enhance price discovery  enable better analysis of liquidity  and facilitate post-trade reporting. Moreover  the EU is intent on levelling the playing field for all market participants  from institutional investors to retail traders. The tape would aggregate data from various trading venues  providing easier monitoring of market trends  assessing market depth  and evaluating the true cost of trading.Lastly  a predominant factor shaping the market has been the digital transformation of fixed income processes in recent years. Market participants are embracing electronic trading platforms  primary issuance workflow tools  automation tools  and digital settlement processes. These advancements streamline trade execution  reduce operational risks  and enhance efficiency throughout the trade lifecycle. A recent example of this at Deutsche Börse was when KfW launched the first digital fixed income bond in the form of a central register security on the German Electronic Securities Act (eWpG). The issue was carried out by Clearstream on Deutsche Börse’s D7 digital post-trade platform.In conclusion  the fixed income market has undergone a significant transformation in product offerings and the utilisation of data-driven insights over the past two years. The integration of ESG considerations  the expansion of innovative bond structures  and the growing importance of alternative data sources reflect the market’s responsiveness to evolving investor preferences. Additionally  advancements in data analytics  AI  and machine learning have empowered investors and market participants with more sophisticated tools for analysis and decision-making. With ongoing regulatory changes and the continuous push for digitalisation  the fixed income market is poised for further evolution in the coming years  catering to the changing demands of investors and the broader financial ecosystem.For further information on Deutsche Börse’s fixed income analytics offerings  please visit: https://www.mds.deutsche-boerse.com/mds-en/analytics or email analytics@deutsche-boerse.com,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.28,0.25,0.46,True,English,"['fixed income market', 'evolution', 'data', 'leading International central securities depository', 'first digital fixed income bond', 'fluctuating interest rate adjustments', 'supply chain data sentiment', 'settlement-level fixed-income transaction data', 'primary issuance workflow tools', 'digital settlement processes', 'fixed income space', 'fixed income segments', 'fixed income assets', 'fixed income processes', 'adjustable coupon rates', 'exchange traded funds', 'Deutsche Börse', 'The European Union', 'fixed income landscape', 'fixed income market', 'social media sentiment', 'online transaction data', 'specific investor needs', 'fixed income issuers', 'various trading venues', 'electronic trading platforms', 'alternative data sources', 'unique post-trade settlement', 'bond trade data', 'SEC reporting requirements', 'unique liquidity scores', 'Clearstream Bond Liquidity', 'central reg', 'digital transformation', 'bond issuers', 'AI-driven tools', 'automation tools', 'financial landscape', 'unique insights', 'unique visibility', 'non-traditional data', 'transactional data', 'data feed', 'investor preferences', 'market participants', 'Eurobond market', 'investor protection', 'market depth', 'trade execution', 'trade lifecycle', 'post-trade reporting', 'intraday trading', 'trading strategies', 'alternative datasets', 'market trends', 'remarkable evolution', 'product offerings', 'data-driven insights', 'regulatory changes', 'ESG factors', 'climate change', 'pressing issue', 'ESG objectives', 'growing demand', 'sustainability goals', 'embedded options', 'recent times', 'emerging markets', 'high yield', 'convenient way', 'diversified portfolio', 'satellite imagery', 'issuer performance', 'informed decisions', 'security holdings', 'T+1 basis', 'machine learning', 'Financial institutions', 'large volumes', 'actionable insights', '170 million transactions', '60 domestic markets', 'pivotal role', 'Evolving regulations', 'Mifid II', 'greater emphasis', 'important factor', 'centralised source', 'price discovery', 'playing field', 'retail traders', 'easier monitoring', 'true cost', 'predominant factor', 'operational risks', 'recent example', 'notable trends', 'credit risk', 'macroeconomic trends', 'systemic risk', 'risk management', 'ESG-centric bonds', 'sustainability bonds', 'Structured bonds', 'municipal bonds', 'technological advancements', 'AI technology', 'recent years', 'advanced technologies', 'consolidated tape', 'institutional investors', 'past', 'utilisation', 'dynamics', 'integration', 'surge', 'means', 'capital', 'projects', 'investments', 'addition', 'innovation', 'features', 'exposure', 'ETFs', 'transparency', 'value', 'analysis', 'hat', 'regard', 'partnership', 'light', 'portfolios', 'top', 'application', 'potential', 'reason', 'Overbond', 'customers', 'access', '100 currencies', 'reforms', 'compliance', 'intensity', 'efforts', 'fragmentation', 'lack', 'uniformity', 'Initiatives', 'plan', 'issues', 'efficiency', 'KfW']",2023-09-27,2023-09-27,thetradenews.com

Launches $389 Million Share Offering in Move to List on Euronext Paris By Investing.com,Coty Inc. Launches $389 Million Share Offering in Move to List on Euronext Paris,"Published Sep 26  2023 02:10PM ET© Reuters.COTY -4.84% Add to/Remove from WatchlistUS beauty and fragrance company Coty (NYSE: ) Inc. launched an offering of 33 million shares on Tuesday  as part of its plan to list on Euronext Paris. This move aims to tap into the European market's deep understanding of the luxury goods industry and is expected to increase the appeal of the French bourse as a global hub for luxury stocks. The stock offering is valued at about $389 million based on Coty's closing price in New York on Monday.Coty has applied to list its Class A common stock on the professional segment of Euronext. Investors will have the option to purchase Coty’s Paris-listed stock in euros or the New York Stock Exchange-listed stock in dollars. However  Coty's US shares dropped 3.3% in premarket trading on Tuesday.The details of this proposed Paris listing were revealed last week  with BNP Paribas (OTC: ) SA  Credit Agricole (OTC: ) SA  Citigroup Inc (NYSE: )  and Banco Santander SA (NYSE: ) serving as joint global coordinators of the offering. Coty plans to price the offering before the US market opens on Thursday  September 28  following a call with prospective investors.The company intends to primarily use the proceeds from this offering to retire debt. Funds may also be directed towards general corporate purposes including strategic investments in its business  working capital  and capital expenditures.Coty's decision to list in Paris is not only due to the presence of analysts and comparables but also because of Euronext NV’s liquidity pool and an extremely deep order book  according to Stephane Boujnah  CEO of the exchange operator.Coty has historic ties with France  having been founded in Paris in 1904. The cosmetics company had announced in May that it was considering listing in Paris — ""the historic home of beauty"" — to tap a fresh pool of capital.In September  Coty raised its sales outlook for the year  citing robust demand for higher-end fragrances like the recently launched ""Burberry Goddess"". Its brands include Covergirl  Kylie Cosmetics  and Gucci and Hugo Boss fragrances. The company also plans to manage its outstanding share count by settling one or more outstanding total return swaps over the next six months  in an amount of up to 27 million shares.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The recent study evaluated five blood-based panels5  which included NIS4®  NIS2+™’s predecessor.The study aims to confirm the diagnostic performances of existing biomarker panels and determine their advantage over commonly used laboratory tests (ALT and FIB-4). Such studies conducted provide necessary data for the regulatory approval of biomarkers for the diagnosis of at-risk NASH and is a crucial step in moving the field closer to having qualified Non-Invasive Tests  such as NIS4® or now NIS2+™  that can be used for widespread clinical use.The findings  published in the scientific journal Nature Medicine  concluded that NIS4® achieved an AUROC6 of 0.815 for its intended use of diagnosing at-risk NASH  demonstrating significant superiority over common clinical-laboratory tools. It also confirmed that NIS4® was the only panel efficient for the diagnosis of the composite phenotype of at-risk NASH. Regarding the detection of NASH and significant fibrosis (F≥2) independently  NIS4®’s performance was superior to the other biomarker panels tested  achieving AUROC values of 0.832 and 0.874  respectively.These findings represent an important milestone in NIS4® technology’s path to regulatory approval by the U.S Food and Drug Administration. NIS2+™  the newly published and optimized version of NIS4®  is currently in the process of being independently evaluated through the NIMBLE consortium.Arun J Sanyal  M.D.  Director of the Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health at Virginia Commonwealth University and Chair of the NIMBLE Consortium  commented: “Such findings will bring us a step closer towards a fully approved biomarker panel which can be made available for widespread clinical use and potentially alleviate the major barrier to care and drug development access. NIS4®’s utility as an effective technology to diagnose at-risk NASH is clearly demonstrated in these findings and we look forward to evaluating NIS4®’s more advanced version  NIS2+™  in the near future.”ABOUT GENFIT’S NASH DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGYNIS2+™ is a blood-based diagnostic technology specifically designed to detect at-risk NASH among patients with metabolic risk factors based on an independent 2-biomarker panel. It is an optimization of the NIS4® technology and was developed and validated by GENFIT as a robust technology across characteristics of interest such as type-2 diabetes  age and sex  allowing large-scale implementation in clinical practice. GENFIT continues to explore the possibility of obtaining regulatory approval and CE Certificates of Conformity  with a development and commercial partner  to release an IVD test powered by NIS2+™ technology on the US and European markets.NIS4® technology  NIS2+™’s predecessor  is being commercialized by Labcorp in the US and Canada as a Laboratory Developed Test.

The sharp fall in single housing unit permits (down 31% year-on-year in July 2023) is impacting our market segments in different ways. In this context  the Group is relying on its diversified business model to continue to move forward through the cycles  support the performance of its businesses and create long-term value. It is also counting on the contribution of its acquisitions. Prudent and agile  HERIGE is pursuing a growth strategy focused on the renovation and refurbishment markets  based on a product range tailored to meet energy and decarbonization challenges  notably with the ramp-up of its Vitaliss ® low-carbon footprint concrete product range.”A context of a sharply deteriorated new construction market  partially offset by the Group's strategic focus on the renovation and refurbishment marketsIn first-half 2023  HERIGE Group posted turnover of €455.0 million  an increase of 10.2% (up 0.2% like for like) compared to the same period in 2022. Sales growth was mainly driven by pricing power and acquisitions carried out in 2022.Despite a decline in volumes  HERIGE Group posted a gross margin of €185.2 million  up €22.3 million compared to the same period in 2022  representing a gross margin of 40.7% of turnover  up 1.2 points versus first-half 2022.The Group quickly took steps to improve operating performance in order to limit the decline in EBITDA. For the first half of 2023  EBITDA totaled €28.8 million  down by just 7.1%  representing an EBITDA margin of 6.3%  down 1.2 points versus first-half of 2022.HERIGE's operating income came in at €18.3 million (down 18.7% compared to H1 2022)  representing an operating margin of 4.0% versus 5.4% one year earlier.After taking into account a net financial loss of €2.3 million (versus €0.6 million in first-half 2022) and a non-recurring loss result of €0.5 million (versus a non-recurring loss of €0.4 million one year earlier)  net income Group share amounted to €9.8 million in first-half 2023 compared with €14.4 million in first-half 2022.Financial structureInvestments (excluding external growth) amounted to €10.3 million in first-half 2023.Against a backdrop of dynamic external growth in 2022  net financial debt amounted to €163.9 million and shareholders' equity to €145.2 million at June 30  2023. As a result  the net debt-to-equity ratio rose to 112.9% from 85.2% in the first half of 2022.Restated for acquisitions  the net debt-to-equity ratio was 91%  with shareholders' equity of €143.5 million and net financial debt of €130.9 million.Outlook and developmentsIn an uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic environment  marked by rising interest rates  ongoing high inflation and a declining new construction market  the Group will continue to implement its strategic priorities.Consolidation of operating performance: pricing power  control of fixed costs and improved productivity.Growth focused on high value-added activities: integration and ramp up of the latest major acquisitions  a product range in line with energy and decarbonization challenges (special and low-carbon concretes  wood and biosourced range  etc.).Ramp up of CSR policy: implementation of the carbon pathway and circular economy initiatives.NEXT PUBLICATION: Q3 2023 turnover on November 7  2023 (after the close of trading)All our financial communications are available on our website: www.groupe-herige.fr/enAbout HERIGEHERIGE Group focuses on three sectors of the building industry: Building Materials Trading  the Concrete Industry and Industrial Joinery.

Legrand improves lives by transforming spaces where people live and work through innovative products and solutions that deliver and manage power  light and data. Creating a premium in-room experience with the complete conferencing platform is what the Signature Teams Rooms are all about.Legrand Partners with Microsoft to Create New Hybrid Conferencing SpaceSignature Teams Rooms were developed to be immersive and inclusive meeting spaces enhanced for hybrid experiences that can be easily deployed at scale around the world. To implement this vision  either for new construction or retrofits  Microsoft had to develop new equipment and standards. This involved changes to the room layout  furniture  audio-visual equipment  and Teams. Microsoft looked at technologies that could make remote employees feel more included in meetings and help people presenting in the room feel more connected to those joining remotely. Legrand proved to be a valuable partner because of the breadth of AV infrastructure  building controls  electrical infrastructure  lighting  and acoustic solutions.For these two new showcase spaces  Legrand provided key components that helped simplify the typical order  delivery  and integration experience for Microsoft. These include:Productivity and AV solutions from Middle Atlantic and Chief  including the Forum Arc Tables which ensure everyone physically in the room faces the camera  the Forum Collaboration Suite Display Stand  which is robust enough to support the Jupiter Pana 105 display  and Chief's Voyager Cart to deliver the Microsoft Surface Hub to any point in the room for better collaboration.Legrand offers a variety of furniture power solutions that supply convenient and configurable power and charging access - including units that install directly into desks  tabletops  and upholstered furniture along with the Evolution Series 8"" Recessed Poke-Thru device for access to power and audio/video services recessed below floor level.Architectural acoustic wall panels from Focal Point provide improved room acoustics for both remote and in-person users while also establishing a cohesive  modern aesthetic with the Forum Display Stand.These products from Legrand combine elegantly  ensuring these spaces are inviting and inclusive in design  and accommodate the speed and scalability of deployment required by Microsoft.""Working with Legrand brings Microsoft a partner that has a massive breadth of product solutions that address a variety of AV and building infrastructure requirements  ranging from leading AV brands to electrical and data infrastructure  to lighting and acoustics. Along with market-leading products  Legrand offers a truly global scale to support Microsoft facilities around the world  enabling global room specifications and availability of products anywhere that Microsoft operates. This partnership and global reach are equally valuable to Microsoft's customers that are similarly working to specify and deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms in large scale around the world "" said John Selldorff  President and CEO of Legrand  North and Central America.""In this Post-Pandemic Era  hybrid workplaces are the future  and in any office  we must consider both in-person and remote experiences. By partnering with Teams  we can combine the technology and breadth of products to design the future of conference rooms to create an exceptional audio-visual experience for employees both in person and remote "" said Selldorff.""Legrand is a great partner for Microsoft to work with because of the breadth of solutions they offer across the full room deployment.

The recent study evaluated five blood-based panels5  which included NIS4®  NIS2+™’s predecessor.The study aims to confirm the diagnostic performances of existing biomarker panels and determine their advantage over commonly used laboratory tests (ALT and FIB-4). Such studies conducted provide necessary data for the regulatory approval of biomarkers for the diagnosis of at-risk NASH and is a crucial step in moving the field closer to having qualified Non-Invasive Tests  such as NIS4® or now NIS2+™  that can be used for widespread clinical use.The findings  published in the scientific journal Nature Medicine  concluded that NIS4® achieved an AUROC6 of 0.815 for its intended use of diagnosing at-risk NASH  demonstrating significant superiority over common clinical-laboratory tools. It also confirmed that NIS4® was the only panel efficient for the diagnosis of the composite phenotype of at-risk NASH. Regarding the detection of NASH and significant fibrosis (F≥2) independently  NIS4®’s performance was superior to the other biomarker panels tested  achieving AUROC values of 0.832 and 0.874  respectively.These findings represent an important milestone in NIS4® technology’s path to regulatory approval by the U.S Food and Drug Administration. NIS2+™  the newly published and optimized version of NIS4®  is currently in the process of being independently evaluated through the NIMBLE consortium.Arun J Sanyal  M.D.  Director of the Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Healthat Virginia Commonwealth Universityand Chair of the NIMBLE Consortium  commented: “Such findings will bring us a step closer towards a fully approved biomarker panel which can be made available for widespread clinical use and potentially alleviate the major barrier to care and drug development access. NIS4®’s utility as an effective technology to diagnose at-risk NASH is clearly demonstrated in these findings and we look forward to evaluating NIS4®’s more advanced version  NIS2+™  in the near future.”ABOUT GENFIT’S NASH DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGYNIS2+™ is a blood-based diagnostic technology specifically designed to detect at-risk NASH among patients with metabolic risk factors based on an independent 2-biomarker panel. It is an optimization of the NIS4® technology and was developed and validated by GENFIT as a robust technology across characteristics of interest such as type-2 diabetes  age and sex  allowing large-scale implementation in clinical practice. GENFIT continues to explore the possibility of obtaining regulatory approval and CE Certificates of Conformity  with a development and commercial partner  to release an IVD test powered by NIS2+™ technology on the US and European markets.NIS4® technology  NIS2+™’s predecessor  is being commercialized by Labcorp in the US and Canada as a Laboratory Developed Test. Since May 2021  Labcorp has been commercializing NASHnext®  powered by NIS4® technology  for use in the clinic.

We are excited to collaborate with mdxhealth to validate the GPS test's potential to enhance risk assessment in men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer.""As a pivotal part of this collaboration  mdxhealth will conduct GPS testing on patient samples derived from the Prostate Mechanisms of Progression and Treatment (ProMPT) cohort. Initiated in 2002  the ProMPT collaborative translational research group involves the cooperation of multiple cancer research programs to collect biological samples and clinical data from participants across the United Kingdom.Michael K. McGarrity  CEO of mdxhealth  commented  “This groundbreaking research partnership between mdxhealth and University of Oxford marks a crucial step toward advancing the understanding of prostate cancer progression and treatment outcomes. The outcomes of this collaboration can pave the way for more tailored and effective treatments for patients with localized prostate cancer. We firmly believe that our Genomic Prostate Score test holds the potential to accurately predict disease progression in patients undergoing treatment for localized prostate cancer.”About mdxhealthMdxhealth is a commercial-stage precision diagnostics company that provides actionable molecular information to personalize patient diagnosis and treatment.

Sept. 26  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Legrand®   a global specialist and industry leader in electrical wiring devices  cable management  audio-visual  and lighting solutions  announces new advances with Microsoft to create a new hybrid conferencing space with Signature Microsoft Teams Rooms featuring products from Legrand  North and Central America. Microsoft has become integral to the way we collaborate and learn. Legrand improves lives by transforming spaces where people live and work through innovative products and solutions that deliver and manage power  light and data. Creating a premium in-room experience with the complete conferencing platform is what the Signature Teams Rooms are all about.Signature Teams Rooms were developed to be immersive and inclusive meeting spaces enhanced for hybrid experiences that can be easily deployed at scale around the world. To implement this vision  either for new construction or retrofits  Microsoft had to develop new equipment and standards. This involved changes to the room layout  furniture  audio-visual equipment  and Teams. Microsoft looked at technologies that could make remote employees feel more included in meetings and help people presenting in the room feel more connected to those joining remotely. Legrand proved to be a valuable partner because of the breadth of AV infrastructure  building controls  electrical infrastructure  lighting  and acoustic solutions.For these two new showcase spaces  Legrand provided key components that helped simplify the typical order  delivery  and integration experience for Microsoft. These include:Productivity and AV solutions from Middle Atlantic and Chief  including the Forum Arc Tables which ensure everyone physically in the room faces the camera  the Forum Collaboration Suite Display Stand  which is robust enough to support the Jupiter Pana 105 display  and Chief's Voyager Cart to deliver the Microsoft Surface Hub to any point in the room for better collaboration.Legrand offers a variety of furniture power solutions that supply convenient and configurable power and charging access - including units that install directly into desks  tabletops  and upholstered furniture along with the Evolution Series 8"" Recessed Poke-Thru device for access to power and audio/video services recessed below floor level.Architectural acoustic wall panels from Focal Point provide improved room acoustics for both remote and in-person users while also establishing a cohesive  modern aesthetic with the Forum Display Stand.These products from Legrand combine elegantly  ensuring these spaces are inviting and inclusive in design  and accommodate the speed and scalability of deployment required by Microsoft.""Working with Legrand brings Microsoft a partner that has a massive breadth of product solutions that address a variety of AV and building infrastructure requirements  ranging from leading AV brands to electrical and data infrastructure  to lighting and acoustics. Along with market-leading products  Legrand offers a truly global scale to support Microsoft facilities around the world  enabling global room specifications and availability of products anywhere that Microsoft operates. This partnership and global reach are equally valuable to Microsoft's customers that are similarly working to specify and deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms in large scale around the world "" said John Selldorff  President and CEO of Legrand  North and Central America.""In this Post-Pandemic Era  hybrid workplaces are the future  and in any office  we must consider both in-person and remote experiences. By partnering with Teams  we can combine the technology and breadth of products to design the future of conference rooms to create an exceptional audio-visual experience for employees both in person and remote "" said Selldorff.""Legrand is a great partner for Microsoft to work with because of the breadth of solutions they offer across the full room deployment. In the design of these specific Signature Teams Rooms  Microsoft Digital collaborated with the Legrand team in a hands-on process led by end-user feedback to create an optimal experience for them "" said Sam Albert  Principal Product Manager  The Hive  Microsoft Digital.About Legrand and Legrand  North and Central AmericaLegrand is the global specialist in electrical and digital building infrastructures.

Compared to the first half 2022  the Defence and Space line of business grew by +63%. This strong performance is partly driven by the laser rangefinder business developed in Sweden since May 2022  which contributed €6.5m (versus €0.4m at end of June 2022) over a total of €16.7m for this market segment. The Defence/Space segment is also progressing  thanks to product deliveries for several satellite constellation deployments.

The rate for the Photonics division rose from 64.0% to 65.2%  as a result of a positive product mix effect. For the Medical division  the rate fell slightly from 61.1% to 60.3%  mainly due to a less favourable product mix  the exchange rate  and the limited impact of price increases due to the absorption of the 2022 order book in the first few months of 2023.

The profitability of the Medical division's profitability fell slightly (15.4% vs. 16.4% in H1 2021) due to investment in new product registrations and product launches which will expand geographical markets in the coming months.First-half income from ordinary operations came to €6.0m  compared with €3.9m for the first half of 2022 due to strong revenue performance combined with a stabilized cost base.Following -€2.8m of financial income and expenses (vs -€0.4m in H1 2022 mainly due to unfavorable exchange rate effects on intra-group financial debts with no cash effect for the Group) and +€0.6m of taxes (vs -€0.9m in H1 2022)  net income totaled €0.5m  compared with €1.2m for the first half of 2022.Cash flow: continued strategic capex investmentsand normalisation of WCR(€m) 30/06/2022 30/06/2023 Net cash-flow from operations (10.2)11.0(20.1)(1.0)(18.2)(10.6)(7.2)(0.4)(0.7)-1.3(1.3)(0.7)(29.1) 6.4 Operating cash-flow before interests and tax 11.0 10.5 Change in WCR (20.1) (2.9) Taxes paid (1.0) (1.2) Net cash-flow from investing activities (18.2) (15.1) Capital expenditures (10.6) (14.0) External growth(Securities and assets) (7.2) (1.1) Other financial assets investments (0.4) - Net cash-flow from financing activities (0.7) (3.2) Capital increase - - Net loans issuance 1.3 0.7 Financing cost (1.3) (1.6) Other change (0.7) (2.4) NET CASH FLOW1 (29.1) (11.9)Working capital is stabilized despite strong business growth  against a backdrop of easing tensions over components.

As at 30 June 2023  the company had nearly 470 000 learners registered on its platform  up 27% from the end of June 2022.The service is available in 530 towns and the increasing geographical coverage  particularly in towns with fewer than 50 000 residents  is a priority for the company so that it can reach more learners and gradually increase its market share. Since the start of the year  the company has been present in 35 new towns with fewer than 50 000 inhabitants.Improved interim resultsThe gross margin gradually fell compared to the previous financial year  to 37% of revenue in the first half of 2023 (39.5% in the first half of 2022 and 37.7% in the second half of 2022). This trend  which was anticipated  reflects the progressive shift in the distribution of sales to traditional learners  who generate a lower gross margin than those financing their lessons through their CPF account.Operating expenses remained under control  falling by 14% compared with the 2nd half of 2022  with tighter cost control since the start of the 2023 financial year aimed at reducing payroll and marketing expenses  items which had risen sharply in the 2nd half of the previous financial year. The 9% increase compared with the same period in 2022 is due to the increase in headcount between these 2 periods (72 people employed at 30 June 2023 compared with 60 people at 30 June 2022).Benefiting from best controls over costs  operating losses  which were stable at -€1.7 million compared with the first half of 2022  fell by more than €1 million (-39%) compared to the second half of 2022.After taking into account financial income and tax expense  the net loss was -€1.7 million  a 38% improvement on the second half of the previous year and stable compared with the first half of 2022.At 30 June  cash stands at €7 million  with cash consumption for the first half of the year amounting to €2.6 million  including €0.5 million in loan and interest repayments and €0.2 million invested in the stock exchange liquidity contract.Roll-out of the government’s RDV Permis platform across FranceThe government’s RDV PERMIS driving test platform was definitively rolled out across the whole of France in the second quarter of 2023.It is reshaping the competitive landscape in favour of online driving schools by redistributing the number of driving test slots awarded based on the number of full-time equivalent teachers.In concrete terms  this liberalisation of the market makes lePERMISLIBRE more attractive to learners  as the average waiting time for a driving test stands now at 32 days  compared with 8 months before the government platform became operational.A first half of the year marked by the development of new servicesThe first half of the year was marked by the enrichment and diversification of services  one of the key focuses of lePERMISLIBRE’s development strategy  which can be broken down as follows:The launch of an accelerated driving course  which responds to an increasing demand from applicants looking to obtain their licence very rapidly. Already available in more than 20 major cities  the company plans to gradually roll out this training course more widely in the second half of the year;A focus on the driving licence for cars equipped with automatic gear boxes  which now accounts for almost 40% of lePERMISLIBRE’s lessons in Ile-de-France  responding to an increasing market demand ;The enlargement of the car insurance offer for drivers under 23 years of age following a partnership with MAIF in order to strengthen lePERMISLIBRE’s position on this sector;The launch of a service to simplify the mandatory and binding administrative procedures required when registering for the driving test  now subscribed by almost 400 learners each month.OutlookIn the second half of 2023  lePERMISLIBRE anticipates that the pace of sales growth will be comparable to that seen in the first half of the year and that its results will continue to improve  with operating expenses expected to continue to fall following cost control measures that have been introduced.New insurance services for learner drivers will be announced before the end of the year.The objective of reaching profitability during the 2024 financial year remains unchanged.2023 interim financial reportThe 2023 interim financial report is available on the company’s website: https://www.lepermislibre.fr/investisseurs in the Financial Information / Financial Documents section.Next press release5 October 2023: Q3 revenueABOUT LEPERMISLIBREFounded in Lyon in 2014 and a pioneer of digital driving schools in France  lePERMISLIBRE is reinventing driving lessons by providing a disruptive offering compared to traditional players  more aligned with the new habits and lifestyles of the digital native generation that grew up with the development of digital technology. lePERMISLIBRE federates a community of more than 1 000 loyal  committed and passionate driving instructors  all of whom are State-qualified. Its digital model  which is more agile  totally transparent and 30% cheaper than a traditional driving school  has enabled it to attract nearly 470 000 applicants.With a user rating of nearly 5 stars on Trustpilot  the platform provides personal spaces to offer better learning methods and revisions to the Highway Code  as well as the ability to book driving lessons from over 530 towns and cities throughout France  with the instructor of their choice  7 days a week  from 6 am to 11 pm  freeing students from time and place constraints.The company is listed on Euronext Growth Paris (ISIN: FR001400F2Z1  mnemo: ALLPL) - Eligible for PEA PME - Qualified as an ""Innovative Company"" by Bpifrance.For more information about the company  visit www.lepermislibre.frCONTACTS",neutral,0.07,0.91,0.02,mixed,0.42,0.21,0.37,True,English,"['2023 interim results', 'Lepermislibre', 'September', '11', 'pioneering French online driving school', 'RDV PERMIS driving test platform', 'stock exchange liquidity contract', 'younger generations’ consumption patterns', 'H1 H2 H1 Revenue', 'RDV Permis platform', 'French accounting standards', 'online driving schools', 'working capital requirements', 'favourable regulatory framework', 'full-time equivalent teachers', 'average waiting time', 'increasing geographical coverage', 'accelerated driving course', 'operating cycle financing', 'tighter cost control', 'interim financial statements', 'lower gross margin', 'O/w payroll expenses', 'personal training account', 'previous financial year', 'test slots', 'financial income', 'increasing demand', 'training course', 'Operating expenses', 'driving licence', 'cash consumption', 'previous year', 'driving lessons', 'marketing expenses', 'Operating income', '2023 financial year', 'operating losses', 'government platform', 'Press release', '2023 interim results', 'Net income', 'statutory auditors', 'limited review', 'first half', 'same period', 'traditional candidates', 'CPF candidates', 'second half', 'progressive shift', 'CPF account', '2nd half', 'best controls', 'tax expense', 'net loss', 'interest repayments', 'second quarter', 'competitive landscape', 'concrete terms', 'key focuses', '20 major cities', 'traditional learners', 'CPF learners', 'total revenue', 'market share', 'development strategy', '35 new towns', 'new services', '470,000 learners', '530 towns', 'lePERMISLIBRE', 'Lyon', 'unaudited', 'Board', 'Directors', '25 September', 'report', '+74% increase', 'sales', 'rebalancing', 'activity', 'hourly', 'hours', 'digitisation', 'roll-out', '30 June', 'company', 'end', 'fewer', '50,000 residents', 'priority', 'start', '50,000 inhabitants', 'distribution', 'items', '9% increase', 'headcount', '2 periods', '72 people', '60 people', 'costs', '38% improvement', 'loan', 'France', 'number', 'liberalisation', '32 days', 'enrichment', 'diversification', 'launch', 'applicants', 'cars', '2022']",2023-09-26,2023-09-27,marketscreener.com

The new information includes estimated ranges for each 2024 tax bracket as well as projections for a growing number of inflation-sensitive tax figures  such as the standard deduction. These annual projections are based on the relevant inflation data recently reported by the U.S. Department of Labor.Key Tax Savings  Inflation-Adjusted Projections for 2024Projections based on the Department of Labor’s inflation figures for the 12-month period between August 31  2022 and August 31  2023 suggest most taxpayers will experience significant inflation-driven “tax cut” savings in comparison to their 2023 tax return filings. An example of how taxpayers will benefit on 2024 tax returns  when compared to 2023 tax returns based on the inflation adjustments provided under the current tax code  follows:Because of the income ranges bracketing  the inflation adjustments will provide an effective “tax cut” by taxing more income at lower marginal tax rates. A single filer with taxable income of $50 000 should owe $254.50 less next year due to the adjustments to the income tax rate brackets between 2023 and 2024.A married couple filing jointly with a total taxable income of $130 000 should pay $509 less income taxes for 2024 tax returns than they will on the same income for 2023 because of indexing of their tax brackets for 2024.The additional standard deduction for those 65-years-old and older or who are blind will increase $50 to $1 550 for 2024 tax returns  with an increase of $100 to $1 950 for single aged 65 or older or blind filers.Other Inflation-adjusted Tax Estimates for 2024The standard deduction for single  married filing jointly  and married filing separately filers is expected to rise for 2024: at $14 600  $29 200 and $14 600  respectively  up from $13 850  $27 700 and $13 850. The standard deduction for heads of household is expected to rise $1 100 to $21 900 for 2024. Any increase in the standard deduction  of course  can produce lower taxes by decreasing the taxpayer’s taxable income.The estate and gift tax applicable exemption was increased by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amount has been adjusted for inflation by Congress and is now projected at $13 610 000 for 2024. A spousal portability election can now effectively protect double that amount against estate and gift tax ($27 220 000 for 2024). The annual gift tax exclusion for 2024 is projected to increase to $18 000 for gifts to each recipient.The 2024 foreign earned income exclusion will increase to $126 500 for 2024  up from $120 000 for 2023.Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting 2024 Tax Projections*As cited earlier  Wolters Kluwer TAA projections for indexed amounts are based on the relevant inflation data released by the U.S. Department of Labor.

For example  the Code now requires over 50 other inflation-driven computations to determine deduction  credit and exclusion amounts in addition to the 50 separate computations needed to inflation-adjust the tax bracket schedules each year. Estimates for any of the inflation-adjusted tax figures for 2024  of course  are also necessarily subject to any changes to the tax law that may be made by Congress over the course of the next year.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG.

The Company has benefited from an increase of the research tax credit of €0.6 million  granted by the French government to encourage companies to conduct technical and scientific research  and from the collaboration agreement signed with LianBio generating an additional €1.3 million revenue for the six months ended June 30  2023.Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenses: R&D expenses consist primarily of preclinical  clinical and manufacturing expenses related to the development of NBTXR3. These expenses for the six months ended June 30  2023  were €17.8 million  compared to €16.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2022. Purchases  sub-contracting and other expenses increased by €1.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30  2023  as compared to the same period in 2022. This increase reflects the Company’s focus on advancing its clinical trial development priorities  specifically the global Phase 3 registrational trial  NANORAY-312.Selling  General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses: SG&A expenses consist primarily of administrative employee-related expenses  legal and other professional fees  patent filing and maintenance fees  and insurance. Total SG&A expenses for the six months ended June 30  2023  were €10.9 million  compared to €9.6 million for the prior-year six-month period. Purchases  fees and other expenses increased by €1.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30  2023 as compared to the same period in 2022  and mainly relates to €1.4 million fees paid to a financial advisor  whereas SG&A payroll cost remained stable as compared to the same period in 2022.Net loss: Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the six months ended June 30  2023 was €28.1 million  or €0.80 per share. This compares to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of €26.4 million  or €0.76 per share  for the same period in 2022.Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30  2023  were €21.6 million  compared to €41.4 million as of December 31  2022.Based on the current operating plan and financial projections  we anticipate that the cash and cash equivalents of €21.6 million as of June 30  2023  in conjunction with the $30M upfront and $5M initial equity tranche received subsequently  extents into the first quarter of 2024  which does not take into account any potential future financing  or cash inflow resulting from milestones or future collaborations. For clarity’s sake  if the EIB cash covenant would not be in place  the cash and cash equivalents would be sufficient to fund its operating expenses into the second quarter of 2024.Subsequent to the Company’s licensing agreement executed with Janssen  the Company has entered into discussions with the EIB aiming to remove the cash covenant from the debt financing agreement between the Company and EIB. These discussions have culminated in an agreement in principle on key terms  that would result in the removal of the cash covenant in its entirety  in exchange for an acceleration of payment of a portion of the applicable Milestones Payments calculated using an escalating single digit percentage applied to bracketed funding amounts in the event of an equity funding event and the payment of scheduled PIK interest. Execution of the definitive amendment to the agreements between Nanobiotix and EIB is subject to finalization of necessary documentation and is expected at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023  which has the potential to positively influence our cash runway.The Company’s executive board determined it is appropriate to prepare its half-year 2023 unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis  assuming the Company will continue to operate for the foreseeable future  and to address its liquidity challenges by pursuing activities to generate additional cash inflows and by closely managing its operating expenditures  based on assumptions described in the half-year 2023 financial report.Availability of the half-year financial reportThe 2023 half-year financial report has been filed with the French financial markets authority (Autorité des marchés financiers).

Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2021  the Company announced an agreement with LianBio to expand development of NBTXR3 into Greater China and other Asian Markets  and in 2023 Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

Commercial cartridges are now exclusively produced on the more automated high-throughput manufacturing line ML2 after having decommissioned the older manufacturing line ML1 during Q1 2023Organizational updateOperational reorganization and cost reduction program The operational reorganization and cost reduction program announced on 15 June 2023 is in its finalization phase. In total  approximately 125 positions will be reduced. In addition  the role of approximately 20 positions has significantly changed. A proportion of these positions will be phased out during the remainder of 2023  to ensure a smooth handover of activities. The reorganization is realized through a transition to a leaner and more agile management structure and an increased focus on partner funded test menu expansion and a more targeted US commercial strategy to increase oncology test utilization. The reorganization is expected to achieve an annualized cost reduction of approximately EUR 18m. The process has been completed in accordance with the Belgian rules on collective dismissals. Total cost associated with the operational reorganization amount up to EUR 4.3m Going forward  enabling access to molecular diagnostic testing in oncology remains at the core of Biocartis’ strategy with a streamlined organization that will focus investments on profitable product revenue generation and strategic partnerships that have the potential to generate significant long-term valueManagement changes: Appointment of Roger Moody as new CEO per 24 April 2023   with Herman Verrelst transitioning into the role of Chair of the Board of Directors Appointment of George Cardoza as new CFO and Head of Service Delivery per 7 August 2023 following the resignation of Jean-Marc Roelandt as the Company’s CFO per 4 Aug 2023 Resignation of Piet Houwen as COO per 1 September 2023 as part of the operational reorganizationCartridge manufacturing – The transfer of all Idylla™ assays to the second generation cartridge manufacturing line (‘ML2’) was completed and all commercial cartridge manufacturing production on ML1 was stopped after Q1 2023. Continued scaling of the more automated high-throughput manufacturing line ML2 is expected to further reduce cartridge production cost and contribute to a gross margin on products of 40-45% for the full year 2023New Medical Advisory Board – creation of new Medical Advisory Board announced on 28 August 2023 comprised of renowned practice leaders to assist with expedited growth of diagnostics partnerships and provide valuable expert technology insights  expert knowledge in the field of oncology in general and of pharma needs in particularIdylla™ test menu  partnerships & publicationsTest menu and product registrations Launch among selected customers on 9 February 2023 of the Idylla™ IDH1-2 Mutation Assay Kit (RUO).

Collaboration revenue amounted to EUR 6m in H1 2023 compared to EUR 5.1m in H1 2022 and largely consisted of development services delivered to our growing network of strategic partners Gross profit – Gross profit on product sales amounted to EUR 9m  an increase of 32% from EUR 6.6m in H1 2022. The gross margin on products continue to increase  from 32% in H1 2022 to 40% in H1 2023  driven by continued scaling of the high-throughput manufacturing line ML2 and the increasing ASP. Q1 2023 was the last quarter that included cartridge production on the old manufacturing line ML1  which is now no longer in use for commercial cartridge production. The overall cartridge ASP increased from EUR 103 in H1 2022 to EUR 115 in H1 2023  as a result of declining sales of the cheaper Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2 tests and the continued increased contribution of higher-priced novel tests in oncologyOPEX – Total operating expenses (excluding cost of sales) of EUR 37m in H1 2023 slightly decreased by EUR 0.7m from EUR 37.7m in H1 2022. The cost reduction implemented during Q4 2022 was partly offset by the impact of the high inflation which led to a mandatory indexation of wages and salaries in January 2023 of over 11% in BelgiumOperating result – The sustained revenue growth and the increased gross profit contributed to a 20% y-o-y improvement of EBITDA  from EUR -18.2m in H1 2022 to EUR -14.5m in H1 2023Net cash flow and cash position – Cash burn from operating activities increased from EUR 24.2m to EUR 29.3m  despite the improved operating result  which was offset by EUR 10.3m investments in working capital (H1 2022: EUR 2.6m) and EUR 1m higher interest expenses. Last year  working capital was favorably impacted by the collection of the fire insurance claim. Moreover  a significant amount of transaction fees associated with the recapitalization were paid during the first half of 2023 and trade receivable increased a.o. because of the deferred payment of services to certain collaboration partners that are expected to be collected during the second half of 2023. Investing cash flows amounted to EUR 1.1m and included the drawdown of the convertible note by SkylineDx after having reached an agreed milestone in the development of the Idylla™ version of SkylineDx’s Merlin assay. On 16 January 2023  the comprehensive recapitalization was completed  and the financing cash flows included EUR 34.4m of net proceeds from the issuance of EUR 25m of new second lien convertible bonds and the final drawdown of EUR 12m under the convertible term loanIDYLLA™ TEST MENU OUTLOOKAfter having obtained US FDA 510(k) clearance for the Idylla™ MSI Test in Q1 2023 and the global availability of the Idylla™ IDH1-2 Mutation Assay Kit (RUO)  Biocartis expects to achieve the following regulatory milestones and to launch the assays listed below.

Estelle ® (Nextstellis ® ) U.S. product sales volumes ( i.e.   dispensed cycles) by Mayne Pharma increased by 80% in H1 2023  compared to H2 2022. Estelle H1 revenues were impacted by lower supply sales to Mayne  as Mayne sold trade units from inventory purchased in 2022 during H1 2023. Mayne's promotional initiatives to ramp up Estelle's U.S. sales also led to Mithra predominantly supplying sample units for the U.S. market during H1 2023 at reduced prices. As a result  while U.S. sales volumes by Mayne improved  a similar increase in supply sales volume is not reflected in Mithra’s H1 2023 Estelle ® sales figures  which also were impacted by lower supply prices. Given the 80% increase in sales volume by Mayne Pharma in H1 2023  compared to H2 2022  the continuing increase in sales volumes in U.S. and Europe  and the generally temporary nature of promotional product pricing   the average Estelle supply price and volume are in good shape to rebound in the future.in H1 2023  compared to H2 2022.

The majority concerns Myring sales in Europe  Canada and since December 2022  in U.S. Estelle H1 revenues were impacted by lower supply sales to Mayne  as Mayne sold trade units from inventory purchased in 2022 during H1 2023. Mayne's promotional initiatives to ramp up Estelle's U.S. sales also led to Mithra predominantly supplying sample units for the U.S. market during H1 2023 at reduced prices. As a result  while U.S. sales volumes by Mayne improved  a similar increase in supply sales volume is not reflected in Mithra’s H1 2023 Estelle® sales figures  which also were impacted by lower supply prices. Revenues from Estelle® (Drovelis®) EU product sales achieved EUR 1.5 million in H1 2023  as Gedeon Richter continued to launch the product in new countries: Ecuador and Malta  as well as Chile in August 2023.Research and development expenses (including depreciation) increased by 17.7% to EUR 32.3 million  compared to EUR 27.5 million in the first half of 2022. This increase is mainly attributable to Donesta® clinical studies and the end of Phase 3 in the US.General and administrative expenses and selling expenses are relatively stable versus the same period in 2022.Other operating income (EUR 1.9 million compared to EUR 3.9 million in the first half 2022) are composed of: R&D tax credit for EUR 0.5 million; wage tax reductions for researchers of EUR 0.5 million  and of costs reinvoicing for EUR 0.4 million.The negative impact of approximately EUR -0.9 million for change in fair value related to contingent consideration payable Estelle® is mainly the consequence of the updated of both discount rate and timing effect.The decrease in financial income is explained by the impact of the remeasurement of refundable government advances measured at amortized cost  due to the review of revenue forecasts.Increase of financial expenses is mostly driven by interest charges linked to the higher financial liabilities during the period  which are higher than first half 2022. The financial expenses contain interests and commitment fees paid in kind to Highbridge and Whitebox lenders for a total amount of EUR 2.8 millionThe group recorded a tax income of EUR 1 million for the six months mainly resulting from the review of tax impact on temporary differences  partially offset by the recognition of tax losses carried forward. The latter are limited compared to previous periods in the view of the tax forecasts and the accumulated losses already recorded on the balance sheet (to be set off against future taxable income).Alternative performance measuresMithra has applied some alternative performance measures (APMs) that are not defined by IFRS but that provide helpful additional information to better assess how the business has performed over the period.

However  it became evident that difficult market conditions combined with the Company’s balance sheet and historic burn rate made outside funding unattainable. Given this reality  the recapitalization and balance sheet restructuring plan by the secured creditors that we announced today  while disappointing to shareholders and unsecured bondholders  is necessary to fund operations and clear up most of the debt and provide long-term stability for the Biocartis business entities. The recapitalization and balance sheet restructuring plan will safeguard the interests of our customers  suppliers  partners  and employees and allows the operational Biocartis companies to continue their mission to enable universal access to personalized medicine for patients around the world by making molecular testing convenient  fast  and suitable for any lab.The operational performance of the Biocartis business in H1 2023 underpins the strong fundamentals of the business. A solid 22% growth of core cartridge revenue in oncology and a 40% gross margin on product sales were complemented by a consistent contribution of collaboration revenues from our growing network of strategic partners.I am convinced that  under the new  recapitalized holding company and in combination with the operational reorganization and cost reduction program that are now being completed  we will now accelerate the path to becoming a financially healthy and sustainable business.“Recapitalization and Balance Sheet Restructuring PlanThe Company today announced an agreement by its secured creditors on a comprehensive corporate restructuring and recapitalization transaction (the “Transaction”). The Transaction will safeguard the interests of customers  suppliers  partners  and employees of Biocartis  and help to continue and execute the growth strategy towards profitability of its operations and will provide for the following:The Company’s secured creditors will take ownership of the Biocartis operating subsidiaries through enforcement. Following enforcement  Biocartis Group NV is expected to be wound down in an orderly fashion.A new entity will be incorporated (“ New Biocartis ”)  owned by the secured creditors  to which substantially all the Company’s assets will be transferred upon an anticipated security enforcement by the secured creditors over the Company’s assets that were pledged to such creditors.”)  owned by the secured creditors  to which substantially all the Company’s assets will be transferred upon an anticipated security enforcement by the secured creditors over the Company’s assets that were pledged to such creditors. Lenders under the Company’s first lien convertible term loan facility and KBC have agreed to roll over their first lien debt into New Biocartis (or its wholly owned subsidiaries) and release claims against Biocartis Group NV. KBC have agreed to extend their financing to Biocartis NV and Biocartis US  Inc.The interests and claims of the EUR 16 million unsecured 4.00% convertible bonds due 2027 (ISIN BE0002651322) will be written down to zero pursuant to their terms as part of the enforcement.Shareholders of Biocartis Group NV will receive no distribution from the security enforcement and are expected to receive nothing at the time of its wind down.With respect to New Biocartis: The Company’s EUR 116 million 4.5% Second Ranking Secured Convertible Bonds due 2026 (ISIN BE6338582206) (the “ Bonds ”  and the holders of the Bonds  the “ Bondholders ”) will be fully equitized in New Biocartis and the Bondholders will become the primary owners of Biocartis’s operating business as shareholders of New Biocartis. The Bondholders will recapitalize New Biocartis (and its operating subsidiaries) with EUR 40 million of equity capital  backstopped by a group of supporting Bondholders (the “ Equity Injection ”). Following the full equitization of EUR 116 million of Bonds  the write down of EUR 16 million of Unsecured 2027 Bonds  and the closing of the Equity Injection  New Biocartis will have less than EUR 45 million of gross debt and net debt of approximately zero.H1 Financial highlightsProduct related revenue of EUR 23.5m (H1 2022: EUR 21.3m)  including EUR 18.4m from 155k cartridges sold and EUR 5.1m from instrument sales  rentals  and servicing: EUR 17.5m cartridge revenue in oncology  +22% year-on-year  driven by 14% cartridge volume growth and an increase of the average selling price (‘ASP’) by 7% The contribution of COVID-19 testing to cartridge revenues decreased from EUR 1.7m in H1 2022 to EUR 0.7m in H1 2023  down to 3% of total product related sales ASP per commercial cartridge of EUR 120 in oncology and EUR 115 overall (H1 2022: EUR 113 and EUR 103  resp.)

Commercial cartridges are now exclusively produced on the more automated high-throughput manufacturing line ML2 after having decommissioned the older manufacturing line ML1 during Q1 2023Organizational updateOperational reorganization and cost reduction program The operational reorganization and cost reduction program announced on 15 June 2023 is in its finalization phase. In total  approximately 125 positions will be reduced. In addition  the role of approximately 20 positions has significantly changed. A proportion of these positions will be phased out during the remainder of 2023  to ensure a smooth handover of activities. The reorganization is realized through a transition to a leaner and more agile management structure and an increased focus on partner funded test menu expansion and a more targeted US commercial strategy to increase oncology test utilization. The reorganization is expected to achieve an annualized cost reduction of approximately EUR 18m. The process has been completed in accordance with the Belgian rules on collective dismissals. Total cost associated with the operational reorganization amount up to EUR 4.3m Going forward  enabling access to molecular diagnostic testing in oncology remains at the core of Biocartis’ strategy with a streamlined organization that will focus investments on profitable product revenue generation and strategic partnerships that have the potential to generate significant long-term valueManagement changes: Appointment of Roger Moody as new CEO per 24 April 2023  with Herman Verrelst transitioning into the role of Chair of the Board of Directors Appointment of George Cardoza as new CFO and Head of Service Delivery per 7 August 2023 following the resignation of Jean-Marc Roelandt as the Company’s CFO per 4 Aug 2023 Resignation of Piet Houwen as COO per 1 September 2023 as part of the operational reorganizationCartridge manufacturing – The transfer of all Idylla™ assays to the second generation cartridge manufacturing line (‘ML2’) was completed and all commercial cartridge manufacturing production on ML1 was stopped after Q1 2023.

Collaboration revenue amounted to EUR 6m in H1 2023 compared to EUR 5.1m in H1 2022 and largely consisted of development services delivered to our growing network of strategic partners Gross profit – Gross profit on product sales amounted to EUR 9m  an increase of 32% from EUR 6.6m in H1 2022. The gross margin on products continue to increase  from 32% in H1 2022 to 40% in H1 2023  driven by continued scaling of the high-throughput manufacturing line ML2 and the increasing ASP. Q1 2023 was the last quarter that included cartridge production on the old manufacturing line ML1  which is now no longer in use for commercial cartridge production. The overall cartridge ASP increased from EUR 103 in H1 2022 to EUR 115 in H1 2023  as a result of declining sales of the cheaper Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2 tests and the continued increased contribution of higher-priced novel tests in oncologyOPEX – Total operating expenses (excluding cost of sales) of EUR 37m in H1 2023 slightly decreased by EUR 0.7m from EUR 37.7m in H1 2022. The cost reduction implemented during Q4 2022 was partly offset by the impact of the high inflation which led to a mandatory indexation of wages and salaries in January 2023 of over 11% in BelgiumOperating result – The sustained revenue growth and the increased gross profit contributed to a 20% y-o-y improvement of EBITDA  from EUR -18.2m in H1 2022 to EUR -14.5m in H1 2023Net cash flow and cash position – Cash burn from operating activities increased from EUR 24.2m to EUR 29.3m  despite the improved operating result  which was offset by EUR 10.3m investments in working capital (H1 2022: EUR 2.6m) and EUR 1m higher interest expenses. Last year  working capital was favorably impacted by the collection of the fire insurance claim. Moreover  a significant amount of transaction fees associated with the recapitalization were paid during the first half of 2023 and trade receivable increased a.o. because of the deferred payment of services to certain collaboration partners that are expected to be collected during the second half of 2023. Investing cash flows amounted to EUR 1.1m and included the drawdown of the convertible note by SkylineDx after having reached an agreed milestone in the development of the Idylla™ version of SkylineDx’s Merlin assay. On 16 January 2023  the comprehensive recapitalization was completed  and the financing cash flows included EUR 34.4m of net proceeds from the issuance of EUR 25m of new second lien convertible bonds and the final drawdown of EUR 12m under the convertible term loanIDYLLA™ TEST MENU OUTLOOKAfter having obtained US FDA 510(k) clearance for the Idylla™ MSI Test in Q1 2023 and the global availability of the Idylla™ IDH1-2 Mutation Assay Kit (RUO)  Biocartis expects to achieve the following regulatory milestones and to launch the assays listed below.

September 26  2023. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® (dupilumab) to treat children aged 1 to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The target action date for the FDA decision is January 31  2024. Dupixent is the first and only treatment in the U.S. approved for children and adults aged 12 years and older with EoE  weighing at least 40kg.The sBLA is supported by data from the Phase 3 EoE KIDS trial (Parts A and B) evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in children aged 1 to 11 with EoE. In Part A  the primary endpoint was met for the proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission (defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils [eos]/high power field [hpf]) at 16 weeks for tiered dosing regimens based on body weight  compared to placebo. Part B was an active treatment extension period evaluating Dupixent for an additional 36 weeks and showed Dupixent maintained histologic remission for 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint. Dupixent also led to increases in body weight for age percentile  which was evaluated as an exploratory endpoint in Part A and a secondary endpoint in Part B.Safety results in Parts A and B of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its FDA-approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. Adverse events more commonly observed (≥5%) with Dupixent were COVID-19  rash  headache  viral gastroenteritis  diarrhea and nausea.Priority review is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority in this setting.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic  progressive disease driven by type 2 inflammation that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. In children  common symptoms of EoE include heart burn  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  food refusal and failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth and development and can cause food-related fear and anxiety  which can persist through adulthood. Dietary adjustments  including the elimination of many foods  are the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. Continuous treatment of EoE may be needed to reduce the risk of complications and disease recurrence.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops  and commercializes life- transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

September 26  2023. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® (dupilumab) to treat children aged 1 to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The target action date for the FDA decision is January 31  2024. Dupixent is the first and only treatment in the U.S. approved for children and adults aged 12 years and older with EoE  weighing at least 40kg.The sBLA is supported by data from the Phase 3 EoE KIDS trial (Parts A and B) evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in children aged 1 to 11 with EoE. In Part A  the primary endpoint was met for the proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission (defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils [eos]/high power field [hpf]) at 16 weeks for tiered dosing regimens based on body weight  compared to placebo. Part B was an active treatment extension period evaluating Dupixent for an additional 36 weeks and showed Dupixent maintained histologic remission for 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint. Dupixent also led to increases in body weight for age percentile  which was evaluated as an exploratory endpoint in Part A and a secondary endpoint in Part B.Safety results in Parts A and B of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its FDA-approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. Adverse events more commonly observed (≥5%) with Dupixent were COVID-19  rash  headache  viral gastroenteritis  diarrhea and nausea.Priority review is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority in this setting.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic  progressive disease driven by type 2 inflammation that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. In children  common symptoms of EoE include heart burn  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  food refusal and failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth and development and can cause food-related fear and anxiety  which can persist through adulthood. Dietary adjustments  including the elimination of many foods  are the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. Continuous treatment of EoE may be needed to reduce the risk of complications and disease recurrence.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops  and commercializes life- transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® (dupilumab) to treat children aged 1 to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The target action date for the FDA decision is January 31  2024. Dupixent is the first and only treatment in the U.S. approved for children and adults aged 12 years and older with EoE  weighing at least 40kg.The sBLA is supported by data from the Phase 3 EoE KIDS trial (Parts A and B) evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in children aged 1 to 11 with EoE. In Part A  the primary endpoint was met for the proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission (defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils [eos]/high power field [hpf]) at 16 weeks for tiered dosing regimens based on body weight  compared to placebo. Part B was an active treatment extension period evaluating Dupixent for an additional 36 weeks and showed Dupixent maintained histologic remission for 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint. Dupixent also led to increases in body weight for age percentile  which was evaluated as an exploratory endpoint in Part A and a secondary endpoint in Part B.Safety results in Parts A and B of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its FDA-approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40kg. Adverse events more commonly observed (≥5%) with Dupixent compared to placebo were COVID-19  rash  headache  viral gastroenteritis  diarrhea and nausea.Priority review is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority in this setting.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic  progressive disease driven by type 2 inflammation that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. In children  common symptoms of EoE include heartburn  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  food refusal and failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth and development and can cause food-related fear and anxiety  which can persist through adulthood. Dietary adjustments  including the elimination of many foods  are the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. Continuous treatment of EoE may be needed to reduce the risk of complications and disease recurrence.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE and prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® (dupilumab) to treat children aged 1 to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The target action date for the FDA decision is January 31  2024. Dupixent is the first and only treatment in the U.S. approved for children and adults aged 12 years and older with EoE  weighing at least 40kg.The sBLA is supported by data from the Phase 3 EoE KIDS trial (Parts A and B) evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in children aged 1 to 11 with EoE. In Part A  the primary endpoint was met for the proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission (defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils [eos]/high power field [hpf]) at 16 weeks for tiered dosing regimens based on body weight  compared to placebo. Part B was an active treatment extension period evaluating Dupixent for an additional 36 weeks and showed Dupixent maintained histologic remission for 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint. Dupixent also led to increases in body weight for age percentile  which was evaluated as an exploratory endpoint in Part A and a secondary endpoint in Part B.Safety results in Parts A and B of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its FDA-approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40kg. Adverse events more commonly observed (≥5%) with Dupixent compared to placebo were COVID-19  rash  headache  viral gastroenteritis  diarrhea and nausea.Priority review is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority in this setting.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic  progressive disease driven by type 2 inflammation that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. In children  common symptoms of EoE include heartburn  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  food refusal and failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth and development and can cause food-related fear and anxiety  which can persist through adulthood. Dietary adjustments  including the elimination of many foods  are the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. Continuous treatment of EoE may be needed to reduce the risk of complications and disease recurrence.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE and prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

Investors will then have the option to purchase Coty shares either in euros for shares listed on Euronext Paris or dollars for shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The completion of the proposed offering is subject to a number of conditions.In an interview with WWD in May  Coty Inc chief executive officer Sue Y. Nabi explained why the company was mulling a dual listing.“European investors want to buy Coty stock. It’s as simple as this ” she said. “This is the right moment to do so. Eleven quarters in line or ahead of expectation is a good moment to start this. I would say that on the Paris Stock Exchange half of the market cap is made with beauty and luxury companies  and we are a beauty and luxury company.”The news comes just days after Coty raised its full-year sales outlook as the fragrance effect shows no sign of slowing.The beauty company  which holds the fragrance licenses for myriad brands such as Gucci and Hugo Boss  said that in the four weeks since it released its latest quarterly earnings it has seen strong momentum in beauty demand across key markets and categories  particularly in prestige fragrances as Burberry Goddess sets new market records.As a result  Coty is now expecting core like-for-like sales growth of between 8 percent and 10 percent for fiscal 2024  up from its earlier guidance of 6 percent to 8 percent.At the same time  Coty lifted its adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization forecast to between about $1.08 billion and $1.09 billion  from a range of $1.07 billion to $1.08 billion.However  the company made no changes to its earnings per share forecast  which is expected to hit a range of between 44 cents and 47 cents  below Wall Street estimates of 48 cents. — KATHRYN HOPKINSBALENCIAGA BRANCHES OUT: Balenciaga continues to invest in Los Angeles  growing its footprint ahead of its Dec. 2 fashion show.The Kering-owned brand now has two locations on Rodeo Drive  and unveiled a new store Monday.A first look at the new Balenciaga store  located at 418 North Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.

These new stores will provide our latest customer experiences with the largest personalized spaces for our VIP clients.”Courtesy of Balenciaga/Noua Unu StudioOf the destination  he said  “This iconic city is home to our historical and current top clients. Shopping in L.A. is a very unique experience and became a global destination.”In what the brand calls “Raw Architecture ” the design keeps with its new look under creative director Demna. It’s a monochromatic interior with an industrial feel  featuring cement bricks  tiles  concrete floors  bare metal racks and banisters  while adored with aluminum tables and faux leather benches. Outside  the two-story facade is viewable from the street  with large glass panels.It’s “conceived to question the nature of authenticity by using existing structural elements and adding evocative details such as simulated corrosion and intentional roughness — a concept that inherently creates less waste and depletes less resources ” the brand describes the construction.Balenciaga is expected to show its fall 2024 men’s and women’s collections in L.A.  thought the venue and details are still unknown.“Balenciaga fosters creativity  craft and innovation and always had a strong connection to Los Angeles ” said Charbit. — RYMA CHIKHOUNEWISH UPON A STAR: Disney enlisted artists and designers  including Schiaparelli’s Daniel Roseberry  Kenzo’s Nigo and Christian Louboutin to contribute pieces to their Create 100 project  which celebrates a century of the House of Mickey Mouse.Andelman cocreated a collection of 100 pillows with artist Harry Nuriev that resemble Disney children’s books  and the idea inspired her to curate an event at Chanel’s 7L bookshop to kick off Paris Fashion Week.Sarah Andelman and Harry Nuriev with their giant pillow books for Disney’s Create 100. Miguel Rosales / Courtesy DisneyAndelman’s puffy tomes can be rearranged as chairs or a sofa  and sit center stage in the exhibit  next to a six-foot sculpture of Sorcerer’s Apprentice Mickey from the film “Fantasia ” designed by Alaska Alaska for Virgil Abloh Securities.Other objects presented include a showstopper of a necklace from Roseberry  inspired by the characters Cody and the eagle princess Marahute from “The Rescuers ” while Nigo created a “life-size” Yoda sculpture  and Maison Margiela deconstructed a traditional Mickey Mouse T-shirt.Artist Charlie Kirihara customized a pair of Adidas shoes  while artist Gabriella Noelle created a chair inspired by Mickey Mouse  including ears and oversized extremities. Christian Louboutin’s collaboration with Marvel is in the collection  too.Items from Cactus Plant Flea Market  Sara Shakeel and Valentino are also on display. The designers were given carte blanche to play.“Everybody grew up with this. We all have memories from our childhood  discovering the stories through books or movies ” said Andelman  who cited “Roger Rabbit” and “The Jungle Book” as personal favorites.Andelman noted that Disney has now expanded to include Star Wars  the Marvel universe  The Simpsons and other properties like National Geographic.“It’s such an empire of cool things ” she said.“There is so many different options now to make it fun and to make it more chic — I think it’s a no-limit world for designers to pick characters to play with ” she said. “And I think Disney enjoys to show that it has a space in fashion because they are both visionary and creative.”“We are thrilled that Sarah Andelman is one of our collaborators and this event  timed to coincide with the start of Paris Fashion Week  is an opportunity to showcase her one-of-a-kind beautiful piece. It truly brings to life the fun  energy and playfulness of our beloved characters — everything we wanted from this anniversary celebration ” said Liz Shortreed  Disney senior vice president global fashion and home.The opening night event welcomed designers and executives from the fashion industry  as well as hosted what is likely to be the most fanciful guest list of the week with Mickey  Minnie and other characters making their way from Disneyland Paris.All of the items will be up for auction to benefit the children’s charity Make-a-Wish  plus Disney will donate $1 million to the foundation. The auction will run from Oct. 12 to 30 online. — RHONDA RICHFORDTWICE AS NICE: Two: Minds  the New York luxury concept store from former Jeffrey buyer Jesse Dong  has migrated southward  opening a second outpost in Miami’s Coconut Grove.The two-story unit situated across from Cipriani’s Mr. C Hotel occupies 6 800 square feet — more than double that of the original Meatpacking District location.Inside Two: Minds Miami. Courtesy of Two: MindsTwo: Minds debuted in 2021 with an investment from Ohio-based merchant Robert Rosenthal. It was one of the first tenants to revitalize the Gansevoort Row shopping district  which grew sleepy after a slew of pandemic-related closures.Dong  a Coconut Grove resident for nearly six years  chose the neighborhood because he felt it similarly “underserved” fashion-wise.“When you think of Miami fashion  everyone automatically assumes Design District or Bal Harbor ” he said. “But when I visited Coconut Grove  the pace slowed. It felt like a resort town with incredible schools and booming restaurants. The only aspect missing was a great place to shop.”To create a cohesive look for his growing retail network  Dong partnered with ICD Workshop on the interiors  which he described as “bright  airy  and open” with an industrial minimalist vibe.Exposed pipes and concrete floors are softened by midcentury-inspired furniture  like re-editions of Pierre Jeanneret’s wicker chairs. Overhead cloud chandeliers from Parisian designer Celine Wright decorate the 30-foot ceilings. Marble accents in Two: Minds’ signature emerald green feature throughout to contrast the stark white palette.Inside Two: Minds Miami. Courtesy of Two: MindsFilling out the space is a mix of men’s and women’s ready-to-wear  accessories and fine jewelry from the likes of Alexander McQueen  Bottega Veneta  Dries Van Noten  Khaite and Renee Lewis.Emerging British designer Jacob Lee  exclusive to Two: Minds in the U.S.  is a new name to the roster as are Italian favorites for tropical dressing  Missoni and Pucci  though Dong was adamant the Miami store not be too resortwear driven. “The climate is much warmer here  but the fashion customer is well traveled ” he explained  adding “it’s important we dress them for every occasion.”Dong will amplify Two: Minds’ presence within the local community through events. He is planning a fashion show on Fisher Island and will follow up on last year’s activation at Art Basel with a a bigger one during the 2024 edition. — ARI STARKPICTURE PERFECT: Athleticism aside  the New York City Ballet always delivers a solid dose of fashion. Next month  Rizzoli has highlighted some of those standout moments with the release of “New York City Ballet: Choreography & Couture ” a book chockablock with 250 photos.NYCB upped that fashion quota by enlisting the talents of major designers through its annual fall fashion gala. Thom Browne  Sarah Burton  Iris van Herpen  Valentino  Carolina Herrera  Prabal Gurung  Raf Simons  Alejandro Gomez Palomo  Christopher John Rogers  Giles Deacon and the late Virgil Abloh were among those who have collaborated. The 208-page tome shows off the craftsmanship that the NYCB Costume Shop has orchestrated in the past decade.NYCB’s director of costumes Marc Happel has written the book to help shed some light on how designers’ ideas for costumes come to fruition through original drawings and technical tweaks  as well as dancers’ memories about performing in the creations. Ballet-going readers will recognize some of the company’s top talent on the pages — including Olivia Boisson  India Bradley  Chun Wai Chan  Jovani Furlan  Gonzalo Garcia  Christopher Grant  Alec Knight  Sara Mearns  Miriam Miller  Mira Nadon and Mimi Staker. Photographer Peter Dukovic handled the imagery  which includes close-ups of the intricacies of the costumes. Sarah Jessica Parker  who dreamt up NYCB’s fall fashion gala in 2012  penned the book’s foreword. The Museum at FIT’s Patricia Mears and Vogue’s Tonne Goodman have pitched in with essays.Happel  Dukovic and fashion designer Anna Sui will discuss the new book and the annual gala collaboration between NYCB’s in-house Happel-directed atelier and the designers at Fotografiska New York on Oct. 17.This year’s annual gala on Oct. 5 will honor cofounding choreographers George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins. Robbins’ “Glass Pieces” will be performed  as will excerpts from Balanchine’s “Who Cares?” (with help from vocalists Joshua Henry  Patti LuPone and Vanessa Williams.) Carolina Herrera’s creative director Wes Gordon will provide the costumes for “Glass Pieces ” a one-night-only event. Naomi Watts  Laverne Cox  Jill Kargman  Mazdack and Zanna Rassi  Elaine Welteroth and Andy Cohen will be some of the gala’s chairs.In honor of its 75th anniversary  NYCB has a raft of other celebrations planned for the coming weeks  though the musicians in the ballet’s orchestra are held up in contract negotiations. Asked for an update  a NYCB spokesperson issued a lengthy statement that claimed that Local 802 “is basing its argument in large part on NYCB’s healthy financial position emerging from COVID[-19]. It is true that NYCB worked very hard to manage the massive revenue losses and other impacts of the pandemic  and it is certainly our hope that the sort of sacrifices made by all NYCB employees will not be necessary going forward.”It wrapped up with “New York City Ballet is hopeful that Local 802 and our musicians will join us in working towards reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.” — ROSEMARY FEITELBERG,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.39,0.42,0.2,True,English,"['Second L.A.\xa0Store', 'Dual Listing', 'Coty', 'Balenciaga', 'outstanding Class A common stock', 'Coty Inc chief executive officer', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Paris Stock Exchange', 'Sue Y.

Steady Growth in Sales for the First Half of 2023 As ...,"Press ReleaseParis  September 27  2023Half-year results SectionHOPSCOTCH GROUPEHalf-year results 2023Sales Grow by 10%HOPSCOTCH invests in its DevelopmentHOPSCOTCH Groupe (Euronext FR0000065278)  a communications consultancy group and major player in Digital  Public Relations  Influence  and Events  presents today its half-year results for 2023.Thousand €1st HALF-YEAR 2023 1st HALF-YEAR 2022 Turnover 122 946 108 845 Gross Margin 41  965 38 162 Operating Income 1  128 4 189 Net Income - Group Share 514 2 919Steady Growth in Sales for the First Half of 2023As previously published  the Group's growth progressed steadily in the first half  with a +13% increase in sales to 122 946 thousand euros and a +10% increase in gross margin to 41 965 thousand euros.All the Group's sectors contributed to this dynamic performance: Sopexa  despite its strong seasonal pattern  which places two-thirds of its business in the second half of the year  grew by almost 4%  Events by almost 7%  driven in particular by the buoyant Luxury Goods sector  and Consulting by over 3%. The consolidation of Hopscotch Sport in the first half of 2023 accounts for around half of this overall growth.Operating Income Mainly Affected by a Base EffectOperating income came to 1 128 thousand euros  compared with 4 189 thousand euros last year. After financial expenses and corporate tax  net income for the first half of 2023 came to 514 thousand euros.This apparent decline is due to (excluding the impact of Hopscotch Sport)Non-recurring expenses of more than 1.0 million euros  mainly linked to the current external growth strategy  and to prospects linked to major events scheduled for 2024  the effects of which will be recognized over the coming half-years.A different method of accounting for certain expenses  in particular provisions for premiums and commissions  compared with last year  which will penalize the first half of 2023 by around 1.6 million euros  but which will not have a negative impact on the current year.Recurring expenses linked to our organic growth policy and related investments. These costs are up by around 2.1 million euros for payroll  and 1.0 million euros for overheads. These are planned structural investments  necessary for the future.In addition  the comparison is unfavorable due to a base effect linked to a sustained recovery in post-covid activities last year  particularly in events  which benefited from the rebound effect.Lastly  as a reminder  the seasonal nature of Sopexa's business  which only generates a third of its sales in the first half of the year  means that losses are recorded in the first half.This year  the rest of the Group anticipates a different seasonal pattern to last year  with a proportionally more active second half  to which Sopexa's seasonal pattern will be added. Indeed  to date  the 2023 order book is already almost equal to the entire previous year's activity. Between September and December 2022  it had been signed and delivered for over 10 million euros in gross margin. The 2023 order book should also be completed by the end of the year  promising a buoyant second half.By the end of the year  therefore  the Group expects to return to a level of operating margin quite comparable to that recorded in 2022  despite the investments made to ensure growth and anticipate 2024  as mentioned above.A Solid Structure: A Net Financial Surplus of 12.5 million eurosThe balance sheet on June 30  2023  shows shareholders' equity of 26 154 thousand euros  including 19 054 thousand euros Group share.Consolidated surplus cash amounted to 37 170 thousand euros  leaving a financial position net of surplus debt of over 12.5 million euros. After repayment of over 3 million euros in the first half  bank borrowings stood at 24 538 thousand euros  including 17 200 thousand euros in gross borrowings on June 31  2023  compared with 27 500 thousand euros  including 19 100 thousand euros in gross borrowings on December 31.The State Granted Loan of 17.2 million euros is added equally to balance sheet liabilities in debt and balance sheet assets in cash  as it has not been used for the Group's financing requirements. It is therefore relevant to compare debt excluding the State Granted Loan of 7.4 million euros with shareholders' equity of 26.2 million euros  and a net financial position identical to 12.5 million euros excluding the State Granted Loan.OutlookThe Group is confident that its momentum will continue in the second half of the year and aims to maintain the same level of operating margin as last year.The contract signing with Interface Tourism  scheduled to close at the beginning of 2024  will enable Hopscotch to strengthen its European presence in Spain  Italy  and the Netherlands  as well as its position in the buoyant tourism and lifestyle sectors. Interface Tourism represents around 10% of the Group's business  but has a higher operating margin.The year 2024 will be rich in major activities  in sports and with the Paris Motor Show among others.Discussions with the Vero Group are still ongoing.HOPSCOTCH Groupe will publish its results for the 3rd quarter of 2023 on Thursday  November 2  after market close.________Shareholder ContactPierre-Franck MOLEY - Chief Executive Officer - Tel. 01 41 34 20 56 - pfmoley@hopscotchgroupe.comPress ContactJodie KNOEPFLER CONSCIENCE - Assistant to the Management Board - Tel. 01 41 34 20 51 - jodiekc@hopscotchgroupe.com________About HOPSCOTCHHOPSCOTCH is an international communications group founded in France  directed by its founders and its managers  all guided by a business vision carried forward by the complementarity of expertise.
