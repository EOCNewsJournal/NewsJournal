According to the business  this was the first time two banks had been able to trade FX swaps via API and match at the market midpoint.Speaking to The TRADE  Hock said: “When we’re looking at futures transactions we have a higher participation rate compared to most of our peers […] so we’ve been fairly early adopter of this product.“What’s important for us when executing – not just in FX but all asset classes – is to get the very best outcome for our investors. Not just best execution  also the regulatory requirements. Our goal is to be connected to the very best platforms and have the best breadth of broker firms on this platform  enabling us to play the white keys  the black keys and the pedals of the piano.”,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.34,0.31,0.35,True,English,"['first FX futures trade', 'Deutsche Börse', 'FX offering', 'Union Investment', 'EMS', 'first block foreign exchange (FX) futures trade', 'inaugural foreign exchange futures liquidity provider', 'exchange futures relationship-trading activity', 'diverse, global client base', 'different FX futures products', 'real-time FX pricing data', 'specialist execution management capabilities', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'OTC) FX execution models', 'world class OTC offering', 'streaming mid liquidity', 'FX execution capabilities', 'Deutsche Börse', 'Eurex FX futures', 'DACH FX sales', 'higher participation rate', 'digital asset aspirations', 'many trading relationships', 'web-based trading technology', 'Listed FX trading', 'Swaps User Network', 'futures transactions', 'first time', 'trading head Hock', 'FX swaps', 'best execution', 'OTC instruments', 'FX forwards', 'OTC channels', 'class EMS', 'The TRADE', 'initial trade', 'multi-asset trading', 'long-term user', 'trading desk', 'asset classes', 'Deutsche Bank', 'trading platform', 'Union Investment', 'Christoph Hock', 'internal processes', 'Rico Milde', 'natural choice', 'integrated setup', 'Hilko Kalberlah', 'institutional clients', 'integration solutions', 'related services', 'increasing costs', 'regulatory changes', 'market participants', 'Sebastian Hofmann-Werther', 'seamless integration', 'strategic investment', 'various needs', 'strong adoption', 'market-leading firms', 'two banks', 'market midpoint', 'early adopter', 'best outcome', 'regulatory requirements', 'best platforms', 'best breadth', 'broker firms', 'white keys', 'black keys', 'six months', 'significant benefits', 'central clearing', 'business’ strategy', '360T EMS', '360T platform', 'development', 'implementation', 'couple', 'role', 'decision', 'range', 'advantage', 'customisation', 'counter', 'announcement', 'result', 'EMEA', 'move', 'access', 'ways', 'APIs', 'SUN', 'peers', 'investors', 'goal', 'pedals', 'piano']",2023-09-28,2023-09-28,thetradenews.com

E4 is a key active pharmaceutical ingredient in both Mithra’s marketed contraceptive Estelle® and its next generation hormone therapy product candidate for postmenopausal symptoms  Donesta®.Amanda Black MD  MPH  FRCSC  Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at The University of Ottawa  will hold an independent oral presentation on the use of E4 for contraception and menopause. Dr. Black will be discussing the science and safety behind the use of E4 in the menopause at the opening symposium and will present some of the data on the effects of E4 on breast tissue.Dr. Wulf Utian1  MD  PhD  DSc  Executive Director Emeritus and Honorary Founding President of NAMS  who is considered to be one of the world’s authorities on menopause and women’s health  will hold an oral presentation on the Phase 3 results of E4 in postmenopausal symptoms. The data  from two multi-center  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials with 2 550 postmenopausal women aged 40-65  show beneficial effects from 12-week treatment with E4. These include a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) – or “good” – cholesterol and a significant decrease in the ratio total of HDL cholesterol to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) “bad” cholesterol and lipoprotein. There was also a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c average blood glucose (glycemia) level. Also observed were trends for decreases in insulin and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).Dr. Black and Dr. Utian will each also hold poster presentations on E4 at NAMS 2023.Graham Dixon  Chief Scientific Officer of Mithra  commented: “The data will demonstrate that E4 treatment has a favorable safety profile  including a low impact on normal and malignant breast tissue  thanks to its unique mode of action which means it has tissue selective activity  unlike all other estrogens. It has also been shown to be effective at decreasing vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. The evidence clearly shows the potential of E4 to offer women differentiated options to support their independence during child-bearing years and maintain their health during menopause.”Mithra has previously reported positive results from Phase 3 trials  showing strong efficacy and a favorable safety profile for contraception  for Estelle®  and separately  a statistically significant reduction in vasomotor symptoms  or hot flushes and night sweats  in postmenopausal women  with Donesta®.Dr. David Horn Solomon  Chief Executive Officer of Mithra  commented: “We are proud that Dr. Black and Dr. Utian  two globally recognized experts on women’s health  are presenting this clinical research on our exciting E4 developments. Our scientific founder  Professor Jean-Michel Foidart  was amongst the first to characterize and recognize the potential of this native and selective estrogen  which is produced by the human fetus during pregnancy  passing into maternal blood at relatively high levels and offering unique benefits. His research and development efforts allowed Mithra to develop and test E4 as the key innovative active pharmaceutical ingredient in Mithra’s oral contraceptive Estelle® and its Donesta® next generation hormone therapy drug candidate.Our marketing partners are currently accelerating the ongoing commercial launches of Estelle®  globally; we are finalizing our application for U.S. marketing authorization of Donesta®  for submission later this year. These data presented at NAMS 2023 illustrate the significant goals we are pursuing to provide women with a new era in oral contraception and the next generation hormone therapy for menopause. Our mission is for these and other innovative products to improve women’s health and independence from young adulthood through mid-life and beyond.”Details of the presentations at NAMS 2023 are as follows:Estetrol (E4): A Promising New Treatment for the Spectrum of Menopausal SymptomsPresenter: Amanda Black – PosterThe Effect of Estetrol (E4) on Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Postmenopausal Women – Results From a Phase 3 TrialPresenter: Wulf Utian – PosterEstetrol (E4)  a Promising New Treatment for Menopausal Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS): Beneficial Lipid and Carbohydrate Metabolism in a Phase 3 Randomized  Double-blind  Placebo-Controlled TrialPresenter: Wulf Utian – OralTime: 4:30-4:45pm EST  Thursday 28 SeptemberLocation: Concurrent Session 2—Oral Abstract Presentations; Grand Ballroom (A–D)—Fifth FloorEstetrol (E4) for contraception and Menopause: Where is the Science?Presenter: Amanda Black – Invited Oral (Independent)Time: 10:10-10:30am EST  Wednesday 27 SeptemberLocation: Opening Symposium—Precision Oncology for Midlife Women; Grand Ballroom (E–L)—Fifth FloorFor more information  please contact:Mithra Pharmaceuticals SAAlex Sokolowski  PhDHead of Investor Relationsinvestorrelations@mithra.com+32 (0)4 349 28 22Frédérique DepraetereCommunications Directorinfo@mithra.com+32 (0)4 349 28 22Chris MaggosCohesion Bureauchris.maggos@cohesionbureau.com+41 79 367 6254About MithraMithra Pharmaceuticals SA (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming Women’s Health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

The consolidation of Hopscotch Sport in the first half of 2023 accounts for around half of this overall growth.Operating Income Mainly Affected by a Base EffectOperating income came to 1 128 thousand euros  compared with 4 189 thousand euros last year. After financial expenses and corporate tax  net income for the first half of 2023 came to 514 thousand euros.This apparent decline is due to (excluding the impact of Hopscotch Sport)Non-recurring expenses of more than 1.0 million euros  mainly linked to the current external growth strategy  and to prospects linked to major events scheduled for 2024  the effects of which will be recognized over the coming half-years.A different method of accounting for certain expenses  in particular provisions for premiums and commissions  compared with last year  which will penalize the first half of 2023 by around 1.6 million euros  but which will not have a negative impact on the current year.Recurring expenses linked to our organic growth policy and related investments. These costs are up by around 2.1 million euros for payroll  and 1.0 million euros for overheads. These are planned structural investments  necessary for the future.In addition  the comparison is unfavorable due to a base effect linked to a sustained recovery in post-covid activities last year  particularly in events  which benefited from the rebound effect.Lastly  as a reminder  the seasonal nature of Sopexa's business  which only generates a third of its sales in the first half of the year  means that losses are recorded in the first half.This year  the rest of the Group anticipates a different seasonal pattern to last year  with a proportionally more active second half  to which Sopexa's seasonal pattern will be added. Indeed  to date  the 2023 order book is already almost equal to the entire previous year's activity. Between September and December 2022  it had been signed and delivered for over 10 million euros in gross margin. The 2023 order book should also be completed by the end of the year  promising a buoyant second half.By the end of the year  therefore  the Group expects to return to a level of operating margin quite comparable to that recorded in 2022  despite the investments made to ensure growth and anticipate 2024  as mentioned above.A Solid Structure: A Net Financial Surplus of 12.5 million eurosThe balance sheet on June 30  2023  shows shareholders' equity of 26 154 thousand euros  including 19 054 thousand euros Group share.Consolidated surplus cash amounted to 37 170 thousand euros  leaving a financial position net of surplus debt of over 12.5 million euros. After repayment of over 3 million euros in the first half  bank borrowings stood at 24 538 thousand euros  including 17 200 thousand euros in gross borrowings on June 31  2023  compared with 27 500 thousand euros  including 19 100 thousand euros in gross borrowings on December 31.The State Granted Loan of 17.2 million euros is added equally to balance sheet liabilities in debt and balance sheet assets in cash  as it has not been used for the Group's financing requirements. It is therefore relevant to compare debt excluding the State Granted Loan of 7.4 million euros with shareholders' equity of 26.2 million euros  and a net financial position identical to 12.5 million euros excluding the State Granted Loan.OutlookThe Group is confident that its momentum will continue in the second half of the year and aims to maintain the same level of operating margin as last year.The contract signing with Interface Tourism  scheduled to close at the beginning of 2024  will enable Hopscotch to strengthen its European presence in Spain  Italy  and the Netherlands  as well as its position in the buoyant tourism and lifestyle sectors. Interface Tourism represents around 10% of the Group's business  but has a higher operating margin.The year 2024 will be rich in major activities  in sports and with the Paris Motor Show among others.Discussions with the Vero Group are still ongoing.HOPSCOTCH Groupe will publish its results for the 3rd quarter of 2023 on Thursday  November 2  after market close.________Shareholder ContactPierre-Franck MOLEY - Chief Executive Officer - Tel. 01 41 34 20 56 - pfmoley@hopscotchgroupe.comPress ContactJodie KNOEPFLER CONSCIENCE – Assistant to the Management Board - Tel. 01 41 34 20 51 - jodiekc@hopscotchgroupe.com________About HOPSCOTCHHOPSCOTCH is an international communications group founded in France  directed by its founders and its managers  all guided by a business vision carried forward by the complementarity of expertise.

The consolidation of Hopscotch Sport in the first half of 2023 accounts for around half of this overall growth.Operating Income Mainly Affected by a Base EffectOperating income came to 1 128 thousand euros  compared with 4 189 thousand euros last year. After financial expenses and corporate tax  net income for the first half of 2023 came to 514 thousand euros.This apparent decline is due to (excluding the impact of Hopscotch Sport)Non-recurring expenses of more than 1.0 million euros  mainly linked to the current external growth strategy  and to prospects linked to major events scheduled for 2024  the effects of which will be recognized over the coming half-years.A different method of accounting for certain expenses  in particular provisions for premiums and commissions  compared with last year  which will penalize the first half of 2023 by around 1.6 million euros  but which will not have a negative impact on the current year.Recurring expenses linked to our organic growth policy and related investments. These costs are up by around 2.1 million euros for payroll  and 1.0 million euros for overheads. These are planned structural investments  necessary for the future.In addition  the comparison is unfavorable due to a base effect linked to a sustained recovery in post-covid activities last year  particularly in events  which benefited from the rebound effect.Lastly  as a reminder  the seasonal nature of Sopexa's business  which only generates a third of its sales in the first half of the year  means that losses are recorded in the first half.This year  the rest of the Group anticipates a different seasonal pattern to last year  with a proportionally more active second half  to which Sopexa's seasonal pattern will be added. Indeed  to date  the 2023 order book is already almost equal to the entire previous year's activity. Between September and December 2022  it had been signed and delivered for over 10 million euros in gross margin. The 2023 order book should also be completed by the end of the year  promising a buoyant second half.By the end of the year  therefore  the Group expects to return to a level of operating margin quite comparable to that recorded in 2022  despite the investments made to ensure growth and anticipate 2024  as mentioned above.A Solid Structure: A Net Financial Surplus of 12.5 million eurosThe balance sheet on June 30  2023  shows shareholders' equity of 26 154 thousand euros  including 19 054 thousand euros Group share.Consolidated surplus cash amounted to 37 170 thousand euros  leaving a financial position net of surplus debt of over 12.5 million euros. After repayment of over 3 million euros in the first half  bank borrowings stood at 24 538 thousand euros  including 17 200 thousand euros in gross borrowings on June 31  2023  compared with 27 500 thousand euros  including 19 100 thousand euros in gross borrowings on December 31.The State Granted Loan of 17.2 million euros is added equally to balance sheet liabilities in debt and balance sheet assets in cash  as it has not been used for the Group's financing requirements. It is therefore relevant to compare debt excluding the State Granted Loan of 7.4 million euros with shareholders' equity of 26.2 million euros  and a net financial position identical to 12.5 million euros excluding the State Granted Loan.OutlookThe Group is confident that its momentum will continue in the second half of the year and aims to maintain the same level of operating margin as last year.The contract signing with Interface Tourism  scheduled to close at the beginning of 2024  will enable Hopscotch to strengthen its European presence in Spain  Italy  and the Netherlands  as well as its position in the buoyant tourism and lifestyle sectors. Interface Tourism represents around 10% of the Group's business  but has a higher operating margin.The year 2024 will be rich in major activities  in sports and with the Paris Motor Show among others.Discussions with the Vero Group are still ongoing.HOPSCOTCH Groupe will publish its results for the 3rd quarter of 2023 on Thursday  November 2  after market close.________Shareholder ContactPierre-Franck MOLEY - Chief Executive Officer - Tel. 01 41 34 20 56 - pfmoley@hopscotchgroupe.comPress ContactJodie KNOEPFLER CONSCIENCE – Assistant to the Management Board - Tel. 01 41 34 20 51 - jodiekc@hopscotchgroupe.com________About HOPSCOTCHHOPSCOTCH is an international communications group founded in France  directed by its founders and its managers  all guided by a business vision carried forward by the complementarity of expertise.

This Inventory is valued in Delta Drone’s books at more than € 2 million.Techaviacom is a Ukrainian private company with a significant track record of doing business in the defence sector. The company's manufacturing capacities and R&D team are located in Ukraine  and it is presently focused on the design and development of a wide range of proprietary defence products and technology solutions.In addition  the Delta Drone management and team have extensive knowledge of Ukraine and the surrounding regions.Under the terms of the PSA  the Inventory will be delivered to Techaviacom in October of this year  which will then develop and/or resell products using the Inventory. The base price of this Inventory is € 2 138 678 (the Inventory’s valuation in Delta Drone’s books) with payments to be made to Delta Drone in four instalments through 1 October 2024. This base price can be adjusted downwards after (i) the inspection to be performed by Techaviacom of the Inventory  (ii) the return by Techaviacom of items of the Inventory that cannot be used  and (iii) the resale of such items of the Inventory  it being understood that Delta Drone and Techaviacom will split the proceeds of these sales 50-50.Drones and drone-related technology are at the forefront of the war between Ukraine and Russia. Drone parts and accessories are in high demand as the war uses an estimated 10 000 drones per month. With the Inventory at its disposal  Delta Drone recognized the immediate opportunity to procure this much-needed technology for Techaviacom. Delta Drone is confident that this Inventory with its “civil” value in France and the European Union can get a higher value by sending it to Ukraine  where there are more buyers with an urgent demand.Delta Drone and Techaviacom view this initial Inventory delivery as the first step in a long-term partnership of military drone research  development  manufacturing  and sales. Given the ongoing war  Ukraine has been deemed the “Silicon Valley” of drone technology  for both civil and military purposes. The speed and efficiency with which drones and drone-related technology are being developed  refined  and combat tested in Ukraine is unparalleled and it is essential that Delta Drone be actively involved in this process for the long-term benefit of its shareholders.Delta Drone and Techaviacom aim to become long-term leaders in this field given that following this initial PSA  they are negotiating the terms of a broader research and development framework agreement for the development and production of Tonner Drones’ military drones in Ukraine in exchange for royalties.“Delta Drone is pleased to be able to provide Techaviacom with this inventory that we are confident will be valuable to Techaviacom as it continues to develop drones and drone related technology in Ukraine’s ongoing war against Russia. Delta Drone looks forward to a long and profitable partnership with Techaviacom as the company continues its pivot towards military drones to generate shareholder value ” stated Brad Taylor  CEO of Delta Drone.About Delta Drone: Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the civil drone sector for professional use.

Umberto Perillo  CEO of Svas Biosana  has commented thus:""The figures reward our investment strategy aimed at strengthening our presence in Italy and abroad  also thanks to our latest acquisition 'Bormia d.o.o.'  which contributed to our very positive results. Our efforts are all projected into the future  and with this in mind we will be building a new factory in Somma Vesuviana over the next two years  entirely dedicated to incontinence aids. The medical device market is continuing to expand strongly. We are very confident that the positive trend will continue and we believe that this will lead to further growth in both sales and expected margins. ANALYSIS OF KEY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DATA Despite the general economic environment affected by the general increase in prices and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine  the Svas Biosana group achieved strong growth across all performance indicators compared to the previous period. During the first six months of 2023  there was a slight reduction in the purchase cost of the main raw materials and semi-finished goods  while the cost of energy services decreased significantly. This had an impact on the cost structure of the group's manufacturing activities  while it had a marginal effect on medical device marketing. The group's strategy is currently geared towards increasing customer prices and focusing more on value-added devices. Revenues from operations as at 30 June 2023 amounted to Euro 55 million  an increase of +25.3% compared to Euro 43.8 million as at 30 June 2022. SVAS BIOSANA S.p.A.

Tax Code 04720630633 Italy Italy Italy svasbiosana@legalmail.it VAT no. 01354901215SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR It should be noted that on 15 September 2022  the Aiuti-bis Decree (Decree Law 115/2022) issued by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Economy and Finance was published in the Official Journal  certifying that the expenditure ceiling for medical devices  set at 4.4% of the National Health Fund  had been exceeded for the years 2015 to 2018. The Decree establishes that half of this overrun is to be covered by economic operators in the industry ('Medical Device Payback'). With subsequent measures  the Italian Government provided for several extensions for the payment of the required amounts  granting the possibility to pay by 30 October 2023 at a reduced rate  equal to 48% of the amount indicated in the regional and autonomous province of Trento and Bolzano measures  waiving any litigation arisen during the period. It should be noted  however  that this risk is not of a significant amount for the group. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OCCURRING AFTER 30 JUNE 2023 In July 2023  the group completed the issuance of two non-convertible  unsubordinated bonds for a total amount of Euro 13 million  pursuant to Art. 2410 of the Civil Code  which are designed to support our investment plan. Specifically  the Euro 13 million transaction involved the issuance of two bonds: one issued by the parent company Svas Biosana in the amount of Euro 10 million; the other issued by Mark Medical in the amount of Euro 3 million  both maturing on 31 December 2029  totally unsecured. Both loans will be subject to compliance with financial covenants according to market practice for similar bonds. The bonds are not listed on regulated markets or admitted to trading on a multilateral trading facility and are not subject to the obligation to publish a prospectus  pursuant to and for the purposes of Art. 1(4) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129. The transaction is aimed at supporting the Svas Biosana group's further growth. In particular  the bond issued by the parent company is intended  among other things  for the construction of a new production plant in Somma Vesuviana (NA) and the development of several production lines for the production of incontinence aids  which already exist in the current Naples plant  while the bond issued by the subsidiary Mark Medical will support the strengthening of the group's commercial presence in Eastern Europe. OUTLOOK The macroeconomic outlook for the economic activity and inflation has become very uncertain and depends crucially on the evolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. In the most recent period  signs of slowing inflation and the receding financial turmoil have prompted the major central banks to continue raising interest rates  albeit at a more moderate pace. These elements represent a drag on the world economy  which is expected to decelerate this year before showing more dynamism in 2024. SVAS BIOSANA S.p.A.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announces the successful first-in-human implant of its ARC-IM Stimulator*  to restore upper extremity function after SCI. The patient also received a wireless brain-computer interface (BCI)  designed to initiate thought-driven movement when paired with ARC-IM.ONWARD ARC-IM delivers targeted  programmed ARC-IM Therapy to the spinal cord to restore movement and other functions after spinal cord injury. ARC-IM Therapy has been applied across multiple clinical feasibility studies to restore mobility and stabilize blood pressure after SCI. For the first time  ARC-IM Therapy has now also been used to restore upper extremity movement and function.Two procedures were performed last month by neurosurgeon Jocelyne Bloch  MD  at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) in Lausanne  Switzerland. The ARC-IM implant procedure took place on August 14  2023  and nine days later the BCI WIMAGINE® from CEA-Clinatec was implanted.Working in concert with ARC-IM  the BCI is engineered to capture the intention of a paralyzed individual to move their upper extremities and uses artificial intelligence to decode those thoughts. ARC-IM then converts the decoded information into ARC-IM Therapy - precise stimulation of the spinal cord - resulting in thought-driven movement.“The implant procedures involving the ONWARD ARC-IM and Clinatec BCI went smoothly ” said Dr. Jocelyne Bloch. “We are now working with the patient to use this cutting-edge innovation to recover movement of his arms  hands  and fingers. We look forward to sharing more information in due course.”This latest breakthrough is part of an ongoing clinical study investigating the safety and effectiveness of thought-initiated spinal cord stimulation after SCI. It builds on the ONWARD announcement from May 2023 that pairing its ARC Therapy with a BCI implant resulted in an individual gaining augmented control over movement of his paralyzed legs. The study is supported by a grant from the European Innovation Council (Reverse Paralysis project) and is coordinated by .NeuroRestore co-Directors – Professor Grégoire Courtine and Dr. Jocelyne Bloch – as well as Guillaume Charvet  head of the Medical Device Development Lab at CEA-Clinatec.“This is another impressive piece of research from our partners at .NeuroRestore. We are excited to learn how ARC-IM Therapy may restore upper extremity function after SCI  and we are eager to see how the addition of a BCI might augment our therapy ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. “Congratulations to the teams at EPFL  CHUV  and CEA-Clinatec for this breakthrough. We feel privileged that our technology is part of this research.”The Company expects to share more information about this pioneering research in the coming months  concurrent with a peer-reviewed publication describing the procedure and results.*All ONWARD devices and therapies  including but not limited to ARC-IM™  ARC-EX™  and ARC Therapy™  alone or in combination with a BCI  are investigational and not available for commercial use.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD is a medical technology company creating therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and movement disabilities.

Source: VopakNeste has expanded its capability to supply renewable fuels to customers on the West Coast of the United States in cooperation with Vopak  a leading energy industry infrastructure provider. Neste commissioned terminal capacity at Vopak's Los Angeles terminal in California for storing Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ (SAF) and Neste MY Renewable Diesel™. This is a major step in further expanding the availability of Neste's renewable fuels in the Southern California region  enabling greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the transportation sector and supporting the energy transition on the West Coast of the U.S.The Vopak Los Angeles Terminal is strategically located in the Port of Los Angeles and is well-connected to fuel logistics via vessels  barges  trucks and pipelines  for example. Having terminal capacity at this location will significantly increase the availability and accessibility of Neste's renewable fuels to customers at critical hubs in the Los Angeles area  such as SAF for airlines at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)  one of the world's largest airports  and renewable diesel (also locally known as R99) for fueling stations serving road transportation all the way to San Diego.""Neste is fully committed to supporting the energy transition in the U.S. as well as globally by working closely together with partners to increase the availability of our renewable fuels. Our cooperation with Vopak shows how repurposing existing fuel distribution infrastructure can accelerate the much needed transition to renewable energy. California has been at the forefront of adopting and endorsing climate-friendly policies and solutions. We are glad to enable more cities  businesses and individual travelers in the state to take advantage of Neste's renewable solutions to reduce their emissions and help fight against climate change "" says Annika Tibbe  acting President for Neste US.""We are proud to serve Neste. Repurposing Vopak's assets from oil and traditional fossil fuel products to low-carbon energy solutions is right on target with our strategy. We are happy that our services and infrastructure have been selected and are committed to being a part of the Los Angeles energy transition "" says Maria Ciliberti  Vopak President United States and Canada.Neste's renewable fuels are a more sustainable alternative to fossil fuels enabling a significant reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel  GHG emissions can be reduced by up to 80%* over the fuel's life cycle compared to using fossil jet fuel. With Neste MY Renewable Diesel  GHG emissions can be reduced by up to 75%** compared to fossil diesel over its life cycle. The fuels are fully compatible with current diesel and aircraft engines and fueling infrastructures  making them ideal solutions for reducing emissions in hard to abate sectors like aviation  heavy duty transport and freight.Neste has been supplying renewable fuels to California since 2016 after the state adopted its Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). According to data from the California Air Resources Board  as of the first quarter of 2023  49% of California's diesel pool is renewable diesel. Since the inception of the LCFS program  renewable diesel has displaced over 5.3 billion gallons (approx. 16 million tons) of fossil diesel. Today  Neste's renewable diesel is used by many municipalities and businesses in the state  and Neste's SAF is available at all of the major airports in California.*) When used in neat form (i.e. unblended) and calculated with established life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies  such as CORSIA methodology**) The GHG emission reduction percentage varies depending on the region-specific legislation that provides the methodology for the calculations (e.g. California LCFS for the US)  and the raw material mix used to manufacture the product for each market.Further information:Neste: Please contact Neste's media service  tel. +358 800 94025 / media@neste.com (weekdays from 8.30 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. EET).

By the end of 2024  we aim to increase this figure to 22 tonnes  and to 80 tonnes by 2026. »H1 2023 highlightsAcceleration of projects in “Construction” or “Awarded” stages at mid 2023During the 1st half of 2023  Lhyfe kept a strong pace in project development and construction of its production units  with 54 MW of installed capacity at “Construction[1]” or “Awarded1” phase as of mid 2023  through 12 sites (versus 50 MW at year end 2022).Among the projects in “Construction” phase  the following developments should be highlighted:Lhyfe Bretagne (Buléon  France): In Buléon  Bretagne (France)  a unit  which will be able to produce up to 2 t/day of green hydrogen (5 MW installed capacity)  is currently under construction since the beginning of 2023  with commissioning expected at end-2023. This unit is part of the VhyGo project (Vallée Hydrogène Grand Ouest) which aims to build the first supra-regional infrastructure for the distribution of green hydrogen in France and is supported by the ADEME.Lhyfe Occitanie (Bessières  France): In Occitanie (France)  Lhyfe continues the construction of a production unit in Bessières  which will be able to produce up to 2 t/day of green hydrogen (5 MW installed capacity)  with commissioning expected at end-2023.Lhyfe Bade-Würtemberg (Schwäbisch Gmünd  Germany): In Schwäbisch Gmünd  Germany  Lhyfe launched during the 1st half of 2023 the construction of a green hydrogen production unit with a maximum capacity of around 4 t/day (10 MW installed capacity) as well as a hydrogen distribution station for the general public and a pipeline to supply the future “H2-Aspen"" technology park with green hydrogen. The plant is expected to be operational in the 2nd half of 2024. This project is part of the HyFIVE (Hydrogen For Innovative Vehicles) project  which has received a €33m funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).Tübingen (Germany): As part of the Deutsche Bahn and Siemens Mobility H2goesRail project  Lhyfe will launch in the 2nd half of 2023 the installation of a production site in Tübingen Germany  with a maximum capacity of 400 kg/day of green hydrogen (1 MW installed capacity)  aimed at supplying hydrogen-powered trains on the Pforzheim-Horb-Tübingen line from 2024.Brake (Germany): Lhyfe will launch the construction of a production unit in Brake  with a maximum capacity of 4 t/day of green hydrogen (10 MW installed capacity). The construction permit has been filed during the 1st half of 2023. This site will supply local mobility and industrial uses  with a commissioning date scheduled for the 2nd half of 2024.Botnia Hydrogen (Sweden): Within the Botnia Hydrogen consortium  Lhyfe carries a project to develop hydrogen production and supply units in the north of Sweden  with a total maximum production capacity of 600 kg/day of hydrogen (1.5 MW installed capacity)  which will address mainly HGVs and buses. The land and connections have been secured. Construction has started in the 1st half of 2023.Lhyfe Pays de la Loire (Bouin  France): The commercial ramp-up in the Bouin unit continues with an expansion of its customer portfolio and the signing of new sale contracts. In order to anticipate the saturation of the Bouin unit next year  an increase in production capacity is planned for 2024. Current installed capacity of 1 MW  i.e.  a total production capacity up to 300 kg of green hydrogen a day  is set to rise to 2.5 MW (i.e.  around 1 t/day) to meet the growing demand in the region.Based on these achievements and on the coming commissioning of the first 5 MW modular sites in France (Lhyfe Bretagne et Lhyfe Occitanie)  Lhyfe confirms the strong expansion of its installed production capacity in 2023 by 14 times compared to end 2022  raising it to up to 4 tonnes of green and renewable hydrogen per day.Projects at an advanced stage of development[2] as of end of June 2023 representing more than 600 MW of installed capacity by 2030Projects at an advanced stage of development2  corresponding to the most mature project stages of the pipeline  now represent an installed capacity of over 619 MW (against 749 MW at the end of 2022).Within these projects  projects in “Construction” phase represent an installed capacity of 34 MW at end June 2023  versus 9 MW as at end 2022  due to the conversion within the period of several projects which were in “Awarded” stage.During the first half 2023 Lhyfe's total commercial pipeline strengthened and represents as of 30 June 2023 an installed capacity of 10.3 GW (versus 9.8 GW at the end of 2022). Lhyfe benefits from a market environment supported by the European energy independence plan RepowerEU  which targets the production of 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen in the European Union by 2030  and by major national plans to support the deployment of the green hydrogen sector.As of 30 June 2023  the allocation of Lhyfe's commercial pipeline between the different project stages was as follows:June 2023 End 2022 Units in operation 2 MW 1 MW Projects at “Construction”1 phase 34 MW 9 MW Projects at “Awarded”1 phase 30 MW 40 MW Projects at “Tender ready”1 phase 555 MW 710 MW Projects at an advanced stage of development2 619 MW 759 MW Projects at “Advanced development“1 phase 4.4 GW 4.1 GW Projects at “Early stage“1 phase 5.3 GW 5.0 GW Total commercial pipeline 10.3 GW 9.8 GWAs a result  Lhyfe has a substantial pipeline of over 10 GW  compared with its target of 3 GW of installed capacity by 2030  for which Lhyfe is exploring a number of financing options.€67m of secured grants to dateAs of the date hereof  secured grants[3] intended to finance research activities as well as production sites currently being deployed represents €67.4m. This amount includes notably the following new grants  secured since the beginning of the year:a €9.8m “Clean Hydrogen Partnership” grant awarded to Lhyfe by the European Commission and related to the HOPE project  supplemented in July by a grant awarded by the Belgian government for an amount of €13m;a €4.4m grant awarded by the European Commission and related to the TH2Icino project in Italy; anda €1.6m grant awarded by the ADEME and related to the Hy'Touraine project.New projects and developments during first half 2023In March 2023  Lhyfe acquired a 49% stake in the Finnish company Flexens  a developer of green hydrogen projects and “Power-to-X"" (transformation of electricity into another energy carrier) projects based on renewable energy sources. Flexens already has a commercial pipeline with a total planned capacity of over 1.5 GW in Finland and abroad. The two companies will combine their expertise  market knowledge and commercial pipelines to accelerate current projects and identify new opportunities in Northern Europe  especially related to large offshore projects.In France  Lhyfe announced on 30 June 2023 its involvement in the Hy'Touraine project  which is to be the first complete  local public-private ecosystem in France for green hydrogen. Under this project founded by four local public authorities from the Tours area and STMicroelectronics Tours  Lhyfe will build a green hydrogen production site with a capacity of up to 2 tonnes per day depending on needs (installed capacity of 5 MW)  powered by renewable energy to be supplied locally while Teréga Solutions will operate the distribution infrastructure.In Germany  Lhyfe and duisport  the owner and management company of the Port of Duisburg - the largest inland port in the world  are investigating the feasibility of building the first major electrolysis plant in the port of Duisburg. Lhyfe will first conduct the feasibility study. The hydrogen production plant with an installed capacity of 20 MW could go into operation by 2025.Progress on our offshore projectsDuring the 1st half of 2023  the Group continued to progress on its various offshore projects launched since 2021  and signed partnership agreements with wind farm developers and energy companies specialising in offshore.Commissioning of the Sealhyfe pilot plant at seaSealhyfe  the world's first offshore green hydrogen production pilot  after its commissioning at quay in September 2022  has been towed 20 kilometres out into the Atlantic and successfully connected to the floating turbine of SEM-REV offshore testing site. Lhyfe and its partners designed  built and assembled all of the technology necessary for producing hydrogen offshore  including the 1 MW electrolyser  in just 16 months  in a less than 200 sq. metre area platform. On the basis of a production capacity of up to 400 kilograms of green hydrogen a day  this plant is fully operational since 20 June 2023.The Group invested more than €1.3m on this project during the 1st half of 2023. In 2022 this project received government approval for a contribution from France 2030. This financing provided by the French government and operated by the ADEME amounts to €1m.HOPE project selected by the European Commission and awarded with a €20m grantThe HOPE (Hydrogen Offshore Production for Europe) project  which Lhyfe coordinates within a consortium of 9 partners  has been selected by the European Commission as part of the European Clean Hydrogen Partnership. As from 2026  this unprecedentedly large-scale project (10 MW of installed capacity) will be able to produce up to 4 t/day of green hydrogen in the North Sea off the port of Ostend (Belgium)  which will be exported to shore by composite pipeline  compressed and delivered to customers.Through these two pioneering projects in offshore hydrogen production  Lhyfe aims to validate the industrial solutions it will present in future calls for projects from various governments  to help achieve the target set by the European Commission under the REPowerEU plan of 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen produced in the European Union by 2030.In this context  Lhyfe signed partnership agreements with wind farm developers and energy companies specialising in offshore such as Centrica and Capital Energy.In March 2023  Lhyfe and Centrica have agreed to jointly develop offshore renewable green hydrogen in the UK in a first for the country. Under the agreement  Lhyfe and Centrica will explore combining their expertise to collaborate on a pilot green hydrogen production site in the Southern North Sea.In June 2023  Lhyfe and Capital Energy  Spanish energy producer and distributor  have signed a collaboration agreement for the joint development of offshore renewable hydrogen projects in Spain and Portugal. Under the agreement  the two companies will work together to create hydrogen production sites at some of the offshore wind farm sites currently being developed by Capital Energy.2023 half-year resultsFirst-half income statementIn thousands of Euros - IFRS 30/06/2023(6 months) 30/06/2022(6 months) 31/12/2022(12 months) Revenue 0.4 0.3 0.6 EBITDA[4] (15.3) (6.3) (17.0) Current operating profit (loss) (16.2) (6.7) (18.2) Operating profit (loss) (16.2) (7.8) (19.2) Financial result 0.6 (6.2) (6.6) Consolidated net profit (loss) (15.9) (13.9) (25.8)H1 revenues of €0.4m mainly consist of sales of green hydrogen produced at the Bouin site (sole production site to date).EBITDA was €(15.3)m in H1 2023  compared with €(6.3)m a year earlier  reflecting the continued acceleration of the Group's investments in its projects and production sites as well as expansion of the company  notably abroad.+€5.7m increase in employee expenses versus H1 2022  reflecting the Group's expansion  the growth in headcount over the period as well as hire of new employees during the 2nd half of 2022 with impacts in the 1st half of 2023.

Lhyfe aims to build a large-scale site producing green and renewable hydrogen (dozens of MW of installed capacity) for local uses in the Epinal area  as well as for transregional and cross-border uses (Germany  Belgium  Netherlands)  to meet growing decarbonisation needs of industrials and mobility sector players.This renewable green energy site  whose implementation  which is subject to certain pre-conditions  including the granting of necessary operating authorizations and construction permits as well as the final investment decision  is expected from 2027  will enable the creation of a cutting-edge industrial cluster in the Vosges area and  on a larger scale  within the Grand Est region.Development of a green hydrogen infrastructure for industrial uses in PerlOn July 2023  Lhyfe announced the development of a 70 MW green hydrogen plant in Perl  Saarland  Germany. The plant is planned to deliver up to 30 tonnes of green hydrogen per day into the pipeline of the mosaHYc hydrogen island network  with industrials consumers  that may benefit from the advantages of green hydrogen  located along the pipeline.Construction  which is subject to the granting of operating authorizations and construction permits  as well as to financial investment decision  is planned for 2027.Lhyfe and TSE to build a green energy hub on the site of the former Poitou FoundriesDuring summer 2023  the consortium comprising Lhyfe and TSE  an independent French solar energy produce  has been selected by the commercial court of Paris to take-over the land and real estate assets of Poitou Foundries site (43 hectares and 40 000 sq. metres of building in the Ingrandes Foundry site and 35 hectares for the Oyré Technical Landfill Centre).Partners  which benefit from the support of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region  intends to build a veritable industrial park centred around green energy and the circular economy  on the site of the former Poitou Foundries  including the installation of a solar park and a green and renewable hydrogen production unit. The photovoltaic power facilities (45 GWh) that TSE plans to install  would allow Lhyfe to produce green and renewable hydrogen.The project consists  in the first place  in the dismantling of existing infrastructures and cleaning up of the site to make it compatible with the industrialisation process  thanks to the Green Fund  and hen building the bases of a truly ecological industrial park where companies will work in synergy. Several companies have already expressed their interest in joining the future site  in synergy with Lhyfe and TSE  such as an industrial logistics company  as well as e-fuel producing companies (e-methanol and rDME).Signature of a first long-term contract for the supply of renewable electricity with VSB énergies nouvellesLhyfe and VSB énergies nouvelles  an independent producer of electricity from renewable energy  announced the signing of a long-term renewable electricity supply contract (Corporate PPA). VSB énergies nouvelles has been commissioned in 2021 and operates the Buléon wind farm (Morbihan  France) with a total capacity of 13.2 MW.Under this 16-year electricity supply contract  green electricity produced by the VSB Energies Nouvelles wind farm in Buléon could be used by Lhyfe Bretagne site  whose commissioning is planned for the 1st half of 2024  and which will produce up to 2 t/day of green hydrogen to supply the local area with green hydrogen for uses related to mobility and industrial processes.Though this new Corporate PPA  Lhyfe secures a local and long-term supply of green electricity and strengthens its network of green energy supply partners.Postponement of final investment decision on GreenHyScale project (Skive  Denmark)The GreenHyScale project is led by a European consortium of which Lhyfe is a member and aims to develop a 100 MW green hydrogen production site incorporating a new-generation of 6 MW electrolyzer modules. Given uncertainties related to this large industrial project and notably the development milestones to be reached within the calendar agreed with the EU  the consortium has decided to suspend temporarily the reimbursement of the future development costs through the EU grant scheme currently in place  and to work on a revised plan and calendar. As a result  Lhyfe has decided to delay its investment decision linked to the GreenHyScale onsite project. This decision reflects Lhyfe's agile projects portfolio management and allocation of resources  notably through the regular assessment of the risk/return balance for any of its projects.Guidance confirmedBuilding on its strong commercial portfolio  and on the basis of the hypothesis detailed in Section 10.2 of the Universal Registration Document approved by the AMF on 25 June 2023 and available on Lhyfe's website  Lhyfe aims at becoming one of the leaders in the production of green hydrogen in Europe  by rapidly deploying green hydrogen sites developed on the basis of a modular industrial design aimed at derisking the industry and boosting efficiency.By 2025  Lhyfe's ambition is to be a major player for mobility use (bulk)  in France and Germany  where national ambitions for the deployment of infrastructures and uses are becoming clearer and accelerate.This ambition can be quantified as follows:In 2023  on the basis of the planned commercial ramp-up in the Bouin  Lhyfe targets revenues around €1m  underpinned by the signing of several commercial contracts with new clients  thus enabling the site to operate at full capacity by the end of the year. Increase in the production capacity in the Bouin site is expected for 2024.By the end of 2024  Lhyfe aims to have a total installed capacity of 55 MW  i.e.  a green hydrogen production capacity of up to 22 t/day.In 2026: Lhyfe aims to have a total installed capacity of 200 MW  i.e.  a green hydrogen production capacity of up to 80 t/day; around €200m in consolidated revenues; and Group EBITDA[6] at breakeven.By 2030  the Company plans to have over 3 GW in total installed capacity.In the long-term  Lhyfe is targeting a Group EBITDA Margin[7] above 30%.Financial AgendaDate Disclosure 28 March 2024 2023 Annual Results (audited)The press release will be published before Euronext Paris market opens.About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group dedicated to the energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen. Its production sites and portfolio of projects aim to provide access to green and renewable hydrogen in industrial quantities  and to enter into a virtuous energy model allowing the decarbonization of entire sectors of industry and mobility.In 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the world's first industrial green hydrogen production site in direct connection with a wind farm. In 2022  Lhyfe inaugurated the world's first pilot platform for green hydrogen production at sea.Lhyfe is present in 11 European countries and has 149 employees at the end of 2022.

The analysis will be used to decide on the best oral ATO’s posology for BioSenic’s forthcoming phase 3 clinical trial.BioSenic phase 2 clinical trial entitled ‘Treatment of Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease with Arsenic Trioxide (GvHD-ATO)’ was conducted from 2016 to 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02966301 - GMED16-001). The first results were originally published in 2022 in the peer-reviewed journal Transplantation and Cellular Therapy under the title ‘High Response Rate and Corticosteroid (CS) Sparing with Arsenic Trioxide-Based First-Line Therapy in Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation’. These collated results demonstrated that the first-line use of ATO and corticosteroids is associated with a high clinical response rate and rapid CS sparing in moderate to severe cGvHD following allo-HSCT (current standard treatment for several types of leukaemias). The primary endpoint of the phase 2 trial was preliminary efficacy based on the overall response rate (ORR; complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) at 6 months  after 1 or 2 cycles of intravenous (IV) ATO treatment. At 6 months  the ORR was 75.0%  with a CR rate of 35% and PR of 40%.BioSenic’s new post-hoc analysis of the full set of clinical data gained during the phase 2 trial shows that among the group of patients who did not achieved complete remission after the first course  a significant one-fifth of these patients had a positive primary endpoint following a second cycle of treatment. As a result  BioSenic will further use this 2-cycle treatment in its forthcoming trials. This will involve the administration of a double four-week course  separated by a rest period  resulting in a two-to-four times higher total dose of ATO. BioSenic expects thus to get closer to the optimal conditions for a curative treatment for cGvHD  for which there is currently no satisfactory therapy.In the field of oncology  IV ATO is used as a first-line treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) since 2003  with demonstrated safety and long-term remissions. Until now  in APL  ATO was administered daily by IV infusions for up to  or more than  a hundred accumulated doses. IV administration  because it requires hospitalization  is not practical for patients  results in lower quality of life  and is very expensive. The introduction of an oral formulation of ATO during 2 short cycles  presently BioSenic’s optimal design of administration  will greatly improve patient quality of life and compliance  while reducing healthcare costs. This is a significant achievement in BioSenic’s aim to contribute improved and potentially curative treatment for an autoimmune disease  with no current satisfactory medical solutions.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and CEO  BioSenic said: ""BioSenic is continuing to investigate new tricks that an old medication accomplishes in the field of autoimmune diseases. BioSenic’s preclinical and clinical data show that the first-in-class modulatory properties for immune differentiation and homeostatic maintenance of the immune system of arsenic trioxide is much wider and profound than anticipated. The systematic analysis of BioSenic’s clinical results is delivering additional conclusions on the mechanism of action of arsenic salts and also on the optimization of its formulations  dosages and optimal treatment timing. We are now focused on the finalizing preparations for our phase 3 trial of a new oral formulation of ATO targeting chronic graft-versus-host disease and devoting our efforts to exploiting clinical data reflecting the properties of arsenic trioxide to provide curative treatments for patients with autoimmune diseases for whom palliative medical treatments are unsatisfactory.”About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in orthopedics.Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined a strategic positionings and strengths to use  separately and combined  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The ATO platform  which has been successfully developed  has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T and other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). cGvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. BioSenic has been successful in a Phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international Phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early Phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a Phase 2 clinical protocol.2) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform developed by BioSenic  with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. ALLOB has recently been evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2b study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late-delayed union. However  in June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in this exploratory Phase 2b clinical trial  interpreted as a failure of a too early cell injection  just after fracture. BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (choice between early or late treatment).Note: Biosenic has reevaluated a previous important and years-long clinical development program. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase 3 JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient subpopulation. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. This leads to a next generation of JTA  off-the-shelf enhanced viscosupplement to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives are intended to provide effective lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic (OA) pain and inflammation.The company  will nevertheless focus its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

The analysis will be used to decide on the best oral ATO’s posology for BioSenic’s forthcoming phase 3 clinical trial.BioSenic phase 2 clinical trial entitled ‘Treatment of Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease with Arsenic Trioxide (GvHD-ATO)’ was conducted from 2016 to 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02966301 - GMED16-001). The first results were originally published in 2022 in the peer-reviewed journal Transplantation and Cellular Therapy under the title ‘High Response Rate and Corticosteroid (CS) Sparing with Arsenic Trioxide-Based First-Line Therapy in Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation’. These collated results demonstrated that the first-line use of ATO and corticosteroids is associated with a high clinical response rate and rapid CS sparing in moderate to severe cGvHD following allo-HSCT (current standard treatment for several types of leukaemias). The primary endpoint of the phase 2 trial was preliminary efficacy based on the overall response rate (ORR; complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) at 6 months  after 1 or 2 cycles of intravenous (IV) ATO treatment. At 6 months  the ORR was 75.0%  with a CR rate of 35% and PR of 40%.BioSenic’s new post-hoc analysis of the full set of clinical data gained during the phase 2 trial shows that among the group of patients who did not achieved complete remission after the first course  a significant one-fifth of these patients had a positive primary endpoint following a second cycle of treatment. As a result  BioSenic will further use this 2-cycle treatment in its forthcoming trials. This will involve the administration of a double four-week course  separated by a rest period  resulting in a two-to-four times higher total dose of ATO. BioSenic expects thus to get closer to the optimal conditions for a curative treatment for cGvHD  for which there is currently no satisfactory therapy.In the field of oncology  IV ATO is used as a first-line treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) since 2003  with demonstrated safety and long-term remissions. Until now  in APL  ATO was administered daily by IV infusions for up to  or more than  a hundred accumulated doses. IV administration  because it requires hospitalization  is not practical for patients  results in lower quality of life  and is very expensive. The introduction of an oral formulation of ATO during 2 short cycles  presently BioSenic’s optimal design of administration  will greatly improve patient quality of life and compliance  while reducing healthcare costs. This is a significant achievement in BioSenic’s aim to contribute improved and potentially curative treatment for an autoimmune disease  with no current satisfactory medical solutions.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and CEO  BioSenic said:""BioSenic is continuing to investigatenew tricks that an old medication accomplishes in the field of autoimmune diseases. BioSenic’s preclinical and clinical data show that the first-in-class modulatory properties for immune differentiation and homeostatic maintenance of the immune system of arsenic trioxide is much wider and profound than anticipated. The systematic analysis of BioSenic’s clinical results is delivering additional conclusions on the mechanism of action of arsenic salts and also on the optimization of its formulations  dosages and optimal treatment timing. We arenow focused on the finalizing preparations for our phase 3 trial ofa new oral formulation of ATO targeting chronic graft-versus-host disease and devoting our effortsto exploiting clinical data reflecting the properties of arsenic trioxide to provide curative treatments for patients with autoimmune diseases for whom palliative medical treatments are unsatisfactory.”About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in orthopedics.Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined a strategic positionings and strengths to use  separately and combined  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The ATO platform  which has been successfully developed  has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T and other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). cGvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. BioSenic has been successful in a Phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international Phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early Phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a Phase 2 clinical protocol.2) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform developed by BioSenic  with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. ALLOB has recently been evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2b study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late-delayed union. However  in June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in this exploratory Phase 2b clinical trial  interpreted as a failure of a too early cell injection  just after fracture. BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (choice between early or late treatment).Note: Biosenic has reevaluated a previous important and years-long clinical development program. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase 3 JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient subpopulation. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. This leads to a next generation of JTA  off-the-shelf enhanced viscosupplement to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives are intended to provide effective lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic (OA) pain and inflammation.The company  will nevertheless focus its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:SeitoseiActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

The connection of new power plants has therefore been delayed. This is the case for the Canudos and SSM3-6 plants  which are now fully built. At the same time  after having focused largely on internal projects in the first half  the teams are now generating strong activity towards third-party clients  particularly for the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment. In this context  our normalised EBITDA target is now around €275 million  which represents twice the last year level.I thank the teams for their commitment  which allow us to take a major step in Voltalia’s growth in 2023  for Energy Sales as well as for Services ” commented Sébastien Clerc  Voltalia’s CEO.KEY FIGURESIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change at current exchange rates Change at constant exchange rates3 Turnover 198.9 198.1 stable stable EBITDA 56.0 47.2 +18% +17% Net result  Group share -19.4 -4.6 x4.2 x4.3Turnover amounts to €198.9 million  in very slight growth compared to the first half of 2022.EBITDA set at €56.0 million  up +18% compared to the first half of 2022 (+17% at constant exchange rates).The seasonal net loss (Group share) is €-19.4 million  reflecting the seasonal nature of the electricity production of the Voltalia power plants  the overweighting of Services sales in the second half of 2023 compared to the first half and non-recurring items.BUSINESS REVIEWEnergy Sales: growth in EBITDA driven by an increase in production enable by the increase of the installed capacityFinancial key figures In € millionBefore eliminations of services provided internally H1 2023 H1 2022 Change at current exchange rates Change at constant exchange rates Turnover 138.3 96.0 +44% +43% EBITDA 75.6 53.8 +41% +40% EBITDA margin 55% 56% -1pt -1ptOperational indicatorsH1 2023 H1 2022 Var.

In Belgium  Greece  Egypt and Jordania  EBITDA is stable despite a slightly lower production than in the first half of 2022.Services: increase of EBITDA due to strong internal activityIn € millionBefore eliminations of services provided internally H1 2023 H1 2022 Change at current exchange rates Change at constant exchange rates Turnover 271.2 149.7 +81% +82% of which internal turnover 210.5 47.4 x4.4 x4.5 of which external turnover 60.7 102.3 -41% -41% EBITDA 16.6 6.9 x2.4 x2.4 EBITDA margin 6.1% 5.0% +2pts +1ptTurnover from Services (internal and external) reaches €271.2 million  up by +81 % (+82 % at constant exchange rates). In order to achieve growth in the portfolio of directly owned power plants  the teams temporarily focused internally (with an internal turnover multiplied by 4.4)  with less activity for third party clients (turnover decreases by -41%).EBITDA is multiplied by 2.4 (at current and constant exchange rates) to €16.6 million  with an EBITDA margin of 6.1% compared to 5.0% in the first half of 2022.Development  Construction and Equipment ProcurementThe Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment posted a turnover of €252.6 million  up by +88 % (at current and constant exchange rates).Internal turnover (eliminated in consolidation) is multiplied by 5 to €203.2 million in the first half of 2023  reflecting a significant volume of own-account construction sites at 961 MW at the end of June 2023  with a turnover coming mainly from Karavasta (Albania)  Rives Charentaises and Sinnamary (France)  Clifton and Higher Stockbridge (United Kingdom) and Helexia (in several countries).External turnover (with third-party clients) decreased by -47 % to €49.4 million compared to €93.8 million in the first half of 2022. The volume under construction contracts on June 30  2023 has reached 550 MW  multiplied by 2.9 since the previous year. However  few milestones were reached  Voltalia recognizing the turnover from construction to projects advancement: important projects such as Power Capital in Ireland (230 MW  solar) were in the upstream phase in the first half of the year.The EBITDA of the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment is multiplied by 2.4 to reach €15.2 million compared to €6.5 million in the first half of 2022. The EBITDA margin stands at 6%  up by 1 point. Over the period  Development benefited from the sale of projects to third-party clients in Brazil  which do not appear in turnover but have a positive impact on EBITDA. Furthermore  the segment benefits from the strong acceleration in internal activity.Operation and maintenanceTurnover for the Operation & Maintenance segment reached €18.6 million  up by +24 % (+25 % at constant exchange rates)  benefiting from the strong dynamism of activity for third-party clients. Thus  at the end of June 2023  the capacity under management was 5.6 GW (+27%)  including 3.9 GW (+30%) on behalf of third-party clients  in particular more than 550 MW from new contracts in Spain and Brazil.The segment posts an EBITDA of €1.3 million  multiplied by 3.5 in the first half of 2023  benefiting from the growth of its third-party activity.OTHER ITEMS OF THE INCOME STATEMENTChange In € million H1 2023 H1 2022 At actual rates At constant rates EBITDA before eliminations and corporate 92.2 60.7 +52% +51% Eliminations and corporate -36.3 -13.3 x2.7 x2.7 Share of results of equity-accounted companies4 0.9 -0.2 na na EBITDA 56.0 47.2 +18% +17% Depreciation  amortisation  and provisions -47.8 -31.8 +50% +49% Operating revenue (EBIT) 8.2 15.4 -47% -50% Financial result -24.8 -13.9 +79% +79% Taxes and net income of equity affiliates -6.3 -8.3 -24% -25% Minority interests 3.5 2.1 +62% +60% Net result (Group share) -19.4 -4.6 x4.2 x4.3EBITDA before eliminations and corporate increase by +52 % to €92.2 million  mainly reflecting strong growth in Energy Sales.Eliminations are up sharply  reflecting the growth in internal activity driven by an increase in construction sites and commissioning for own account. Consolidated EBITDA amounts to €56.0 million  up +18 % (+17 % at constant exchange rates) compared to the first half of 2022.Depreciation  amortisation and provisions amounts to €-47.8 million  an increase of €16 million (+50 % and +49 % at constant exchange rate). The increase is driven by €8 million from the power plants commissioned in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023  and from the full half-year effect of the power plants commissioned in the first half of 2022. Furthermore  it is also driven by the amount of €8 million of non-recurring items  mainly: (i) stocks of solar panels depreciated due to the drop in market prices  (ii) charges associated with exceptional regulatory measures adopted in France in order to limit the increase electricity prices following the invasion of Ukraine (infra-marginal tax) and (iii) a base effect coming from the reversal of a provision in the first half of 2022 upon the sale of a building in Portugal.The financial result (a net charge) increases by €10.9 million (+79 % at current and constant exchange rate). The debt burden  which rises in line with the growth of the power plant portfolio  increases by €4 million. Interest on deposits (especially on the accounts of subsidiaries dedicated to each power plant)  received mainly in Brazil  decreased by €2 million with the fall of short-term interest rates on Brazilian deposits in real. Exchange rates effects increased by €2 million.After taking into account minority interests and tax  the seasonal loss stands at €-19.4 million  compared to €4.6 million in the first half of 2022.SIMPLIFIED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETVoltalia's balance sheet at the end of June 2023 reached €3.5 billion  up to +14 %.In € million 30/06/2023 31/12/2022 Goodwill 79 87 Tangible and intangible fixed assets 2 497 2 074 Cash and cash equivalents 278 384 Other assets 602 491 Total assets 3 456 3 035 Equity  Group share 1 273 1 232 Minorities 124 107 Financial debt 1 610 1 313 Provisions 29 26 Other current and non-current liabilities 420 357 Total liabilities 3 456 3 035With fixed assets up +20 % to €2.5 billion  the growth in the Group's assets is essentially linked to the increase in the portfolio of power plants in operation and under construction (+€313 million in outstanding assets from power plants under construction).Other current and non-current assets amount to €602 million at the end of June 2023  also up +23 % compared to the end of 2022  in line with the Group's business.Cash flow stands at €278 million.

In terms of technology  solar is the majority at 64 %  followed by wind power for 30 % and other technologies for 6 %.Voltalia announces that its Brazilian Canudos and SSM3-6 power plants are fully completedThe Canudos wind power plant (99 MW) is fully built. It has been ready  for several weeks now  to be tested and to produce. The SSM3-6 solar power plant (260 MW)  which produced its first MWh in July 20236 with a first installment of 17 MW  is now also fully built  with 128 MW in operation and the rest ready for testing and production. The two power plants are backed by a long-term electricity sales contract (14 and 20 years)  whose price is fully indexed on inflation. However  due to the indirect consequences of the widespread blackout in Brazil described below  the Canudos plant and the remaining of SSM3-6 (132 MW) have not yet been able to come in operation.Widespread power outage in Brazil on August 15  2023Following a widespread blackout affecting almost the entire country on 15 August  production at Voltalia power plants in Brazil was shut down for a few hours. The exact origin of this national network outage is not yet known and a study is underway to determine the causes. During this investigation  the Authority adopted  exceptionally  temporary restrictive measures for power plants in operation (production curtailments) and new power plants ready to produce (postponement of connections to the network). These measures  which were intended to be at very short duration  continue to this day.LATEST DEVELOPMENTSVoltalia chosen by Power Capital Renewable Energy for the construction and maintenance of solar power plants totalling 230 MW7Voltalia was chosen by Power Capital Renewable Energy  a major independent energy producer based in Ireland  to provide construction  operation and maintenance services for four photovoltaic projects located in the south-east of the Republic of Ireland  a total capacity of 230 MW.

The half-year accounts were reviewed by Voltalia's Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors at its September 26  2023 meeting.Voltalia will comment its half-year results for 2023  during a live video webcast starting at 8:30 am Paris time on Wednesday September 27  2023. Login details are available on our website: https ://www.voltalia.com/fr/investor-relations.« The commissioning of power plants owned by Voltalia has been occurring one after the other since the beginning of 2023 as well as in 2022. Electricity production therefore jumped by 41 % in the first half. The base effect of the commissioning in the first half of the year as well as those to come will allow this trend to continue. However  the pace of ramp-up has temporarily slowed in Brazil where  following a widespread power blackout  that affected almost the entire network for a few hours.The connection of new power plants has therefore been delayed. This is the case for the Canudos and SSM3-6 plants  which are now fully built. At the same time  after having focused largely on internal projects in the first half  the teams are now generating strong activity towards third-party clients  particularly for the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment. In this context  our normalised EBITDA target isnow around €275 million  which representstwice the last year level.I thank the teams for their commitment  which allow us to take a major step in Voltalia’s growth in 2023  for Energy Sales as well as for Services ” commented Sébastien Clerc  Voltalia’s CEO.KEY FIGURESIn € million H1 2023 H12022 Change at current exchange rates Change at constant exchange rates3 Turnover 198.9 198.1 stable stable EBITDA 56.0 47.2 +18% +17% Net result  Group share -19.4 -4.6 x4.2 x4.3Turnover amounts to €198.9 million  in very slight growth compared to the first half of 2022.EBITDA set at €56.0 million  up +18% compared to the first half of 2022 (+17% at constant exchange rates).The seasonal net loss (Group share) is €-19.4 million  reflecting the seasonal nature of the electricity production of the Voltalia power plants  the overweighting of Services sales in the second half of 2023 compared to the first half and non-recurring items.BUSINESS REVIEWEnergy Sales: growth in EBITDA driven by an increase in production enable by the increase of the installed capacityFinancial key figures In € millionBefore eliminations of services provided internally H1 2023 H1 2022 Change at current exchange rates Change at constant exchange rates Turnover 138.3 96.0 +44% +43% EBITDA 75.6 53.8 +41% +40% EBITDA margin 55% 56% -1pt -1ptOperational indicatorsH1 2023 H1 2022 Var.

In Belgium  Greece  Egypt and Jordania  EBITDA is stable despite a slightly lower production than in the first half of 2022.Services: increase of EBITDA due to strong internal activityIn € millionBefore eliminations of services provided internally H1 2023 H1 2022 Change at current exchange rates Change at constant exchange rates Turnover 271.2 149.7 +81% +82% of which internal turnover 210.5 47.4 x4.4 x4.5 of whichexternal turnover 60.7 102.3 -41% -41% EBITDA 16.6 6.9 x2.4 x2.4 EBITDA margin 6.1% 5.0% +2pts +1ptTurnover from Services (internal and external) reaches €271.2 million  up by +81 % (+82 % at constant exchange rates). In order to achieve growth in the portfolio of directly owned power plants  the teams temporarily focused internally (with an internal turnover multiplied by 4.4)  with less activity for third party clients (turnover decreases by -41%).EBITDA is multiplied by 2.4 (at current and constant exchange rates) to €16.6 million  with an EBITDA margin of 6.1% compared to 5.0% in the first half of 2022.Development  Construction and Equipment ProcurementThe Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment posted a turnover of €252.6 million  up by +88 % (at current and constant exchange rates).Internal turnover (eliminated in consolidation) is multiplied by 5 to €203.2 million in the first half of 2023  reflecting a significant volume of own-account construction sites at 961 MW at the end of June 2023  with a turnover coming mainly from Karavasta (Albania)  Rives Charentaises and Sinnamary (France)  Clifton and Higher Stockbridge (United Kingdom) and Helexia (in several countries).External turnover (with third-party clients) decreased by -47 % to €49.4 million compared to €93.8 million in the first half of 2022. The volume under construction contracts on June 30  2023 has reached 550 MW  multiplied by 2.9 since the previous year. However  few milestones were reached  Voltalia recognizing the turnover from construction to projects advancement: important projects such as Power Capital in Ireland (230 MW  solar) were in the upstream phase in the first half of the year.The EBITDA of the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment is multiplied by 2.4 to reach €15.2 million compared to €6.5 million in the first half of 2022. The EBITDA margin stands at 6%  up by 1 point. Over the period  Development benefited from the sale of projects to third-party clients in Brazil  which do not appear in turnover but have a positive impact on EBITDA. Furthermore  the segment benefits from the strong acceleration in internal activity.Operation and maintenanceTurnover for the Operation & Maintenance segment reached €18.6 million  up by +24 % (+25 % at constant exchange rates)  benefiting from the strong dynamism of activity for third-party clients. Thus  at the end of June 2023  the capacity under management was 5.6 GW (+27%)  including 3.9 GW (+30%) on behalf of third-party clients  in particular more than 550 MW from new contracts in Spain and Brazil.The segment posts an EBITDA of €1.3 million  multiplied by 3.5 in the first half of 2023  benefiting from the growth of its third-party activity.OTHER ITEMS OF THE INCOME STATEMENTChange In € million H1 2023 H1 2022 At actual rates At constant rates EBITDA before eliminations and corporate 92.2 60.7 +52% +51% Eliminations and corporate -36.3 -13.3 x2.7 x2.7 Share of results of equity-accounted companies4 0.9 -0.2 na na EBITDA 56.0 47.2 +18% +17% Depreciation  amortisation  and provisions -47.8 -31.8 +50% +49% Operating revenue (EBIT) 8.2 15.4 -47% -50% Financial result -24.8 -13.9 +79% +79% Taxes and net income of equity affiliates -6.3 -8.3 -24% -25% Minority interests 3.5 2.1 +62% +60% Net result (Group share) -19.4 -4.6 x4.2 x4.3EBITDA before eliminations and corporate increase by +52 % to €92.2 million  mainly reflecting strong growth in Energy Sales.Eliminations are up sharply  reflecting the growth in internal activity driven by an increase in construction sites and commissioning for own account. Consolidated EBITDA amounts to €56.0 million  up +18 % (+17 % at constant exchange rates) compared to the first half of 2022.Depreciation  amortisation and provisions amounts to €-47.8 million  an increase of €16 million (+50 % and +49 % at constant exchange rate). The increase is driven by €8 million from the power plants commissioned in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023  and from the full half-year effect of the power plants commissioned in the first half of 2022. Furthermore  it is also driven by the amount of €8 million of non-recurring items  mainly: (i) stocks of solar panels depreciated due to the drop in market prices  (ii) charges associated with exceptional regulatory measures adopted in France in order to limit the increase electricity prices following the invasion of Ukraine (infra-marginal tax) and (iii) a base effect coming from the reversal of a provision in the first half of 2022 upon the sale of a building in Portugal.The financial result (a net charge) increases by €10.9 million (+79 % at current and constant exchange rate). The debt burden  which rises in line with the growth of the power plant portfolio  increases by €4 million. Interest on deposits (especially on the accounts of subsidiaries dedicated to each power plant)  received mainly in Brazil  decreased by €2 million with the fall of short-term interest rates on Brazilian deposits in real. Exchange rates effects increased by €2 million.After taking into account minority interests and tax  the seasonal loss stands at €-19.4 million  compared to €4.6 million in the first half of 2022.SIMPLIFIED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETVoltalia's balance sheet at the end of June 2023 reached €3.5 billion  up to +14 %.In € million 30/06/2023 31/12/2022 Goodwill 79 87 Tangible and intangible fixed assets 2 497 2 074 Cash and cash equivalents 278 384 Other assets 602 491 Total assets 3 456 3 035 Equity  Group share 1 273 1 232 Minorities 124 107 Financial debt 1 610 1 313 Provisions 29 26 Other current and non-current liabilities 420 357 Total liabilities 3 456 3 035With fixed assets up +20 % to €2.5 billion  the growth in the Group's assets is essentially linked to the increase in the portfolio of power plants in operation and under construction (+€313 million in outstanding assets from power plants under construction).Other current and non-current assets amount to €602 million at the end of June 2023  also up +23 % compared to the end of 2022  in line with the Group's business.Cash flow stands at €278 million. This level can be compared to a total financial debt of €1 610 million as of June 30  2023  an increase of €297 million reflecting the growth in the portfolio of power plants.

In terms of technology  solar is the majority at 64 %  followed by wind power for 30 % and other technologies for 6 %.Voltalia announces that its Brazilian Canudos and SSM3-6 power plants are fully completedThe Canudos wind power plant (99 MW) is fully built. It has been ready  for several weeks now  to be tested and to produce. The SSM3-6 solar power plant (260 MW)  which produced its first MWh in July 20236 with a first installment of 17 MW  is now also fully built  with 128 MW in operation and the rest ready for testing and production. The two power plants are backed by a long-term electricity sales contract (14 and 20 years)  whose price is fully indexed on inflation. However  due to the indirect consequences of the widespread blackout in Brazil described below  the Canudos plant and the remaining of SSM3-6 (132 MW) have not yet been able to come in operation.Widespread power outage in Brazil on August 15  2023Following a widespread blackout affecting almost the entire country on 15 August  production at Voltalia power plants in Brazil was shut down for a few hours. The exact origin of this national network outage is not yet known and a study is underway to determine the causes. During this investigation  the Authority adopted  exceptionally  temporary restrictive measures for power plants in operation (production curtailments) and new power plants ready to produce (postponement of connections to the network). These measures  which were intended to be at very short duration  continue to this day.LATEST DEVELOPMENTSVoltalia chosen by Power Capital Renewable Energy for the construction and maintenance of solar power plants totalling 230 MW7Voltalia was chosen by Power Capital Renewable Energy  a major independent energy producer based in Ireland  to provide construction  operation and maintenance services for four photovoltaic projects located in the south-east of the Republic of Ireland  a total capacity of 230 MW. All four projects are currently under construction.Full power for the new Garrido complex in Portugal8The Portuguese Garrido complex composed of five solar power plants with a total capacity of 50.6 MW  has been fully commissioned  after a partial commissioning that began in March 2023.The Rives Charentaisesplant delivered its first megawatt hours to SNCF Voyageurs9The Rives Charentaises plant began producing electricity in August with the first eight wind turbines. The other nine wind turbines are gradually be put into service by the end of November  reaching a total power of 37.4 MW. Production will avoid the equivalent of 12 700 tonnes of CO2 per year. The wind farm is backed by a sales contract with SNCF Voyageurs  via its internal electricity supplier SNCF Energie  which will purchase all of the plant's production for 25 years. The wind farm will cover 1 4 % of SNCF Voyageurs’ traction electricity consumption.Helexia signs a distributed generation partnership with Prime Energy in Brazil10Helexia  a subsidiary of Voltalia and an international player in the energy transition  has signed a 46 MW contract with Prime Energy  one of Brazil's largest electricity traders.

In a complex energy market  we demonstrated the resilience of our business model  and the major competitive advantage that WAGABOX® technology gives us in the landfill gas recovery market. The structuring work accomplished in recent months  and our successful move into the North American market  mean we can confidently execute our growth plan and step up our actions for the energy transition"".Waga Energy (Euronext Paris: FR0012532810  EPA: WAGA)  a specialist in the production of renewable natural gas using landfill gas  has published results for the first half of 2023  ending June 30  approved by the Board of Directors on September 26  2023. The Group delivered a solid performance in the first half of 2023  marked by strong sales growth and accelerated international expansion  while limiting the rise in operating costs.Revenue doubledWaga Energy generated revenue of €13.7 million (+95% on first-half 2022)  75% of which came from renewable natural gas sales and purification services invoiced to landfill operators (€10.2 million). The rise in France's regulated feed-in tariff  decreed in November 2022 on the basis of economic indices  accounted for 10% of this increase. Excluding this ""price effect""  the increase in revenue generated by renewable natural gas sales and purification services reached 48%.H1 2023 revenue also included €3.2 million corresponding to the percentage-of-completion recognition of the sale of two cryogenic distillation modules to Air Liquide in the United States  and of a WAGABOX® unit to the Capital Regional District (CRD) for the Hartland site (Canada). The latter was concluded in August 2022 for a total amount of C$30 million and is recognized in sales as the project progresses.Growth of 48% in renewable natural gas productionWaga Energy injected 142 GWh (484 500 mmBTu) of renewable natural gas into the grid in the first half of the year (+48%)  thanks to increased production capacity. The Group benefited from the ramp-up of a high-capacity unit near Paris  which came onstream in March 2022  and from the commissioning of four additional units since June 2022  at Montois-la-Montagne (France)  Milhac-d'Auberoche (France)  Saint-Étienne-des-Grés (Canada) and Els Hostalets de Pierola (Spain). The successful start-up of the first international units (4% of renewable natural gas production over the half-year) represents a major step in the deployment of WAGABOX® technology in Europe and North America. At June 30  2023  the Group had 17 WAGABOX® units in operation in France  Spain and Canada.The increase in renewable natural gas production also stemmed from the high level of equipment availability  which averages 95% for the entire plant fleet.To date H1 2023 End-2022 H1 2022 Units in operation Number 17 17 14 13 Capacity (GWh/year) 640 640 415 390 Units under construction Number 16 12 15 13 Capacity (GWh/year) 915 420 645 590 Total (GWh/year) 1 555 1 060 1 060 980Results reflecting the ramp-up and operational structuringWaga Energy generated EBITDA of -€3.1 million for the first half of 2023  compared to -€2 million in the first half of 2022. This change stemmed primarily from the Group's international structuring and organization. The Group has recruited 59 people over the past 12 months  primarily to strengthen engineering teams in North America. As of June 30  2023  it employed 175 people.The change in EBITDA also reflected higher energy and raw materials costs  although these were partially offset by indexation mechanisms included in contracts.In June  Waga Energy also obtained ISO 9001 and ISO14001 dual certification for Europe  attesting to the implementation of a high-performance quality management system  and the company's commitment to sustainable development objectives.Increased investmentsIn line with its strategy  Waga Energy stepped up investment in its asset base (capex) over the first half of the year to €20.5 million  compared with €14.1 million in the first half of 2022. The increase mainly concerned the commissioning of large-capacity units in Canada and Spain  and the construction of the first unit in the United States (Bath  New York). The Group also used equity to finance the construction of other units in France and Canada.Waga Energy aims to refinance all these units with bank loans. In March 2023  the Group obtained a long-term  non-recourse bank loan of €6.6 million from Bpifrance to finance its Spanish unit.As of June 30  2023  the Group's balance sheet was solid  with shareholders' equity of €105.1 million and cash and cash equivalents of €58.8 million  compared with financial debt of €50.5 million. The Group also has a drawing capacity of over €21 million on non-recourse bank debt  which it can use to finance its growth.Breakthrough in North AmericaIn the first half of 2023  Waga Energy managed to engage in exclusive negotiations with several operators of public and private landfill sites in the strategic US market. Four of these have already converted into major contracts signed over the summer: the Group began construction of three large-capacity units on sites of private operator Casella Waste Systems  a major player in recycling and waste management in the eastern United States  and a fourth unit on the Davenport site (Iowa)  operated by Scott County. These four new units will provide an additional installed capacity of 495 GW/h (1 690 000 mmBTu). In addition  the Group is in exclusive negotiations for several contracts in North America representing a potential installed capacity of 1.2 TWh/year (4 095 000 mmBTu).At the date of this press release  the Group operates 17 WAGABOX® units in France  Canada and Spain  with an installed capacity of 640 GWh/year (2 184 000 mmBTu). It is also currently building 16 more units  for additional installed capacity of over 900 GWh/year (3 071 000 mmBTu). Once they are all up and running  these 33 units will offer total installed capacity of over 1.5 TWh/year (5 118 000 mmBTu).Based on projects in operation and projects signed  the Group estimates that annual contractual and recurring revenue is now in excess of €80 million per year  compared with €46 million at the time of the 2022 results publication last April[2].Strengthened by its achievements  Waga Energy is confident it can deliver revenue of €200 million and installed capacity of 4 TWH/year in 2026.Upcoming event:Publication of 2023 revenue on February 28  2024 after market closeAbout Waga EnergyWaga Energy (EPA: WAGA) produces competitively priced Renewable Natural Gas by upgrading landfill gas using a patented purification technology called WAGABOX®.

In 2023  this transaction generated a cash inflow of €30 million for Exail Technologies  the capital gain is fully recognized in the first-half accounts. The ISP division now contributes to the 2022 income statement only on the line of income from discontinued operations (application of IFRS 5).154 million in revenues in the first half of 2023Exail technologies achieved +14% revenue growth in the 1st half of 2023  with an acceleration in the second quarter (+19%).Navigation & Maritime robotics segment: advances in civil and defense applicationsRevenues in the Navigation & Maritime robotics segment grew by +11% in the 1st half of 2023  including +20% in the 2nd quarter of 2023. This segment includes the two main activities of the group  vertically integrated: the sale of navigation and positioning systems and the marketing of drones and autonomous drone systems for maritime applications. Revenue growth is driven by three important drivers:Progress on ongoing major defence programmes  including underwater mine action programmesThe growth of existing applications in the maritime field  for various sectors (marine renewable energies  shipyards  etc.)The breakthrough on booming applications thanks to differentiating solutions  such as underwater mapping by drone or space navigation.Advanced Technologies segment: strong demand translates into record deliveriesThis segment consists of developing and marketing the most efficient photonic and quantum components (special optical fibers  optical modulators  quantum measurement instruments) and products using the most advanced technologies (embedded communication equipment  simulators  decision-making autonomy). These components and products are sold directly to third parties or integrated into the systems of the Navigation & Maritime robotics segment.The ramp-up of the production rate of this segment continues and was able to meet the significant orders of the quarter  both for internal needs and for third-party customers. Revenues in this segment increased by +28%. The very diverse customer base includes many leading players in lasers  telecommunications  aeronautics  space  defense and quantum  who rely on Exail as a strategic and recurring supplier.More details on H1 2023 revenues are available in the dedicated press release published on July 26  2023 (link to the press release).Operating income by division[4](€ million) H1 2023 H1 2022 equivalent scope[5] VarM€ Change% Navigation & Maritime Robotics Revenues 116 4 104 7 +12 +11% Current EBITDA 24 8 - - - Current EBITDA margin (%) 21 3% - - - Income from ordinary activities 14 9 - - - Advanced technologies Revenues 41 3 32 2 +9 +28% Current EBITDA 7 4 - - - Current EBITDA margin (%) 17 9% - - - Income from ordinary activities 4 8 - - -A current EBITDA margin of 21%Exail Technologies generated recurring EBITDA of €32m in the first half of 2023  in line with expectations in this first year of integration of the new Exail group. On an equivalent basis  the current EBITDA margin was down on last year and close to that of the second half of the year. It is at a good level and may vary from one half-year to the next depending on the mix of margins on business delivered during the year.The Navigation and Maritime Robotics segment  which accounts for the bulk of the Group's activities  achieved a recurring EBITDA margin of 21% in the first half  thanks to progress on major defense programs and deliveries of inertial navigation systems.The Advanced Technologies segment generated 18% current EBITDA margin. It includes on the one hand high-margin activities  such as optical fibers for laser applications  but also activities in development (such as terrestrial drones and some quantum instruments) that still contribute little to the group's profitability this year. The performance of this division is also impacted by the decline in products sold for the aerospace sector  where customers are waiting for the new version of the ELITE SC emergency beacon.Operating income of €8 millionDepreciation and provisions amounted to €14 million in the 1st half of 2023  a stable level compared to last year. Income on ordinary activities thus amounted to €17.4 million.Other operating income amounted to €9 million  half of which came from the decline in the value of Prodways Group shares and had no effect on cash[6]. These Prodways Group shares were distributed to shareholders in June 2023. The balance includes costs related to the employee incentive and retention plan implemented by iXblue (renamed EXAIL) for several years and the latest costs related to the acquisition of iXblue. As a result  the company's operating income amounted to €8 million.Cost of financial debt on the rise  with partial effect on cash flowThe acquisition of iXblue was carried out without a capital increase by Exail Technologies thanks to the leverage effect created at the level of the subsidiary EXAIL HOLDING  to which ECA Group was contributed. This financial structure offers significant value creation potential  due to the amplification of the effects of the group's growth through financial leverage. However  it generates an increase in the cost of financial debt  to €12 million in the 1st half of 2023.A significant portion of the interest recognized - the interest on bonds issued to ICG - is capitalized and therefore has no effect on cash. Disbursements related to debt interest therefore represent slightly more than half of the expense in the income statement. These costs are expected to decrease in the coming years as the company gradually deleverages.Financial structure at end-June 2023Cash flow from operating activities[7] amounted to €28m in the first half of 2023. This performance was offset by a sharp increase in working capital (+€31m)  penalized by a traditionally unfavorable seasonality between the two half-year periods  particularly this year on the BENL program payment milestones. WCR was also impacted by a payment delay of one working day (from June 30 to July 4)  amounting to €7 million.Capex amounted to €14 million  mainly including investments in R&D  as well as investments in certain production tools.Exail Technologies also received €30 million thanks to the sale of the ISP division in the 1st half of 2023. This sale proceeds were used in July 2023 to acquire 5% of the subsidiary EXAIL Holding for €24.5 million (see press release of 26 July).At the end of June 2023  the Group's cash position therefore amounted to €70 million (compared to €59 million at the end of 2022). The adjusted group's net debt was relatively stable at €269 million  including the obligations in fine (2030) subscribed by financial partner ICG. It stands at €183 million excluding these bonds  which have no cash impact before maturity.PerspectivesOrder intake of €139m in H1 2023  up 6% on H1 2022New orders for the first half were driven by the Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment  with €110 m of new orders  up €14 m on the same period last year. Although this performance was relatively disappointing  it remains solid given the postponement of certain ongoing tenders in the field of underwater mine countermeasures  particularly in the Middle East. Several processes are still underway and Exail Technologies will continue to communicate on the progress of these projects  while respecting the confidentiality constraints of these processes.The Advanced Technologies segment booked €31 m of orders in the first half of 2023  down €6 m on the same period last year. Against a backdrop of strong sales momentum in the optical components business  the Group decided to give priority to the internal needs of the Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment at the expense of external orders  to be able to meet the high demand for inertial navigation systems. Orders were also adversely affected by lower sales of on-board equipment for the aerospace industry  as mentioned earlier in this press release.Supportive and well-oriented marketsThe Group's markets remain buoyant thanks to the continuation of supportive underlying trends in the Group's main applications. In the civil sector  the needs for cutting-edge equipment for hydrographic missions remains strong. They are driven by sovereign priorities such as the construction of offshore wind farms  ocean protection and deep-sea exploration. These trends are reflected in recent orders taken by the Group  which in September announced a record order in the civil maritime sector for navigation equipment and a new order for the DriX drone.In the defense sector  the overall increase in defense budgets worldwide (+$130 billion by 2022) is supporting the Group's activities. The modernization and dronization of naval forces is beginning  enabling navies to carry out protection and surveillance missions more effectively and at lower cost. The French Navy's Centre for Strategic Studies expects ""a proliferation of drones""[8]  which should benefit the Group's activities.Exail Technologies achieves a start to 2023 with a good level of revenue and profitability. The Group confirms its 2023 objective of revenue growth of more than 15% compared to 2022 revenue on an equivalent scope. The Group's management therefore expects significantly higher revenue in the second half of the year.Upcoming financial eventsQ3 2023 activity: October 26  2023About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is the new name of Groupe Gorgé  adopted after the transformation of the group at the end of 2022  now focused on the activities of its subsidiary Exail.

In 2023  this transaction generated a cash inflow of €30 million for Exail Technologies  the capital gain is fully recognized in the first-half accounts. The ISP division now contributes to the 2022 income statement only on the line of income from discontinued operations (application of IFRS 5).154 million in revenues in the first half of 2023Exail technologies achieved +14% revenue growth in the 1st half of 2023  with an acceleration in the second quarter (+19%).Navigation & Maritime robotics segment: advances in civil and defense applicationsRevenues in the Navigation & Maritime robotics segment grew by +11% in the 1st half of 2023  including +20% in the 2nd quarter of 2023. This segment includes the two main activities of the group  vertically integrated: the sale of navigation and positioning systems and the marketing of drones and autonomous drone systems for maritime applications. Revenue growth is driven by three important drivers:Progress on ongoing major defence programmes  including underwater mine action programmesThe growth of existing applications in the maritime field  for various sectors (marine renewable energies  shipyards  etc.)The breakthrough on booming applications thanks to differentiating solutions  such as underwater mapping by drone or space navigation.Advanced Technologies segment: strong demand translates into record deliveriesThis segment consists of developing and marketing the most efficient photonic and quantum components (special optical fibers  optical modulators  quantum measurement instruments) and products using the most advanced technologies (embedded communication equipment  simulators  decision-making autonomy). These components and products are sold directly to third parties or integrated into the systems of the Navigation & Maritime robotics segment.The ramp-up of the production rate of this segment continues and was able to meet the significant orders of the quarter  both for internal needs and for third-party customers. Revenues in this segment increased by +28%. The very diverse customer base includes many leading players in lasers  telecommunications  aeronautics  space  defense and quantum  who rely on Exail as a strategic and recurring supplier.More details on H1 2023 revenues are available in the dedicated press release published on July 26  2023 (link to the press release).Operating income by division[4](€ million) H1 2023 H1 2022 equivalent scope[5] VarM€ Change% Navigation & Maritime Robotics Revenues 116 4 104 7 +12 +11% Current EBITDA 24 8 - - - Current EBITDA margin (%) 21 3% - - - Income from ordinary activities 14 9 - - - Advanced technologies Revenues 41 3 32 2 +9 +28% Current EBITDA 7 4 - - - Current EBITDA margin (%) 17 9% - - - Income from ordinary activities 4 8 - - -A current EBITDA margin of 21%Exail Technologies generated recurring EBITDA of €32m in the first half of 2023  in line with expectations in this first year of integration of the new Exail group. On a like-for-like basis  the recurring EBITDA margin was down on last year and close to that of the second half of the year. It is at a good level and may vary from one half-year to the next depending on the mix of margins on business delivered during the year.The Navigation and Maritime Robotics segment  which accounts for the bulk of the Group's activities  achieved a recurring EBITDA margin of 21% in the first half  thanks to progress on major defence programmes and deliveries of inertial navigation systemsThe Advanced Technologies segment generated 18% current EBITDA margin. It includes on the one hand high-margin activities  such as optical fibers for laser applications  but also activities in development (such as terrestrial drones and some quantum instruments) that still contribute little to the group's profitability this year. The performance of this division is also impacted by the decline in products sold for the aerospace sector  where customers are waiting for the new version of the ELITE SC emergency beacon.Operating income of €8 millionDepreciation and provisions amounted to €14 million in the 1st half of 2023  a stable level compared to last year. Income on ordinary activities thus amounted to €17.4 million.Other operating income amounted to €9 million  half of which came from the decline in the value of Prodways Group shares and had no effect on cash[6]. These Prodways Group shares were distributed to shareholders in June 2023 The balance includes costs related to the employee incentive and retention plan implemented by iXblue (renamed EXAIL) for several years and the latest costs related to the acquisition of iXblue. As a result  the company's operating income amounted to €8 million.Cost of financial debt on the rise  with partial effect on cash flowThe acquisition of iXblue was carried out without a capital increase by Exail Technologies thanks to the leverage effect created at the level of the subsidiary EXAIL HOLDING  to which ECA Group was contributed. This financial structure offers significant value creation potential  due to the amplification of the effects of the group's growth through financial leverage. However  it generates an increase in the cost of financial debt  to €12 million in the 1st half of 2023.A significant portion of the interest recognized - the interest on bonds issued to ICG - is capitalized and therefore has no effect on cash. Disbursements related to debt interest therefore represent slightly more than half of the expense in the income statement. These costs are expected to decrease in the coming years as the company gradually deleverages.Financial structure at end-June 2023Cash flow from operating activities[7] amounted to €28m in the first half of 2023. This performance was offset by a sharp increase in working capital (+€31m)  penalized by a traditionally unfavorable seasonality between the two half-year periods  particularly this year on the BENL program payment milestones. WCR was also impacted by a payment delay of one working day (from June 30 to July 4)  amounting to €7 million.Capex amounted to €14 million  mainly including investments in R&D  as well as investments in certain production tools.Exail Technologies also received €30 million thanks to the sale of the ISP division in the 1st half of 2023. This sale proceeds were used in July 2023 to acquire 5% of the subsidiary EXAIL Holding for €24.5 million (see press release of 26 July).At the end of June 2023  the Group's cash position therefore amounted to €70 million (compared to €59 million at the end of 2022). The adjusted group's net debt was relatively stable at €269 million  including the obligations in fine (2030) subscribed by financial partner ICG. It stands at €183 million excluding these bonds  which have no cash impact before maturity.PerspectivesOrder intake of €139m in H1 2023  up 6% on H1 2022New orders for the first half were driven by the Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment  with €110 m of new orders  up €14 m on the same period last year. Although this performance was relatively disappointing  it remains solid given the postponement of certain ongoing tenders in the field of underwater mine countermeasures  particularly in the Middle East. Several processes are still underway and Exail Technologies will continue to communicate on the progress of these projects  while respecting the confidentiality constraints of these processes.The Advanced Technologies segment booked €31 m of orders in the first half of 2023  down €6 m on the same period last year. Against a backdrop of strong sales momentum in the optical components business  the Group decided to give priority to the internal needs of the Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment at the expense of external orders  to be able to meet the high demand for inertial navigation systems. Orders were also adversely affected by lower sales of on-board equipment for the aerospace industry  as mentioned earlier in this press release.Supportive and well-oriented marketsThe Group's markets remain buoyant thanks to the continuation of supportive underlying trends in the Group's main applications. In the civil sector  the needs for cutting-edge equipment for hydrographic missions remains strong. They are driven by sovereign priorities such as the construction of offshore wind farms  ocean protection and deep-sea exploration. These trends are reflected in recent orders taken by the Group  which in September announced a record order in the civil maritime sector for navigation equipment and a new order for the DriX drone.In the defense sector  the overall increase in defense budgets worldwide (+$130 billion by 2022) is supporting the Group's activities. The modernization and dronization of naval forces is beginning  enabling navies to carry out protection and surveillance missions more effectively and at lower cost. The French Navy's Centre for Strategic Studies expects ""a proliferation of drones""[8]  which should benefit the Group's activities.Exail Technologies achieves a start to 2023 with a good level of revenue and profitability. The Group confirms its 2023 objective of revenue growth of more than 15% compared to 2022 revenue on an equivalent scope. The Group's management therefore expects significantly higher revenue in the second half of the year.Upcoming financial eventsQ3 2023 activity: October 26  2023About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is the new name of Groupe Gorgé  adopted after the transformation of the group at the end of 2022  now focused on the activities of its subsidiary Exail.

The strategy to expand the sales of our Specialty Products in key locations with the addition of strategic sales resources and distributors  combined with our focus on industrial opportunities for the Water Technologies and Services (WTS) business pillar has really paid off. We also directed our efforts towards the development of the Corporation’s O&M customer base through scope of work expansions. Meanwhile  the pressure on gross profit margins represented our main challenge for FY2023  notably in the Maple business line as previously mentioned in September 19  2023 press release. After managing constant price increases in our supply chain and high inflation in the labor market  we now see more stability on the horizon. We have implemented initiatives to recover and improve our gross profit margin profile in the coming quarters  such as amongst others  price increase programs  CPI adjustments on O&M contracts and the insourcing of some of our manufactured products. With an improvement of cash flow generated from operating activities resulting into a reduction of our net debt level  we look into the future with confidence in maintaining the sustained organic revenue growth and improved margin profile as per our Three-Year Strategic Plan. The Corporation’s financial position  more favorable market conditions and our disciplined approach for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) should enable us to capture new organic and acquisition growth opportunities. Overall  we remain committed to our 3-Year Strategic Plan and objectives ” stated Frédéric Dugré  President  Chief Executive Officer and co-Founder of H 2 O Innovation.1 Non-IFRS measures are presented as additional information and should be used in conjunction with the IFRS financial measurements presented in this press release. A definition of all non-IFRS measures and additional IFRS measures are provided in the MD&A in the section ‘’Non‑IFRS financial measurements’’ to give the reader a better understanding of the indicators used by management. Quantitative reconciliations of non-IFRS financial measures are presented below under the section “Non-IFRS financial measurements.”Financial results for fiscal year 2023With three strong and complementary business pillars  the Corporation is well balanced and not dependent on a single source of revenue  enabling it to generate a sustained revenue growth for the fiscal year ended on June 30  2023. Consolidated revenues coming from the Corporation’s three business pillars  for fiscal year ended on June 30  2023  increased by $68.9 M  or 37.4%  to reach $253.3 M compared to $184.4 M for the comparable period of the previous fiscal year. This increase mainly came from an organic revenue growth1 of $37.1 M  or 20.1%  and an acquisition growth1 of $24.3 M  or 13.2%  combined with a favorable exchange rate impact of $7.6 M  or 4.1%.(In thousands of Canadian dollars) Three-month periods ended June 30  Twelve-month periods ended June 30  2023 2022 2023 2022 $ % (a) $ % (a) $ % (a) $ % (a) Revenues per business pillar WTS 15 057 23.2 12 997 25.0 50 138 19.8 42 440 23.0 Specialty Products 18 987 29.2 13 360 25.7 85 527 33.8 54 397 29.5 O&M 30 916 47.6 25 689 49.4 117 654 46.4 87 519 47.5 Total revenues 64 960 100.0 52 046 100.0 253 319 100.0 184 356 100.0 Gross profit margin before depreciation and amortization 15 287 23.5 13 464 25.9 63 755 25.2 49 607 26.9 SG&A expenses(b) 12 511 19.3 9 667 18.6 44 211 17.5 33 376 18.1 Net earnings (loss) for the period (2 289) (3.5) 2 445 4.7 (1 296) (0.5) 5 107 2.8 EBITDA1 1 999 3.1 1 999 3.8 17 445 6.9 13 079 7.1 Adjusted EBITDA1 3 126 4.8 4 754 9.1 21 404 8.4 18 101 9.8 Adjusted net earnings (loss)1 (176) (0.3) 1 627 3.1 7 796 3.1 8 848 4.8 Recurring revenues2 57 272 88.2 43 543 83.7 224 278 88.5 156 511 84.9(a) % of total consolidated revenues. (b) Selling  general operating and administrative expenses (“SG&A”).WTS’s revenues for the year ended June 30  2023 increased by $7.7 M  or 18.1%  coming from organic revenue growth related to service activities and water treatment systems projects combined with a favorable foreign exchange impact. WTS’ EBAC2 increased by $0.7 M or 17.1%  representing an increase in dollars  but a slight decrease in percentage over revenues. The increase of WTS’s EBAC in dollars is mainly attributable to improved project performance  but the decrease in percentage over revenues is due to higher selling and general expenses to support sales important growth.Specialty Products’ revenues stood at $85.5 M for the year ended June 30  2023  compared to $54.4 M for the previous fiscal year  representing an increase of $31.1 M  or 57.2%. This increase was driven by strong sales and an efficient marketing strategy execution combined with the addition of strategic sales resources. Specialty Products’ business pillar delivered components and consumables to large desalination plants and penetrated strategic regions in the Middle East during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. This momentum was sustained during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 with a breakthrough in the Israeli market. Furthermore  enhanced sales synergies between the Corporation’s various product lines were achieved  combined with a growth of $12.1 M from the acquisition of Leader  which led to a significant revenue growth. Specialty Products’ EBAC2 increased by $3.1 M  or 20.4%  representing an increase in dollars  but a decrease in percentage over revenues. Even if Specialty Products’ EBAC was positively impacted by strong sales growth  pressure on gross margin and business mix between specialty chemicals  components  consumables  and maple farming equipment negatively affected the ratios.1 These non-IFRS measures are presented as additional information and should be used in conjunction with the IFRS financial measurements presented in this press release. Definition of all non-IFRS measures and additional IFRS measures are provided at the end of this press release in section ‘’Non-IFRS financial measurements’’ to give the reader a better understanding of the indicators used by management. 2 The definition of EBAC means the earnings before administrative costs and other items in note 25 of the consolidated financial statements. EBAC is a non-IFRS measure  and it is used by management to monitor financial performance and to make strategic decisions. The definition of EBAC used by the Corporation may differ from those used by other companies.O&M’s revenues stood at $117.7 M for the year ended June 30  2023  compared to $87.5 M for the same period of last fiscal year  representing an increase of $30.2 M  or 34.4%. The O&M business pillar showed organic growth of $12.7 M  or 14.5%  coming from important scope expansions and new projects secured in previous quarters. The acquisitions of JCO and EC contributed to an acquisition growth for the year ended June 30  2023  of $12.1 M  or 13.9%  combined with a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of $5.3 M.The gross profit margin before depreciation and amortization stood at $63.8 M  or 25.2% for the year ended June 30  2023  compared to $49.6 M  or 26.9% for the same period of last fiscal year  representing an increase of $14.2 M  or 28.5%  while the revenues of the Corporation increased by 37.4%. The decrease in percentage for the year ended June 30  2023 is explained by high inflation of material costs  pressure on salaries  business mix within the Specialty Products business pillar combined with the most challenging maple syrup harvest season in many years due to unseasonable weather conditions.The Corporation’s SG&A reached $44.2 M for the year ended June 30  2023  compared to $33.4 M for the same period of the previous fiscal year  representing an increase of $10.8 M  or 32.5%  while the revenues of the Corporation increased by 37.4%. Those increases are due to the pressure on salaries  the hiring of additional resources as well as higher stock-based compensation costs. Despite the increase in SG&A expenses  the percentage of SG&A expenses over revenues (SG&A ratio) for the twelve-month period decreased by 0.6%  showing the scalability of our business model as revenues continue to grow. Investments made in sales and business development are paying off since revenues are growing faster than the SG&A ratio.The Corporation’s adjusted EBITDA1 increased by $3.3 M  or 18.2%  to reach $21.4 M for the year ended June 30  2023  from $18.1 M for the previous fiscal year. The adjusted EBITDA % decreased by 1.4% and reached 8.4% for the year ended June 30  2023  compared to 9.8% for the same period last year. Those variations are mostly explained by a decrease in the Corporation’s consolidated gross profit margin  considering that the Corporation’s profitability has been impacted by ongoing macroeconomic trends on the supply chain  higher inflation  increased wages and the most challenging maple season in a decade.Net loss amounted to $1.3 M and $0.014 per share for fiscal year ended June 30  2023  compared to net earnings of $5.1 M and $0.058 per share for the previous fiscal year. The variation was explained by the reduction in gross profit margins  higher depreciation and amortization  higher finance costs  higher tax expense  partially offset by other gains related to the debt extinguishment.As at June 30  2023  the combined backlog of secured contracts between WTS and O&M reached $189.6 M compared to $163.0 M as at June 30  2022  which is an increase of 16.3%. This combined backlog provides good visibility on revenues for the upcoming quarters of fiscal year 2024 and beyond.The net debt including contingent considerations1 stood at $39.9 M  compared to $50.3 M as at June 30  2022  representing a $10.4 M decrease attributable to a higher cash balance.1 These non-IFRS measures are presented as additional information and should be used in conjunction with the IFRS financial measurements presented in this press release.

The maker of CoverGirl and Lancaster products began trading on the exchange at 3:30 p.m. CET.,PARIS — On its first day of trading on the professional segment of Euronext Paris Thursday  Coty Inc. stock remained stable  closing the day down about 0.1 percent to 10.39 euros.The maker of CoverGirl and Lancaster products began trading on the exchange at 3:30 p.m. CET.More from WWDAs previously reported  the beauty company  which is already listed on the New York Stock Exchange  on Monday announced the launch of a global offering of 33 million shares of Coty’s outstanding Class A common stock. It is part of a plan to secure a double listing in Paris.The price was set at 10.28 euros  or $10.80 per share.Coty said in May that it was looking into a dual listing. The company had gone public in New York in 2013.In May  during an interview with WWD  Coty chief executive officer Sue Y. Nabi explained why the company was mulling such a move in the French capital.“European investors want to buy Coty stock. It’s as simple as this ” she said. “This is the right moment to do so. Eleven quarters in line or ahead of expectation is a good moment to start this. I would say that on the Paris Stock Exchange half of the market cap is made with beauty and luxury companies  and we are a beauty and luxury company.”Coty intends to use the net proceeds of an offering primarily to pay off outstanding debt and also for general corporate purposes  such as making investments  working capital and capital expenditures.At the close of its most recent fiscal year  ended June 30  Coty’s net debt stood at $4 billion.Best of WWDClick here to read the full article.,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,positive,0.75,0.23,0.02,True,English,"['Euronext Paris', 'Coty', 'Trading', 'outstanding Class A common stock', 'Coty chief executive officer', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Sue Y.

The consolidated half-year financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 27 September 2023.Key figures H1 2023 H1 2022 Revenues (€000) 1 437 1 746 Gains on disposal of securities2 (€000) - 1 041 Consolidated net income/(loss) (€000) (2 992) (846) First half average headcount1 78 51 Key figures 30/06/2023 31/12/2022 Capacity of plants under development (MW) 909 751 Shareholders' equity (€000) 105 327 107 410 Cash and cash equivalents (€000) 76 736 87 359Employees and contractors in countries where the Company has no dedicated legal entity Sale of shares to investors in SPVsCommercial rollout and strengthening of technical teamsProspecting initiatives in 2022 enabled us to expand the portfolio of projects under development  which had increased by over 20% at 30 June 2023 compared to 31 December 2022.Portfolio monitoring provides the earliest indicator of HDF's value creation for both the group and all project stakeholders. The HDF group estimates that it is able to generate revenues representing between 12% and 17% of the cost of construction during the development and construction phases  including via the provision of engineering services and supply of fuel cells during the power plant construction phase.After focusing mainly on commercial rollout in 2022  the priority for early 2023 was to strengthen the central technical teams in order to ensure monitoring of the excellent sales results achieved in 2022  as reflected in the business portfolio. Accordingly  the Technical Division hired 17 new employees  mainly at head office.Construction of the Blanquefort plant and consolidation of the industrial projectThe deployment of technical teams includes the teams dedicated to the launch of fuel cell manufacturing in 2024 following the delivery of the Blanquefort plant scheduled for late 2023. Nearly €6 million was invested in this area during the first half.Meanwhile  the group is expanding its deployment strategy in the marine and rail mobility sectors by acquiring equity interests in Digas  a Latvian company specialising in locomotive retrofitting  and Hynaval (after the 30 June balance sheet date)  which specialises in the design  manufacture and retrofitting of hydrogen-powered ships. These two investments support strategic partnerships aimed at combining these companies' business expertise with HDF's experience throughout the hydrogen value chain.The relevant European Commission departments are currently examining the IPCEI application (Important Project of Common European Interest). The decision is now expected by mid-2024 and will allow the group to step up the project's implementation.Half-year results reflecting commercial and technical investmentsConsolidated revenues for H1 2023 totalled €1.4 million versus €1.7 million in H1 2022. This mainly corresponds to revenues recognised under the Renewstable Barbados (RSB) project development contract and includes re-invoicing  without margin  for services outsourced to external service providers for €0.5 million (compared to €0.05 million in H1 2022).Due to delays in project development and in the sale of shares to investors in certain SPVs  we were not able to generate consolidated revenues corresponding to the services rendered for our most advanced projects  other than RSB  during the first half. Invoicing issued by HDF in H1 2023 for project management assistance services for projects over which the group will retain control  the impact of which is eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  amounted to €0.7 million  versus €1.6 million in H1 2022. This value creation will be recognised indirectly through gains or losses on disposal of the investments when control is lost.Accordingly  in 2022 the group posted a €1 million gain on disposal following the loss of control in RSB (compared to zero gains or losses on disposals in H1 2023).The acceleration of the development plan and team structuring drive led to an increase in operating expenses. Average headcount (employees and contractors) rose from 51 in H1 2022 to 78 in H1 2023.Despite the significant financial profit derived from cash investments  the group posted a €3.0 million consolidated net loss for H1 2023  compared to a €0.8 million loss in H1 2022.Solid financial structure  promising outlookAt 30 June 2023  Group shareholders' equity stood at €105.3 million compared to €107.4 million at 31 December 2022. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €76.7 million  down from €87.4 million at 31 December 2022 as a result of the industrial investments made during the period.As such  the Company still has the financial means required to continue its development and accelerate its commercial rollout.In French Guiana  various demonstrations have held up construction work on the CEOG power plant  which was temporarily suspended for several months in 2023. Construction work resumed on 16 August 2023. On this occasion  HDF paid a €0.3 million current account advance in August 2023 and committed on 7 September 2023 to the payment of an additional €0.95 million staggered over the plant construction phase. This landmark project remains profitable for HDF despite this additional financing.Discussions are currently underway regarding the schedule for the transferral of fuel cell ownership to Siemens Energy in 2023 or 2024  when HDF will recognise the corresponding revenues.The strong momentum observed in 2022 has continued into 2023 with the signing of partnerships  notably with the governments of Indonesia and Philippines.HDF Energy is therefore entering the coming months with confidence.Damien Havard  Chairman and CEO of Hydrogène de France  said: ""In line with our strategic plan  prospecting and team structuring have continued since the beginning of 2023. The positive progress made on projects under development gives us confidence in the future economic benefits. All our teams are committed to this goal. The industrial component is currently being rolled out and new markets are taking shape through concrete partnerships. Our solid financial structure is a source of confidence for planning the plant's commissioning and the development of these new markets.""ABOUT HYDROGÈNE DE FRANCE (HDF Energy)HDF Energy is a leading global player in the hydrogen industry  dedicated to developing large-scale hydrogen infrastructure and advanced multi-megawatt fuel cell technology.

Some of the largest companies in this sector  including LVMH  L’Oreal SA  Hermes International and Kering SA  are traded on Euronext Paris  creating an ecosystem of analysts and investors with deep knowledge of the industry.Coty has in recent months “been able to attract leading investors  particularly in France and throughout Europe ” Chief Financial Officer Laurent Mercier said in written comments. This will help the company to “ensure real liquidity in Paris” and also diversify its shareholder base  he said.Demand for Coty’s offering “significantly” exceeded the size of the share sale  according to Mercier.Coty’s ties to France date back to 1904  when it was founded in Paris. The cosmetics company has called its move a return to “the historic home of beauty.”The company plans to use proceeds from the share sale to pay down debt and fund general corporate purposes  including strategic investments in its business  working capital and capital expenditures.BNP Paribas SA  Credit Agricole SA  Citigroup Inc. and Banco Santander SA are joint global coordinators on the offering.,neutral,0.3,0.69,0.01,neutral,0.12,0.82,0.06,True,English,"['Beauty Firm Coty', '$356 Million Offering', 'Paris', 'Chief Financial Officer Laurent Mercier', 'general corporate purposes', 'L’Oreal SA', 'BNP Paribas SA', 'Credit Agricole SA', 'Banco Santander SA', 'New York-listed shares', 'joint global coordinators', 'Kering SA', 'new stock', 'global center', 'golden hour', 'Jie Zhang', 'perfume stocks', 'largest companies', 'Hermes International', 'deep knowledge', 'recent months', 'real liquidity', 'shareholder base', 'share sale', 'historic home', 'strategic investments', 'working capital', 'capital expenditures', 'Citigroup Inc.', 'luxury stocks', 'European investors', 'leading investors', 'cosmetics company', 'Euronext Paris', 'open', '2% discount', 'Wednesday', 'listing', 'AlphaValue', 'decision', 'interest', 'appeal', 'Coty', 'developing', 'role', 'sector', 'LVMH', 'ecosystem', 'analysts', 'industry', 'France', 'comments', 'offering', 'size', 'ties', 'The', 'move', 'beauty', 'proceeds', 'debt', 'business']",2023-09-28,2023-09-28,dailymaverick.co.za
