To accurately quantify food waste and comply with shared standards  each property is encouraged to measure its waste using  Gaïa a dedicated online reporting tool unique to Accor hotels. This technology-based solution makes it easier for hotels to measure and monitor their energy  water  waste and carbon footprint performance  so that they can accurately track the impact of their sustainability initiatives. To date  71% of the Group’s affiliate  managed and franchised hotels  spread across 3 900 properties  have adopted this platform. The Group plans to extend this to all its hotels with catering operations by 2025.Within the IFWC  Accor is working to define a common methodology for measuring and establishing best practices to help reduce food waste in commercial and contract catering.Accor has long been committed to transforming the way we work and to supporting our hotels and guests as they move towards more ethical consumption. To go even further  we first need to work on developing industry-wide standards. Accor is a committed member of the IFWC (International Food Waste Coalition)  which is working to define and implement a methodology and targets for measuring and reducing food waste. Secondly  it is essential to roll out working  reporting and analysis methods based on a rigorous scientific approach. To achieve this  Accor is now leveraging the latest technological advances in Artificial Intelligence. Thanks to these two levers  the Group aims to exceed its targeted 50% reduction in food waste by 2030. Brune Poirson  Chief Sustainability OfficerIn average  almost 20 tons of food waste is generated per hotel each year  accounting for around 43% of a hotel’s total waste. While 45% of food waste in hotels comes from processing and excess preparation  34% is due to food left on plates. The remaining 20% is the result of poor inventory management.Accor is joining forces with three start-ups that leverage Artificial Intelligence to accelerate its transformationTo help reduce waste at source  200 pilot programs have been launched in properties that generate significant F&B sales.Since 2016  Winnow Vision has been scanning and visually recognizing surplus food to obtain detailed data on its quantity and type  enabling teams to adjust menus and reduce food waste. The solution is currently being used in around 100 properties  including at Fairmont Jakarta  which has reduced its food waste by 16% (1.6 tons) in a single year  and Novotel London Excel  which has reduced waste by 39%  a reduction of12 tons.Using Artificial Intelligence  Orbisk  a startup awarded the Accor Challenge at Viva Technology 2021  scans leftover food to obtain clear data on the amount and type of food being thrown away  helping to adjust menus and thus reduce waste. This has been used at Sofitel The Palm in Dubai  which has reduced its food waste by 13% in five months  corresponding to an 3 tons annually  and Novotel Amsterdam Schiphol Airport  which has cut its waste by 35%  the equivalent of 8 tons over two years.Lastly  Fullsoon  a predictive management solution for restaurants  estimates the number of customers  the dishes that will be ordered and the exact quantity of ingredients needed to prepare them. This start-up emerged from our intrapreneurship program launched by the Innovation Lab. Through this initiative Accor enabled a Group employee to devote 100% of his time to bringing his idea to life  financing his project and creating his start-up before ultimately leaving the Group so that Fullsoon could take off. Damien Perrot  Global Chief Design  Technical Services & Innovation Officer SME  said  We’re working to get 10 pilots up and running by the end of 2023  before rolling out to a large number of hotels worldwide  with the aim of optimizing F&B margins by 6% and saving an average of €800 in waste per hotel per month.Changing habitsSharing best practices for positively influencing the behavior of employees – and particularly chefs – is another point of action. The Group has designed specific training modules for its kitchen teams on the topic of food waste.Improving customer awareness of the need to combat food waste is also an essential daily task for our teams: interacting  raising awareness and embarking on our journey to encourage them to adopt more responsible habits. Accor is also committed to selling uneaten food at reduced prices or donating it through a partnership we launched back in 2017 with Too Good to Go. In 2023  137 116 baskets have already been collected from the 685 participating hotels  preventing over 345 tons of excess CO2 emissions and saving 137 tons of food from the trash can.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries in 5 400 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

The conclusion? There was no consensus among economists. But  according to Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions experts  that doesn’t have to mean that lenders must wait around for experts to agree  as there are still long-term economic trends—and regulatory realities—with which lenders must contend.“At a time when all lenders are struggling to reduce costs  some institutions may be tempted to reduce staffing in areas like compliance that don’t generate revenue or profit ” says Simon Moir  Vice President  Banking Compliance Solutions  Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions in a recent article for HousingWire  “The Market Outlook May Be Unclear  but Lender Challenges Cannot Get Clearer.”“Given the current zero-tolerance environment  however  this is dangerous  short-term thinking. Fair lending examination  supervision and enforcement  for example  are top priorities for the CFPB  the prudential regulators  DOJ and HUD ” he says.Moir goes on to explain why maintaining the long view is essential for lender success in a dynamic economic and regulatory environment.“Regardless of market conditions  there is a need to ensure that compliance and risk management teams are fully staffed and supported at the highest levels of the organization. One way to leverage these resources is to support them with data and analytics solutions that automate various compliance tasks  such as HMDA and CRA reporting ” Moir says. “These solutions can provide early warning signs for major lending issues  such as redlining  appraisal bias or identifying practices that could be deemed unfair or abusive. The goal should always be to identify these issues before regulators do.”HousingWire is an influential source of news and information for the U.S. mortgage and housing markets  boasting a readership that spans lending  servicing  investments and real estate market participants as well as financial market professionals.Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions is a market leader and trusted provider of risk management and regulatory compliance solutions and services to U.S. banks  credit unions  insurers and securities firms.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneCompanies listed on the Irish Stock Exchange  Euronext Dublin  contributed €12.4 billion to the domestic economy last year  according to a report commissioned by the exchange and local stockbrokers  which calls for Government support to reboot the market as departures outpace initial public offerings (IPOs).The report  written by Grant Thornton  has called for the establishment of a so-called “cornerstone fund” to participate in IPOs  tax incentives for retail investors to put money into public companies and tax breaks for founders or owners of companies that join the market.It also urged that stamp duty on Irish share trading be abolished – something Euronext Dublin has long campaigned for – and that Enterprise Ireland and Euronext initiate a fresh campaign to encourage companies to consider listing. Enterprise Ireland was among the four parties to commission the report.“Ireland is at a pivotal moment with regards to public listings. Action is required to ensure the domestic equity market remains a viable funding mechanism for Irish companies  commercially viable for market participants  and continues to support the funding needs of Ireland’s growing companies ” the report said. “A local exchange is critical to supporting local enterprise.”READ MOREDublin-listed companies employ approximately 47 000 people across the State  directly generating €6.7 billion in wages  the report said. A further 40 000 jobs are indirectly supported by such companies  it added.All told  the publicly-quoted companies contributed about €12.4 billion gross value added to the economy last year  including indirect impacts  it said.The figure was based on 2022 data  before a series of announcements from some of the largest companies on the Stock Exchange heightened the existential crisis facing the Irish equities market.CRH  previously the Iseq’s largest company  delisted from Euronext Dublin last week as it moved its primary quotation from London to New York. Another heavyweight  Smurfit Kappa  said earlier this month that it also plans to quit the Irish exchange for New York as part of a merger with a US peer.Both  however  have committed to remaining domiciled in the Republic.Flutter Entertainment  owner of Paddy Power  is also expected to leave the Irish market in the near future  having decided earlier this year to take out a listing in the US.Department of Finance officials have warned that nutrition company Glanbia  insulation maker Kingspan and food group Kerry may also be tempted by a US listing.

To this end  the Company has retained the services of a leading investment bank.This license search is a priority in the Company's strategy  given the number of clinical studies already conducted and the maturity of the pipeline  and given the additional investments required to complete the clinical program  up to market authorizations. We want to highlight that the duration of this license search is not predictable and that the realization of a license is dependent on a number of factors and is not guaranteed. However  the milestones reached at this stage are essential factors that contribute to the feasibility of this strategy.As a result of the focus strategy  AB Science has decided to adapt its organization  which lead to a significant reduction in costs. AB Science has therefore implemented a redundancy plan.This strategic focus reinforces and sustains the existing agreement between certain shareholders of AB Science and Alain Moussy.Update on the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) timetable for examination of the masitinib marketing authorization application in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)AB Science provided an update on the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) timetable for examination of the masitinib marketing authorization application in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).The timetable extension was requested by AB Science in order to address a question from the CHMP that arose following implementation of a guidance  updated on July 28  2023  from the EMA. This guidance requested all marketing authorisation holders to review their manufacturing processes for all products containing chemically synthesised or biological active substances to identify and  if necessary  mitigate the risk of presence of nitrosamine impurities.Because performing this activity was not compatible with the conventional 30 days stop-clock  AB Science requested an extension of this stop-clock in order to complete a risk evaluation of the manufacturing process in terms of risk of formation of nitrosamines in active substance and finished product.An extension of clock-stop is not automatic. A request for extension together with a corresponding scientific justification must be submitted by the applicant and needs to be discussed in a CHMP plenary session. AB Science’s request was accepted during the September 11-14  2023 CHMP session.Based on this updated timetable  the CHMP decision on masitinib marketing authorization in ALS is expected during the first quarter of 2024.Based on the current stage of investigations  AB Science is confident that the current manufacturing process of masitinib complies with this new EMA guidance.Strengthening of AB Science's intellectual property position in ALSAB Science announced that the patent office of Japan and the patient office of Canada have issued a Notice of Allowance (NOA) for a patent relating to methods of treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with its lead compound masitinib.These new patents provide strong protection for masitinib in the treatment of ALS until 2037 and complete the IP coverage for ALS across all key geographic areas where masitinib could be marketed.First complete bone marrow response in a n acute myeloid leukemia patient in its AB8939 Phase I/II clinical trialAB Science announced in March 2023 a case report from the initial stage of its Phase I/II study (AB18001) evaluating AB8939  a microtubule destabilizer  in patients with refractory and relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).The AML patient in question was in failure to prior treatment with azacitidine and presented with a MECOM gene rearrangement  which is a biomarker for resistance to standard chemotherapies that is associated with a high-risk of disease progression and inferior prognosis.One month after the first treatment cycle (i.e.  three consecutive days of AB8939 treatment) there was a drastic reduction in bone marrow blast cells (i.e.  leukemia cells)  from a pretreatment level of 55% to 5% (i.e.  a morphologic leukemia free state). Remarkably  this response was achieved at a very low dose of AB8939  corresponding to the second step of dose increment (out of 13 potential steps) in phase I. The patient also showed excellent tolerance to AB8939  having experienced no treatment-related toxicities. At the request of the investigator  AB Science has authorized further treatment cycles of AB8939 to this patient. One month after the second treatment cycle of three consecutive days at this dose  a good response has been maintained with bone marrow blasts being at 10% (corresponding to a 5-fold reduction relative to baseline). A third treatment cycle for this patient has been initiated.Considering the overall study to date  there have been no signs of moderate  severe or serious toxicity and approximately 50% of patients have requested further treatment cycles of AB8939 after the first cycle of treatment and a measurement at day 28.CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2023The operating loss as of June 30  2023 was 8 850 K€  compared to a loss of 9 562 K€ as of June 30  2022  i.e. a decrease in the operating loss of 712 K€ (7.5%).Operating income  exclusively made up of sales related to the operation of a veterinary medicine  amounted to 448 K€ as of June 30  2023 compared to 629 K€ one year earlier  a decrease of 28.8%. This decrease is due to a product supply disruption between August 2022 and April 2023  due to a change in the synthesis process for Masivet active ingredient (masitinib)  which required to submit a variation of Masivet marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  which was approved in April 2023.Operating expenses amounted to 9 298 K€ as of June 30  2023  compared to 10 192 K€ as of June 30  2022  a decrease of 8.8%.Marketing expenses decreased by 13.8% from 253 K€ as of June 30  2022 to 218 K€ as of June 30  2023.Administrative expenses were stable compared with 30 June 2022 (down 2%).Research and development expenses decreased by 886 K€  i.e 10.9 %  from 8 099 K€ as of June 30  2022 to 7 213 K€ as of June 30  2023. This variation is mainly explained by: the increase in the research tax credit (633 K€)  the decrease in the value of warrants issued as payment for research and development services  from 414 K€ as of 30 June 2022 to 160 K€ as of 30 June 2023.The financial income as of June 30  2023 is a loss of 1 569 K€ compared to a gain of 2 424 K€ one year earlier. As of June 30  2023  financial income (1 042 K€) corresponded mainly to the difference between the cancellation of the recognition of the ADPC debt following their cancellation for 3 692 K€ and the recognition of the new E shares  created to replace the ADPCs and with a value of 2 908 K€ as of 30 June 2023. This transaction generated net proceeds of 784 K€. Financial expenses (2 610 K€) mainly relate to the restatement of the bond loan contract (985 K€)  interest on loans (947 K€) and the discounting of conditional advances (652 K€). These effects had no cash impact.The net loss as of June 30  2023 amounts to 10 411 K€ compared to a loss of 7 141 K€ as of June 30  2022.The following table summarizes the consolidated financial statements for the first half of 2023 prepared in accordance with IFRS  and comparative information with the first half of 2022:In thousands of euros  except for share data 30/06/2023 30/06/2022 Net turnover 448 629 Cost of sales and marketing expenses (219) (158) Marketing expenses (218) (253) Administrative expenses (1 648) (1 682) Research and development expenses (7 213) (8 099) Operating income (8 850) (9 562) Financial income 1 042 3 847 Financial expenses (2 610) (1 423) Financial income (1 569) 2 424 Net income (10 411) (7 141) Other comprehensive income for the period net of tax 51 174 Total comprehensive income for the period (10 360) (6 967) Basic earnings per share - in euros (0.22) (0.15) Diluted earnings per share - in euros (0.22) (0.15)In thousands of euros 30/06/2023 31/12/2022 Cash and cash equivalents 14 786 7 269 Total Assets 33 198 23 841 Equity (19 225) (35 670) Non-current liabilities 1 209 393 Trade payables 12 417 12 248 Current liabilities 21 381 23 079OTHER CORPORATE INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2023 AND SINCE JUNE 30  2023Drawdown of the second tranche of €6 million under its financing agreement with the European Investment BankAB Science announced in January 2023 that it has received payment of €6.0 million as the second tranche of a €15 million loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB).The second tranche has a maturity of five years and is therefore repayable in January 2028. It carries a capitalized annual interest rate of 7.0% and the issuance of 115 830 warrants  each giving the right to subscribe to one ordinary share of AB Science at 14.0 euros for 15 years. These warrants represent 0.22% of the current capital of the Company (if they were to be exercised in their entirety).Financial restructuringOn 21 April 2023  AMY S.A.S and Alain Moussy (majority shareholders)  AB Science and the minority shareholder entities (including in particular the convertible bondholders  the Tax Research Credit lenders and the APDC holders) signed an Agreement relating to:(i) the implementation of AB Science's new strategy (ii) the financing of AB Science and(iii) the restructuring of AB Science's bond debt and Class C preference shares.These transactions were the subject of an agreement signed by the parties on 21 April 2023  the date on which all transactions were accounted for  and are detailed in section 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements as of 30 June 2023.Restructuring of convertible bonds issued in February 2022 and Class C preferred sharesAB Science announced on 21 April 2023 the negotiation of a framework agreement under which the terms and conditions of the bond issue agreement (entered into with the holders of the US$8.5 million convertible bonds issued in February 2022 and to which 50 000 warrants were attached with an exercise price of 000 warrants with an exercise price of EUR 12.65) would be amended to provide  on 15 July 2023 and automatically  for the conversion of all the convertible bonds into ordinary shares of AB Science on the basis of a price per share of EUR 5.75 (i.e. the subscription price of the New Shares).The framework agreement has also been negotiated with the holders of Class C preferred shares (the “C Preferred”). It provides the C Preferred still in circulation to be repurchased by AB Science for one symbolic euro (and subsequently cancelled). 520 786 share warrants (each warrant entitling the holder to subscribe for one ordinary share of AB Science at par value for a period of 12 months) will be issued in substitution of the C Preferred. In addition  still in substitution of the C Preferred  it provides a new class of preferred shares to be created  benefiting from priority dividend rights (equal to 1.25% of the net sales of masitinib or of any licensing royalties  up to a limit of 9.0 million euros) and convertible into 750 000 ordinary shares of AB Science if the share price of AB Science exceeds a threshold of 30 euros for more than 90 consecutive days.Finally  it has been proposed to the shareholders to extend the term of certain lines of warrants already issued  to adapt to the evolution of AB Science’s strategy and of its clinical pipeline.These agreements were submitted approved by the General Meeting of AB Science held on 30 June 2023.Capital increase for an amount of 15 million eurosAB Science announced on April 24  2023 the success of its capital increase through the issuance of new ordinary shares with attached warrants  with a waiver of preferential subscription rights.The Capital Increase consisted of a private placement pursuant to Articles L. 225-136 of the French Commercial Code and L. 411-2 1° of the French Monetary and Financial Code and has been carried out with a waiver of preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the delegation of authority granted to the Board of Directors under the 20th resolution of the Combined General Shareholders’ Meeting of June 29  2022. The Capital Increase has taken the form of the issuance of 2 608 686 actions new ordinary shares (the “New Shares”) to each of which are attached a share subscription warrant (the “Warrants”).The Capital Increase was made through a cash contribution of approximately EUR 11.5 million and by offsetting existing receivables  i.e. approximately EUR 3.0 million (receivables related to the pre-financing of the research tax credit for the 2020 financial year and maturing in 2023  as well as approximately EUR 500 000 in interest accrued to date on the convertible bonds issued in February 2022).Two warrants giving the right to subscribe to one ordinary share  all of the 2 608 686 New Shares and all of the 1 304 343 new shares that would be issued upon exercise of the warrants  i.e. a total of 3 913 029 shares in the Company  represent 7.36% of the Company's current share capital. The issue price of the New Shares has been set at 5.75 euros (0.01 euro par value and 5.74 euros issue premium) and the exercise price of the Warrants at 8.625 euros  representing a total fundraising of approximately EUR 15.0 million (taking into account the exercise of the warrants  the maximum amount of the Capital Increase could be increased by an amount of 26.3 million euros).The Warrants may be exercised from January 1st  2025 to December 31  2030.Renewal of the Programme d’Augmentation de Capital à Terme ( PACT ) concluded with Alpha Blue OceanAlpha Blue Ocean is committed to subscribe  from April 28  2023  to newly issued shares of AB Science (in tranches comprised of a number of shares between 500 000 and 1 million) over a period of 24 months  up to a maximum of 4.0 million shares in total (or 7.2% of the company’s share capital on the basis of the capital after the capital increase announced on 24 April 2023). Such subscriptions for new shares shall be carried out using the 28th resolution of the Shareholder’s Meeting of June 29  2022 (as renewed or otherwise amended  if applicable).By way of example  based on the April 27  2023 closing price of AB Science’s shares  i.e 6.27 euros  on Euronext Paris  it is estimated that AB Science could raise approximately 25 million euros through this equity financing facility.For each tranche  the issuance price of new shares of AB Science  subscribed by Alpha Blue Ocean  shall be equal to 100% of the volume-weighted average price of the shares of AB Science traded on Euronext Paris over the three trading days preceding a tranche drawdown request.For each tranche  and after the settlement-delivery of the new shares of AB Science following the relevant capital increase  80% of the proceeds of the tranche shall be secured in an escrow account with a third-party escrow agent. The remaining balance shall be kept by AB Science.Following predefined trading rules for each tranche  Alpha Blue Ocean shall manage the orderly sale  on or off the market  of the AB Science shares subscribed to. 95% of the proceeds shall be distributed to AB Science on a monthly basis (minus a structuration fee)  directly from Alpha Blue Ocean or by way of a release from the escrow account.AB Science has no obligations to draw down on the PACT and shall utilise this innovative financing solution only if necessary and if the market conditions are favourable to the interests of AB Science and its shareholders.For each drawdown  the number of shares issued with respect to this agreement and admitted to trading will be reported in an Euronext notice and in a specific communication on AB Science’s website.Investors are invited to take note of the risks associated with this transaction  potentially dilutive of 7.2% of the company’s share capital on the basis of the capital after the capital increase announced on 24 April 2023  which could create downward pressure on the AB Science share. Investors are also invited to be vigilant before taking the decision to invest in a company that carries out such operations  particularly when they are carried out successively. AB Science recalls that the present dilutive financing operation is not the first one it has put in place.Other eventsOther securities transactionsDuring the first half of 2023  2 739 516 share warrants were allocated  including 115 830 to the European Investment Bank as part of the financing agreement  2 608 686 relating to the capital increase and 15 000 to the directors.Other informationAB Science confirms its eligibility for PEA-PME (a share savings plan aimed at providing finance to SMEs) in accordance with decree no. 2014-283 of 4 March 2014 taken for the application of article 70 of law no. 2013-1278 of 29 December 2013 of finance for 2014 fixing the eligibility of companies for PEA-PME  i.e. less than 5 000 employees on the one hand  an annual turnover of less than 1 500 million euros or a total balance sheet of less than 2 000 million euros  on the other hand.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

However  considering that the operating results of the business unit devoted to television productions conferred to Loft have been fully included in the results of the period ended June 30  2022 and already disclosed to the market  it is deemed useful  for the purpose of clear disclosure of the Group's performance  to also show the comparison period exclusively for the main items in the Income Statement.*Because this is the first period of consolidation  the previous period of comparison is not shown.

Revenues attributable to the publishing sector are mainly composed of revenues from (i) newsstand sales of the daily newspaper in the amount of €7 349 thousand; (ii) sales of the monthly magazine FQMillennium in the amount of €152 thousand; (iii) sales of Paper First books in the newsstand and bookstore channel in the amount of €758 thousand; and (iv) sales of digital subscriptions of publishing products and digital content in the amount of €2 980 thousand.Media content sector : revenues in the media content sector show a total increase of 23.2% to which growth in all lines contributed. Specifically  revenues are composed of (i) exploitation of TV content of Euro 1 388 thousand; (ii) sales of theater shows and events of Euro 149 thousand; and (iii) TVLOFT App subscriptions of Euro 157 thousand.Advertising sector : advertising revenues amounted to 1 572 thousand euros and showed a decrease of approximately 14%. The decrease had been predicted by the advertising concessionaires and is therefore not unexpected. Revenues for the first half of 2023 are essentially composed of (i) advertising sales on the newspaper in the amount of €356 thousand; (ii) advertising sales on the website in the amount of €1 214 thousand.(in Euro thousands) Time Period 30.06.2023 % V.d.P. 30.06.2022 % V.d.P.

In particular  EBITDA of €1 155 thousand  or 6.7% of the Value of Production  was more than doubled in percentage and absolute terms  compared to the €566 thousand recorded as of June 30  2022.Net income for the period as of June 30  2023 shows a loss of €1 117 thousand  down from the loss of €1 900 thousand recorded in the same period of the previous year.Gross investments for the period in intangible fixed assets amounted to Euro 2 618 thousand essentially due to (i) the production of television content amounting to Euro 1 703 thousand  all content for which the company holds all copyright and economic exploitation rights over time; (ii) total investments for digital and technological innovation intended for new projects related to the digital transition still in progress amounting to Euro 261 thousand and those intended for the new business line development project in the training sector totaling Euro 557 thousand.Gross investments in tangible fixed assets amounted to 13 thousand Euro.Financial fixed assets  which amounted to Euro 865 thousand as of June 30  2023  were adjusted for the amounts of asset management carried out by Banca Fideuram amounting to Euro 419 thousand  which can be liquidated at the request of the Company and therefore reclassified under NFI under ""Current Financial Receivables.""Net Operating Working Capital is negative in the amount of Euro 1 994 thousand and consists exclusively of assets and liabilities related to core operations. The balances show amounts in line with historical amounts and the values of trade receivables and payables are congruent with the volume of assets and the average days of collection and payment usually applied by the Company. All amounts are due within the next fiscal year.Consolidated Shareholders' Equity shows a negative balance of €792 thousand net of the consolidated net income for the period as of June 30  2023. In addition to the loss of €1 117 thousand  shareholders' equity consists of share capital of €2 501 thousand  total Reserves of €4 242 thousand net of loss carried forward of €5 278 thousand  and the negative Reserve for treasury shares in portfolio of €1 140 thousand. The total value of the Consolidated Shareholders' Equity was negatively affected by the operations of eliminating intercompany items and the consequent elimination of values related to the contribution of the Loft business unit.It should be noted that the value of Consolidated Shareholders' Equity has no relevance for the purposes of statutory regulations on share capital  for which only the values of the individual financial statements of Group companies  which are positive  are relevant.Current Net Financial Indebtedness of 1 369 thousand Euro  consists of cash and cash equivalents net of the ""within the year"" portion of bank loans to be repaid in the following 12 months. For the purpose of calculating the NFI  amounts related to freely available securities management for the Company  amounting to 419 thousand Euro  allocated to financial fixed assets on the balance sheet  were reclassified under “Financial Receivables”. The amount of Euro 642 thousand shown under non-current financial debt refers to the portion repayable beyond 12 months of the loan issued by Unicredit S.p.A. in 2020. Total net financial debt was €2 012 thousand as of June 30  2023.Significant events that occurred during the periodThe 2023 fiscal year is the one in which  as envisaged in the 2023 - 2025 business plan  the main projects were developed and defined  namely the one related to the ""School of Fact "" the WEB 3.0 Community  and those related to the digital transition of publishing products. The strategy of developing audio-visual content production activities was also implemented through the subsidiary Loft Produzioni S.r.l.  which began to build a growth path through diversification of projects and expansion of relationships by consolidating some co-productions.Significant events after the close of the first half of the yearIn the months after June 30  2023  the Company recorded growth in some indicators  such as subscriptions and newsstand sales. The increase in digital revenues indicate the positive impact of the related production and commercial strategies included in the plan from 2023  which are beginning to deliver the expected results. All production and commercial activities continued smoothly allowing the maintenance of market positioning and the technological infrastructure development program  resulting in continued investment and strengthening of the organization and technical structure necessary to continue the development of new projects in particular Community 3.0 and Training. The investment program to support the developments of the projects envisaged in the business plan will be supported by the cash flow from income management and partly by the cash flow from financial management.Foreseeable development of managementThe trend in production and sales volumes of individual product lines and the growth in digital revenues allows for the smooth running of management activities and the implementation of planned developments within the timeframe set out in the business plan. In the last quarter of 2023  both the Training project with the delivery of the first two training courses and the WEB 3.0 project will be launched. Both will be the focus of management activities in 2024 along with the strong push for digital transition of all publishing products.The trends recorded during the period and the progress of the implementation program of the new projects suggests that the economic and financial results are expected to be in line with those forecasted over the 2023-2025 plan period  and therefore  at the moment  there is no reason to change the 2025 targets.***The consolidated half-yearly financial report as of June 30  2023 will be made available to the public at the Company's registered office  on the Company's website www.seif-spa.it (Investor Relations section)  and on the website www.borsaitaliana.it  Shares/Documents section  within the terms prescribed by current regulations.For the dissemination of regulated information SEIF uses the 1INFOSDIR dissemination system (www.1info.it)  managed by Computershare S.p.A. having its registered office in Milan  Via Lorenzo Mascheroni No. 19 and authorized by CONSOB.This press release is available in the Investor Relations/Press Releases section of www.seif-spa.it and at www.1info.it.***SOCIETÀ EDITORIALE IL FATTO S.P.A.

It was an invite-only event for family and friends. Photograph Nick BradshawIn what is set to be his first full public appearance since the RTÉ payments row last summer  Ryan Tubridy will be the keynote speaker at the Women and Agriculture conference at the Lyrath hotel in Kilkenny on October 25th.Tubridy will be having a “fireside chat” with Ciara Leahy of Irish Country Living  the organisers. She’ll be asking him about “hosting an iconic chatshow  presenting radio programmes and writing best-selling books”. The Oireachtas Media Committee  this isn’t. Janine Kennedy  acting editor of Irish Country Living  agrees the conference aims to have a positive and encouraging tone.Launched in 2008  it was originally designed to give women connected to agriculture a day off from farming. It’s always a sell-out  Kennedy says  and 500 of the 600 tickets for next month’s event have already been shifted.Tubridy’s appearance  which will last about half an hour  was booked through his agent Noel Kelly but organisers will not disclose the fee. When we asked  tongue in cheek  if it’s anything like the €25 000 a pop Renault paid the broadcaster in 2020  Kennedy said: “This is not a moneymaking event and we don’t have that kind of money.”READ MOREThe theme is Finding the Balance  and Tubridy might like to hang around for the discussion on conflict resolution  or the one about “finding the balance in your wardrobe following illnesses and change”.[ What next for Tubridy? Will Newstalk come calling or could he go back to the BBC? ]The former RTÉ presenter has done two other events since last summer’s pay row  but of a semipublic kind. He launched Dr Tony Holohan’s book  We Need To Talk  but it was an invite-only event for family and friends. He also popped up at Pension Awareness Week on Thursday  doing a panel discussion on preparing for retirement  and a 25-minute chat with Brian Mooney. Both were pre-recorded. So it’s a bit of a coup for Irish Country Living  and by October 25th  Tubs may even be ready to reveal what he’s planning to do next.Applegreen unplugs from ESB deal on fast chargersApplegreen says it is now replacing some ESB chargers with its own chargers. Photograph: Cyril ByrneA partnership between ESB and Applegreen to provide fast chargers for electrical vehicles on the garage’s forecourts has come to an end. ESB said that 50kw chargers in Castlebellingham  Co Louth  Enfield  Co Kildare  Lusk in Co Dublin  and Cullenmore in Wicklow have been removed  but alternatives are available elsewhere in those counties.In a somewhat more charged statement  the petrol-station operator told us it recently replaced seven ESB chargers along the M1  M4 and M11 with “new  more modern Applegreen electric high-powered chargers in order to improve the customer experience for EV drivers”.[ Ireland gets second high-speed EV charging hub ]Applegreen said its units can charge two vehicles at a time  “thereby doubling the available DC charging infrastructure at each location”  and boasts that its machines operate at speeds more than three times faster than the old kit – providing up to 180 kilowatts per hour charging speeds to vehicles that can handle that. The chargers are also more accessible  said Applegreen  as drivers can pay directly via debit card “and are not required to download an app to use the charging facilities”.The company currently has 34 fast-charging bays  and this is expected to increase to 52 by the end of the year. The ESB  meanwhile  said it is rolling out over 50 high-power hubs throughout Ireland  part of a €20 million investment. Can we call it a power struggle?O’Leary’s pop on share trading levy helpful to Irish stock exchangeMichael O’Leary of Ryanair has criticised the imposition of stamp duty on Irish share trades. Photograph: Nick BradshawHow gratifying for Dublin Euronext  as the Irish stock exchange is now known  to see Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary doing free PR on its behalf. In a pre-budget submission sent to Minister for Finance Michael McGrath last July  Euronext argued that the imposition of stamp duty on Irish share trades was having a negative impact on the ability of companies to raise funds through the exchange.The two largest Irish listed companies  representing 45 per cent of the market capitalisation  were going to seek US listings  where trading is exempt from stamp duty  Euronext added  in a reference to CRH and Flutter. Meanwhile  there are few new listings in Dublin  and “it is our strong opinion that the levying of stamp duty on trades in Irish shares... has been a contributory factor”.That argument was made more punchily by O’Leary in an interview with the Sunday Times. The levying of 1 per cent stamp duty here  when other exchanges charge half that  “pisses investors off”  he declared. Only for EU ownership rules stopping its listing moving to the US  Ryanair would be “gone like a shot”  he added.[ Want to start investing? Here are the taxes and charges ]The stamp duty is a money-spinner for the exchequer  however  raising €506 million in 2020. Euronext estimates up to €250 million of that arose from trading in CRH and Flutter. Since that revenue is disappearing  the finance minister may decide not to jettison the rest  even if it risks irking O’Leary even further.Ireland’s aviation high flyersWe know Ireland is a high flyer in aviation and our dominance of the skies is graphically illustrated in a new survey by Airline Economics  a leading publication for the sector. Every year it puts together a list of the top 40 executives under 40  based on nominations from senior people in the aviation community  and clients. This year  15 of the 40 are Irish.Naturally there are several from aviation companies  such as David Breen  head of corporate development and investor relations at Avolon  Cian Coakley of Orix Aviation  and Kate Holohan  head of trading at Carlyle Aviation. But there are also several from the financial side of the sector  such as Claire Waters  a tax director at KPMG Ireland  and Joe Conboy  partner at PwC Ireland. And there are legal experts  including Claire McDermott  a partner at Flynn O’Driscoll. The top 40 under 40 will meet up at a gala dinner at the Guildhall in London on Monday. We presume they’ll all fly in.Government advertises for new data commissionersData Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon. The DPC has finally advertised for two new commissioners to join her. Photograph Nick BradshawWell over a year after the Government approved the commencement of a process to appoint two additional commissioners to the Data Protection Commission  the job ads have finally been posted. It was in August 2022 that Helen McEntee  the justice minister  announced that Helen Dixon  the current commissioner  would become the chairwoman of the DPC  and that it would have three commissioners overall. The Cabinet decision followed criticism of the DPC’s ability to regulate the EU operations of the Big Tech operators based in Ireland.Since then  the DPC has shown its teeth  slapping a €345 million fine on TikTok and a €1.2 billion penalty on Meta Ireland. But while staff numbers at the regulator increased from 110 in 2018 to 196 at the end of last year  there has been no sign of the commissioner cavalry coming over the hill to help Dixon.Now the Department of Justice says a selection competition has been advertised by the Public Appointments Service in line with public service recruitment principles. “The terms and conditions of the appointments have been agreed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform ” a spokesman said.The Wicklow artist who is huge in AsiaGenieve Figgis is now the 508th best selling artist at auction in the world  according to Artprice.com.Who is Ireland’s most commercially successful artist? It could be Kevin Sharkey  who told The Times that “in the last 12 months I’ve earned about €4.5 million  up from €3 million the year before  and the trajectory is continuing to rise”.The title might also go to Genieve Figgis  a Wicklow-based artist. In 2012  she was earning €10 an hour working in a shop. Now she is the 508th best selling artist at auction in the world  according to Artprice.com. Her painting Debutants Ball was sold by Christie’s for four million Chinese yuan (€520 000) in March 2022.Figgis  whose application for art college in Dún Laoghaire was rejected when she was 19  is much less appreciated in Ireland than in Asia. In April 2013  her first solo exhibition was at the Talbot Gallery  above Grainger’s pub on Talbot Street in Dublin  where works went for as little as €300. Lemon Queen  from that show  is being sold by the original purchaser at Whyte’s Auctioneers on Monday  with a guide price of €25 000-€35 000. Peter Whyte says the exact figure the purchaser paid for Lemon Queen isn’t known “but it was under €1 000″.

30862,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.marketscreener.com/news/latest/A-good-way-to-end-a-tough-September--44953546/,A good way to end a tough September,(marketscreener.com) Although today is up to a good start  with reassuring inflation data  this last session of the month should not prevent September 2023 from being a poor vintage. Equity markets bounced back a little yesterday on the back of slightly buoya…,Although today is up to a good start  with reassuring inflation data  this last session of the month should not prevent September 2023 from being a poor vintage. Equity markets bounced back a little yesterday on the back of slightly buoyant news. They are now eagerly awaiting companies' Q3 results and forecasts.A few buy orders on cyclical stocks enabled the most battered indices  such as the Nasdaq 100 to regain ground. Meta  Broadcom and Alphabet managed to offset earnings disappointments  which saw Accenture and Micron fall by more than 4% at the close. Corporate results will rapidly become a major focus over the coming weeks  once the market digests the current issues  including a potential shutdown and extra rate hike. The first major third-quarter release will be PepsiCo on Tuesday October 10  followed by BlackRock  UnitedHealth and JPMorgan Chase on October 13. The first announcements from companies in the off-year are rather cautious on the outlook for consumption in 2024  although Nike shone yesterday with its outlook.The previous day's rebound was boosted by rumors of easing China US relations  even though everyone knows it’s just for show. The Wall Street Journal understands that the latest diplomatic efforts between the two powers could lead to a summit between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping. At the same time  data on US consumer sentiment was less robust than expected  and a member of the Fed was rather optimistic about inflation control. Always quick to see the bottle as half-full  equity investors deduced that the US central bank might be a little more flexible in its policy. I should add that Jerome Powell's speech yesterday offered no surprise: the Fed boss put aside monetary policy issues to focus on the subject of the meeting  education.Today  inflation data is in the spotlight and there was some good news coming from Europe  with Germany Spain  France and generally the eurozone recording lower-than-expected inflation in September.In the US  the personal consumption expenditures price index  the gauge favored by the Federal Reserve  climbed 0.4% in August  against estimates of a 0.5% rise. Excluding volatile food and energy components  the core PCE price index expanded by 0.1% in August  compared with estimates of 0.2%. It fell to a 3.9% year-over-year rate  in line with expectations.U.S. stock index futures rose after the data  which raised hopes that there would be no new Fed rate hike this year.However  this good Friday is probably not enough to save a September which  as usual  has been a trying month for the equity markets. On the S&P500  for example  September has been calamitous for the past four years: -4% in 2020  -4.8% in 2021  -9.3% in 2022 and -4.6% in 2023 on the morning of the last monthly session.A final word on Asia  where troubles for Chinese property developers continues. In the latest episode  the boss of China Evergrande has been arrested. Beijing applies this technique in two situations: when a boss becomes too powerful and too popular. This is the Jack Ma jurisprudence. Or when he bears the infamous mark of failure. This is what probably happened to Xu Jiayin (which is his Mandarin name  and also called Hui Ka Yan in Chinese  I found out this morning).Today's economic highlights:European September inflation  PCE inflation  trade balance  household income & spending and wholesaler inventories  as well as Chicago PMI and the second reading of the University of Michigan consumer confidence index are on the agenda.The dollar is down to EUR 0.9443 and GBP 0.8161.

This robust trend is supported by the strong growth in our Digital Marketing activities  which represented 58% of our first-half net sales. For reference  these activities generated 18% of the Group’s net sales in 2018.We are maintaining high levels of profitability  with EBITDA of €10.7m  representing 13.6% of the gross margin  and net income (Group share) of €5.0m  representing 6.4% of the gross margin. Down from the previous year  these results take into account a high level of investment  not only in our Magazine business  with its significant commercial investments continuing to progress despite a challenging general press environment  but also in our Digital Marketing business  with the structuring investments required - further strengthening our partners and support teams  particularly for Consulting - with a view to securing future growth. These developments were partially offset by the improvement in results for our Insurance business.As a data marketing specialist  we will continue to build on our growth while supporting brands with their marketing needs (consulting  agencies and solutions)  in addition to further strengthening our own portfolios generating recurrent revenues (press and insurance) by maintaining our commercial investments.The percentage of digital marketing within our activities will continue to ramp up with the development of our consulting activities  the continued growth in our engagement marketing and engineering activities  and the increasingly international profile of the solutions we offer.We are focusing our development on marketing innovation powered by data and technology. To support our ambitions  we have solid financial resources in place and we will continue to closely monitor opportunities for external growth  in France and across Europe  in complementary areas with strong potential  as we were able to do in September with our acquisition of Le Nouveau Bélier  an advertising strategy consulting agency and retail expert.Our 1 000 employees are fully committed to continue moving forward with our Group’s growth  supporting our clients and partners  with our Ambition 2025 to become the European leader for data marketing”.FIRST-HALF KEY DEVELOPMENTSDuring the first half of 2023  the DÉKUPLE Group achieved solid growth  driven by the continued expansion of its Digital Marketing activities  which represented 57.7% of consolidated net sales  compared with 50.8% one year ago. Their gross margin  up +35.9%  is benefiting from the data marketing market’s robust development and the growing appeal of the Group’s data marketing solutions that combine multiple areas of expertise to enable brands to improve their business performance.The portfolio-based activities have maintained a significant level of commercial investments with a view to supporting their portfolio of subscriptions generating recurrent revenues. In a challenging general environment for the press industry  the Magazine business  down -8.2%  was affected by the contraction in purchasing power for French consumers and the increase in acquisition costs. Alongside this  the Insurance business consolidated its growth in relation to a high basis for comparison in 2022  which benefited from the successful development of the supplementary health offering.HALF-YEAR EARNINGSConsolidated net sales2 came to €96.1m  up +7.9% compared with the first half of 2022  while the gross margin3 is up +9.6% to €78.9m.Against a backdrop of a high level of investments  restated EBITDA came to €10.7m  down-14.7% from the previous year  to represent 13.6% of the half-year gross margin.Operating income came to €7.1m  representing 9.0% of the half-year gross margin  compared with 13.4% for the first half of 2022. This change is linked primarily to i) the significant level of commercial investment maintained in the Magazine business  ii) the inclusion in results for the Digital Marketing offers of the structuring investments required to support their strong growth trend  and iii) the negative results recorded by the Spanish subsidiary. On the positive side  the subsidiary ADLP Assurances confirmed the improvement in its profitability.After factoring in the tax expense (€2.2m)  consolidated net income totaled €4.9m for the first half of 2023  down -28.7% from the first half of 2022.After deducting minority interests  net income (Group share) totaled €5.0m  representing 6.4% of the half-year gross margin.(€m) First half of 2023 First half of 2022 Change 2023/2022 Net sales 96.1 89.1 +7.9% Gross margin 78.9 72.0 +9.6% Restated EBITDA 10.7 12.6 -14.7% % of gross margin 13.6% 17.5% Income from ordinary operations 7.1 9.7 -26.7% % of gross margin 9.0% 13.4% EBIT 7.1 9.7 -26.7% % of gross margin 9.0% 13.4% Net financial expenses / income 0.1 (0.1) Tax expense (2.2) (2.4) Share of net income from associates (0.1) (0.3) ‏Consolidated net income 4.9 6.9 -28.7% % of gross margin 6.2% 9.6% Net income (Group share) 5.0 6.6 -23.9% % of gross margin 6.4% 9.1%FINANCIAL POSITION AT 30 JUNE 2023The Group’s shareholders’ equity at 30 June 2023 is up +€0.4m to €37.7m  compared with €37.3m at 31 December 2022  primarily taking into account half-year earnings (+€4.9m)  the ordinary dividend paid out in June this year (-€3.5m)  and the impact of treasury shares and bonus share awards (-€1.1m).The Group’s cash position at end-June 2023 represented €58.4m  compared with €58.5m at 31 December 2022 and €40.2m at 30 June 2022. Financial debt totaled €46.8m  compared with €50.9m at 31 December 2022  including commitments to buy out minority interests in the Group’s subsidiaries. It also includes €26.7m of bank borrowings set up before the crisis at favorable interest rates to support the Group’s development.EXTERNAL GROWTHOn 19 September  DÉKUPLE announced that it had acquired a majority stake in Le Nouveau Bélier  an advertising strategy consulting firm with Retail expertise (see press release concerning this operation).OUTLOOKDespite the uncertainty linked to the economic environment  the DÉKUPLE Group is continuing to roll out its Ambition 2025 strategy with a view to becoming a European leader for data marketing. With the financial resources in place  it is effectively positioned to continue with its commercial investments in its Magazine and Insurance activities to develop its portfolios of contracts generating recurrent revenues  while also supporting the development of its Digital Marketing solutions through organic and external growth.ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONThe corporate and consolidated financial statements for the first half of 2023 were approved by the Board of Directors on 29 September 2023.

This is unprecedented in the indication  and Batten-1 is thus a source of great hope for children affected by the disease and for their families"".Professor Clark will be presenting the 12-month interim efficacy and safety results at the ""Translational Research Clinical"" session on Friday 29 September at 12.25pm (CEST).The 12-month treatment results further support the 6-month results announced in mid-June 2023. The new results  achieved after 12 months of treatment  show an average 32% decline in neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in patient serum (as a reminder  17% after 6 months' treatment). Neurofilaments are a recognized biomarker of neurodegeneration[1]. A 64% reduction in this biomarker is also observed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). After twelve months of treatment  in line with preclinical data the results also confirmed a reduction in the glycosphingolipids involved in the disease (Gb3 reduction of 45%) which  when they accumulate  are toxic to neurons. Clinically  there was notably less worsening of motor symptoms evaluated by the modified UBDRS physical assessment subscale after 12 months than what is expected in this naturally progressive disease.For Theranexus' CEO  Mathieu Charvériat: ""We are delighted with these 12-month results which confirm and complement our initial 6-month results. The decrease of biomarker levels confirms the effect of Batten-1 on neuronal death  and the clinical course did not worsen. These consistent results represent a significant endorsement of the mechanism of action and demonstrate the strong therapeutic potential of Batten-1 in Batten disease (CLN3)"".As a reminder  the Phase I/II trial conducted by Theranexus and BBDF to evaluate their drug candidate  Batten-1  includes six patients with Batten disease (CLN3) aged 17 years and over. The patients are being treated over a 24-month period.The presentation of the 12-month efficacy and safety results will be available online on 29 September after market closing.For further information about NCL2023: https://ncl2023.de/Upcoming publications:Detailed slides describing the 12-month results available on the company website (https://www.theranexus.com/fr/actionnaires/documents.html): 29 September 2023 after market closing.17 October 2023: Cash position as of 30 September 2023Plus d'informations sur https://www.theranexus.comCliquez et suivez-nous sur Twitter et LinkedlnContactsTHERANEXUSThierry LAMBERTDirecteur administratif et financiercontact@theranexus.comFP2COMFlorence PORTEJOIERelations médias+ 33 (0)6 07 76 82 83fportejoie@fp2com.frAbout Batten-1Batten-1 is a novel and exclusive proprietary drug containing the active ingredient miglustat. The mechanism of action of this substance blocks the accumulation of glycosphingolipids and neuroinflammation  thus significantly reducing neuronal death that contributes to a progressive loss of function in patients. For patients over 17 years of age in the Phase I/II trial  the product is administered in solid form. In the Phase III trial  it will be administered in a liquid form better suited to pediatric patients.Phase I/II trial design: this is an open-label trial involving 6 patients over 17 years of age with CLN3 Batten disease  treated with miglustat up to 600 mg/day for a 2-year period. The primary endpoint is patient safety and tolerability  assessed using reports of adverse effects  biological tests and ECG  as well as the pharmacokinetics of miglustat. The secondary endpoints include biomarkers (NfL  glycosphingolipds)  efficacy monitoring: Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale  visual acuity  measurement of brain volumes by MRI and measurement of the thickness of the neuronal layer of the retina by optical coherence tomography scans. Administration of Batten-1 in escalating doses with a maximum of 600 mg/day was well tolerated  with no severe side effects observed causing treatment discontinuation. The most commonly reported adverse events are reversible gastrointestinal effects of often light to moderate severity  thus demonstrating the good tolerability profile of Batten-1 in this population. Batten-1 will continue to be assessed in these patients treated over a 24-month period. Further information about the trial is available on https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT05174039.About Batten diseaseJuvenile Batten disease  also known as Spielmeyer-Vogt or CLN3 disease  is a rare  fatal  inherited disorder of the nervous system for which there is no treatment or cure. Juvenile Batten disease belongs to a group of disorders referred to as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). Over 400 different errors in 13 genes have been attributed to various forms of NCL  which differ from one another primarily by when symptoms first appear. The first symptom in the juvenile form  progressive vision loss  appears between the ages of 4 and 6 and is followed by cognitive disorders  behavioral disorders  and motor disorders. Seizures commonly appear within 2-4 years of the onset of disease. Over time  patients continue to decline mentally and physically. Eventually  those affected become wheelchair-bound  are bedridden  and die prematurely.Juvenile Batten disease is always fatal; usually by the late teens to early 20s. In the United States and Europe  the juvenile form is the most common of the NCLs  which together  affect nearly 2 000 patients[2]. In pathophysiological terms  interactions between neurons and glial cells play key roles in the emergence and progression of all the NCLs.About Beyond Batten Disease FoundationBeyond Batten Disease Foundation (BBDF) is the world's largest nonprofit organization dedicated to funding research for a treatment and cure for juvenile (CLN3) Batten disease. Since its inception in 2008  over $35 million has been invested in research by leveraging donations  co-funding and strategic partnerships. BBDF is spearheading a unique  cohesive strategy  incorporating independent scientific resources and collaboration with related organizations to drive research in juvenile Batten Disease[3]. Today there is a treatment in sight. BBDF funded research has discovered a drug – Batten-1 – that slows the progression of the disease in Batten models.

For reference  these activities generated 18% of the Group’s net sales in 2018.We are maintaining high levels of profitability  with EBITDA of €10.7m  representing 13.6% of the gross margin  and net income (Group share) of €5.0m  representing 6.4% of the gross margin. Down from the previous year  these results take into account a high level of investment  not only in our Magazine business  with its significant commercial investments continuing to progress despite a challenging general press environment  but also in our Digital Marketing business  with the structuring investments required - further strengthening our partners and support teams  particularly for Consulting - with a view to securing future growth. These developments were partially offset by the improvement in results for our Insurance business.As a data marketing specialist  we will continue to build on our growth while supporting brands with their marketing needs (consulting  agencies and solutions)  in addition to further strengthening our own portfolios generating recurrent revenues (press and insurance) by maintaining our commercial investments.The percentage of digital marketing within our activities will continue to ramp up with the development of our consulting activities  the continued growth in our engagement marketing and engineering activities  and the increasingly international profile of the solutions we offer.We are focusing our development on marketing innovation powered by data and technology. To support our ambitions  we have solid financial resources in place and we will continue to closely monitor opportunities for external growth  in France and across Europe  in complementary areas with strong potential  as we were able to do in September with our acquisition of Le Nouveau Bélier  an advertising strategy consulting agency and retail expert.Our 1 000 employees are fully committed to continue moving forward with our Group’s growth  supporting our clients and partners  with our Ambition 2025 to become the European leader for data marketing”.FIRST-HALF KEY DEVELOPMENTSDuring the first half of 2023  the DÉKUPLE Group achieved solid growth  driven by the continued expansion of its Digital Marketing activities  which represented 57.7% of consolidated net sales  compared with 50.8% one year ago. Their gross margin  up +35.9%  is benefiting from the data marketing market’s robust development and the growing appeal of the Group’s data marketing solutions that combine multiple areas of expertise to enable brands to improve their business performance.The portfolio-based activities have maintained a significant level of commercial investments with a view to supporting their portfolio of subscriptions generating recurrent revenues. In a challenging general environment for the press industry  the Magazine business  down -8.2%  was affected by the contraction in purchasing power for French consumers and the increase in acquisition costs. Alongside this  the Insurance business consolidated its growth in relation to a high basis for comparison in 2022  which benefited from the successful development of the supplementary health offering.HALF-YEAR EARNINGSConsolidated net sales2 came to €96.1m  up +7.9% compared with the first half of 2022  while the gross margin3 is up +9.6% to €78.9m.Against a backdrop of a high level of investments  restated EBITDA came to €10.7m  down-14.7% from the previous year  to represent 13.6% of the half-year gross margin.Operating income came to €7.1m  representing 9.0% of the half-year gross margin  compared with 13.4% for the first half of 2022. This change is linked primarily to i) the significant level of commercial investment maintained in the Magazine business  ii) the inclusion in results for the Digital Marketing offers of the structuring investments required to support their strong growth trend  and iii) the negative results recorded by the Spanish subsidiary. On the positive side  the subsidiary ADLP Assurances confirmed the improvement in its profitability.After factoring in the tax expense (€2.2m)  consolidated net income totaled €4.9m for the first half of 2023  down -28.7% from the first half of 2022.After deducting minority interests  net income (Group share) totaled €5.0m  representing 6.4% of the half-year gross margin.(€m) First half of 2023 First half of 2022 Change 2023/2022 Net sales 96.1 89.1 +7.9% Gross margin 78.9 72.0 +9.6% Restated EBITDA 10.7 12.6 -14.7% % of gross margin 13.6% 17.5% Income from ordinary operations 7.1 9.7 -26.7% % of gross margin 9.0% 13.4% EBIT 7.1 9.7 -26.7% % of gross margin 9.0% 13.4% Net financial expenses / income 0.1 (0.1) Tax expense (2.2) (2.4) Share of net income from associates (0.1) (0.3) ‏Consolidated net income 4.9 6.9 -28.7% % of gross margin 6.2% 9.6% Net income (Group share) 5.0 6.6 -23.9% % of gross margin 6.4% 9.1%FINANCIAL POSITION AT 30 JUNE 2023The Group’s shareholders’ equity at 30 June 2023 is up +€0.4m to €37.7m  compared with €37.3m at 31 December 2022  primarily taking into account half-year earnings (+€4.9m)  the ordinary dividend paid out in June this year (-€3.5m)  and the impact of treasury shares and bonus share awards (-€1.1m).The Group’s cash position at end-June 2023 represented €58.4m  compared with €58.5m at 31 December 2022 and €40.2m at 30 June 2022. Financial debt totaled €46.8m  compared with €50.9m at 31 December 2022  including commitments to buy out minority interests in the Group’s subsidiaries. It also includes €26.7m of bank borrowings set up before the crisis at favorable interest rates to support the Group’s development.EXTERNAL GROWTHOn 19 September  DÉKUPLE announced that it had acquired a majority stake in Le Nouveau Bélier  an advertising strategy consulting firm with Retail expertise (see press release concerning this operation).OUTLOOKDespite the uncertainty linked to the economic environment  the DÉKUPLE Group is continuing to roll out its Ambition 2025 strategy with a view to becoming a European leader for data marketing.

For acquisition and management commissions linked to sales of insurance policies  net sales comprise current and future commissions issued  acquired by the accounting reporting date  net of cancellations.Following various financial elements reported by the subsidiaries  2023 first-half net sales were adjusted by +€0.3m compared with the half-year net sales figure announced on 28 August 2023.3 For the digital marketing business  the gross margin represents the total amount of net sales (total invoices issued: fees  commissions and purchases charged back to customers) less the total amount of costs for external purchases made on behalf of customers.

These included amendments to the Articles …,The Hague  September 29  2023 - Aegon’s Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders (EGM) today approved the first step in the company’s redomiciliation to Bermuda and adopted all other agenda items. These included amendments to the Articles of Association of Aegon N.V. to reflect the conversion into a Luxembourg S.A.; as well as the appointment of the members of the Board of Directors of Aegon S.A. and of the Board of Aegon Ltd.Following the closure of the transaction with a.s.r.  Aegon no longer has a regulated insurance entity in the Netherlands. Under Solvency II rules  Aegon’s current supervisor  the Dutch central bank  can therefore no longer remain Aegon’s group supervisor. Following discussions in the college of supervisors  the Bermuda Monetary Authority informed Aegon that it would become its group supervisor if the company were to move its legal domicile to Bermuda.As Dutch law currently does not facilitate a direct transfer of a legal domicile to a country outside of the European Economic Area  Aegon will first change its legal domicile to Luxembourg which does allow for such relocations.Aegon will now proceed with a second EGM for the shareholders’ resolution on the second step of the redomiciliation. This EGM will be held in Luxembourg tomorrow. Following the adoption of this resolution and the completion of the EGM in Luxembourg  the redomiciliation to Bermuda will be implemented on 30 September 2023.An audio live stream of tomorrow’s EGM  which begins at 09:30 CEST  will be available at Aegon's corporate website.ContactsMedia relations Investor relations Richard Mackillican Hielke Hielkema +31(0) 62 741 1546 +31(0) 70 344 7697 richard.mackillican@aegon.com hielke.hielkema@aegon.comAbout AegonAegon is an international financial services holding company.

Andrea Farina  today approved the Half-Year Financial Report at 30 June 2023.The main consolidated economic results achieved by the Itway Group in the first half of the 2023 financial year are shown below  compared with those of the same period to 30 June 2022.in thousands of Euro 30/06/2023(6 months) 30/06/2022(6 months) Revenues 21.495 18.326 Gross operating profit (EBITDA) 743 828 Operating profit (EBIT) 415 526 Pre-tax result 769 (88) Net result 485 (301)In the half-year ended June 30  2023  revenues increased by 17%  while operating results fell slightly: EBITDA went from Euro 828 thousand in the first half of 2022 to Euro 743 thousand in the first half of 2023  while Operating profit (EBIT) went from Euro 526 thousand to Euro 415 thousand. On the other hand  the net result for the first half improved sharply  going from Euro -301 thousand to Euro 485 thousand  thanks above all to the exchange gains made by the Turkish subsidiary.Operating results are affected by the increase in costs  which is mainly linked to the significant investments in progress  and  in particular  is linked to the growth in personnel costs of 33% (+522 thousand euros) and employees. The number of employees increased from 67 units (30 June 2022) to 80 units (30 June 2023) and relates to the inclusion of qualified personnel in the Group  with an increase of 13 units among executives (4)  senior account managers  junior account managers  project managers  developers  service desks  cybersecurity consultants  systems engineers and back offices  as envisaged in the company's investment plans.The insertion and training of new resources in such an important way has inevitably led to a phase of lower internal efficiency in the ability to deliver revenues  even if growing  due precisely to the absorption of senior resources in training and in the transfer of know-how to new entries.This phase of lower efficiency and production capacity is expected to improve as early as the second half of 2023.General context of the economy and development of the ICT marketThe latest projections of the trend of the ICT market 2023 take into account the prolongation of the extremely complex international scenario linked and determined by the continuation of the war in Ukraine  the shortage of raw materials  the still very high energy costs  the beating inflation  projections that Anitec-Assinform published in June 2023.The trend of the digital market expected for the two-year period 2023-2024 will be influenced by several factors:• the real use of PNRR resources allocated to the country's digitization projects and their real feasibility in complex territorial and operational contexts;• the persistence  as described above  of an uncertain economic situation both at national and international level;• an increase in external and internal costs to the ICT sector which makes the digital transition more expensive.Following the growth of 13.4% in 2022  the most innovative components of digital innovation  the so-called digital innovation  are expected to continue to grow at double-digit rates  more precisely 13%. ""Digital Enabler and Transformer""  starting from Cloud  Cybersecurity  IoT  AI and collaborative and remote work platforms (including smartworking).Italian GDP is expected to grow both in 2023 (+1.2%) and in 2024 (+1.1%)  albeit slowing down compared to 2022.In line with the trend in economic activity  consumption by resident households and Private Social Institutions (ISPs) is expected to increase in 2023 (+0.5%)  which will strengthen the following year (+1.1%)  thanks to a further reduction in inflation associated with a gradual recovery in wages and an improvement in the labour market.Investments will maintain high growth rates  compared to the other components: 3% in 2023 and 2% in 2024  decelerating compared to the previous two years.In this forecast  employment will grow in line with GDP (+1.2% in 2023 and +1% in 2024). The improvement in employment will be accompanied by a fall in the unemployment rate to 7.9% this year and 7.7% the following year.The path of inflation recovery  favoured by the fall in energy prices and the restrictive policies implemented by central banks (ECB and FED)  will be reflected in a reduction in inflation dynamics both in the current year (+5.7%) and  to a greater extent  in 2024 (+2.6%).On the basis of consolidated and forecast data  the ECB has implemented a series of powerful interest rate increases since July 2022  when it was at a negative rate  up to today's 4.75%; There is a strong conviction on the part of the president and a majority of advisers that a tight monetary policy can squeeze inflation down to the 2% target. This also at the cost of triggering any recessionary processes.

The strengthening of the technical and commercial structure  as commented above  we expect to bring an acceleration in growth.BU Cyber security & InfrastructureTo achieve the objectives of the business plan  Itway will focus on the growth of the Cyber Security & Resiliency Business Unit  in particular by pushing the new product line ""Itway Cyber Security & Resiliency 360 ™""  offering the market further expanded NOC/SOC services and managed security services (MSP) h24x365gg. which today represent a true excellence.Important agreements for the resale of advanced products and services have also been defined; in particular  it is worth mentioning the important exclusive agreement signed with the MasterCard company  which has developed innovative Cyber Risk Assessment services (RiskRecon) and exclusively also with the company Zerofox (social engineering products and brand/web reputation). The strategic partnership agreement signed with Cloudian  a Silicon Valley company specializing in the creation of enterprise-class object storage software  is also of considerable importance. Our offering is fully part of the ""new wave"" of Cyber Resilience with a vertical and horizontal integration of ""state of the art"" products and specific services. Also in Cyber Resiliency we have the new agreement with the company Quest Software that provides cloud management services  software as-a-service  security  mobility and backup / recovery.The theme of Cyber security and infrastructures therefore remains the central pivot of the Itway Group's range of services  with the aim of increasingly strengthening our market shares through the expansion of the customer base and the creation of new partnerships with technology vendors that represent the state of the art in the field of Cyber Security & Cyber Resiliency and infrastructures.BU Cyber safetyThe Cyber Safety Business Unit  based on the ICOY MOVER product  deserves a special mention. During the first half of the year  the first orders were fulfilled and important signs of interest from customers were found  and this bodes well for the realization of further orders.With the specialized sales team on ICOY  which also includes a senior professional in the role of Key Account Manager (KAM)  a conspicuous pipeline of offers and opportunities has developed  and therefore we will continue with the Direct Marketing activity aimed at companies in the engineering and steel sector to further increase the portfolio of negotiations and realize orders before the end of the fiscal year. We have developed the brand of the Business Unit  activating all the communication tools such as registered logo and trademark  specific website www.icoy.it  as well as signed the first alliances with specific associations in the security sector  such as RSPP Italia and AIAS  with whom we have started to plan a communication and evangelization activity to the market; contacts are also underway with other sector associations.The interest in ICOY MOVER is really great and the terrible sequence of accidents at work (even these days) further testifies how many lives could be saved with the adoption of the ICOY MOVER product. As of this report  more than 130 large steel and metallurgy companies contacted have shown concrete interest and 31 of these have requested and received an offer from ICOY MOVER.4 Science S.p.A.  BU Data ScienceThe second half of 2023 opens with an important order book and with interesting growth prospects linked above all to the international market and in particular to the US one  hoping however that  as regards the national market  there will be the hoped-for positive effect linked to the investments envisaged in the PNRR and in particular in the so-called PND (National Digitization Plan).In addition  the growth in orders received during the first half of 2023  well above that of last year  positions us well for the second half of 2023.In terms of revenues and margins  the positive effects linked to the new organizational structure should also be seen  in particular with regard to the efficiency of operations made necessary as a result of the substantial investments made in the company's personnel starting from last year and continued during the first half of 2023.The company is today  worldwide  one of the main service providers of the DSpace platform with a leading role within the American steering committee that defines its developments and future evolutions; This leading role  together with the increased production capacity of our software factory  will allow us to grow both on the international and national markets.Even the direct presence in the US market  which has already given the first positive results  will have to represent a growth factor generating a significant amount of negotiations to be transformed into sales  in a market that can certainly offer great opportunities.BU Cyber security Products VAD + PS: Itway Turkiye Ltd. e Itway Hellas S.A.There are no significant factors that could in any way slow down steady growth in the remainder of 2023. A close eye on the currency situation in Turkey and a vigilant management of operating costs will be maintained.The expectation is that value-added distribution activities with design services will continue in an important way in their growth  maintaining a constant focus on margin protection  which are increasing  and working capital management.The reference market in the two countries in which we operate is in a phase of significant development and the prospect is to grow organically thanks to the growth rates expected by the vendors we represent  the increase in our market share and the introduction of new product lines  such as Mastercard  as well as other lines for the storage and cloud back-up market.The objective remains to maintain good growth rates  both in terms of revenues and profitability  in line with the Business Plan  and to confirm the strategic leadership positioning in Cyber security of Greece and Turkey.The risks related to the well-known conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the possible effects that this emergency could have on the global economy  in relation to the Group and the reference businesses  in the process of drawing up the financial statements  were assessed by the Management in order to verify whether there could be potential impacts in relation to the performance of the business itself. The Group does not currently maintain direct relations with Russia and Ukraine and their markets; there are no financial flows that directly involve the Group's operations that are expressed or regulated by Russian and Ukrainian foreign currencies. The Group also assessed the impacts linked to the potential increase in energy costs.Management will continue to monitor all scenarios and any impacts related to such events.Related Party RelationshipsDuring the first half of 2023  the Group maintained commercial and financial relationships with related companies.

Currency fluctuations had a favorable effect of +4.2% on the group’s growth this year  with a significant appreciation of the US dollar and more notably the Russian ruble.Current operating profitability increased by +24.8% on a reported basis and +26.9% on a like for like basis(1)  with the current operating margin of 2.7%  higher than the communicated guidance.Key figuresConsolidatedAccounts(In € million) 2022-2023 2021-2022 Variations Revenue 2 406.2 2 202.6 +9.2% Current operating income 65.9 52.8 +24.8% Net result 14.5 35.4 -59.1%Message from Xavier Unkovic - Chief Executive Officer:“In an environment of a widespread inflation and where strong geopolitical tensions remain in certain regions where the group operates  the diversity of our activities (long-life  fresh and processed)  our production and sales regions  distribution channels (retail  food service) and our products either branded or private label enabled the Bonduelle Group to post a growth in both revenue and current operating income.Financial year 2023-2024 starts in a climate of significant deconsumption  fuelled by still important inflation. More than ever  our ability to innovate and offer product differentiation through strong and accessible brands will be key elements in the necessary recovery of the group’s profitability. “Activity by Geographic RegionTotal consolidated revenue(In € million) 2022-2023 2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis(1) Europe Zone 1 508.1 1 357.3 11.1% 11.6% Non-Europe Zone 898.1 845.3 6.3% -5.8% Total 2 406.2 2 202.6 9.2% 5.0%Activity by Operating SegmentsTotal consolidated revenue(In € million) 2022-2023 2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis(1) Canned 1 126.3 958.4 17.5% 13.0% Frozen 278.8 238.4 17.0% 165% Freshprocessed 1 001.1 1 005.9 -0.5% -5.4% Total 2 406.2 2 202.6 9.2% 5.0%Europe ZoneThe Europe Zone  representing 62.7% of the business activity in FY 2022-2023  recorded a very strong revenue growth of +11.1% on reported figures and +11.6% on like for like basis(1).All technologies reported growth in value over the year  despite Quarter 4 marked by a downturn in retail.For the long life segment  canned-brand activities posted a drop in volume  but maintained their market share in declining markets  while the group private labels activities experienced a more limited decline  enabling them to meet the expectations of the various market segments. Driven by the year’s innovations  the frozen activity posted a growth in volume. Price increases  made necessary by the rise in various cost items  supported growth in value. The food service activity  mainly frozen  confirmed its dynamism over the whole year  with a growth in volume  reinforced in value by price increases.More sensitive to the consumer environment  the fresh processed segment in retail also contributed to overall growth in value  with sales sustained by a good performance in fresh prepared activity  with growth in volume thanks to the success of innovations and favorable weather conditions  on the other hand  the fresh cut salads showed a sharper decline.Non-Europe ZoneThe revenue of the Non-Europe Zone  representing 37.3% of the business activity over FY  recorded a growth of +6.3% on reported figures and -5.8% on a like for like basis(1).In North America  the downturn in the fresh processed segment remained marked in retail  due to an unfavorable market trend returning to pre-Covid levels  an agronomic crisis linked to a plant disease that affected the entire sector  and the residual impact of the previous year's loss of references; the price rises made necessary by cost increases did not offset the volume declines recorded. As in the Europe Zone  the dynamic remains encouraging in the food service activity  with growing markets and the conquest of new customers.The reorganization of our sales teams  the overhaul of our commercial policy  the outcome of recent negotiations  the relaunch of our innovation policy and the stabilization of markets should enable us to achieve a recovery in sales volumes in the future.In the Eurasia zone  the canned activity  which is predominant in this area and impacted by the geopolitical context  posted an overall decline in volume  with the Globus brand preserving the brand’s significant market share in this region. The frozen activity  which is more marginal  posted for its part a significant decline. For safety reasons  the Russian frozen plant in Belgorod has been shut down for the 2023 harvest  with the processing activity being outsourced during this period.The export activity of the group also suffered the consequences of the inflationary and geopolitical environment  with heightened competition in certain regions with limited purchasing power and major delivery constraints  while continuing to expand with the introduction of Bonduelle's range of frozen products in Israel.Operating profitability(In € million) 2022-2023 2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis(1) Revenue 2 406.2 2 202.6 +9.2% +5 0% Current operating profitability 65.9 52.8 +24.8% +26 9% Current operating margin rate 2.7% 2.4% 34 bps 59 bpsFor fiscal year 2022-2023  the Bonduelle Group’s current operating profitability stands at € 65.9 million at constant exchange rates compared to € 52.8 million for the previous fiscal year  i.e.  a current operating margin of 2.7% on reported figures.The Europe Zone posted a like for like(1) current operating margin of 4.7% with price increases making it possible to absorb the considerable increases in production costs.The Non-Europe Zone saw its profitability recover over the fiscal year. The Eurasia region benefited from favorable exchange rates for the competitiveness of the products sold  with the fresh processed segment in North America seeing its negative profitability narrow under the effect of the competitiveness initiatives put in place and set to strengthen in 2023-2024.After taking into account non-recurring items of € -11.7 million for the fiscal year  mainly related to the industrial reorganization costs for the fresh processed segment in North America  Bonduelle Group’s operating income stood at € 54.1 million as reported compared to a loss of € -65.2 million for the previous fiscal year  where impairment of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets was recorded as a non-recurring item.Net ResultFinancial result amounted to € -31.3 million  compared to € -14.5 million at the end of the previous fiscal year. This rise is mainly due to the higher cost of debt as a result of the increase in interest rates in the currencies in which the Bonduelle Group finances its activity along with the nature of the instruments used  with the average financing rate rising from 1.61% to 4.01% and  lastly  an increase in working capital requirement on a like for like basis due to the impact of inflation on inventories.Foreign exchange hedging transactions generated a loss of € -4.6 million  mainly due to changes in the Russian ruble  which is now ineligible for foreign exchange hedges and which is offset by the competitiveness gains mentioned above. Net income from associates was € 4.4 million corresponding to the share of income from Nortera Foods holding  now accounted for under the equity method  less impairments recorded on non-controlling interests in start-ups intended to reflect their market value.The income tax expense amounted to € 18.5 million  compared to € 40.0 million the previous year  the effective tax rate (80.9%) being distorted by the non-capitalization of losses on fresh processed activities in North America.After taking into account income from associates  financial result  tax expense and an earn-out of € 5.7 million related to the disposal of the long-life activity in North America the previous fiscal year  Bonduelle Group’s net income for fiscal year 2022-2023 came to € 14.5 million  compared with € 35.4 million for the previous fiscal year  or 0.6% of revenue.Financial situationJune 30  2021Reported figures June 30  2021Excl.

The leverage ratio (net debt/REBITDA) amounted to 2.84 compared to 2.28 the previous fiscal year.Other significant informationAdaptation of the American industrial set upIn February 2023  the Bonduelle Group announced the adaptation of the industrial structure of its activity on the East Coast of the United States in order to improve its competitiveness in the fresh processed market in the United States and to refocus its activity on its valued segment. Thus  the manufacturing activities in Florence (New Jersey) are currently being transferred to the Swedesboro site (New Jersey). This operation aims at optimizing the production of all products for customers nationally  while achieving gains in efficiency and coverage of fixed costs.At the closing date  the project was underway  with completion scheduled for the first half of the fiscal year 2023-2024.The net impact of this reorganization has been recorded in the fiscal year 2022-2023 under non-recurring items (€ 10.1 million).Amendment of the green syndicated loan of € 400 millionOn February 6  2023  the Bonduelle Group signed an amendment to its € 400 million syndicated revolving credit facility (RCF) with its banking partners  thereby securing an essential source of financing  which is particularly well suited to the seasonal nature of the group's financing needs  and on very competitive terms  despite the current unstable economic environment. This arrangement provides for a two-year extension  bringing the maturity from 2026 to 2028  with two one-year extension options  bringing the final maturity of the loan to February 2030.The financial terms of this credit line include Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) indicators in line with the group's mission and purpose  both in terms of B Corp certification and in terms of reducing its carbon footprint and contributing  with its agricultural partners  to a regenerative agriculture.This operation demonstrates once again the confidence shown by the banking partners in supporting the Bonduelle Group's development over the long term.First B CorpTM certifications awardedIn 2018  the Bonduelle Group announced its ambition to become a certified B Corp company by 2025. This ambition involves each of its entities obtaining their certification one by one. FY 2022-2023 marks a major milestone with the certification of Bonduelle in Italy and Bonduelle Fresh Americas in the United States  together accounting for a third of group revenue. The two Bonduelle Group entities are the first to meet B Lab's demanding social and environmental impact standards.

Currency fluctuations had a favorable effect of +4.2% on the group’s growth this year  with a significant appreciation of the US dollar and more notably the Russian ruble.Current operating profitability increased by +24.8% on a reported basis and +26.9% on a like for like basis(1)  with the current operating margin of 2.7%  higher than the communicated guidance.Key figuresConsolidated Accounts(In € million) 2022-2023 2021-2022 Variations Revenue 2 406.2 2 202.6 +9.2% Current operating income 65.9 52.8 +24.8% Net result 14.5 35.4 -59.1%Message from Xavier Unkovic - Chief Executive Officer:“In an environment of a widespread inflation and where strong geopolitical tensions remain in certain regions where the group operates  the diversity of our activities (long-life  fresh and processed)  our production and sales regions  distribution channels (retail  food service) and our products either branded or private label enabled the Bonduelle Group to post a growth in both revenue and current operating income.Financial year 2023-2024 starts in a climate of significant deconsumption  fuelled by still important inflation. More than ever  our ability to innovate and offer product differentiation through strong and accessible brands will be key elements in the necessary recovery of the group’s profitability. “Activity by Geographic RegionTotal consolidated revenue(In € million) 2022-2023 2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis(1) Europe Zone 1 508.1 1 357.3 11.1% 11.6% Non-Europe Zone 898.1 845.3 6.3% -5.8% Total 2 406.2 2 202.6 9.2% 5.0%Activity by Operating SegmentsTotal consolidated revenue(In € million) 2022-2023 2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis(1) Canned 1 126.3 958.4 17.5% 13.0% Frozen 278.8 238.4 17.0% 165% Fresh processed 1 001.1 1 005.9 -0.5% -5.4% Total 2 406.2 2 202.6 9.2% 5.0%Europe ZoneThe Europe Zone  representing 62.7% of the business activity in FY 2022-2023  recorded a very strong revenue growth of +11.1% on reported figures and +11.6% on like for like basis(1).All technologies reported growth in value over the year  despite Quarter 4 marked by a downturn in retail.For the long life segment  canned-brand activities posted a drop in volume  but maintained their market share in declining markets  while the group private labels activities experienced a more limited decline  enabling them to meet the expectations of the various market segments. Driven by the year’s innovations  the frozen activity posted a growth in volume. Price increases  made necessary by the rise in various cost items  supported growth in value. The food service activity  mainly frozen  confirmed its dynamism over the whole year  with a growth in volume  reinforced in value by price increases.More sensitive to the consumer environment  the fresh processed segment in retail also contributed to overall growth in value  with sales sustained by a good performance in fresh prepared activity  with growth in volume thanks to the success of innovations and favorable weather conditions  on the other hand  the fresh cut salads showed a sharper decline.Non-Europe ZoneThe revenue of the Non-Europe Zone  representing 37.3% of the business activity over FY  recorded a growth of +6.3% on reported figures and -5.8% on a like for like basis(1).In North America  the downturn in the fresh processed segment remained marked in retail  due to an unfavorable market trend returning to pre-Covid levels  an agronomic crisis linked to a plant disease that affected the entire sector  and the residual impact of the previous year's loss of references; the price rises made necessary by cost increases did not offset the volume declines recorded. As in the Europe Zone  the dynamic remains encouraging in the food service activity  with growing markets and the conquest of new customers.The reorganization of our sales teams  the overhaul of our commercial policy  the outcome of recent negotiations  the relaunch of our innovation policy and the stabilization of markets should enable us to achieve a recovery in sales volumes in the future.In the Eurasia zone  the canned activity  which is predominant in this area and impacted by the geopolitical context  posted an overall decline in volume  with the Globus brand preserving the brand’s significant market share in this region. The frozen activity  which is more marginal  posted for its part a significant decline. For safety reasons  the Russian frozen plant in Belgorod has been shut down for the 2023 harvest  with the processing activity being outsourced during this period.The export activity of the group also suffered the consequences of the inflationary and geopolitical environment  with heightened competition in certain regions with limited purchasing power and major delivery constraints  while continuing to expand with the introduction of Bonduelle's range of frozen products in Israel.Operating profitability(In € million) 2022-2023 2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis(1) Revenue 2 406.2 2 202.6 +9.2% +5 0% Current operating profitability 65.9 52.8 +24.8% +26 9% Current operating margin rate 2.7% 2.4% 34 bps 59 bpsFor fiscal year 2022-2023  the Bonduelle Group’s current operating profitability stands at € 65.9 million at constant exchange rates compared to € 52.8 million for the previous fiscal year  i.e.  a current operating margin of 2.7% on reported figures.The Europe Zone posted a like for like(1) current operating margin of 4.7% with price increases making it possible to absorb the considerable increases in production costs.The Non-Europe Zone saw its profitability recover over the fiscal year. The Eurasia region benefited from favorable exchange rates for the competitiveness of the products sold  with the fresh processed segment in North America seeing its negative profitability narrow under the effect of the competitiveness initiatives put in place and set to strengthen in 2023-2024.After taking into account non-recurring items of € -11.7 million for the fiscal year  mainly related to the industrial reorganization costs for the fresh processed segment in North America  Bonduelle Group’s operating income stood at € 54.1 million as reported compared to a loss of € -65.2 million for the previous fiscal year  where impairment of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets was recorded as a non-recurring item.Net ResultFinancial result amounted to € -31.3 million  compared to € -14.5 million at the end of the previous fiscal year. This rise is mainly due to the higher cost of debt as a result of the increase in interest rates in the currencies in which the Bonduelle Group finances its activity along with the nature of the instruments used  with the average financing rate rising from 1.61% to 4.01% and  lastly  an increase in working capital requirement on a like for like basis due to the impact of inflation on inventories.Foreign exchange hedging transactions generated a loss of € -4.6 million  mainly due to changes in the Russian ruble  which is now ineligible for foreign exchange hedges and which is offset by the competitiveness gains mentioned above. Net income from associates was € 4.4 million corresponding to the share of income from Nortera Foods holding  now accounted for under the equity method  less impairments recorded on non-controlling interests in start-ups intended to reflect their market value.The income tax expense amounted to € 18.5 million  compared to € 40.0 million the previous year  the effective tax rate (80.9%) being distorted by the non-capitalization of losses on fresh processed activities in North America.After taking into account income from associates  financial result  tax expense and an earn-out of € 5.7 million related to the disposal of the long-life activity in North America the previous fiscal year  Bonduelle Group’s net income for fiscal year 2022-2023 came to € 14.5 million  compared with € 35.4 million for the previous fiscal year  or 0.6% of revenue.Financial situationJune 30  2021Reported figures June 30  2021Excl.

The leverage ratio (net debt/REBITDA) amounted to 2.84 compared to 2.28 the previous fiscal year.Other significant informationAdaptation of the American industrial set upIn February 2023  the Bonduelle Group announced the adaptation of the industrial structure of its activity on the East Coast of the United States in order to improve its competitiveness in the fresh processed market in the United States and to refocus its activity on its valued segment. Thus  the manufacturing activities in Florence (New Jersey) are currently being transferred to the Swedesboro site (New Jersey). This operation aims at optimizing the production of all products for customers nationally  while achieving gains in efficiency and coverage of fixed costs.At the closing date  the project was underway  with completion scheduled for the first half of the fiscal year 2023-2024.The net impact of this reorganization has been recorded in the fiscal year 2022-2023 under non-recurring items (€ 10.1 million).Amendment of the green syndicated loan of € 400 millionOn February 6  2023  the Bonduelle Group signed an amendment to its € 400 million syndicated revolving credit facility (RCF) with its banking partners  thereby securing an essential source of financing  which is particularly well suited to the seasonal nature of the group's financing needs  and on very competitive terms  despite the current unstable economic environment. This arrangement provides for a two-year extension  bringing the maturity from 2026 to 2028  with two one-year extension options  bringing the final maturity of the loan to February 2030.The financial terms of this credit line include Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) indicators in line with the group's mission and purpose  both in terms of B Corp certification and in terms of reducing its carbon footprint and contributing  with its agricultural partners  to a regenerative agriculture.This operation demonstrates once again the confidence shown by the banking partners in supporting the Bonduelle Group's development over the long term.First B CorpTM certifications awardedIn 2018  the Bonduelle Group announced its ambition to become a certified B Corp company by 2025. This ambition involves each of its entities obtaining their certification one by one. FY 2022-2023 marks a major milestone with the certification of Bonduelle in Italy and Bonduelle Fresh Americas in the United States  together accounting for a third of group revenue. The two Bonduelle Group entities are the first to meet B Lab's demanding social and environmental impact standards. They join the growing community of B Corp-certified companies  working collectively to make the global economy more respectful of the planet  inclusive and equitable every day.These two certifications illustrate the Bonduelle Group's determination to place a positive impact at the heart of its business model  formalized from 2020 through a roadmap called the B!Pact and built around 3 pillars: food  planet and people. The B Corp certification process accelerates the commitment and mobilization of all the company's activities around the group's positive impact programs.Governance evolutionFollowing the announcement of Guillaume Debrosse’ departure in May 2023  the group announced the appointment of Xavier Unkovic as Chief Executive Officer.

30870,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/fashion-news-cher-givenchy-carine-roitfeld-1235846075/,Cher Celebrates Anniversary at Givenchy  Carine Roitfeld’s 69th Birthday,Plus  Coty's first day trading in Paris  and how a U.S. government shutdown would affect Birkenstock's IPO.,STABLE CELEBRATIONS: Christmas is coming a little early for Paris Fashion Week fans of Cher.After attending last year  the legendary singer is becoming a bit of a front-row regular  much to the delight of the crowds in front of Givenchy.The week is now a special occasion for the singer.“I met my boyfriend here last year  so it’s our anniversary. And so I’m pretty excited ” she said  attending the Givenchy show alongside beau Alexander Edwards. She didn’t reveal any grandiose plans though. “I don’t know what we’re gonna do. Everything we do is special.”Cher spoke with WWD at the Ann Demeulemeester show last year and laughed at the brief reminder. “When I fell down? Because I had on the models’ pants  and they’re so much taller so I caught my heel inside the thing  and I actually fell over three people!” she confided  albeit in a down-to-earth way.In black blazer  chunky boots and  well  regular-size cargo pants  she looked much more stable in her Givenchy outfit.“This is what felt like me ” she said of how she selected the day’s look.The singer is about to put out her first holiday songs. “I’m not a Cher fan  but this album is really good ” she joked. “It’s a Christmas album  but this is not your mother’s Christmas album.”The buzz around Paris Fashion Week is that people will get a little taste of the new sound before the last runway is rolled up.Jared Leto is taking a breather.To come to Paris Fashion Week and face the fans and frenzy outside of the shows might be an unusual choice  but having just dropped his new 30 Seconds to Mars album a little over a week ago  returning the front row is a bit of a relief.“For me  this is like the least stressful thing in the world ” he said. “Because it’s not pressure for me  I get to just be an observer and appreciate the hard work. As somebody who stands on stages around the world playing shows  it’s kind of interesting to see a 15-minute show  with the sound and lighting and presentation. It’s fascinating.”He even eased into his outfit for the day. It looked a little complicated with a trouser  overskirt  high-neck draped top and full gloved arm to outside observers  but he countered  “No  this I just zip-it-up  so it’s very fast. Whatever is quick and easy is my favorite one. I like a little spontaneity.”So what does cause stress for the Oscar winner? “Probably putting this new album out. Deadlines  deliverables — all that stuff. When there’s a timeline. Pressure is good but it’s not always easy.”Next up he’s prepping for a world tour in support of the album  titled “It’s the End of the World but It’s a Beautiful Day.”Sabrina Carpenter is fresh of her performance at Lollapalooza  which she deemed “amazing.”She sported a sleek Givenchy dress and a very teeny-tiny bag. “You can’t fit anything in here ” she joked.She’s attended Paris Fashion Week before.“Paris is like my favorite city in the world. And obviously when it comes to Matthew he’s always so adventurous. Coming to shows here has always been very special to me ” she said of Givenchy creative director Matthew Williams’ work.Williams waxed a little romantic for the season  with florals  lace and beading. — RHONDA RICHFORDBUMPY RIDE: Birkenstock’s road to Wall Street has been a long one — it’s already been 249 years since Johann Adam Birkenstock was listed as “cobbler” in the church archives of Langen-Bergheim.But it looks like the German sandalmaker  which is backed by private equity giant L Catterton  might have to wait just a little longer.While a source said the company was on track to make its offering sometime the week of Oct. 9  a government shutdown could delay that.Gary Gensler  chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission  testified to Congress this week that his active workforce would immediately shrink from 4 600 to about 400 if the government were to shut down.“We’d be a skeletal staff ” Gensler said  noting that those who were working would be plugging away without pay.As the SEC is charged with broad oversight of the financial markets  that would stretch things pretty thin.“Largely  the initial public offering market would be shut down with the government ” he said.That will no doubt have Birkenstock chief executive officer Oliver Reichert paying extra close attention come Sunday when — unless there’s a deal or some change of heart by hard-right House Republican holdouts — Washington will kinda  sorta go dark.It’s a political drama that could tie up a fashion drama.After a drought in IPO’s last year  the market has started to open up this summer in the worlds of fashion and beauty with offerings from Savers Value Village and Oddity Tech. And in the consumer more broadly  grocery delivery firm Instacart took its bow this month.But Birkenstock — a stalwart and connected name  growing fast and posting big profits — is seen as the fashion bellwether  the one that could ignite the market for real.All the companies eyeing their own offering  including Kim Kardashian’s Skims  are just going to have to wait until Washington finds its way to some kind of detente to find out. — EVAN CLARKWHAT’S IN A NUMBER?: Carine Roitfeld  who celebrated her 69th birthday on Wednesday night in Paris  is a late bloomer extraordinaire.She started smoking only five years ago  got her first helix piercing in 2022  and her first tattoos only five months ago — delicate doodlings on her wrists and fingers.Matthew Williams  Michel Gaubert  Carine Roitfeld and Ryan Aguilar at Carine Roitfeld’s 69th birthday party on Wednesday in Paris. River Callaway for WWD“It keeps me young ” she said as guests poured into subterranean nightspot Raspoutine for a dinner and party. “I’m glad to be 69  and I’m happy to tell my age. But maybe I’ll stick with it for some time because I think it’s a great number.”Matthew M. Williams  Alexandre Mattiussi and Peter Dundas  minus his signature curls  mingled with the likes of Eva Longoria  Poppy Delevingne and Michel Gaubert.While she doesn’t describe herself as a late bloomer  Lisa Rinna only made it to the cover of a magazine at age 59 — Roitfeld’s CR Fashion Book.Rinna said she’s never been secretive about her age  but has had a few trepidations since turning 60.“You know what I don’t like?” she asked. “Because I’m an actor  whenever they print my picture now they also put my age. They never did it that much before  or maybe I’m just seeing it more now. I do not f–king like it.”“I’m a late bloomer in horticulture ” Honey Dijon confessed. “I love flowers. I’m starting to get into it.”Peonies are Dijon’s specialty so far. And her main gardening tip? “Moisture ” she purred.Williams  who designed the black Givenchy couture gown Roitfeld wore for the evening  said he also recently started flexing his green thumbs.“It was something to take care of during COVID-19 ” he said. “I have a little balcony and I grow cherry trees  strawberries for my daughters  which they love  lavender  some herbs — and roses.”Smoked salmon and caviar potatoes were served by waiters wearing black organza masks  while dancers roamed around in sexy black outfits to rival the Crazy Horse. — MILES SOCHAFIRST DAY: On its first day of trading on the professional segment of Euronext Paris Thursday  Coty Inc.’s stock remained stable  closing the day down about 0.1 percent to 10.39 euros.The maker of CoverGirl and Lancaster products began trading on the exchange at 3:30 p.m. CET.As previously reported  the beauty company  which is already listed on the New York Stock Exchange  on Monday announced the launch of a global offering of 33 million shares of Coty’s outstanding Class A common stock. It is part of a plan to secure a double listing in Paris.The price was set at 10.28 euros  or $10.80 per share.Coty said in May that it was looking into a dual listing. The company had gone public in New York in 2013.In May  during an interview with WWD  Coty chief executive officer Sue Y. Nabi explained why the company was mulling such a move in the French capital.“European investors want to buy Coty stock. It’s as simple as this ” she said. “This is the right moment to do so. Eleven quarters in line or ahead of expectation is a good moment to start this. I would say that on the Paris Stock Exchange half of the market cap is made with beauty and luxury companies  and we are a beauty and luxury company.”Coty intends to use the net proceeds of an offering primarily to pay off outstanding debt and also for general corporate purposes  such as making investments  working capital and capital expenditures.At the close of its most recent fiscal year  ended June 30  Coty’s net debt stood at $4 billion. — JENNIFER WEILHIT GOAL: Replay is doubling down on its links with soccer and the sports world.The Italian contemporary and denimwear brand said Thursday that it inked a four-season tie-in with soccer team FC Bayern München until June 2027.

He’s the captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs. But thanks to a shared passion for philanthropy  Sentaler founder and creative director Bojana Sentaler and pro hockey star John Tavares found common ground to create a varsity jacket to benefit kids.“We first connected because of my wife Aryne  who is a big fan of Sentaler and the clothing company they are ” said Tavares  who in 2020 launched the John Tavares Foundation to inspire the next generation to build a better world for themselves and generations that follow.The charity also helps kids understand the importance of a healthy lifestyle and provides the needed tools to awaken their passions by participating in community events.Only 91 Sentaler x John Tavares varsity jackets have been created. That final look debuted Thursday — along with the runway presentation of the new Sentaler men’s fall 2023 collection — at Toronto’s Ultra Supper Club. The invite-only launch of the Sentaler x John Tavares varsity jacket is being presented by EY Canada  which shines a spotlight on Canadian entrepreneurs.Priced at for 2 250 Canadian dollars  or $1 850  each jacket is made in Peruvian baby alpaca fabric and has a quilted padded filling for added warmth.Also  every luxuriously detailed keepsake is finished with the official Sentaler x JTF logo and its 1/91  2/91 and so on classification embroidered on its interior lining.Yet merging the athleisure aesthetic of today’s sports world with the elegant functionality that Sentaler is known for internationally was a challenge.An image from the Sentaler x John Tavares campaign. Erin Leydon/Courtesy of JTF“I’d never done a varsity jacket before. Frankly  it is more challenging to make something simple yet memorable ” said Sentaler  who launched her brand in Toronto in 2009. Since then it has become recognized for its signature ribbed sleeve details and hooded wrap coats — many of which have been worn by celebrities like Meghan Markle  Halle Berry  Jennifer Lopez  Gigi Hadid  Emily Blunt and others.She took inspiration from Tavares’ own lifestyle and came up with a blue-hued jacket that features a collar with a nontraditional cut  and diagonal ribbing on the pockets.Sentaler is also allowing shoppers to customize this jacket  which is another first for the brand. Consumers can put their own letter on the jacket front  as well as a one- or two-digit number on the back for more personalization. — CONSTANCE DROGANES,neutral,0.16,0.83,0.01,mixed,0.55,0.29,0.16,True,English,"['Carine Roitfeld', '69th\xa0Birthday', 'Cher', 'Anniversary', 'Givenchy', 'Birkenstock chief executive officer Oliver Reichert', 'hard-right House Republican holdouts', 'initial public offering market', 'Paris Fashion Week fans', 'beau Alexander Edwards', 'first holiday songs', 'full gloved arm', 'private equity giant', 'extra close attention', 'Savers Value Village', 'grocery delivery firm', 'Johann Adam Birkenstock', 'regular-size cargo pants', 'Ann Demeulemeester show', 'sleek Givenchy dress', 'Givenchy creative director', 'fashion drama', 'fashion bellwether', 'Givenchy show', 'models’ pants', '15-minute show', 'STABLE CELEBRATIONS', 'special occasion', 'grandiose plans', 'brief reminder', 'black blazer', 'chunky boots', 'little taste', 'last runway', 'Jared Leto', 'unusual choice', 'new 30 Seconds', 'high-neck draped', 'outside observers', 'little spontaneity', 'Oscar winner', 'Sabrina Carpenter', 'teeny-tiny bag', 'favorite city', 'RHONDA RICHFORD', 'BUMPY RIDE', 'Wall Street', 'church archives', 'German sandalmaker', 'L Catterton', 'Exchange Commission', 'active workforce', 'skeletal staff', 'broad oversight', 'financial markets', 'political drama', 'Oddity Tech', 'connected name', 'big profits', 'Kim Kardashian', 'Givenchy outfit', 'Mars album', 'new album', 'three people', 'earth way', 'new sound', 'front row', 'stressful thing', 'hard work', 'favorite one', 'Gary Gensler', 'Christmas album', 'legendary singer', 'Cher fan', 'Beautiful Day', 'government shutdown', 'world tour', 'Matthew Williams', 'bit', 'front-row', 'delight', 'crowds', 'boyfriend', 'anniversary', 'Everything', 'WWD', 'heel', 'look', 'mother', 'buzz', 'breather', 'frenzy', 'shows', 'relief', 'pressure', 'somebody', 'stages', 'lighting', 'presentation', 'top', 'Deadlines', 'deliverables', 'stuff', 'timeline', 'support', 'performance', 'Lollapalooza', 'season', 'florals', 'lace', 'beading', 'long', 'cobbler', 'Langen-Bergheim', 'source', 'company', 'track', 'Oct.', 'chair', 'Securities', 'Congress', 'pay', 'things', 'deal', 'heart', 'Washington', 'drought', 'IPO', 'worlds', 'beauty', 'offerings', 'consumer', 'Instacart', 'bow', 'stalwart', 'real', 'companies', 'Skims', 'kind', 'detent']",2023-09-29,2023-09-30,wwd.com
30871,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/eutelsat-soars-to-new-heights-with-oneweb-merger-48592/,Eutelsat soars to new heights with OneWeb merger,Eutelsat and OneWeb have finalised their mergerThe new company  Eutelsat Group  is claimed to be the world’s first GEO-LEO integrated satellite playerWith a to…,French satellite provider Eutelsat has completed its merger with UK satellite operator OneWeb  a move that is expected to see the newly combined company soar to new heights in the low-earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary (GEO) satellite arena.In a joint statement  the companies hailed the creation of the new entity  Eutelsat Group  which they said is “the first fully integrated GEO-LEO satellite operator”  sporting a fleet of 37 GEO satellites – the Eutelsat network – and a LEO constellation of more than 600 satellites that had been launched by OneWeb.The new company aims to deliver “global  fully integrated connectivity” powered by a mix of Eutelsat’s GEO satellites  which offer network density and high throughput  and the “low latency and ubiquity” of OneWeb’s LEO constellation.“This combination confirms Eutelsat as a pioneer in the space industry and a leader in space technology innovation  showcasing its continuous commitment to pushing the boundaries of the satellite landscape ” the companies noted.The new company hopes that the combination of GEO and LEO services will open up new markets and enable differentiated applications for customers  including fixed connectivity (for backhaul and corporate networks)  mobile connectivity (for maritime and in-flight offerings)  and secure services for government agency users. Eutelsat noted that its broadcast and video services will remain “integral” to its business.Great expectationsBoth companies place high hopes on the development of their newly born entity: They expect Eutelsat Group’s revenue to grow at a double-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the medium to long term  hitting around €2bn in annual revenues by 2027. They also forecast that the adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) will also grow at a double-digit CAGR in the same period  outpacing the increase in revenue (though they did not share exact figures).According to them  their highly praised “unique suite of in-orbit and on-ground assets” is capable of meeting the needs of customers worldwide  with the group pledging to deliver “safe  resilient and environmentally sustainable connectivity to help bridge the digital divide”.Eutelsat Group’s headquarters will remain in Paris  while OneWeb will act as a subsidiary  operating commercially as Eutelsat OneWeb  based in London. The group is already listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange and  as of today  is also now trading on the London Stock Exchange. It has more than 1 700 employees in total and is run by CEO Eva Berneke.“We can address a wider range of customer requirements and provide hybrid connectivity services where they are required worldwide  all with industry-leading resilience. As we continue our track record of innovation to develop future generations of satellite technology  we can unlock significant value both for customers and shareholders. The Eutelsat-OneWeb combination has given us the scale  financial strength and business proposition to capitalise on the significant opportunity ” said Berneke.The new company’s chairman  Dominique D’Hinnin  described the merger as a “historic moment for the satellite industry” as it unites two businesses that are “at the forefront of delivering integrated  seamless and reliable connectivity to customers worldwide”.Sunil Bharti Mittal  VP and co-chair of Eutelsat Group  stated that the union will be “transformative for communities and businesses worldwide  utilising the unique blend of GEO and LEO technologies.”The merger ends a tumultuous period for OneWeb  which was declared bankrupt in early 2020 after its biggest single investor  SoftBank  withdrew its support. But only eight months later  in November 2020  it was rescued from bankruptcy protection by the UK government and Indian multinational conglomerate Bharti Global  which then attracted a range of additional investors  including Eutelsat. OneWeb then agreed to merge with Eutelsat in July 2022 – see What’s up with… Eutelsat and OneWeb  BT  5G in India.OneWeb expects to be able to deliver global connectivity services to enterprises and communities by the end of 2023  after completing its initial phase of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite deployments in March.The company has been actively pursuing collaborations to boost its role in the connectivity market.

The decreases were largely driven by one-time events around settlements of litigation  related legal fees and spot employee bonuses. Profit / (Loss): Based on Continuing Operations  Profit increased by $549 thousand  an improvement of $195 thousand as compared to Half-year 2022. The improvement was driven primarily by falling interest expense and by one-time gains from debt restructurings. Net Debt: Borrowings were reduced by $1.27 million. Gross debt (inclusive of obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts) were reduced by $1.71 million. Net debt increased by $885 thousand as we deployed cash to reduce borrowings and to cover one-time expenses. IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON 2023 AND BEYONDCovid-19 is now having little direct impact in our markets.

There is instability in our markets and globally that could impact on Group activities in ways that are currently unpredictable. To account for the unpredictable conditions  in forecasting future cash flows in our assessment of Going Concern  Management has made certain extraordinary assumptions. Specifically  we have:Forecasted a materially negative impact on revenue for the years 2023 and 2024. Forecasted expenses to remain approximately at the levels they are as on date of publication of our 2022 Annual Report  meaning we are assuming (for Going Concern assessment only) that the Group has no more flexibility to drive down expenses further. Assumed that the Group will be able to continue to defer junior debt and to negotiate terms for repayment as liquidity becomes available. Assumed no development nor material construction  but do assume some repurposing of existing real estate to accommodate for changes in demand. Forecasted no extraordinary one-time events that may impact positively or negatively on the Group's cash flows  though such events are possible particularly given the environment. Assumed a stable regulatory environment in all countries with existing operations  and have forecasted receiving no governmental support apart from what has already been received.Management has reviewed their plan with the Directors and has collectively formed a judgment that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future  which Management and the Directors have defined as being at least the next 12 months from the filing of this 2023 Half-year Report. In arriving at this judgment  Management has prepared the cash flow projections of the Group.Directors have reviewed this information provided by Management and have considered the information in relation to the financing uncertainties in the current economic climate  the Group's existing commitments and the financial resources available to the Group. Specifically  Directors have considered: (i) there are probably no sources of new financing available to the Group; (ii) the Group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers; (iii) other risks to which the Group is exposed  the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk; (iv) sources of Group income  including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations; (v) cash generation and debt amortization levels; (vi) fundamental trends of the Group's businesses; (vii) ability to re-amortize and unsecured lenders; and (viii) level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets  and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the Going Concern period. The Directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations  as follows:Special Resolution: On September 21  2016  the Group's shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ""any or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors."" This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group.Corporate Expense and Cash Flow: Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company.Liquidity and Working Capital: As of the date of publication of this 2023 Half-year Report  the Group forecasts operating with low levels of reserves and working capital. Selling assets will be critical to creating a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the Going Concern period  which ability to liquidate assets is contingent on market factors that are not within the control of the Group.Considering the above  Management and Directors are satisfied that the consolidated Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report. For these reasons  Management and Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.THUNDERBIRD RESORTS  INC.
