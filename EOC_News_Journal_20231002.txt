Despite progress in our transformation journey  we are facing broader industry challenges  which have been exacerbated by the historic five-month-long writers and actors strike in Hollywood and are delaying our path to recovery. In this troubled environment  we stand alongside our clients to continue delivering world-class quality of work as they are gearing up for production restart once the still ongoing actors strike is settled.In this context  I am truly grateful for the continued support of our creditors and shareholders who have provided new financing.

The highlights include:Better client and operational support: Simplification of business processes to reduce waste  inefficiency  and duplication. Improved operational procedures by documenting and training Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).Structural measures of cost adaptation: Governance controls and authority levels updated and actively managed to ensure greater scrutiny of capital preservation and capital allocation. Substantive progress being made in the reduction of the real estate liabilities with lease exits having been achieved and sublet opportunity identified.Finalization of the technical separation process of Technicolor Creative Studios from Vantiva (termination of the transitional services agreement) by the end of the year.FIRST HALF RESULT S ANALYSISTechnicolor Creative Studios revenues amounted to €302.7 million for the first half 2023  down -25.9% at current rate (down -24.3% at constant rate) compared to the same period in 2022. This decrease mainly includes the reduction of the pipeline compared to the first half 2022 (post covid recovery year).In first half 2023  adjusted EBITDA after lease2 decreased by €58.9 million to €-15.7 million (down to €-14.5 million at constant rate)  with margin down from 11% to -5%. This decrease resulted from the reduction of activity  that was partly offset by the cost actions taken as part of the Re*Imagined program  for both variable and fix costs.In first half 2023  restructuring costs amounted to €13.5 million  compared to €1.3 million in first half 2022. This increase mainly resulted from the implementation of the Re*Imagined transformation plan. EBIT was a €53.6 million loss compared to a €19 million profit in first half 2022. This decrease resulted from both lower activity and higher restructuring costs than previous year.The financial result amounted to €72.2 million compared to a €8.9 million loss in first half 2022. This profit mainly resulted from the net fair value gain on debt and equity instruments arising from the refinancing. Income tax amounted to €6.4 million in first half 2023 compared to an expense of €14.7 million in first half 2022. This decline mainly results from Technicolor Creative Studios reduced profitability. The Group net result therefore amounted to €13.0 million in first half 2023  compared to a loss of €4.4 million in the same period last year.Simplified P&LIn € million 2023 2022 Var Revenues 302.7 408.7 (106.0) Adjusted EBITDA after lease (15.7) 43.2 (58.9) As a % of revenues -5% 11% -600 bps D&A (21.8) (20.1) (1.7) Adjusted EBITA after lease (37.5) 23.1 (60.6) As a % of revenues -12% 6% -600 bps PPA amortization (4.3) (4.3) - IFRS16 impact 5.3 5.1 0.2 Restructuring (13.5) (1.3) (12.2) Other non-current (3.6) (3.6) - EBIT (53.6) 19.0 (72.6) Financial result 72.2 (8.9) 81.1 Taxes (6.4) (14.7) 8.3 Profits from Discontinued operations 0.8 0.4 0.4 Non-Controlling Interest 0.0 (0.1) 0.1 Net Result 13.0 (4.4) 17.4Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow after leaseIn first half 2023  Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow after lease amounted to €(80.5) million  compared to €(23.1) million for first half 2022.

Combined with the slowdown of the advertising VFX market affecting The Mill  this challenging environment is impacting the pace of the Company’s business recovery. Therefore  Technicolor Creative Studios expects its rebound to be postponed by one year.Consequently  the Company has reassessed its future liquidity needs and engaged discussions with some of its shareholders and lenders  and  as part of the process  shared with them forward looking assumptions. The figures given for 2023 to 2025 were established in the context of the discussions; in no case they should constitute a guidance  nor forecasts of any kind.As a consequence of the above  the Company is publishing the following forward-looking assumptions:For 2023: revenue contraction and adjusted EBITDA after lease to decrease by c.€40m compared to first half 2023.For 2024: transition year with progressive recovery of the business in H1  to be materialized in H2 revenues  and adjusted EBITDA after lease to remain negative.For 2025: sharp rebound in revenues and return to normalized profitability with adjusted EBITDA after lease not to exceed €100 million.In this challenging context  shareholders and lenders have decided to demonstrate their support and have renewed their confidence in the future prospects of Technicolor Creative Studios.The main shareholders and lenders of the Company agreed to inject an extra €30 million cash by October 31 st   2023  in accordance with the existing financial agreements.Cash interests on all debt instruments (New Money and Reinstated debt) will be turned into PIK interests until end of 2024  for c.€48 million.In addition  23 of the main shareholders of the Company (holding 94 82%4 of the capital)   announced their intent to acquire the Technicolor Creative Studios S.A. shares the concert does not already own and to file a public tender offer (“offre publique d’achat simplifiée”) with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF). The tender offer  for a cash consideration of 1 63 euro per Technicolor Creative Studios share  dividends included  will be subject to the AMF’s approval and will be followed  the required conditions of capital and voting rights being already met  by a mandatory squeeze-out.The projected delisting of the Company along with these new financing arrangements attest to the strength of Technicolor Creative Studios’ shareholder support.In addition to this first €30 million cash injection  Technicolor Creative Studios intends to seek  in the short term  further financing options from various sources to address its future liquidity needs The Company intends to deepen and accelerate its strategic review announced in March and June 2023. The roll-out of the transformation program will also allow to further optimize working capital and monitor the cash expenditures to ensure the relevant level of cash to operate the Company.T ECHNICOLOR C REATIVE S TUDIOS BOARD OF DIRECTORS WELCOMES FAVORABLY THE CONTEMPLATED DELISTINGTechnicolor Creative Studios’ Board of Directors which met today favorably welcomed the proposed tender offer announced today and the subsequent potential delisting of the Company. The Company signed today a tender offer agreement with the main parties initiating the draft tender offer. The Board of Directors will release an informed opinion on the terms of the Offer in due course  in light of the work of an independent expert appointed to opine on the financial terms of the Offer and  as the case may be  the mandatory squeeze-out.This delisting project also seems consistent with the low trading volumes of the Company shares on Euronext Paris and will enable the Company to minimize the costs and administrative requirements related to the regulatory framework of a listed Company on Euronext Paris. The contemplated delisting would allow Technicolor Creative Studios to place its focus on the execution of its long-term strategy and to prioritize its resources to operational objectives  including strengthening current client relationships along with developing new business opportunities.To ensure transparent and fair assessment of the offer as 90% of the share capital and voting rights of the Company are already held by the concerted shareholders intending to proceed to a squeeze-out  the Board of Directors has decided to appoint an ad-hoc committee in charge of proposing the appointment of an independent expert in charge of providing a report on the financial terms of the offer.The ad-hoc committee is comprised of three independent members: Anne Bouverot  Chairperson  Christine Laurens  Independent director  and Katherine Hays  Independent Director.The board of directors decided to appoint  upon recommendation of the ad-hoc committee  A2EF represented by Mrs. Sonia Bonnet-Bernard as independent expert pursuant to Article 261-1  I and II of the AMF General Regulations.The contemplated delisting would have no impact on Technicolor Creative Studios’ day-to-day operations. The company remains committed to achieve its ambition to be the first-choice digital services production partner for the world’s most creative companies.Further information regarding the contemplated delisting process will be provided in due course.***The limited review of the company's financial information by its statutory auditors is ongoing5.***The Company announces that it has requested Euronext Paris to resume the trading of its shares on Euronext Paris.***ABOUT TECHNICOLOR CREATIVE STUDIOSTechnicolor Creative Studios shares are admitted to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (TCHCS)Technicolor Creative Studios is a creative technology company providing world-class production expertise driven by one purpose: The realization of ambitious and extraordinary ideas.

This sustained growth essentially resulted from the full-year effect of rents coming from the developments in 2022  rents of the warehouses delivered during the first nine months of 2023  as well as the indexation that took place on January 1  2023 (+4% on average).Significant events of the third quarter 2023Carried by a record pipeline - with total investments of €315 million for close to 270 000 sq.m of new developed surfaces for 2023 and 2024 - ARGAN has pursued its strong growth momentum.During the third quarter  our Group has thus delivered two new warehouses on PRIME locations:Montbartier (82)   close to Toulouse  by accompanying D ECATHLON with the delivery of a fourthAutOnom ®-labelled warehouse   which produces its own green energy  for a total surface of 19 000 sq.m;  close to Toulouse  by accompanying   which produces its own green energy  for a total surface of 19 000 sq.m; Mionnay (01)  in the North-East of Lyon  by delivering a total surface of 15 000 sq.m  for COVERGUARD  a leading player on the market of personal protective equipment (PPE). This warehouse  which is also AutOnom®-labelled  is made of two different cells of around 6 500 sq.m each  and one bloc for offices of 1 800 sq.m.These developments complement the one in Janneyrias (38)  close to Lyon as well  as part of a first transaction for BUT with a 38 000 sq.m platform  with a long-term 9.5-year fixed lease. Combined  the sites already delivered to this day in 2023 total a surface of close to 72 000 sq.m.Two new developments will moreover be delivered by the end of this year for a total of close to28 000 sq.m  including the extension of a cold storage warehouse for EURIAL at La Crèche (79) (for two new negative cold cells for additional 12 400 sq.m).Together  2023 projects total 100 000 sq.m in new surfaces for an overall investment of €135 million  already financed through amortizing mortgage loans that were taken out in 2022  before interest rates rose.For 2024  the very upbeat business momentum secured a development pipeline of close to €180 million for 170 000 sq.m in total. These projects comprise developments already announced  including the start of the construction of an AutOnom® site for a surface of 82 000 sq.m for Carrefour  on a former brownfield of PSA in Caen  a project led with an exemplary approach in terms of environmental standards. ARGAN also announced the construction of a distribution centre for 4 600 sq.m in Rouen for DSV  and the extension of another distribution centre in Bruguières (31) for GEODIS  thus increasing the site's size to 13 400 sq.m.Half of investment amounts is already financed through amortizing mortgage loans and the other half should come from the sale of warehouses in 2024 or early 2025  depending on market conditions.All announced or already rolled-out initiatives this year confirm ARGAN's leadership in France  which testifies both to our proven ability to secure PRIME locations  on a backdrop of scarcer land availability  and to a solid positioning as a trust partner to our clients  to support them along projects that are crucial for their good development.2023 targets  updated1 as part of the half-year results  are confirmed:Based on the performance in the first nine months of 2023  and taking into account an occupancy rate standing at 100% in a rental market with very little availability  ARGAN is confirming the targets that were previously updated as part of the 2023 half-year results:Indicators 2023 updated1 targets 2023 initial1targets Full-year 2022 Changevs 2022 Rental income €183m €182m €166m +10% Recurring net income €124m €124m €119m +4% Dividend per share €3.152 A minimum of €3 €3.0 +5%Financial calendar 2024 (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: 2023 Annual SalesJanuary 18: 2023 Annual ResultsMarch 21: Annual General MeetingAbout ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

The Transaction involves (1) a share consolidation with respect to all outstanding Shares by means of a 1-for-10 reverse stock split (the ""Share Consolidation"")  after which ten existing Shares will be represented by one new Share  and each ADS will represent one new Share  (2) listing the Shares on Nasdaq  (3) a mandatory exchange under the Company's ADS facility as a result of which ADS holders will receive Shares in exchange for their ADSs on the basis of a ratio of one ADS for one Share (the ""Mandatory ADS Exchange"")  (4) a repositioning of the Shares from the Euronext Brussels trading system to the Nasdaq trading system  and (5)  following a transition period of at least three weeks after the Mandatory ADS Exchange (the ""Transition Period"")  the de-listing of the Shares from listing and trading on Euronext Brussels (the ""De-Listing"").Story continuesThe board of directors is proposing the Transaction for a number of reasons but primarily because it is expected that consolidating the trading of the Company’s securities onto a single exchange will improve trading liquidity and reduce the administrative and legal costs associated with maintaining a presence on two exchanges. Upon termination of the ADS facility  ADSs held in brokerage accounts will be automatically cancelled and exchanged for Nasdaq-listed Shares without ADS holders having to take any action. During the Transition Period and following the Euronext Brussels De-listing  shareholders may reposition their Shares for trading on Nasdaq after completing a procedure through their financial intermediary or broker. The Company expects that many financial intermediaries will use their discretionary rights (under their terms of service to their clients) to automatically reposition their clients’ Euronext Brussels-listed Shares on their behalf. The Company will provide more information regarding the repositioning of Shares after the Share Consolidation and De-Listing have been approved by the general shareholders' meeting.Michael K. McGarrity  CEO of mdxhealth  commented: ""A key priority for us has been to create a more attractive and efficient trading mechanism for our global investors and stakeholders and to support increasing interest from new investors  while reducing our operating costs. We believe the transition to trade exclusively on the Nasdaq accomplishes this objective. This is an exciting time for mdxhealth  and we look forward to expanding our shareholder base as we continue to execute and drive growth as a leading precision diagnostics company.""For further information and details regarding the proposed Transaction  reference is made to the dedicated web page which can be found on the Company's website  which contains (among other things) (i) a Special Report describing the proposals that will be submitted to the Company's extraordinary general shareholders' meeting  (ii) a letter from the chair of the board of directors summarizing the Transaction  and (iii) frequently asked questions (FAQs) providing context and technical details with respect to the Transaction. This web page and the FAQs will be kept up-to-date as and when necessary.Extraordinary Shareholders MeetingIn order to implement the Transaction  it will be necessary for the Company’s shareholders to approve the Share Consolidation and the De-Listing. In view thereof  the board of directors hereby convenes an extraordinary general shareholders’ meeting to be held on November 3  2023 at 3:00 p.m.  Belgian time  to seek required shareholder approvals.The items on the agenda of the extraordinary general shareholders' meeting include the approval of the proposed Share Consolidation and De-Listing  as well as a number of technical amendments to the Company's articles of association that allow for the De-Listing.In order to participate in the extraordinary general shareholders’ meeting of the Company  the holders of securities issued by the Company must comply with article 7:134  §2  first indent of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code and the articles of association of the Company  and fulfill the formalities described in the convening notice.
