It was created by collector Gilles Fuchs (amongst others) in response to a very clear shrinkage of the influence of French artists at the international level in the 1990s. Its mission was quite simply to rescue French art by generating an environment more conducive to the emergence of French artists in what was then a very delicate context for the French Contemporary art market.[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/10/image1-artists-bertille-bak-massinissa-selmani-bouchra-khalili-tarik-kiswanson-copyright-julie-ansiau.jpg ]From left to right in the photo: Bertille Bak  Massinissa Selmani  Bouchra Khalili  Tarik Kiswanson.Photo ©Julie Ansiau[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/10/image2-top-10-works-sold-at-auction-by-the-winners-of-the-marcel-duchamp-prize-copyright-artprice-com.jpg ]Top 10 works sold at auction by the winners of the Marcel Duchamp Prize ©artprice.com“For over two decades  the Marcel Duchamp Prize has become an essential reference in the world of Contemporary art  but beyond the prestige of the prize itself  the ADIAF plays a pivotal role in elevating the French art scene on a global scale and providing vital support for French artistic expression.” thierry EhrmannEvery year  the Marcel Duchamp Prize highlights French artists or artists working in France during the FIAC  now Paris+ by Art Basel. Since 2016  the finalists have been given a substantial spotlight (often their first) at a strategic moment in the international Contemporary Art calendar: their works are shown at the Pompidou Center for three months in an exhibition area of 650 m2 (previously  they were exhibited at the FIAC and only the winner benefited from an exhibition at the Center Pompidou). This exposure in one of France's top museums is already a major boost for their careers  but the ADIAF also deploys other strategies to promote young hopefuls from the French scene on the international stage.The impact of the Duchamp PrizeOn top of a substantial financial reward for the finalists (90 000 euros  including a prize of 35 000 euros for the winner)  the winner also benefits from a research residency in the United States at the Villa Albertine. Indeed  beyond the allocation of a prize and the one-off exhibition  the Marcel Duchamp Prize aims to be a complete system of support for artists in their careers. The idea is to promote the French art scene in the world via international exhibitions organized in partnership with foreign museums and with the support of the Institut Français. More than 50 Marcel Duchamp Prize artists and 140 major works have benefited from visibility during some 20 exhibitions organized in major museums around the world  in Buenos Aires  Beijing  Shanghai  Los Angeles  Seoul  and Berlin  among other places. The professional networks established with the Marcel Duchamp Prize can constitute important springboards. This represents invaluable support because while obtaining a Prize always constitutes a positive argument in the career of an artist by boosting his/her legitimacy  it is above all the meetings with collectors and the exhibitions generated as a result that will increase  in the long term  the artist's notoriety and market prices.Prize recipients: whats it worth?It is difficult to assess the immediate impact of winning the Marcel Duchamp Prize on the artists' market prices. Although it is clear that obtaining such an award does indeed sharpen the interest of collectors  the galleries are the first beneficiaries of this momentum  since the Prize does not necessarily trigger an acceleration of transactions on the auction market (which is essentially a ‘secondary' market).Among the big names who have received the Marcel Duchamp Prize in the past  Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster  Laurent Grasso  Tatiana Trouvé  Mircea Cantor  and Kader Attia  have established themselves as artists of international quality and are sought after by major collectors. However  the auction market does not always reflect the quality of their careers or of their works.While the works of Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster (2002 winner)  for example  have been acquired by several major museums including the Tate Modern (London)  the Dia Art Foundation (New York)  and the Pompidou Center in (Paris)  her works are extremely rare in at auction; and when they are presented  they are not necessarily indicative of the artist's interdisciplinary practice  which encompasses cinema  installation  video and various forms of collaborative work. Her auction record of $23 410 in a Christie's sale in London (Multiverse  2004-2012) has not been renewed since 2012 – more than ten years ago – a significant amount of time in the dynamics of the Contemporary art market. Indeed  some winners like Clement Cogitore (2018 winner) have never seen their works offered at auction  or have not yet found their audience in the art market  like Julien Prévieux (2014 winner).Other artists  when supported by particularly powerful international galleries  enjoy more sustained auction activity. This is the case of Tatiana Found (supported by the Perrotin  Paris; the Gagosian  New York and Johann König  Berlin)  Cyprien Gaillard (supported by Gladstone  New York and Sprüth Magers  Berlin)  Laurent Grasso (supported by Perrotin  Paris and Sean Kelly  New York) or even Latifa Echakhch (supported by Kamel Mennour  Paris; Kaufmann Repetto  Milan; Dvir Gallery  Tel Aviv and Eva Presenhuber  Zurich)  all ranked in the 10 000 top-selling artists at global auctions.Tatiana Found (2007 winner) and Latifa Echakhch (2013 winner) have both already ranked among the 5 000 top-selling artists on the global market and have in common auction records dating back to 2015. Tatiana Found's installation Untitled (ref: cable 9) sold for $67 000 at Phillips in London  and  a few months later  a painting by Latifa Echakhch fetched $203 300 at the same auctioneer after being part of the collection of Dr. Frederic S. Brandt in Miami. The young Latifa Echakhch  today sought after by international collectors  has been crowned by eight auction results above $100 000.Other winners have sold above this price level  a significant and rare level for young French artists indeed. They include Cyprien Gaillard (2010 winner) whose peak currently stands at $193 750. Again  his record also dates back to 2015 (like those of Tatiana Trouvé and Latifa Echakhch)  but Cyprien Gaillard's was hammered at Sotheby's New York and not in London.Kader Attia (2016 winner) also distinguished himself by the sale of two installations for over $100 000 before obtaining his Duchamp Prize in 2016  the only prize with which he had been honored until then. Thomas Hirschhorn (2000 winner) has an auction record of $156 190 following the sale in 2006 of a large mixed-technique entitled Abstract Relief No.548 (1999) at Phillips de Pury & Company in London. His first works went to auction in 2001  a few months after winning the Duchamp Prize  and his demand has become global with 76% of his turnover being hammered in the United States.Award-winning artists accessible on the auction marketMany of these French artists  whose talent has been confirmed by winning the Duchamp Prize  have works that are accessible for under $5 000 at auction. This is the case for Carole Benzaken (2004 winner)  whose biggest paintings exceed $15 000; Thomas Hirschhorn (2000 winner)  62% of whose works sell between $1 000 and $5 000; Matthew Mercier (2003 winner)  half of whose works sell for between $1 000 and $5 000 at auction. Likewise for Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige (2017 winners)  whose politically motivated works – attempting to reveal history's underbelly and question the standard representation of conflicts – have been exhibited at several art biennials and in museums as important as the Solomon R. Guggenheim (New York) and the British Museum (London). They have also been integrated into several large private and public collections  but still remain affordable at auction.It is clear that solid international recognition does not always have a major impact on the auction market. Informed collectors deal directly with galleries and the prices of artists evolve confidentially  especially for works that are often transversal  atypical and do not necessarily conform to trends in global demand.The winners of the Marcel Duchamp PrizeThomas Hirschhorn (2000 - 2001)Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster (2002)Matthew Mercier (2003)Carole Benzaken (2004)Claude Closky (2005)Philippe Mayaux (2006)Tatiana Trouvé (2007)Laurent Grasso (2008)Saâdane Afif (2009)Cyprien Gaillard (2010)Mircea Cantor (2011)Daniel Dewar and Grégory Gicquel (2012)Latifa Echakhch (2013)Julien Prévieux (2014)Melik Ohanian (2015)Kader Attia (2016)Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige (2017)Clément Cogitore (2018)Eric Baudelaire (2019)Kapwani Kiwanga (2020)Lili Reynaud Dewar (2021)Mimosa Echard (2022)The nominees for the 2023 Marcel Duchamp PrizeClaude Bonnin  President of ADIAF  will reveal the name of the winner on 16 October following the vote of an international jury composed of Xavier Rey  Director of the National Museum of Modern Art (Pompidou Center)  Claude Bonnin  collector and President of the ADIAF  Akemi Shiraha  representative of the Marcel Duchamp Association  Dr. Jimena Blasquez Abascal  collector and Director of the Montenmedio Contemporary Foundation (Spain)  Josée Gensollen  collector of the Gensollen La Fabrique Collection in Marseille  Béatrice Salmon  director of the National Center for Visual Arts (CNAP) and Adam D.

Whether it is her own community in the mining areas of northern France or in groups that are unfamiliar to her  she never chooses to distance herself. On the contrary  it is about sharing a passage in life… a struggle… a resistance.” (Source Xippas Gallery).Her work has been the subject of numerous exhibitions: Museum of Modern Art of the City of Paris in 2012  Merz Foundation in Turin in 2022  and Louvre Lens in 2023  among others.Bouchra Khalilihttps://www.adiaf.com/artistes/bouchra-khalili/Born in 1975 in Casablanca  Khalili lives and works in Berlin and is represented by the Mor Charpentier Gallery  Paris and the ADN Gallery in BarcelonaThe artist's work includes film and video installations  photography  and screen printing. Each of her projects can be seen as a platform from which members of minorities groups can propose  implement and share resistance strategies and discourses developed from the margins. Her work has been the subject of numerous exhibitions including at Barcelona's MACBA and Paris's Palais de Tokyo in 2015  New York's MoMA in 2016  and Paris's Jeu de Paume in 2018.Tarik Kiswansonhttps://www.adiaf.com/artistes/tarik-kiswanson/Born in 1986 in Halmstad (Sweden) Kiswanson lives and works in Paris  France  and Amman  Jordan.Represented by the carlier | gebauer Gallery in Berlin and the Sfer Gallery in Hamburg and Beirut.His work encompasses sculpture  writing  performance  drawing  sound  and video works.

It was created by collector Gilles Fuchs (amongst others) in response to a very clear shrinkage of the influence of French artists at the international level in the 1990s. Its mission was quite simply to rescue French art by generating an environment more conducive to the emergence of French artists in what was then a very delicate context for the French Contemporary art market.From left to right in the photo: Bertille Bak  Massinissa Selmani  Bouchra Khalili  Tarik Kiswanson. Photo © julie ansiau Top 10 works sold at auction by the winners of the Marcel Duchamp Prize ©artprice.com""For over two decades  the Marcel Duchamp Prize has become an essential reference in the world of Contemporary art  but beyond the prestige of the prize itself  the ADIAF plays a pivotal role in elevating the French art scene on a global scale and providing vital support for French artistic expression."" thierry EhrmannEvery year  the Marcel Duchamp Prize highlights French artists or artists working in France during the FIAC  now Paris+ by Art Basel. Since 2016  the finalists have been given a substantial spotlight (often their first) at a strategic moment in the international Contemporary Art calendar: their works are shown at the Pompidou Center for three months in an exhibition area of 650 m2 (previously  they were exhibited at the FIAC and only the winner benefited from an exhibition at the Center Pompidou). This exposure in one of France's top museums is already a major boost for their careers  but the ADIAF also deploys other strategies to promote young hopefuls from the French scene on the international stage.The impact of the Duchamp PrizeOn top of a substantial financial reward for the finalists (90 000 euros  including a prize of 35 000 euros for the winner)  the winner also benefits from a research residency in the United States at the Villa Albertine. Indeed  beyond the allocation of a prize and the one-off exhibition  the Marcel Duchamp Prize aims to be a complete system of support for artists in their careers. The idea is to promote the French art scene in the world via international exhibitions organized in partnership with foreign museums and with the support of the Institut Français. More than 50 Marcel Duchamp Prize artists and 140 major works have benefited from visibility during some 20 exhibitions organized in major museums around the world  in Buenos Aires  Beijing  Shanghai  Los Angeles  Seoul  and Berlin  among other places. The professional networks established with the Marcel Duchamp Prize can constitute important springboards. This represents invaluable support because while obtaining a Prize always constitutes a positive argument in the career of an artist by boosting his/her legitimacy  it is above all the meetings with collectors and the exhibitions generated as a result that will increase  in the long term  the artist's notoriety and market prices.Prize recipients: whats it worth?It is difficult to assess the immediate impact of winning the Marcel Duchamp Prize on the artists' market prices. Although it is clear that obtaining such an award does indeed sharpen the interest of collectors  the galleries are the first beneficiaries of this momentum  since the Prize does not necessarily trigger an acceleration of transactions on the auction market (which is essentially a 'secondary' market).Among the big names who have received the Marcel Duchamp Prize in the past  Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster  Laurent Grasso  Tatiana Trouvé  Mircea Cantor  and Kader Attia  have established themselves as artists of international quality and are sought after by major collectors. However  the auction market does not always reflect the quality of their careers or of their works.While the works of Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster (2002 winner)  for example  have been acquired by several major museums including the Tate Modern (London)  the Dia Art Foundation (New York)  and the Pompidou Center in (Paris)  her works are extremely rare in at auction; and when they are presented  they are not necessarily indicative of the artist's interdisciplinary practice  which encompasses cinema  installation  video and various forms of collaborative work. Her auction record of $23 410 in a Christie's sale in London (Multiverse  2004-2012) has not been renewed since 2012 – more than ten years ago – a significant amount of time in the dynamics of the Contemporary art market. Indeed  some winners like Clement Cogitore (2018 winner) have never seen their works offered at auction  or have not yet found their audience in the art market  like Julien Prévieux (2014 winner).Other artists  when supported by particularly powerful international galleries  enjoy more sustained auction activity. This is the case of Tatiana Found (supported by the Perrotin  Paris; the Gagosian  New York and Johann König  Berlin)  Cyprien Gaillard (supported by Gladstone  New York and Sprüth Magers  Berlin)  Laurent Grasso (supported by Perrotin  Paris and Sean Kelly  New York) or even Latifa Echakhch (supported by Kamel Mennour  Paris; Kaufmann Repetto  Milan; Dvir Gallery  Tel Aviv and Eva Presenhuber  Zurich)  all ranked in the 10 000 top-selling artists at global auctions.Tatiana Found (2007 winner) and Latifa Echakhch (2013 winner) have both already ranked among the 5 000 top-selling artists on the global market and have in common auction records dating back to 2015. Tatiana Found's installation Untitled (ref: cable 9) sold for $67 000 at Phillips in London  and  a few months later  a painting by Latifa Echakhch fetched $203 300 at the same auctioneer after being part of the collection of Dr. Frederic S. Brandt in Miami. The young Latifa Echakhch  today sought after by international collectors  has been crowned by eight auction results above $100 000.Other winners have sold above this price level  a significant and rare level for young French artists indeed. They include Cyprien Gaillard (2010 winner) whose peak currently stands at $193 750. Again  his record also dates back to 2015 (like those of Tatiana Trouvé and Latifa Echakhch)  but Cyprien Gaillard's was hammered at Sotheby's New York and not in London.Kader Attia (2016 winner) also distinguished himself by the sale of two installations for over $100 000 before obtaining his Duchamp Prize in 2016  the only prize with which he had been honored until then. Thomas Hirschhorn (2000 winner) has an auction record of $156 190 following the sale in 2006 of a large mixed-technique entitled Abstract Relief No.548 (1999) at Phillips de Pury & Company in London. His first works went to auction in 2001  a few months after winning the Duchamp Prize  and his demand has become global with 76% of his turnover being hammered in the United States.Award-winning artists accessible on the auction marketMany of these French artists  whose talent has been confirmed by winning the Duchamp Prize  have works that are accessible for under $5 000 at auction. This is the case for Carole Benzaken (2004 winner)  whose biggest paintings exceed $15 000; Thomas Hirschhorn (2000 winner)  62% of whose works sell between $1 000 and $5 000; Matthew Mercier (2003 winner)  half of whose works sell for between $1 000 and $5 000 at auction. Likewise for Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige (2017 winners)  whose politically motivated works – attempting to reveal history's underbelly and question the standard representation of conflicts – have been exhibited at several art biennials and in museums as important as the Solomon R. Guggenheim (New York) and the British Museum (London). They have also been integrated into several large private and public collections  but still remain affordable at auction.It is clear that solid international recognition does not always have a major impact on the auction market. Informed collectors deal directly with galleries and the prices of artists evolve confidentially  especially for works that are often transversal  atypical and do not necessarily conform to trends in global demand.The winners of the Marcel Duchamp PrizeThomas Hirschhorn (2000 - 2001)Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster (2002)Matthew Mercier (2003)Carole Benzaken (2004)Claude Closky (2005)Philippe Mayaux (2006)Tatiana Trouvé (2007)Laurent Grasso (2008)Saâdane Afif (2009)Cyprien Gaillard (2010)Mircea Cantor (2011)Daniel Dewar and Grégory Gicquel (2012)Latifa Echakhch (2013)Julien Prévieux (2014)Melik Ohanian (2015)Kader Attia (2016)Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige (2017)Clément Cogitore (2018)Eric Baudelaire (2019)Kapwani Kiwanga (2020)Lili Reynaud Dewar (2021)Mimosa Echard (2022)The nominees for the 2023 Marcel Duchamp PrizeClaude Bonnin  President of ADIAF  will reveal the name of the winner on 16 October following the vote of an international jury composed of Xavier Rey  Director of the National Museum of Modern Art (Pompidou Center)  Claude Bonnin  collector and President of the ADIAF  Akemi Shiraha  representative of the Marcel Duchamp Association  Dr. Jimena Blasquez Abascal  collector and Director of the Montenmedio Contemporary Foundation (Spain)  Josée Gensollen  collector of the Gensollen La Fabrique Collection in Marseille  Béatrice Salmon  director of the National Center for Visual Arts (CNAP) and Adam D.

She had joined the company in March from Credit Suisse.Goodbody  which was bought by AIB two years ago  currently has about 350 employees.Staff were also informed that Goodbody has acquired Clearstream Solutions  an environmental  social and governance consultancy that has 15 employees  for an undisclosed amount.READ MOREMeanwhile  AIB has decided to transfer its equity capital unit  which has eight staff and is led by Finlay McFadyen  to Goodbody Stockbrokers  the sources said.“Reflecting the unprecedented set of challenges currently faced by investment banks globally  we are taking decisive actions to strengthen our business and position ourselves for long-term success ” said Martin Tormey  Goodbody chief executive  in a statement sent to The Irish Times in response to questions on the staff briefing.[ Smurfit Kappa’s Irish stock market exit compounds existential crisis ]“While we regret the impact this decision will have on our affected employees  we believe these measures are necessary to align our resources with our strategic priorities.”News of the job cuts come less than a month after Davy  Goodbody’s larger rival which is owned by Bank of Ireland  moved to open up redundancy programmes in its capital markets businesses in the UK and Ireland  with as many as 18 staff expected to exit the business.The Irish stock market’s previous largest publicly quoted company CRH cancelled its Dublin listing less than two weeks ago  as part of a wider listings rejig that will see it move its primary quotation from London to New York.Flutter Entertainment  currently the largest company on the Iseq  is also widely expected to take a similar route in the near term  having decided earlier this year to take out a secondary listing in the US.Meanwhile  Smurfit Kappa  another Iseq heavyweight  revealed last month that it plans to quit the Irish market if it presses ahead with a merger with US-based rival WestRock.Are the EU and China edging towards a trade war?

The Transaction involves (1) a share consolidation with respect to all outstanding Shares by means of a 1-for-10 reverse stock split (the ""Share Consolidation"")  after which ten existing Shares will be represented by one new Share  and each ADS will represent one new Share  (2) listing the Shares on Nasdaq  (3) a mandatory exchange under the Company's ADS facility as a result of which ADS holders will receive Shares in exchange for their ADSs on the basis of a ratio of one ADS for one Share (the ""Mandatory ADS Exchange"")  (4) a repositioning of the Shares from the Euronext Brussels trading system to the Nasdaq trading system  and (5)  following a transition period of at least three weeks after the Mandatory ADS Exchange (the ""Transition Period"")  the de-listing of the Shares from listing and trading on Euronext Brussels (the ""De-Listing"").The board of directors is proposing the Transaction for a number of reasons but primarily because it is expected that consolidating the trading of the Company’s securities onto a single exchange will improve trading liquidity and reduce the administrative and legal costs associated with maintaining a presence on two exchanges. Upon termination of the ADS facility  ADSs held in brokerage accounts will be automatically cancelled and exchanged for Nasdaq-listed Shares without ADS holders having to take any action. During the Transition Period and following the Euronext Brussels De-listing  shareholders may reposition their Shares for trading on Nasdaq after completing a procedure through their financial intermediary or broker. The Company expects that many financial intermediaries will use their discretionary rights (under their terms of service to their clients) to automatically reposition their clients’ Euronext Brussels-listed Shares on their behalf. The Company will provide more information regarding the repositioning of Shares after the Share Consolidation and De-Listing have been approved by the general shareholders' meeting.Michael K. McGarrity  CEO of mdxhealth  commented: ""A key priority for us has been to create a more attractive and efficient trading mechanism for our global investors and stakeholders and to support increasing interest from new investors  while reducing our operating costs. We believe the transition to trade exclusively on the Nasdaq accomplishes this objective. This is an exciting time for mdxhealth  and we look forward to expanding our shareholder base as we continue to execute and drive growth as a leading precision diagnostics company.""For further information and details regarding the proposed Transaction  reference is made to the dedicated web page which can be found on the Company's website  which contains (among other things) (i) a Special Report describing the proposals that will be submitted to the Company's extraordinary general shareholders' meeting  (ii) a letter from the chair of the board of directors summarizing the Transaction  and (iii) frequently asked questions (FAQs) providing context and technical details with respect to the Transaction. This web page and the FAQs will be kept up-to-date as and when necessary.Extraordinary Shareholders MeetingIn order to implement the Transaction  it will be necessary for the Company’s shareholders to approve the Share Consolidation and the De-Listing. In view thereof  the board of directors hereby convenes an extraordinary general shareholders’ meeting to be held on November 3  2023 at 3:00 p.m.  Belgian time  to seek required shareholder approvals.The items on the agenda of the extraordinary general shareholders' meeting include the approval of the proposed Share Consolidation and De-Listing  as well as a number of technical amendments to the Company's articles of association that allow for the De-Listing.In order to participate in the extraordinary general shareholders’ meeting of the Company  the holders of securities issued by the Company must comply with article 7:134  §2  first indent of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code and the articles of association of the Company  and fulfill the formalities described in the convening notice.

The Transaction involves (1) a share consolidation with respect to all outstanding Shares by means of a 1-for-10 reverse stock split (the ""Share Consolidation"")  after which ten existing Shares will be represented by one new Share  and each ADS will represent one new Share  (2) listing the Shares on Nasdaq  (3) a mandatory exchange under the Company's ADS facility as a result of which ADS holders will receive Shares in exchange for their ADSs on the basis of a ratio of one ADS for one Share (the ""Mandatory ADS Exchange"")  (4) a repositioning of the Shares from the Euronext Brussels trading system to the Nasdaq trading system  and (5)  following a transition period of at least three weeks after the Mandatory ADS Exchange (the ""Transition Period"")  the de-listing of the Shares from listing and trading on Euronext Brussels (the ""De-Listing"").The board of directors is proposing the Transaction for a number of reasons but primarily because it is expected that consolidating the trading of the Company’s securities onto a single exchange will improve trading liquidity and reduce the administrative and legal costs associated with maintaining a presence on two exchanges. Upon termination of the ADS facility  ADSs held in brokerage accounts will be automatically cancelled and exchanged for Nasdaq-listed Shares without ADS holders having to take any action. During the Transition Period and following the Euronext Brussels De-listing  shareholders may reposition their Shares for trading on Nasdaq after completing a procedure through their financial intermediary or broker. The Company expects that many financial intermediaries will use their discretionary rights (under their terms of service to their clients) to automatically reposition their clients’ Euronext Brussels-listed Shares on their behalf. The Company will provide more information regarding the repositioning of Shares after the Share Consolidation and De-Listing have been approved by the general shareholders' meeting.Michael K. McGarrity  CEO of mdxhealth  commented: ""A key priority for us has been to create a more attractive and efficient trading mechanism for our global investors and stakeholders and to support increasing interest from new investors  while reducing our operating costs. We believe the transition to trade exclusively on the Nasdaq accomplishes this objective. This is an exciting time for mdxhealth  and we look forward to expanding our shareholder base as we continue to execute and drive growth as a leading precision diagnostics company.""For further information and details regarding the proposed Transaction  reference is made to the dedicated web page which can be found on the Company's website  which contains (among other things) (i) a Special Report describing the proposals that will be submitted to the Company's extraordinary general shareholders' meeting  (ii) a letter from the chair of the board of directors summarizing the Transaction  and (iii) frequently asked questions (FAQs) providing context and technical details with respect to the Transaction. This web page and the FAQs will be kept up-to-date as and when necessary.Extraordinary Shareholders MeetingIn order to implement the Transaction  it will be necessary for the Company’s shareholders to approve the Share Consolidation and the De-Listing. In view thereof  the board of directors hereby convenes an extraordinary general shareholders’ meeting to be held on November 3  2023 at 3:00 p.m.  Belgian time  to seek required shareholder approvals.The items on the agenda of the extraordinary general shareholders' meeting include the approval of the proposed Share Consolidation and De-Listing  as well as a number of technical amendments to the Company's articles of association that allow for the De-Listing.In order to participate in the extraordinary general shareholders’ meeting of the Company  the holders of securities issued by the Company must comply with article 7:134  §2  first indent of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code and the articles of association of the Company  and fulfill the formalities described in the convening notice.

The aim is to reproduce an unlimited and environmentally friendly source of energy  like the Sun. The consequences of such an innovation are enormous  as it would enable the population to be supplied with energy in a continuous and non-polluting manner.Now  equipped with servers using direct liquid cooling solutions  LLNL has chosen 2CRSi to test immersion cooling technology. This powerful technology allows for faster cooling of energy-intensive computing equipment  such as those sited at LLNL.2CRSi understands the environmental urgency and works every day to create and develop new methods to cool computer equipment in all types of environments.At the end of this test phase  the collaboration between 2CRSi and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory could be extended with additional orders over several years.About 2CRSiFounded in Strasbourg  the 2CRSi Group designs  produces and markets customized  eco-responsible high-performance computer servers. In fiscal year 2022-2023  the Group generated sales of 184 million euros. The Group now markets its innovative solutions (computing  storage and networking) in over 50 countries. 2CRSi has been listed since June 2018 on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN Code: FR0013341781)  and its shares were transferred to Euronext Growth in November 2022.

Substantive progress being made in the reduction of the real estate liabilities with lease exits having been achieved and sublet opportunity identified.Finalization of the technical separation process of Technicolor Creative Studios from Vantiva (termination of the transitional services agreement) by the end of the year.FIRST HALF RESULT S ANALYSISTechnicolor Creative Studios revenues amounted to €302.7 million for the first half 2023  down -25.9% at current rate (down -24.3% at constant rate) compared to the same period in 2022. This decrease mainly includes the reduction of the pipeline compared to the first half 2022 (post covid recovery year).In first half 2023  adjusted EBITDA after lease2 decreased by €58.9 million to €-15.7 million (down to €-14.5 million at constant rate)  with margin down from 11% to -5%. This decrease resulted from the reduction of activity  that was partly offset by the cost actions taken as part of the Re*Imagined program  for both variable and fix costs.In first half 2023  restructuring costs amounted to €13.5 million  compared to €1.3 million in first half 2022. This increase mainly resulted from the implementation of the Re*Imagined transformation plan. EBIT was a €53.6 million loss compared to a €19 million profit in first half 2022. This decrease resulted from both lower activity and higher restructuring costs than previous year.The financial result amounted to €72.2 million compared to a €8.9 million loss in first half 2022. This profit mainly resulted from the net fair value gain on debt and equity instruments arising from the refinancing. Income tax amounted to €6.4 million in first half 2023 compared to an expense of €14.7 million in first half 2022. This decline mainly results from Technicolor Creative Studios reduced profitability.

Combined with the slowdown of the advertising VFX market affecting The Mill  this challenging environment is impacting the pace of the Company’s business recovery. Therefore  Technicolor Creative Studios expects its rebound to be postponed by one year.Consequently  the Company has reassessed its future liquidity needs and engaged discussions with some of its shareholders and lenders  and  as part of the process  shared with them forward looking assumptions. The figures given for 2023 to 2025 were established in the context of the discussions; in no case they should constitute a guidance  nor forecasts of any kind.As a consequence of the above  the Company is publishing the following forward-looking assumptions:For 2023: revenue contraction and adjusted EBITDA after lease to decrease by c.€40m compared to first half 2023.For 2024: transition year with progressive recovery of the business in H1  to be materialized in H2 revenues  and adjusted EBITDA after lease to remain negative.For 2025: sharp rebound in revenues and return to normalized profitability with adjusted EBITDA after lease not to exceed €100 million.In this challenging context  shareholders and lenders have decided to demonstrate their support and have renewed their confidence in the future prospects of Technicolor Creative Studios.The main shareholders and lenders of the Company agreed to inject an extra €30 million cash by October 31 st   2023  in accordance with the existing financial agreements.  2023  in accordance with the existing financial agreements. Cash interests on all debt instruments (New Money and Reinstated debt) will be turned into PIK interests until end of 2024  for c.€48 million.In addition  23 of the main shareholders of the Company (holding 94 82%4 of the capital)   announced their intent to acquire the Technicolor Creative Studios S.A. shares the concert does not already own and to file a public tender offer (“offre publique d’achat simplifiée”) with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF). The tender offer  for a cash consideration of 1 63 euro per Technicolor Creative Studios share  dividends included  will be subject to the AMF’s approval and will be followed  the required conditions of capital and voting rights being already met  by a mandatory squeeze-out.The projected delisting of the Company along with these new financing arrangements attest to the strength of Technicolor Creative Studios’ shareholder support.In addition to this first €30 million cash injection  Technicolor Creative Studios intends to seek  in the short term  further financing options from various sources to address its future liquidity needs The Company intends to deepen and accelerate its strategic review announced in March and June 2023. The roll-out of the transformation program will also allow to further optimize working capital and monitor the cash expenditures to ensure the relevant level of cash to operate the Company.T ECHNICOLOR C REATIVE S TUDIOS BOARD OF DIRECTORS WELCOMES FAVORABLY THE CONTEMPLATED DELISTINGTechnicolor Creative Studios’ Board of Directors which met today favorably welcomed the proposed tender offer announced today and the subsequent potential delisting of the Company. The Company signed today a tender offer agreement with the main parties initiating the draft tender offer. The Board of Directors will release an informed opinion on the terms of the Offer in due course  in light of the work of an independent expert appointed to opine on the financial terms of the Offer and  as the case may be  the mandatory squeeze-out.This delisting project also seems consistent with the low trading volumes of the Company shares on Euronext Paris and will enable the Company to minimize the costs and administrative requirements related to the regulatory framework of a listed Company on Euronext Paris. The contemplated delisting would allow Technicolor Creative Studios to place its focus on the execution of its long-term strategy and to prioritize its resources to operational objectives  including strengthening current client relationships along with developing new business opportunities.To ensure transparent and fair assessment of the offer as 90% of the share capital and voting rights of the Company are already held by the concerted shareholders intending to proceed to a squeeze-out  the Board of Directors has decided to appoint an ad-hoc committee in charge of proposing the appointment of an independent expert in charge of providing a report on the financial terms of the offer.The ad-hoc committee is comprised of three independent members: Anne Bouverot  Chairperson  Christine Laurens  Independent director  and Katherine Hays  Independent Director.The board of directors decided to appoint  upon recommendation of the ad-hoc committee  A2EF represented by Mrs. Sonia Bonnet-Bernard as independent expert pursuant to Article 261-1  I and II of the AMF General Regulations.The contemplated delisting would have no impact on Technicolor Creative Studios’ day-to-day operations. The company remains committed to achieve its ambition to be the first-choice digital services production partner for the world’s most creative companies.Further information regarding the contemplated delisting process will be provided in due course.***The limited review of the company's financial information by its statutory auditors is ongoing5.***The Company announces that it has requested Euronext Paris to resume the trading of its shares on Euronext Paris.***ABOUT TECHNICOLOR CREATIVE STUDIOSTechnicolor Creative Studios shares are admitted to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (TCHCS)Technicolor Creative Studios is a creative technology company providing world-class production expertise driven by one purpose: The realization of ambitious and extraordinary ideas.

The figures given for 2023 to 2025 were established in the context of the discussions; in no case they should constitute a guidance  nor forecasts of any kind.As a consequence of the above  the Company is publishing the following forward-looking assumptions:For 2023: revenue contraction and adjusted EBITDA after lease to decrease by c.€40m compared to first half 2023.For 2024: transition year with progressive recovery of the business in H1  to be materialized in H2 revenues  and adjusted EBITDA after lease to remain negative.For 2025: sharp rebound in revenues and return to normalized profitability with adjusted EBITDA after lease not to exceed €100 million.In this challenging context  shareholders and lenders have decided to demonstrate their support and have renewed their confidence in the future prospects of Technicolor Creative Studios.The main shareholders and lenders of the Company agreed to inject an extra €30 million cash by October 31 st   2023  in accordance with the existing financial agreements.  2023  in accordance with the existing financial agreements. Cash interests on all debt instruments (New Money and Reinstated debt) will be turned into PIK interests until end of 2024  for c.€48 million.In addition  23 of the main shareholders of the Company (holding 94 82%4 of the capital)   announced their intent to acquire the Technicolor Creative Studios S.A. shares the concert does not already own and to file a public tender offer (“offre publique d’achat simplifiée”) with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF). The tender offer  for a cash consideration of 1 63 euro per Technicolor Creative Studios share  dividends included  will be subject to the AMF’s approval and will be followed  the required conditions of capital and voting rights being already met  by a mandatory squeeze-out.The projected delisting of the Company along with these new financing arrangements attest to the strength of Technicolor Creative Studios’ shareholder support.In addition to this first €30 million cash injection  Technicolor Creative Studios intends to seek  in the short term  further financing options from various sources to address its future liquidity needs The Company intends to deepen and accelerate its strategic review announced in March and June 2023. The roll-out of the transformation program will also allow to further optimize working capital and monitor the cash expenditures to ensure the relevant level of cash to operate the Company.T ECHNICOLOR C REATIVE S TUDIOS BOARD OF DIRECTORS WELCOMES FAVORABLY THE CONTEMPLATED DELISTINGTechnicolor Creative Studios’ Board of Directors which met today favorably welcomed the proposed tender offer announced today and the subsequent potential delisting of the Company. The Company signed today a tender offer agreement with the main parties initiating the draft tender offer. The Board of Directors will release an informed opinion on the terms of the Offer in due course  in light of the work of an independent expert appointed to opine on the financial terms of the Offer and  as the case may be  the mandatory squeeze-out.This delisting project also seems consistent with the low trading volumes of the Company shares on Euronext Paris and will enable the Company to minimize the costs and administrative requirements related to the regulatory framework of a listed Company on Euronext Paris.

At Accor specifically  it accounts for around 43% of the total operating waste  averaging almost 20 tons per hotel per year  as we serve 200 …,"As a major hospitality player  we are acutely aware of the challenges our industry faces when it comes to food waste. At Accor specifically  it accounts for around 43% of the total operating waste  averaging almost 20 tons per hotel per year  as we serve 200 million meals each year across our 10 000+ restaurants and bars.By closely collaborating with our hotel owners and teams  we’re working to make a real difference and foster a more sustainable food system  with the ultimate goal of drastically reducing food waste. To achieve this  our teams are focusing on a three-fold plan: measuring food waste  being creative in our culinary approach and changing habits.What Gets Measured  Gets Managed at UK’s Novotel London ExCelNovotel London ExCel is a buzzing business hub ౼ offering dining options for conferences  banquets and various large events  in addition to its in-house restaurant and bar. Given the diversity of its food and beverage outlets  the hotel decided to turn to the power of AI technology to significantly reduce food waste. Winnow  an automated AI system weighs  identifies and records every ounce of food before it is discarded by kitchen teams. This gives the hotel a clear view of what is thrown out and why. With this extensive data in hand  our chefs can see what guests really want  avoid errors and improve purchasing and production. Since the implementation of the tool in October 2022  food waste has dropped by 45% at the hotel.Culinary Creativity on Display at the Neighboring Hotels Fairmont Singapore and Swissôtel The StamfordIn the heart of downtown Singapore  among the skyscrapers and bustling streets  sits a gleaming example of culinary creativity. Fairmont Singapore and Swissôtel The Stamford collaborated with gardening experts to convert their shared herb and vegetable garden into a symbiotic aquaponics and vegetable farm ౼ where fish waste fertilizes vegetables  while the plants clean and filter the water. This urban oasis not only generates fresh  pesticides-free produce and locally grown fish  but it minimizes the supply chain’s carbon footprint. From January through August 2023  the hotels harvested more than 25 kilos of food  while in-house chefs further reduce food waste by designing menus around the seasonal harvest of vegetables and fish.Fairmont and Swissotel The Stamford  Singapore— Photo by AccorFairmont and Swissotel The Stamford  Singapore— Photo by AccorFairmont and Swissotel The Stamford  Singapore— Photo by AccorChange is Afoot at Brazil’s Pullman São Paulo Guarulhos AirportThe Pullman São Paulo Guarulhos Airport serves an astounding 43 000 meals each year in its bar-restaurant and throughout its large event spaces. Given the sheer size of its culinary operations  the hotel team decided that the best way to reduce food waste was to take a look inwards and change some of their habits. This all starts with accurate daily forecasts to enable efficient  need-based planning. In addition  during every meal  guests are invited to a live preparation station  encouraging interaction and boosting personalization  which all leads to decreasing food waste. At the end of each meal service  a nutritionist helps teams categorize leftovers ౼ selling high-quality items on the ""Food to Save"" platform and donating others to local NGOs through the ""Comida Invisível"" platform. With these new habits in place  the hotel reduced food waste by 80%.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries in 5 400 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

This sustained growth essentially resulted from the full-year effect of rents coming from the developments in 2022  rents of the warehouses delivered during the first nine months of 2023  as well as the indexation that took place on January 1  2023 (+4% on average).Significant events of the third quarter 2023Carried by a record pipeline – with total investments of €315 million for close to 270 000 sq.m of new developed surfaces for 2023 and 2024 – ARGAN has pursued its strong growth momentum.During the third quarter  our Group has thus delivered two new warehouses on PRIME locations:Montbartier (82)   close to Toulouse  by accompanying D ECATHLON with the delivery of a fourthAutOnom ®-labelled warehouse   which produces its own green energy  for a total surface of 19 000 sq.m;  close to Toulouse  by accompanying   which produces its own green energy  for a total surface of 19 000 sq.m; Mionnay (01)  in the North-East of Lyon  by delivering a total surface of 15 000 sq.m  for COVERGUARD  a leading player on the market of personal protective equipment (PPE). This warehouse  which is also AutOnom®-labelled  is made of two different cells of around 6 500 sq.m each  and one bloc for offices of 1 800 sq.m.These developments complement the one in Janneyrias (38)  close to Lyon as well  as part of a first transaction for BUT with a 38 000 sq.m platform  with a long-term 9.5-year fixed lease. Combined  the sites already delivered to this day in 2023 total a surface of close to 72 000 sq.m.Two new developments will moreover be delivered by the end of this year for a total of close to28 000 sq.m  including the extension of a cold storage warehouse for EURIAL at La Crèche (79) (for two new negative cold cells for additional 12 400 sq.m).Together  2023 projects total 100 000 sq.m in new surfaces for an overall investment of €135 million  already financed through amortizing mortgage loans that were taken out in 2022  before interest rates rose.For 2024  the very upbeat business momentum secured a development pipeline of close to €180 million for 170 000 sq.m in total. These projects comprise developments already announced  including the start of the construction of an AutOnom® site for a surface of 82 000 sq.m for Carrefour  on a former brownfield of PSA in Caen  a project led with an exemplary approach in terms of environmental standards. ARGAN also announced the construction of a distribution centre for 4 600 sq.m in Rouen for DSV  and the extension of another distribution centre in Bruguières (31) for GEODIS  thus increasing the site’s size to 13 400 sq.m.Half of investment amounts is already financed through amortizing mortgage loans and the other half should come from the sale of warehouses in 2024 or early 2025  depending on market conditions.All announced or already rolled-out initiatives this year confirm ARGAN’s leadership in France  which testifies both to our proven ability to secure PRIME locations  on a backdrop of scarcer land availability  and to a solid positioning as a trust partner to our clients  to support them along projects that are crucial for their good development.2023 targets  updated1 as part of the half-year results  are confirmed:Based on the performance in the first nine months of 2023  and taking into account an occupancy rate standing at 100% in a rental market with very little availability  ARGAN is confirming the targets that were previously updated as part of the 2023 half-year results:Indicators 2023 updated1 targets 2023 initial1targets Full-year 2022 Changevs 2022 Rental income €183m €182m €166m +10% Recurring net income €124m €124m €119m +4% Dividend per share €3.152 A minimum of €3 €3.0 +5%Financial calendar 2024 (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: 2023 Annual SalesJanuary 18: 2023 Annual ResultsMarch 21: Annual General MeetingAbout ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate. VGP operates a fully integrated business model with capabilities and longstanding expertise across the value chain.

The MRS Operations Award recognises the operations professionals who are fundamental to keeping the research and insight sector running. The winners were announced on 28.09.2023.Having a strong record of providing support to academics all over the world with their research studies  Bilendi has been involved in the TISP-Project since the beginning of 2023. TISP is a huge multi-country research project running in 68 countries in partnership with respected researchers from Harvard University and the University of Zurich.Multi-country research project covering 68 countries and 79% of the global populationWhat are the underlying reasons behind the erosion of trust in science  the prevalence and correlates of science-related populist attitudes across countries  and the consequences of this declining trust? To answer these questions  Dr. Viktoria Cologna (Harvard University) and Dr. Niels G. Mede (University of Zurich) envisioned the TISP project. The project adopted a Many Labs format  bringing together an interdisciplinary team of 240 scientists from 68 countries. The baseline survey engaged over 70 000 respondents across 68 countries  spanning all inhabited continents. Consequently  the survey encompassed 31% of the world's countries  representing a remarkable 79% of the global population.Country-specific approach and strong quality control measuresData collection occurred from November 2022 to April 2023. Samples were carefully weighted to reflect national distributions of age  gender  education level  and country size. Due to the project's global scope  data collection methods were tailored accordingly. In countries with limited internet penetration  the questionnaires were adapted to a face-to-face data collection with Computer Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI). In some markets  country-specific questions were added  for example on the response of local governments to COVID-19 and the impacts of the pandemic on people’s lives. Bilendi  provided advice on questionnaire adaptation considering country-specific legislation  language  and topic-sensitiveness  demonstrating a commitment to ethical and responsible research practices.Bilendi maintained strong quality control measures throughout fieldwork and data processing to ensure reliable data integrity. Alongside the usual thorough quality checks  a dedicated Quality Assurance Team worked with TISP project leads to conduct meticulous manual quality controls. This unwavering commitment resulted in accurate research outcomes with minimal data cleaning required in all markets.High-quality standards  academic experience and international project management capabilities were key factors for choosing Bilendi as the main data collection provider.According to the TISP Project Leads  “Bilendi was particularly suited to the project due to its professionalism  high-quality standards  academic experience  and international project management capabilities”. As part of its ISO certification  Bilendi meticulously assessed and vetted 50 distinct local providers. Bilendi assembled a team of 14 Senior Project Managers located in numerous countries to support the 69 collaborator groups. This dedicated TISP Project Management Team successfully oversaw 79 individual projects  spanning 68 countries in 18 time zones and involving 35 languages.Dr. Viktoria Cologna  main lead of the TISP Project (Harvard University  USA)  states:“Thanks to their global coverage  Bilendi helped us to collect samples across all inhabited continents  providing guidance and instruction to our global team whenever needed. The best part about working with Bilendi was the open and transparent communication with both the project managers assisting our collaborators and the executive team who oversaw the entire project. Bilendi was always open to feedback and willing to accommodate our requests expeditiously. After our successful collaboration on TISP  I am already working with Bilendi on a new project and have also recommended Bilendi to several other colleagues interested in recruiting global samples.”Marc Bidou  CEO and founder of Bilendi  states:“We are extremely proud to have been awarded with a highly commended award for the best data collection solution of the year for quantitative research. This award recognizes the work carried out by all our teams  whom I warmly congratulate on their commitment. I would like to thank Harvard University and the University of Zurich for the confidence they have shown in us by entrusting us with this ambitious global project. The great success of this project confirms our position as one of the few players capable of carrying out projects on a global scale.”Next publication: Q3 2023 sales: November 8  2023 (after market close)About BilendiAt a time when the volume  variety and speed of data transmitted and exchanged are increasing exponentially  Bilendi provides an innovative technological response to data collection  management and enhancement.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (SELECTED) Update on Canudos project (99.4 MW): confirmation of the validity of the construction permits by Brazilian federal court Voltalia announces today that the Brazilian federal court of appeals overturned the preliminary decision that had suspended the Canudos project's permits last april5 . Voltalia has the authorization to finalize the works  carry out the commissioning and start the operation of the wind farms. In parallel with the resumption of operations  Voltalia will present a complementary environmental study and arrange a public hearing with local communities within 6 months. The Public Prosecutor will have the possibility to make an appeal to this second instance decision within a limited time period (30 business day after being intimated of this decision). First megawatt-hours for the SSM3-6 solar power plant in Brazil 6 SSM3-6 is part of the Serra Branca cluster  the largest wind and solar cluster in the world  developed entirely by Voltalia. The cluster generates some of the most competitive energy in the country  with exceptional levels of wind and sunshine as complementary energy sources. Out of a total of 260 MW  17 MW came on stream in June and a further 83 MW since the beginning of July. The rest will gradually be brought on stream over the coming months. The plant is backed by a 14-year electricity sales contract with Copel  a Brazilian utility and long-standing partner of Voltalia. In French Guiana  commissioning of a combined solar and storage power plant 7 Voltalia has commissioned its Sable Blanc power plant  combining photovoltaic generation  with a capacity of 5 MW  and battery storage  with a capacity of 10.6 MWh. Developed entirely by Voltalia  the mixed power plant will benefit from a guaranteed sales tariff for 20 years. The lithium-ion batteries will enable the electricity produced during the day to be injected after night fall  while improving the stability of electricity production in a region with high demand. SNCF Energie signs a new wind energy supply contract with Voltalia 8 The contract covers production at a wind farm in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of France. The contract is for a period of 25 years. The wind farm  called Rives Charentaises  has a total installed capacity of 37.4 MW  and will produce around 78 GWh a year  or 1.4% of SNCF Voyageurs' traction electricity consumption. The plant is scheduled to be commissioned in the first half of 2024. Helexia wins a new 90 MW contract in Brazil 9 The 20-year agreement between Helexia and Comerc Energia  a leading provider of energy management solutions in Brazil  covers the supply of up to 90 MW of photovoltaic solar power spread across a series of distributed generation projects. They will be built progressively in the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso do Sul  Ceará and Pernambuco.

Its mission was quite simply to rescue French art by generating an environment more conducive to the emergence of French artists in what was then a very delicate context for the French Contemporary art market.[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/10/image1-artists-bertille-bak-massinissa-selmani-bouchra-khalili-tarik-kiswanson-copyright-julie-ansiau.jpg ]From left to right in the photo: Bertille Bak  Massinissa Selmani  Bouchra Khalili  Tarik Kiswanson.Photo ©Julie Ansiau[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/10/image2-top-10-works-sold-at-auction-by-the-winners-of-the-marcel-duchamp-prize-copyright-artprice-com.jpg ]Top 10 works sold at auction by the winners of the Marcel Duchamp Prize ©artprice.com“For over two decades  the Marcel Duchamp Prize has become an essential reference in the world of Contemporary art  but beyond the prestige of the prize itself  the ADIAF plays a pivotal role in elevating the French art scene on a global scale and providing vital support for French artistic expression.” thierry EhrmannEvery year  the Marcel Duchamp Prize highlights French artists or artists working in France during the FIAC  now Paris+ by Art Basel. Since 2016  the finalists have been given a substantial spotlight (often their first) at a strategic moment in the international Contemporary Art calendar: their works are shown at the Pompidou Center for three months in an exhibition area of 650 m2 (previously  they were exhibited at the FIAC and only the winner benefited from an exhibition at the Center Pompidou). This exposure in one of France's top museums is already a major boost for their careers  but the ADIAF also deploys other strategies to promote young hopefuls from the French scene on the international stage.The impact of the Duchamp PrizeOn top of a substantial financial reward for the finalists (90 000 euros  including a prize of 35 000 euros for the winner)  the winner also benefits from a research residency in the United States at the Villa Albertine. Indeed  beyond the allocation of a prize and the one-off exhibition  the Marcel Duchamp Prize aims to be a complete system of support for artists in their careers. The idea is to promote the French art scene in the world via international exhibitions organized in partnership with foreign museums and with the support of the Institut Français. More than 50 Marcel Duchamp Prize artists and 140 major works have benefited from visibility during some 20 exhibitions organized in major museums around the world  in Buenos Aires  Beijing  Shanghai  Los Angeles  Seoul  and Berlin  among other places. The professional networks established with the Marcel Duchamp Prize can constitute important springboards. This represents invaluable support because while obtaining a Prize always constitutes a positive argument in the career of an artist by boosting his/her legitimacy  it is above all the meetings with collectors and the exhibitions generated as a result that will increase  in the long term  the artist's notoriety and market prices.Prize recipients: whats it worth?It is difficult to assess the immediate impact of winning the Marcel Duchamp Prize on the artists' market prices. Although it is clear that obtaining such an award does indeed sharpen the interest of collectors  the galleries are the first beneficiaries of this momentum  since the Prize does not necessarily trigger an acceleration of transactions on the auction market (which is essentially a ‘secondary' market).Among the big names who have received the Marcel Duchamp Prize in the past  Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster  Laurent Grasso  Tatiana Trouvé  Mircea Cantor  and Kader Attia  have established themselves as artists of international quality and are sought after by major collectors. However  the auction market does not always reflect the quality of their careers or of their works.While the works of Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster (2002 winner)  for example  have been acquired by several major museums including the Tate Modern (London)  the Dia Art Foundation (New York)  and the Pompidou Center in (Paris)  her works are extremely rare in at auction; and when they are presented  they are not necessarily indicative of the artist's interdisciplinary practice  which encompasses cinema  installation  video and various forms of collaborative work. Her auction record of $23 410 in a Christie's sale in London (Multiverse  2004-2012) has not been renewed since 2012 – more than ten years ago – a significant amount of time in the dynamics of the Contemporary art market. Indeed  some winners like Clement Cogitore (2018 winner) have never seen their works offered at auction  or have not yet found their audience in the art market  like Julien Prévieux (2014 winner).Other artists  when supported by particularly powerful international galleries  enjoy more sustained auction activity. This is the case of Tatiana Found (supported by the Perrotin  Paris; the Gagosian  New York and Johann König  Berlin)  Cyprien Gaillard (supported by Gladstone  New York and Sprüth Magers  Berlin)  Laurent Grasso (supported by Perrotin  Paris and Sean Kelly  New York) or even Latifa Echakhch (supported by Kamel Mennour  Paris; Kaufmann Repetto  Milan; Dvir Gallery  Tel Aviv and Eva Presenhuber  Zurich)  all ranked in the 10 000 top-selling artists at global auctions.Tatiana Found (2007 winner) and Latifa Echakhch (2013 winner) have both already ranked among the 5 000 top-selling artists on the global market and have in common auction records dating back to 2015. Tatiana Found's installation Untitled (ref: cable 9) sold for $67 000 at Phillips in London  and  a few months later  a painting by Latifa Echakhch fetched $203 300 at the same auctioneer after being part of the collection of Dr. Frederic S. Brandt in Miami. The young Latifa Echakhch  today sought after by international collectors  has been crowned by eight auction results above $100 000.Other winners have sold above this price level  a significant and rare level for young French artists indeed. They include Cyprien Gaillard (2010 winner) whose peak currently stands at $193 750. Again  his record also dates back to 2015 (like those of Tatiana Trouvé and Latifa Echakhch)  but Cyprien Gaillard's was hammered at Sotheby's New York and not in London.Kader Attia (2016 winner) also distinguished himself by the sale of two installations for over $100 000 before obtaining his Duchamp Prize in 2016  the only prize with which he had been honored until then. Thomas Hirschhorn (2000 winner) has an auction record of $156 190 following the sale in 2006 of a large mixed-technique entitled Abstract Relief No.548 (1999) at Phillips de Pury & Company in London. His first works went to auction in 2001  a few months after winning the Duchamp Prize  and his demand has become global with 76% of his turnover being hammered in the United States.Award-winning artists accessible on the auction marketMany of these French artists  whose talent has been confirmed by winning the Duchamp Prize  have works that are accessible for under $5 000 at auction. This is the case for Carole Benzaken (2004 winner)  whose biggest paintings exceed $15 000; Thomas Hirschhorn (2000 winner)  62% of whose works sell between $1 000 and $5 000; Matthew Mercier (2003 winner)  half of whose works sell for between $1 000 and $5 000 at auction. Likewise for Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige (2017 winners)  whose politically motivated works – attempting to reveal history's underbelly and question the standard representation of conflicts – have been exhibited at several art biennials and in museums as important as the Solomon R. Guggenheim (New York) and the British Museum (London). They have also been integrated into several large private and public collections  but still remain affordable at auction.It is clear that solid international recognition does not always have a major impact on the auction market. Informed collectors deal directly with galleries and the prices of artists evolve confidentially  especially for works that are often transversal  atypical and do not necessarily conform to trends in global demand.The winners of the Marcel Duchamp PrizeThomas Hirschhorn (2000 - 2001)Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster (2002)Matthew Mercier (2003)Carole Benzaken (2004)Claude Closky (2005)Philippe Mayaux (2006)Tatiana Trouvé (2007)Laurent Grasso (2008)Saâdane Afif (2009)Cyprien Gaillard (2010)Mircea Cantor (2011)Daniel Dewar and Grégory Gicquel (2012)Latifa Echakhch (2013)Julien Prévieux (2014)Melik Ohanian (2015)Kader Attia (2016)Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige (2017)Clément Cogitore (2018)Eric Baudelaire (2019)Kapwani Kiwanga (2020)Lili Reynaud Dewar (2021)Mimosa Echard (2022)The nominees for the 2023 Marcel Duchamp PrizeClaude Bonnin  President of ADIAF  will reveal the name of the winner on 16 October following the vote of an international jury composed of Xavier Rey  Director of the National Museum of Modern Art (Pompidou Center)  Claude Bonnin  collector and President of the ADIAF  Akemi Shiraha  representative of the Marcel Duchamp Association  Dr. Jimena Blasquez Abascal  collector and Director of the Montenmedio Contemporary Foundation (Spain)  Josée Gensollen  collector of the Gensollen La Fabrique Collection in Marseille  Béatrice Salmon  director of the National Center for Visual Arts (CNAP) and Adam D.

It was created by collector Gilles Fuchs (amongst others) in response to a very clear shrinkage of the influence of French artists at the international level in the 1990s. Its mission was quite simply to rescue French art by generating an environment more conducive to the emergence of French artists in what was then a very delicate context for the French Contemporary art market.From left to right in the photo: Bertille Bak  Massinissa Selmani  Bouchra Khalili  Tarik Kiswanson. Photo © julie ansiau Top 10 works sold at auction by the winners of the Marcel Duchamp Prize ©artprice.com""For over two decades  the Marcel Duchamp Prize has become an essential reference in the world of Contemporary art  but beyond the prestige of the prize itself  the ADIAF plays a pivotal role in elevating the French art scene on a global scale and providing vital support for French artistic expression."" thierry EhrmannEvery year  the Marcel Duchamp Prize highlights French artists or artists working in France during the FIAC  now Paris+ by Art Basel. Since 2016  the finalists have been given a substantial spotlight (often their first) at a strategic moment in the international Contemporary Art calendar: their works are shown at the Pompidou Center for three months in an exhibition area of 650 m2 (previously  they were exhibited at the FIAC and only the winner benefited from an exhibition at the Center Pompidou). This exposure in one of France's top museums is already a major boost for their careers  but the ADIAF also deploys other strategies to promote young hopefuls from the French scene on the international stage.The impact of the Duchamp PrizeOn top of a substantial financial reward for the finalists (90 000 euros  including a prize of 35 000 euros for the winner)  the winner also benefits from a research residency in the United States at the Villa Albertine. Indeed  beyond the allocation of a prize and the one-off exhibition  the Marcel Duchamp Prize aims to be a complete system of support for artists in their careers. The idea is to promote the French art scene in the world via international exhibitions organized in partnership with foreign museums and with the support of the Institut Français. More than 50 Marcel Duchamp Prize artists and 140 major works have benefited from visibility during some 20 exhibitions organized in major museums around the world  in Buenos Aires  Beijing  Shanghai  Los Angeles  Seoul  and Berlin  among other places. The professional networks established with the Marcel Duchamp Prize can constitute important springboards. This represents invaluable support because while obtaining a Prize always constitutes a positive argument in the career of an artist by boosting his/her legitimacy  it is above all the meetings with collectors and the exhibitions generated as a result that will increase  in the long term  the artist's notoriety and market prices.Prize recipients: whats it worth?It is difficult to assess the immediate impact of winning the Marcel Duchamp Prize on the artists' market prices. Although it is clear that obtaining such an award does indeed sharpen the interest of collectors  the galleries are the first beneficiaries of this momentum  since the Prize does not necessarily trigger an acceleration of transactions on the auction market (which is essentially a 'secondary' market).Among the big names who have received the Marcel Duchamp Prize in the past  Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster  Laurent Grasso  Tatiana Trouvé  Mircea Cantor  and Kader Attia  have established themselves as artists of international quality and are sought after by major collectors. However  the auction market does not always reflect the quality of their careers or of their works.While the works of Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster (2002 winner)  for example  have been acquired by several major museums including the Tate Modern (London)  the Dia Art Foundation (New York)  and the Pompidou Center in (Paris)  her works are extremely rare in at auction; and when they are presented  they are not necessarily indicative of the artist's interdisciplinary practice  which encompasses cinema  installation  video and various forms of collaborative work. Her auction record of $23 410 in a Christie's sale in London (Multiverse  2004-2012) has not been renewed since 2012 – more than ten years ago – a significant amount of time in the dynamics of the Contemporary art market. Indeed  some winners like Clement Cogitore (2018 winner) have never seen their works offered at auction  or have not yet found their audience in the art market  like Julien Prévieux (2014 winner).Other artists  when supported by particularly powerful international galleries  enjoy more sustained auction activity. This is the case of Tatiana Found (supported by the Perrotin  Paris; the Gagosian  New York and Johann König  Berlin)  Cyprien Gaillard (supported by Gladstone  New York and Sprüth Magers  Berlin)  Laurent Grasso (supported by Perrotin  Paris and Sean Kelly  New York) or even Latifa Echakhch (supported by Kamel Mennour  Paris; Kaufmann Repetto  Milan; Dvir Gallery  Tel Aviv and Eva Presenhuber  Zurich)  all ranked in the 10 000 top-selling artists at global auctions.Tatiana Found (2007 winner) and Latifa Echakhch (2013 winner) have both already ranked among the 5 000 top-selling artists on the global market and have in common auction records dating back to 2015. Tatiana Found's installation Untitled (ref: cable 9) sold for $67 000 at Phillips in London  and  a few months later  a painting by Latifa Echakhch fetched $203 300 at the same auctioneer after being part of the collection of Dr. Frederic S. Brandt in Miami. The young Latifa Echakhch  today sought after by international collectors  has been crowned by eight auction results above $100 000.Other winners have sold above this price level  a significant and rare level for young French artists indeed. They include Cyprien Gaillard (2010 winner) whose peak currently stands at $193 750. Again  his record also dates back to 2015 (like those of Tatiana Trouvé and Latifa Echakhch)  but Cyprien Gaillard's was hammered at Sotheby's New York and not in London.Kader Attia (2016 winner) also distinguished himself by the sale of two installations for over $100 000 before obtaining his Duchamp Prize in 2016  the only prize with which he had been honored until then. Thomas Hirschhorn (2000 winner) has an auction record of $156 190 following the sale in 2006 of a large mixed-technique entitled Abstract Relief No.548 (1999) at Phillips de Pury & Company in London. His first works went to auction in 2001  a few months after winning the Duchamp Prize  and his demand has become global with 76% of his turnover being hammered in the United States.Award-winning artists accessible on the auction marketMany of these French artists  whose talent has been confirmed by winning the Duchamp Prize  have works that are accessible for under $5 000 at auction. This is the case for Carole Benzaken (2004 winner)  whose biggest paintings exceed $15 000; Thomas Hirschhorn (2000 winner)  62% of whose works sell between $1 000 and $5 000; Matthew Mercier (2003 winner)  half of whose works sell for between $1 000 and $5 000 at auction. Likewise for Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige (2017 winners)  whose politically motivated works – attempting to reveal history's underbelly and question the standard representation of conflicts – have been exhibited at several art biennials and in museums as important as the Solomon R. Guggenheim (New York) and the British Museum (London). They have also been integrated into several large private and public collections  but still remain affordable at auction.It is clear that solid international recognition does not always have a major impact on the auction market. Informed collectors deal directly with galleries and the prices of artists evolve confidentially  especially for works that are often transversal  atypical and do not necessarily conform to trends in global demand.The winners of the Marcel Duchamp PrizeThomas Hirschhorn (2000 - 2001)Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster (2002)Matthew Mercier (2003)Carole Benzaken (2004)Claude Closky (2005)Philippe Mayaux (2006)Tatiana Trouvé (2007)Laurent Grasso (2008)Saâdane Afif (2009)Cyprien Gaillard (2010)Mircea Cantor (2011)Daniel Dewar and Grégory Gicquel (2012)Latifa Echakhch (2013)Julien Prévieux (2014)Melik Ohanian (2015)Kader Attia (2016)Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige (2017)Clément Cogitore (2018)Eric Baudelaire (2019)Kapwani Kiwanga (2020)Lili Reynaud Dewar (2021)Mimosa Echard (2022)The nominees for the 2023 Marcel Duchamp PrizeClaude Bonnin  President of ADIAF  will reveal the name of the winner on 16 October following the vote of an international jury composed of Xavier Rey  Director of the National Museum of Modern Art (Pompidou Center)  Claude Bonnin  collector and President of the ADIAF  Akemi Shiraha  representative of the Marcel Duchamp Association  Dr. Jimena Blasquez Abascal  collector and Director of the Montenmedio Contemporary Foundation (Spain)  Josée Gensollen  collector of the Gensollen La Fabrique Collection in Marseille  Béatrice Salmon  director of the National Center for Visual Arts (CNAP) and Adam D.
