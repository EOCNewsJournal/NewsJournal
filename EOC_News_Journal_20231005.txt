The acquisition will add 15 new jobs.In addition  AIB’s eight-strong equity capital team led by Finlay McFadyen will join Goodbody as part of this strategic review. That team manages two private equity strategies for AIB  investing the bank’s capital indirectly through venture capital and private equity funds and directly by taking minority stakes in companies. It will now become part of Goodbody.The job cuts will see around 20 of the 100 roles in the existing investment bank (IB) section go. Overall  Goodbody employs around 350 people.The company said the aim is to create a focused investment bank that ensures continuity of service and support for its core client base through deep sector expertise in the consumer  industrial  financials (and economics) and growth sectors.“Reflecting the unprecedented set of challenges currently faced by investment banks globally  we are taking decisive actions to strengthen our business and position ourselves for long-term success ” said Goodbody CEO Martin Tormey.“While we regret the impact this decision will have on our affected employees  we believe these measures are necessary to align our resources with our strategic priorities.”Goodbody rival Davy  owed by Bank of Ireland  has cut a similar number of jobs in Dublin and London  including in its capital markets arm. It too has beefed up in ESG advisory.Davy has a significantly larger number of employees than Goodbody at around 900.Davy was sold to Bank of Ireland in a deal worth €427m.That deal was triggered in 2020 when the Central Bank fined Davy €4.13m for breaching conflict of interest rules on a major bond transaction related to a heavily discounted deal to sell €27m in Anglo Irish Bank bonds.In the aftermath of the bond scandal revelations  Davy ended up being re-acquired by former owner Bank of Ireland.AIB bought back Goodbody for €138m having previously sold it after the financial crash.,positive,0.81,0.15,0.03,negative,0.02,0.14,0.85,True,English,"['banking jobs', 'Goodbody', 'focus', 'ESG', 'two private equity strategies', 'Anglo Irish Bank bonds', 'Goodbody CEO Martin Tormey', 'eight-strong equity capital team', 'private equity funds', 'core client base', 'deep sector expertise', 'major bond transaction', 'bond scandal revelations', 'investment banking arm', 'potential growth area', 'capital markets arm', 'ESG) advisory consultancy', 'existing investment bank', 'focused investment bank', 'Goodbody rival Davy', 'ESG advisory', 'investment banks', 'venture capital', 'growth sectors', 'strategic refocus', 'wider move', 'Clearstream Solutions', 'Finlay McFadyen', 'strategic review', 'minority stakes', 'job cuts', 'IB) section', 'industrial, financials', 'unprecedented set', 'decisive actions', 'long-term success', 'strategic priorities', 'similar number', 'larger number', 'Central Bank', 'interest rules', 'former owner', 'financial crash', 'affected employees', '15 new jobs', 'stockbroker', 'AIB', 'part', 'staff', 'acquisition', 'social', 'governance', 'business', 'addition', 'companies', '100 roles', '350 people', 'company', 'aim', 'continuity', 'service', 'support', 'economics', 'challenges', 'impact', 'decision', 'measures', 'resources', 'Ireland', 'Dublin', 'London', 'deal', 'conflict', 'aftermath']",2023-10-04,2023-10-05,independent.ie

Dalata has also completed the transaction to enter the hotel market in the Netherlands with the acquisition of the leasehold interest in Hard Rock Hotel Amsterdam American  as announced on 21 September 2023.Development Site - St. Andrew’s Square  EdinburghThe development site  which is superbly located fronting on to St. Andrew’s Square  one of the most prestigious areas in Edinburgh and within close proximity to the city’s key corporate and leisure demand drivers  was acquired for a total consideration of £12.5 million  from Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited. The consideration was paid from Dalata’s existing cash and banking facilities.The site includes a Category A listed building which is currently vacant and approved for office use  with planning permission granted for an extension to both the rooftop and rear of the property. The Group plans to submit a revised planning application in Q1 next year  enabling the construction of a new 4-star Clayton Hotel  which is expected to be completed by mid-2026. The Group’s hotel scheme is designed to work within the new building envelope permitted under the existing planning permission. Subject to a successful revised planning application the hotel will incorporate 153 bedrooms  a bar  restaurant  dry gym and two large meeting rooms with stunning period features on the first floor overlooking St. Andrew’s Square.The overall investment in the project  including the site purchase  will be circa £48 million  creating circa 60 new employee positions when the hotel is operational.The new hotel  as part of our sustainability strategy  will be one of our first to be designed to operate with zero on-site carbon emissions. As a conversion scheme  it will also have considerably lower embodied carbon than a new build.Clayton Hotel Amsterdam AmericanFurther to the announcement of 21 September 2023  Dalata has completed the acquisition of a leasehold interest in Hard Rock Hotel Amsterdam American. Pursuant to the transaction  Dalata has acquired the entire issued share capital of American Hotel Exploitatie BV  which holds the operating leasehold  for a total consideration of €29.5 million from Zien Group. The consideration will also be financed from Dalata’s existing cash and banking facilities.The 4-star hotel  which is owned by Deka Immobilien  is centrally located in Amsterdam on the corner of Leidsekade Canal and Leidseplein Square  Amsterdam’s central district of culture and entertainment. The hotel consists of 173 bedrooms  ground floor lobby  Café and Bar. Renowned for its iconic Café and Bar Americain  this landmark hotel has undergone a €14.5 million renovation since 2020.The hotel is being rebranded to Clayton Hotel Amsterdam American and Dalata will invest approximately €4.5 million to enhance the property over the coming years. Included within these enhancements is a substantial investment in its sustainability credentials  which will result in a significant reduction in the carbon footprint of the property. The hotel with an expectation of stabilised annual earnings of circa €5 million  will be Dalata’s first hotel in Amsterdam and second hotel in continental Europe.Today is an important day for the Dalata team as we announce two significant developments for the Group. Edinburgh has long been a target city for us to locate our brands and we are delighted to have secured such a prestigious building in the centre of the city. This will be our third hotel in Scotland. We are also delighted to have secured our first Clayton hotel in Amsterdam. The American Hotel has a renowned reputation in the city and we will continue to protect and enhance that with our Clayton brand. I offer an especially warm welcome to the hotel staff today  as they join the wider Dalata family. In the year to date  we have announced four new opportunities in three of the strongest city hotel markets in Europe - London  Amsterdam and Edinburgh. We will continue to seek out further opportunities in our target markets. Dermot Crowley  CEO  DalataEdinburgh is one of the top performing hotel markets in Europe and we are delighted to secure a development site in such a prestigious location. Our development team has extensive experience and history in delivering complex projects  we look forward to collaborating with Edinburgh authorities  to deliver a flagship Clayton hotel with zero onsite operational carbon by mid-2026.Additionally  Amsterdam has been a priority location for Dalata since we commenced our journey into continental Europe. To have acquired such an attractive existing hotel  in a city which has traditionally high barriers of entry  is a testament to our standing in the market and a credit to all involved across the Group.

On 29 September 2023  Brétéché  a fuel distributor that operates in six French departments  inaugurated its first hydrogen station in Maché (Vendée)  on the Challans to La Roche-sur-Yon road axis. The station has been designed with a high hydrogen supply capacity.Brétéché opens Vendée's first privately-owned hydrogen station in MachéLast Friday  Brétéché inaugurated the Maché hydrogen refuelling station at its existing site at the Bel-Air business park. This station now offers green hydrogen with a refuelling capacity of up to 800 kilograms per day. With this station located on the Challans to La Roche-Sur-Yon route  Brétéché is targeting commercial customers with high-volume hydrogen needs  such as heavy goods and utility vehicles. It is one of the largest capacity green hydrogen refuelling hubs in France.Thanks to a partnership with Lhyfe  the Vendée station is supplied with green and renewable hydrogen produced just forty kilometres away in Bouin  at the Lhyfe Pays de la Loire site  using wind-generated electricity and sea water.This site is a first milestone for the distributor which aims to develop a hydrogen ecosystem in conjunction with Lhyfe and open other refuelling stations in other departments  near Lhyfe's future production plants.Lhyfe plans to increase the production capacity of the Lhyfe Pays de la Loire site  in BouinAs for Lhyfe  during the presentation of its half-year results on 27 September 2023  it confirmed that it is to ramp up the Lhyfe Pays de la Loire site in order to meet growing demand from existing customers and new customers like Brétéché.Lhyfe plans to increase the production capacity of this site for 2024. With a current installed capacity of 1 MW  which represents a production capacity of up to 300 kilograms of green hydrogen a day  Lhyfe Pays de la Loire already delivers customers such as the multi-energy service stations of La Roche sur Yon  Les Sables d'Olonne and Le Mans and the Lidl logistics centre in Carquefou. This production capacity will be boosted up to a tonne of green hydrogen a day during 2024  giving an installed capacity of 2.5 MW.Eric Hidier  CEO Brétéché: “Our world is undergoing dramatic changes which require us to reassess our manners of producing and consuming for the years to come. We will need to be prepared to work differently  protecting resources and the environment. At Brétéché  we are convinced that the only long-term decarbonisation solution  with a short supply chain and zero emissions  is decarbonised hydrogen. We are proud to be playing a pioneering role in this ecological transition.”Matthieu Guesné  Founder and CEO of Lhyfe: “We welcome the initiative of Brétéché  which is leading the way in renewable hydrogen distribution. We need other players like them that are action-oriented  with a strong business culture  and aware of the need to change and change fast  and to unite mobility players around hydrogen. This first privately-owned station strengthens the dynamics of the Vendée hydrogen ecosystem.”For an interview with the spokespersons above  please contact the press department.Click to access the Lhyfe Media Kit (press kit and visuals)About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

The government will provide €16.4 million of non-dilutive funding in the form of a subsidy (60%) and a repayable advance (40%).

This currently limits the Group's visibility on its sales level at the end of 2023. In particular  the Group expects significant orders or deliveries of micro-UAV equipment to be postponed until the 1st half of 2024. At the end of the 1st half of 2023  Parrot continued to expect orders to be confirmed and delivered in 2023  generating sales growth compared with 2022. At this stage  the Group estimates that it will be able to achieve consolidated sales of at least €60 million in 2023  compared with €71.9 million in 2022  representing a decline of around 16%  taking into account the Group's two main activities (photogrammetry solutions and microdrones).During the 2nd quarter  the Group implemented a series of measures to reduce its cash consumption. It should also be noted that consolidated sales for Q3 2022 at €21.6m represented 30% of sales for 2022  and included significant deliveries to defense and security institutions.For reference  the press release on sales and earnings for the 1st half of 2023  which details the Group's strategy and environment  is available here.Next financial date2023 third-quarter revenues: Thursday November 16  2023ABOUT THE PARROT GROUPParrot is Europe's leading commercial microUAV group.

In the ambitious context of the holistic protection of critical infrastructures  the ResilMesh project will develop a set of innovative tools for the realisation of a Security Orchestration and Analytics Platform Architecture (SOAPA) based on the concept of cybesecurity awareness to improve the resilience of digital infrastructures through the achievement of several objectives:Improve end-to-end data aggregation and interoperability of security controls in distributed digital infrastructures;Provide Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) with a better awareness of the interdependencies between services and resources in managed and monitored infrastructure networks;Helping CSIRTs develop cyber resilience capabilities;Develop Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms and tools for early and continuous detection and prediction of cyber attacks;Develop a situation assessment system to visualise and predict risk at network level.ResilMesh will define the proposed architecture by combining existing security controls and tools provided by the participating consortium with already available Open Source elements  developing algorithms and software tools to improve the detection and prediction of infrastructure attacks. The project will validate the functioning of the proposed innovations through 3 use cases in different categories of infrastructures (SCADA for monitoring renewables  robotics for smart manufacturing and regional civil infrastructures) and 5 use cases to be defined through Open Calls. The total of 8 planned pilot projects will ensure that the platform will be evaluated on a wide range of critical infrastructures and in different application areas. In the context of the project  algoWatt  as a provider of Operation & Maintenance (O&M) services for photovoltaic plants (via the PAM platform https://algowatt.com/er-pam/)  contributes to the validation activities with a significant use case dealing with the integration of several complementary technologies (PV plants  inverters  SCADA  telecommunication protocols  etc.). The objectives of the experimentation will be 1) to test a distributed approach to cybersecurity awareness involving the operators of renewable and O&M services (including systems and resources  with a holistic view of the hierarchy and their interdependencies) and 2) to detect and predict anomalies and cyber attacks in renewable O&M services based on the use of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Operational Technology (OT). algoWatt will make its industrial expertise available to the Consortium as a Digital Energy solution provider & system integrator  offering the innovations proposed by the project a hybrid IT/OT test bed in an application context of significant economic and social impact such as the resilience of the energy system linked to production from renewable sources (in particular  PV plants).

Applications will include training large foundation models for generative AI  simulations for developing advanced materials  creating digital twins of the human heart or brain for medical purposes  validating quantum computers  and high-resolution simulations of climate that encompass the entire Earth system.Based on Eviden’s BullSequana XH3000 direct liquid cooled architecture  JUPITER will have three times the computing capability of Europe’s current most powerful supercomputer  and will provide the equivalent power of 10 million modern desktop computers. The overall system will require the space of about 4 tennis courts and will use over 260km of high-performance cabling  allowing it to move over 2 000 Tb per second  the equivalent of 11 800 full copies of Wikipedia every second.It will be composed of two partitions  a highly scalable GPU accelerated Booster Module and a general-purpose Cluster Module with high memory bandwidth processors. The Booster Module will utilize next-generation NVIDIA data center technology and the Cluster Module will be based on SiPearl Rhea1  the first HPC-dedicated European processor on the market.More details and specifics about the system will be announced in November at this year’s SC23 conference.Emmanuel Le Roux  Group SVP  Global Head of HPC  AI & Quantum at Eviden  Atos Group said “Providing the first Exascale supercomputer in Europe  based on our BullSequana XH3000  is a moment of true pride for our teams. For as long as we have been providing computing technologies  we have been supporting European countries in their journey to economic and industrial sovereignty. The European scientific community will now benefit from a remarkable ‘made in Europe’ machine to tackle scientific challenges and stimulate innovation.”Bernhard Frohwitter  CEO of ParTec AG said “The dynamic Modular System Architecture (dMSA) approach developed under the lead of the Jülich Supercomputing Centre and ParTec with the participation of several European partners and patented by ParTec is a novel system design in high-performance computing and makes a crucial contribution to providing the required speed and efficiency for sophisticated AI algorithms. The contract awarded to ParTec AG and its long-standing partner Eviden not only underlines the competitiveness and performance of German and European suppliers in building supercomputers  it is also a decisive step towards Europe's technological sovereignty.”Ian Buck  Vice President of Hyperscale and HPC at NVIDIA said “NVIDIA is collaborating with Eviden and with the EuroHPC JU and the European scientific community on JUPITER to provide researchers with the state-of-the-art AI and HPC resources they need to power the next wave of breakthroughs in areas such as climate and weather  material science  drug discovery  industrial engineering  and quantum computing technologies. By bringing the power of NVIDIA’s accelerated computing to the first exascale supercomputer in Europe  we are helping chart new paths of research and scientific discovery not just in Europe  but the world.”Philippe Notton  CEO and Founder of SiPearl  said “We are thrilled that Rhea1  our energy-efficient HPC-dedicated microprocessor  will fuel part of Europe’s first Exascale supercomputer. This validates EuroHPC’s vision in creating the European Processor Initiative consortium  which incubated SiPearl. We look forward to working with Jülich  Eviden and ParTec in bringing the groundbreaking Jupiter system to life. Together  we will contribute to European technological sovereignty while dramatically reducing the carbon footprint of supercomputing and Artificial Intelligence.”***About Eviden1Eviden is a next-gen technology leader in data-driven  trusted and sustainable digital transformation with a strong portfolio of patented technologies.

Clinicians rely upon medical librarians for trusted clinical content and as the data grows  so do the demands of the job. To examine the daunting challenges that medical librarians face while avoiding burnout  Wolters Kluwer Health and the Medical Library Association (MLA) will host a lively online discussion titled  “Doing more while avoiding burn-out: Helping medical librarians balance emerging demands ” today  October 4th  at 1:00 pm ET.“Librarians are a critical part of healthcare  ensuring care teams have access to the most current information to help treat their patients ” said Julie Frey  Head of Product  Provider  Wolters Kluwer Health. “As the demand for and volume of information grows  it is important to understand the unique needs of medical librarians. This webinar will provide insights into their evolving role in empowering clinicians and patients while avoiding burnout and helping to mitigate it for colleagues.”Librarians saw dramatic changes that impacted the volume and quality of medical information during the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency. Incorrect or misleading information about the virus and vaccines spread quickly over social media. The rise in virtual care and the use of retail clinics created new channels for people to seek treatment in an already busy system as well as new demands for information. And new technologies such as generative AI offer new challenges in light of reports of healthcare information being fabricated by generative AI.This distinguished group of panelists that will discuss the oversight  guidance  and support needed for librarians includes:(Moderator) Michelle Kraft  AHIP  FMLA  Director of Library Services  Cleveland Clinic Floyd D. Loop Alumni LibraryBeverly Murphy  MLS  Asst. Director  Communications and Web Content  Hospital Nursing Liaison  Duke University Medical CenterBridget Jivanelli  MLIS  AHIP Medical Librarian  Kim Barrett Memorial Library  HSS Education InstituteGail Kouame  MLIS  Director  Charles M. Baugh Biomedical Library  University of South AlabamaTopics to be discussed during this webinar include:Exploring typical causes of burnout across the medical librarian community  and steps to take to mitigate or prevent it.Understanding the potential and risk of new information resources  and how librarians can support the institutions and clinicians who may want to use these innovative technologies.The consideration of emerging trends in medical librarianship  such as artificial intelligence  data analytics  and personalized information services  and the evolution of the profession.Developing best practices to reinforce the key role medical librarians play in managing medical information—and identifying activities that cross those boundaries or intersect with other functions.Summarizing current initiatives that librarians are undertaking to demonstrate their value across critical performance dimensions such as reducing costs  improving care quality  increasing patient safety and regulatory compliance  and expediting paths to accreditation.Attendees can register for this webinar here.Wolters Kluwer Health provides trusted clinical technology and evidence-based solutions that engage clinicians  patients  researchers  and students in effective decision-making and outcomes across healthcare.

Oct. 04  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced the final readout on primary endpoints from Study 102 Dose Expansion—the expansion part of a Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion study evaluating potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3 for patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer (Study 102). The results were presented by Principal Investigator Professor Christophe Le Tourneau in an oral presentation at the 65th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO). Additionally  the abstract was selected for inclusion in a scientific highlight session on head and neck cancer and the final results were selected for discussion in a scientific discussion on augmenting the potential of radiation therapy (RT) with novel therapeutics and imaging.This oral presentation at ASTRO will be followed by a conference call on Thursday  October 5  2023  at 8:00 AM EDT / 2:00 PM CEST. During the call  Laurent Levy  chief executive officer  will review the Study 102 final data before taking questions from participants.Study BackgroundSurgery or definitive cisplatin-based chemotherapy are the current standard of care for patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC; head and neck cancer). One third of these patients  however  cannot tolerate cisplatin due to complications such as age-related frailty or other medical conditions (comorbidities). Combined with the fact that 20-30% of patients with LA-HNSCC have a high burden of comorbidity1  and 30% of patients with LA-HNSCC are over the age of 70  this patient population presents a significant unmet need for new therapies that offer tolerable safety and the potential for improved local control.“The hypothesis we sought to evaluate in Study 102 was that novel radioenhancer NBTXR3—as a single intratumoral injection procedure  that does not interact directly with other drugs  and could potentially improve locoregional control of the primary tumor without adding harmful side effects for elderly patients with head and neck cancer—may provide a promising new therapeutic option ” said Professor Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  principal investigator for Study 102. “The favorable safety profile we have seen throughout the study  along with what we believe is meaningful efficacy  reinforce my confidence in the potential of NBTXR3 for these patients.”ABSTRACT #55360: Novel Radioenhancer NBTXR3 Activated by Radiotherapy in Cisplatin-ineligible Locally Advanced HNSCC Patients: Final Results of a Phase 1 TrialChristophe Le Tourneau  Zoltán Takacsi-Nagy  Laetitia Finzi  Xavier Liem  Valentin Calugaru  Victor Moreno  Emiliano Calvo  Sébastien Salas  Bernard Doger  Antoine Dubray-Vautrin  Xavier Mirabel  Nathalie Badois  Anne Chilles  Nicolas Fakhry  Stéphanie Wong Hee Kam  Laetitia Houdas  Anais Debard  Omar I. Vivar  Leonard A. Farber  Maria LesnikStudy DesignStudy 102 was designed as a multicenter Phase 1 study with a dose escalation part followed by a cohort expansion to further test the recommended phase II dose. The escalation part achieved its primary objective  establishing a tolerable safety profile without dose-limiting toxicities and a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) at 22% of tumor volume. The completed cohort expansion recruited a total of 56 patients across 20 sites in 4 European countries. In each patient  the primary tumor was injected with NBTXR3  while involved lymph nodes were not injected. The NBTXR3-injected lesion and the non-injected lesion were treated with the same dose of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).The patient population entered the study with negative prognostic factors such as advanced age  and a high burden of comorbidity as measured by the age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (ACCI ≥ 4)2. 61% of patients in the study were aged ≥ 70 years and 67% had ACCI ³ 4. The median duration of follow up was 18.2 months.SafetyAll 56 patients treated received at least 90% of the planned injected volume of NBTXR3 and 91% completed IMRT. 5 patients discontinued IMRT due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  of which one TEAE (sepsis) was possibly related to RT and NBTXR3. 10 deaths occurred within 180 days of enrollment  of which 1 death (sepsis) was possibly related to RT and NBTXR3. 80% of these patients (8/10) entered the study with a high burden of comorbidity (ACCI ³ 4). The study concluded that injection of NBTXR3 followed by RT activation was feasible and well tolerated in elderly patients with LA-HNSCC.EfficacyThe evaluable population in the study included 44 patients. Response was measured in the NBTXR3-injected lesion alone (injected lesion) as per RECIST 1.1  and in the NBTXR3-injected and non-injected lesions together (all lesions). In the injected lesions  data showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 81.8% (36/44) with a complete response rate (CRR) of 63.6% (28/44). In all lesions  data showed an overall response rate of 79.5% (23/44) with a complete response rate of 52.3% (23/44). At the final readout  an independent review committee determined a median Progression-Free Survival (mPFS) of 16.9 months in evaluable patients. Median Overall Survival (mOS) in evaluable patients was 23.1 months. Historical data in a similar population show an expected mPFS of 9 months and mOS of 12 months3. Importantly  the median duration of response in NBTXR3-injected lesions was not reached by the end of the study  compared to a median duration of response of 12.4 months in all lesions  suggesting durable antitumor activity from RT-activated NBTXR3.Next Steps for Nanobiotix Head and Neck PathwayTo date  the Company has provided timing expectations for NANORAY-312 informed by initial hypotheses within the study protocol  including recruitment rate projections and an expected “Time-to-Event” (e.g.  tumor progression  death  etc.) for patients based on historical data in a similar population (i.e.  9-month mPFS and 12-month mOS).After observation of a potentially significant extension in mPFS and mOS versus historical data in the final efficacy analysis of Study 102  and in view of experience with global recruitment ramp up since the beginning of site activation for NANORAY-312  Nanobiotix is adjusting guidance for the NANORAY-312 futility analysis to 2H2024. The Company expects NANORAY-312 to record the appropriate number events for the interim readout in 1H2025  and to deliver the interim efficacy analysis mid-2025.“Underlying the NBTXR3 global development program is the belief that the universal  physics-based mechanism of our potential first-in-class radioenhancer could significantly increase the dose of radiotherapy within the injected tumor without increasing harmful side effects for patients with cancer ” said Louis Kayitalire  MD  chief medical officer at Nanobiotix. “In my view  the results from Study 102 could represent a significant step toward validating this hypothesis and addressing the unmet needs of patients with head and neck cancer. The signals of safety and efficacy we observed in Study 102  combined with the learnings we have applied in the design of our pivotal Phase 3 study in a similar population  add to my conviction that NBTXR3 has the potential to revolutionize treatment for millions of patients with cancer around the world.”Conference Call DetailsLive (US): 1-877-423-9813Live France: 0 800 912 848Live (international): 1-201-689-8573Call me™: click hereParticipants can use guest dial-in numbers above and be answered by an operator or they can click the Call me™ link for instant telephone access to the event (dial-out).

Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2021  the Company announced an agreement with LianBio to expand development of NBTXR3 into Greater China and other Asian Markets  and in July 2023 Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

Oct. 04  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced the final readout on primary endpoints from Study 102 Dose Expansion—the expansion part of a Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion study evaluating potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3 for patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer (Study 102). The results were presented by Principal Investigator Professor Christophe Le Tourneau in an oral presentation at the 65th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO). Additionally  the abstract was selected for inclusion in a scientific highlight session on head and neck cancer and the final results were selected for discussion in a scientific discussion on augmenting the potential of radiation therapy (RT) with novel therapeutics and imaging.This oral presentation at ASTRO will be followed by a conference call on Thursday  October 5  2023  at 8:00 AM EDT / 2:00 PM CEST. During the call  Laurent Levy  chief executive officer  will review the Study 102 final data before taking questions from participants.Study BackgroundSurgery or definitive cisplatin-based chemotherapy are the current standard of care for patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC; head and neck cancer). One third of these patients  however  cannot tolerate cisplatin due to complications such as age-related frailty or other medical conditions (comorbidities). Combined with the fact that 20-30% of patients with LA-HNSCC have a high burden of comorbidity1  and 30% of patients with LA-HNSCC are over the age of 70  this patient population presents a significant unmet need for new therapies that offer tolerable safety and the potential for improved local control.“The hypothesis we sought to evaluate in Study 102 was that novel radioenhancer NBTXR3—as a single intratumoral injection procedure  that does not interact directly with other drugs  and could potentially improve locoregional control of the primary tumor without adding harmful side effects for elderly patients with head and neck cancer—may provide a promising new therapeutic option ” said Professor Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  principal investigator for Study 102. “The favorable safety profile we have seen throughout the study  along with what we believe is meaningful efficacy  reinforce my confidence in the potential of NBTXR3 for these patients.”ABSTRACT #55360: Novel Radioenhancer NBTXR3 Activated by Radiotherapy in Cisplatin-ineligible Locally Advanced HNSCC Patients: Final Results of a Phase 1 TrialChristophe Le Tourneau  Zoltán Takacsi-Nagy  Laetitia Finzi  Xavier Liem  Valentin Calugaru  Victor Moreno  Emiliano Calvo  Sébastien Salas  Bernard Doger  Antoine Dubray-Vautrin  Xavier Mirabel  Nathalie Badois  Anne Chilles  Nicolas Fakhry  Stéphanie Wong Hee Kam  Laetitia Houdas  Anais Debard  Omar I. Vivar  Leonard A. Farber  Maria LesnikStudy DesignStudy 102 was designed as a multicenter Phase 1 study with a dose escalation part followed by a cohort expansion to further test the recommended phase II dose. The escalation part achieved its primary objective  establishing a tolerable safety profile without dose-limiting toxicities and a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) at 22% of tumor volume. The completed cohort expansion recruited a total of 56 patients across 20 sites in 4 European countries. In each patient  the primary tumor was injected with NBTXR3  while involved lymph nodes were not injected. The NBTXR3-injected lesion and the non-injected lesion were treated with the same dose of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).The patient population entered the study with negative prognostic factors such as advanced age  and a high burden of comorbidity as measured by the age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (ACCI ≥ 4)2. 61% of patients in the study were aged ≥ 70 years and 67% had ACCI ³ 4. The median duration of follow up was 18.2 months.SafetyAll 56 patients treated received at least 90% of the planned injected volume of NBTXR3 and 91% completed IMRT. 5 patients discontinued IMRT due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  of which one TEAE (sepsis) was possibly related to RT and NBTXR3. 10 deaths occurred within 180 days of enrollment  of which 1 death (sepsis) was possibly related to RT and NBTXR3. 80% of these patients (8/10) entered the study with a high burden of comorbidity (ACCI ³ 4). The study concluded that injection of NBTXR3 followed by RT activation was feasible and well tolerated in elderly patients with LA-HNSCC.EfficacyThe evaluable population in the study included 44 patients. Response was measured in the NBTXR3-injected lesion alone (injected lesion) as per RECIST 1.1  and in the NBTXR3-injected and non-injected lesions together (all lesions). In the injected lesions  data showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 81.8% (36/44) with a complete response rate (CRR) of 63.6% (28/44). In all lesions  data showed an overall response rate of 79.5% (23/44) with a complete response rate of 52.3% (23/44). At the final readout  an independent review committee determined a median Progression-Free Survival (mPFS) of 16.9 months in evaluable patients. Median Overall Survival (mOS) in evaluable patients was 23.1 months. Historical data in a similar population show an expected mPFS of 9 months and mOS of 12 months3. Importantly  the median duration of response in NBTXR3-injected lesions was not reached by the end of the study  compared to a median duration of response of 12.4 months in all lesions  suggesting durable antitumor activity from RT-activated NBTXR3.Next Steps for Nanobiotix Head and Neck PathwayTo date  the Company has provided timing expectations for NANORAY-312 informed by initial hypotheses within the study protocol  including recruitment rate projections and an expected “Time-to-Event” (e.g.  tumor progression  death  etc.) for patients based on historical data in a similar population (i.e.  9-month mPFS and 12-month mOS).After observation of a potentially significant extension in mPFS and mOS versus historical data in the final efficacy analysis of Study 102  and in view of experience with global recruitment ramp up since the beginning of site activation for NANORAY-312  Nanobiotix is adjusting guidance for the NANORAY-312 futility analysis to 2H2024. The Company expects NANORAY-312 to record the appropriate number events for the interim readout in 1H2025  and to deliver the interim efficacy analysis mid-2025.“Underlying the NBTXR3 global development program is the belief that the universal  physics-based mechanism of our potential first-in-class radioenhancer could significantly increase the dose of radiotherapy within the injected tumor without increasing harmful side effects for patients with cancer ” said Louis Kayitalire  MD  chief medical officer at Nanobiotix. “In my view  the results from Study 102 could represent a significant step toward validating this hypothesis and addressing the unmet needs of patients with head and neck cancer. The signals of safety and efficacy we observed in Study 102  combined with the learnings we have applied in the design of our pivotal Phase 3 study in a similar population  add to my conviction that NBTXR3 has the potential to revolutionize treatment for millions of patients with cancer around the world.”Conference Call DetailsLive (US): 1-877-423-9813Live France: 0 800 912 848Live (international): 1-201-689-8573Call me™: click hereParticipants can use guest dial-in numbers above and be answered by an operator or they can click the Call me™ link for instant telephone access to the event (dial-out).

Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2021  the Company announced an agreement with LianBio to expand development of NBTXR3 into Greater China and other Asian Markets  and in July 2023 Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

PLEASE SEE THE IMPORTANT NOTICE AT THE END OF THIS PUBLICATION.Public disclosure of inside information according to Article 17 para. 1 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse (Market Abuse Regulation)European Healthcare Acquisition & Growth Company B.V. convenes extraordinary general meeting to extend the business combination deadline and publishes repurchase document relating to the redemption of the public shares and the proposed amendment of the Warrant T&CMunich  4 October 2023European Healthcare Acquisition & Growth Company B.V. (the ""Company"")  a Dutch operators-led special purpose acquisition company listed on Euronext Amsterdam  today convenes an extraordinary general meeting (the ""EGM"") to extend the business combination deadline and publishes a repurchase document relating to the redemption offer for all issued and outstanding class A ordinary shares (the ""Public Shares"" and a holder of Public Shares  a ""Public Shareholder"") and the proposed amendment of the Warrant T&C (as defined below) (the ""Repurchase Document"").EGMThe EGM will be held on 15 November 2023 at 10:00 CET at the offices of Houthoff Coöperatief U.A.  Gustav Mahlerplein 50  1082 MA Amsterdam  the Netherlands. Shareholders who are registered on 18 October 2023 (after processing of settlements on that date) and who give due notice of their wish to attend the EGM no later than by 17:30 CET on 8 November 2023 will have the right to attend the EGM in person or virtually. Shareholders who attend the EGM virtually cannot exercise their votes by electronic means during the EGM. They – as well as shareholders who do not attend the EGM in person or virtually – have the option and are encouraged to exercise their voting rights by proxy prior to the EGM by 17:30 CET on 8 November 2023. Details of how to register for the EGM and exercise voting rights are included in the convocation of the EGM.The agenda for the EGM includes (i) the extension of the original deadline by which a business combination must be completed (the ""Business Combination Deadline"") by up to twelve months until 17 November 2024 and (ii) the conditional dissolution of the Company.Redemption offerIn light of the proposed extension of the Business Combination Deadline  the Company will offer its Public Shareholders to redeem their Public Shares under the same terms as in the event of a liquidation scenario as further detailed in the Company's prospectus dated 16 November 2021. The redemption offer period will start on Monday  9 October 2023  and end on Tuesday  7 November 2023.Public Shareholders may tender all or part of their Public Shares for repurchase by the Company at a price of €10.17 per Public Shares  consisting of €10.00 per Public Share plus the pro rata share of the net positive interest to be accrued on the escrow account up to and including 31 October 2023 of €0.17 per Public Share. As the Company will initially withhold 15% from the pro rata share of such net positive interest accrued (i.e. €0.0255 per Public Share) (the ""Withheld Amount"") to address potential Dutch dividend withholding tax (dividendbelasting)  Public Shareholders will initially receive €10.1445 per Public Share on the settlement date on 9 November 2023 (the ""Settlement Amount""). However  Public Shareholders who confirm that they are not a Dutch resident individual or entity  and accordingly are not subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax  will receive the Withheld Amount ultimately on 30 November 2023.The Repurchase Document contains details of the redemption offer  including with respect to how shareholders can tender their Public Shares for redemption  if they wish to do so. Public Shareholders who do not wish to tender any Public Shares do not need to take any action. They will remain shareholders of the Company as their Public Shares will not be repurchased.Persons who are Public Shareholders on the record date of 18 October 2023  who tender all or part of their Public Shares in the redemption offer  who receive the Settlement Amount on 9 November 2023 and who are therefore not Public Shareholders on the date of the EGM have nevertheless the chance to vote all of their Public Shares prior to or in the EGM.Proposed amendment of the Warrant T&CIn the context of the proposed extension of the Business Combination Deadline as announced in the Company's press release of 20 September 2023 and as further set out in the agenda and explanatory notes of the EGM  the board of the Company proposes that the holders of redeemable class A warrants (the ""Public Warrants"") and the holders of class B warrants (the ""Founder Warrants"" and together with the Public Warrants  the ""Warrants"") amend the terms and conditions of the Warrants (the ""Warrant T&C"") to have all Warrants expire worthless on the original Business Combination Deadline  being 17 November 2023  as the Warrants have proved to impede the Company's chances of successfully executing a business combination. The Warrant T&C provide that the terms of the Warrants may be amended with the vote or written consent of the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding Warrants. The Sponsors have indicated to vote in favour of the proposed amendment of the Warrant T&C. Further details on how to vote on the Warrants are set out in the Repurchase Document. The voting forms are attached to the Repurchase Document that is available on the Company's website and can be submitted by e-mail to info@ehc-company.com by 17:30 CET on 9 November 2023.Detailed timetable of EGM and redemption offerEvent Date (and time in CET) Commencement of the redemption offer Monday  9 October 2023  at 9:00 Record date EGM Wednesday  18 October 2023 Closing date for the redemption offer Tuesday  7 November  at 12:00 (noon) Announcement of results of the redemption offer Tuesday  7 November (after market close) Deadline for (i) registration for the EGM and (ii) submitting electronic voting instructions or proxies Wednesday  8 November 2023 by 17:30 Settlement of the redemption offer Thursday  9 November 2023 Deadline to submit a declaration and voting instruction for the payment of the Withheld Amount and the proposed amendment of the Warrant T&C Thursday  9 November 2023 by 17:30 Notification of voting results of the proposed amendment of the Warrant T&C Friday  10 November 2023 EGM Wednesday  15 November 2023 at 10:00 Expiration of the Warrants  subject to amendment of the Warrant T&C Friday  17 November 2023 Ultimate payment date of Withheld Amount to Public Shareholders who are not subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax Thursday  30 November 2023The Company reserves the right to extend the period of the redemption offer and the voting instructions and may adjust the dates and times given in the timetable. Any such extension or adjustment will be announced through a press release.The convocation  agenda  explanatory notes to the agenda and form of proxy of the EGM  the Repurchase Document and the voting forms for the amendment of the Warrant T&C are available on the website of EHC (www.ehc-company.com) in the 'Investor Relations' section under 'Shareholder Meetings' and 'Business Combination Materials'.-----------About EHCEHC is an operators-led special purpose acquisition company.

As part of this conference  UCB will present two late-breaking posters that shed light on the care and management of Dravet syndrome.Poster 1: Outcomes Among Individuals With Dravet Syndrome Using Fenfluramine: A Retrospective Analysis Using U.S. Claims DataFintepla® (fenfluramine) 2.2 mg/mL oral solution)Dravet syndrome  a rare and severe developmental epileptic encephalopathy  has long presented challenges in terms of treatment and care. However  a new retrospective analysis utilizing U.S. claims data has unveiled promising outcomes for individuals with Dravet syndrome who were treated with fenfluramine  following its approval in June 2020 for the management of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in the United States.1The objective of this analysis was to quantify the relationship between fenfluramine and seizure-related healthcare events through claims data. The study utilized the Komodo U.S. healthcare claims database to measure healthcare utilization  including rescue anti-seizure medication use and healthcare visits. Individuals with Dravet syndrome were identified by ICD-10 codes. Patients receiving prior/concomitant cannabidiol or stiripentol were excluded.1Among the 108 individuals with Dravet syndrome included in the analysis  91 individuals (84%) had continuous fenfluramine use for a minimum of 6 months. This subset exhibited a 77% reduction in rescue antiseizure medication use (P<0.001). Moreover  the reductions extended to healthcare visits  with a 50% decrease in ER visits  a 27% reduction in outpatient visits  a 24% reduction in neurology visits  and a 24% reduction in inpatient hospitalizations.1The findings suggest that meaningful reductions in healthcare utilization were observed among individuals with Dravet syndrome treated with fenfluramine for at least 6 months. The 6-month persistency rate of fenfluramine usage indicates not only its efficacy but also its tolerability in this patient population.1Authors: Srihari Jaganathan  Derek Ems  Rob Sederman  Chen Chen  Shuang WuPoster 2: Diagnosis and Information Management of Dravet Syndrome in Recently Diagnosed Pediatric Patients: Results From a Dravet Syndrome Foundation Caregiver Insight SurveyThe second late-breaking poster explored the challenges surrounding the early diagnosis of Dravet syndrome. Caregivers of pediatric patients aged ≤4 years  diagnosed with Dravet syndrome  were surveyed to gather insights into their experiences.2The survey  distributed via the Dravet Syndrome Foundation Family Network  received responses from 73 caregivers. The results highlighted that the average age at symptom onset was 5 months  while the average age at Dravet syndrome diagnosis was 12 months. Changes in healthcare providers were common  with the most frequent reasons being clinical expertise and trust. The poster further highlights the vital role that patient advocacy groups and online resources play in providing caregivers with valuable information and support during the diagnosis and management process.2Authors: Andrea Wilkinson  BA  Danya Kaye  BA  Veronica Hood  PhD  Mary Anne Meskis  Laurie Bailey  BCPA  Rebecca Burns  PharmD  PhD  Amélie Lothe  PhDThese posters underscore the advancements in understanding and managing Dravet syndrome  as well as the pivotal role of both medical interventions and patient advocacy resources in enhancing the lives of those affected by this condition.1 2About FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine)1In the U.S.  FINTEPLA is approved for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.FINTEPLA is available in the U.S. through the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).

Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The ATO platform  which has been successfully developed  has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T and other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). cGvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. BioSenic has been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early Phase IIa study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol.2) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform developed by BioSenic  with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. ALLOB has recently been evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late-delayed union. However  in June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in this exploratory Phase IIb clinical trial  interpreted as a failure of a too early cell injection  just after fracture. BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (choice between early or late treatment).Note: Biosenic has reevaluated a previous important and years-long clinical development program. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient subpopulation. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. This leads to a next generation of JTA  off-the-shelf enhanced viscosupplement to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives are intended to provide effective lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic (OA) pain and inflammation.The company  will nevertheless focus its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

This leads to a next generation of JTA  off-the-shelf enhanced viscosupplement to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives are intended to provide effective lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic (OA) pain and inflammation.The company  will nevertheless focus its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

It is moving its primary listing from London to New York.Another heavyweight  Smurfit Kappa  said earlier this month that it also plans to quit the Irish exchange for New York as part of a merger with a US peer.Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment is expected to leave the Irish market soon after it decided earlier this year to take out a listing in the US.These departures have prompted Zurich to announce the closure of its Irish Equity Fund.This fund invests in stocks listed on the Irish stock exchange.Zurich told brokers: “As the number and size of stocks listed on the exchange has reduced  the fund is becoming more concentrated as a result. For that reason  Zurich have taken the decision to close the fund.”It will close early next year.Zurich said it will no longer accept single premiums or switches into the fund.Regular premiums will continue to be invested in it and switches out of and withdrawals from the fund are permitted until the fund closes in early 2024.“We will be in contact with you in the coming months to confirm the closure date and to outline the closure process including customer communications ” it said in an email to investors and brokers.Broker Liam Ferguson  of Tullamore-based Ferga.com  said: “The closure of Zurich Life’s Irish Equity fund shows that the departure of some of the big hitters like Diageo  CRH and Flutter from Euronext Dublin has ripple effects.”Mr Ferguson said the Zurich Life Irish Equity Fund would typically own around 20 Irish shares  including Ryanair  Kerry Group  Kingspan  AIB  Bank of Ireland and Glanbia .When a Zurich Life policyholder chose to invest in this fund  the fund would buy more shares in each of the 20 companies.When this Zurich Life fund closes  it will no longer be buying Dublin-listed shares  he said.Mr Ferguson said that from a Zurich Life customer’s point of view  the closure should not have a dramatic impact on their investments.The Irish Equity fund was one of Zurich Life’s smaller funds and very few customers would have all of their investment or pension funds invested in it alone.He said: “Customers who did invest in this fund enjoyed a good return – the fund was up 12.8pc per year over the three years to the end of August this year.”Those that are invested in it will be offered another equity fund from the Zurich portfolio  Mr Ferguson said.He said the closure reinforces the advice that investors should diversify and keep their portfolio spread across industries and global regions rather than having all eggs in one basket.Zurich was contacted  but did not want to comment.,neutral,0.02,0.83,0.15,mixed,0.33,0.18,0.49,True,English,"['Irish equities fund', 'Dublin stock market', 'company delistings', 'Zurich', 'face', 'Construction materials giant CRH', 'Zurich Life Irish Equity Fund', 'The Irish Equity fund', 'Paddy Power owner', 'Tullamore-based Ferga.com', 'Broker Liam Ferguson', 'Zurich Life policyholder', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'Zurich Life customer', 'Zurich Life fund', 'Irish market', 'Irish exchange', '20 Irish shares', 'customer communications', 'Mr Ferguson', 'huge blow', 'Euronext Dublin', 'largest company', 'New York', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'single premiums', 'Regular premiums', 'coming months', 'big hitters', 'ripple effects', 'Kerry Group', 'dramatic impact', 'smaller funds', 'pension funds', 'good return', 'three years', 'global regions', 'one basket', 'Dublin-listed shares', 'Investment company', 'big companies', 'primary listing', 'US peer', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Zurich portfolio', '20 companies', 'response', 'number', 'London', 'heavyweight', 'part', 'merger', 'stocks', 'brokers', 'size', 'result', 'reason', 'decision', 'withdrawals', 'early', 'contact', 'date', 'process', 'email', 'investors', 'Diageo', 'Ryanair', 'Kingspan', 'AIB', 'Bank', 'Ireland', 'Glanbia', 'point', 'view', 'investments', 'customers', 'end', 'August', 'advice', 'industries', 'eggs']",2023-10-05,2023-10-05,independent.ie
