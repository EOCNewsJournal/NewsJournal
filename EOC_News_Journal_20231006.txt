31057,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/reports-that-china-has-been-dumping-treasury-bonds-have-been-greatly-exaggerated-22b84092,The Tell: Reports that China has been dumping Treasury bonds have been greatly exaggerated,Data purporting to show that China has been dumping its holdings of Treasury bonds have caught the attention of market bears and the financial press.,Data purporting to show that China has been dumping its holdings of Treasury bonds have caught the attention of market bears and the financial press.But one economist believes these claims have been greatly exaggerated. And he’s got the numbers to back this up.In a blog post published this week that caught the attention of some on Wall Street  Brad Setser  an economist and senior fellow at the Council for Foreign Relations  showed that a popular U.S. government data series on holdings of U.S. assets by foreign buyers doesn’t tell the whole story.Setser found that the only notable shift in the composition of China’s foreign securities haul over the past eight years — at least as far as the U.S. is concerned — has been that Beijing’s reserve managers have favored agency debt like mortgage bonds over Treasurys.Although China has slightly pared back its Treasury holdings over the past two years  its total exposure to U.S. assets appears to have changed little going back to 2015  contrary to claims that China has been actively “de-dollarizing” as geopolitical tensions with the U.S. have flared.“China has not been dumping its Treasury holdings  but people highlighting the TIC data to argue that China is dumping don’t understand the nuances of that data ” Setser said Thursday during a phone interview with MarketWatch.“The small reduction in their holdings is most likely due to a decision not to reinvest the proceeds back into the market.”Assuming Setser’s calculations are correct  it would mean the surge in Treasury yields over the past three months has had little to do with selling by one of the biggest foreign holders of U.S. debt securities.To be sure  Wall Street bond-market analysts have more readily blamed the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy  stubborn inflation  and worries about the U.S.’s ballooning debt load as the primary drivers behind the selloff. But bearish voices on social media and elsewhere have fixated on signs of China selling to support their argument that foreign governments are souring on U.S. debt  potentially creating more problems for the U.S. economy.Perhaps the most important piece of Setser’s analysis is this: China is widely believed to manage some of its dollar-denominated reserves through foreign custodians like Euroclear  based in Belgium  and Clearstream  which is based in Luxembourg. These entities handle the mundane tasks of warehousing and protecting securities. Based in part on their location  the finer points of their holdings aren’t as easily monitored by U.S. authorities.Because of this  the monthly Treasury International Capital report — better known by the abbreviation “TIC” — data  seen as an authoritative record of countries’ holdings of U.S. securities  must be adjusted to incorporate some of these other foreign holdings.Setser’s complicated methodology uses other U.S. data sets aside from the TIC numbers  while also adjusting for falling bond prices with yields on long-dated Treasurys touching their highest levels in 16 years this month.The 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y yield stood at 4.711% Thursday afternoon in New York  while the yield on the 30-year bond BX:TMUBMUSD30Y stood at 4.887%. Both saw yields touch their highest levels since 2007 earlier this week.His conclusion: China’s U.S. dollar assets have been basically stable since 2015 at between $1.8 trillion and $1.9 trillion. Roughly half of that is believed to be invested in U.S. dollar-bonds  with roughly 40% of that amount consisting of Treasurys.BRAD SETSERAccording to the latest TIC report  which was released on Sept. 18  China’s Treasury holdings declined to $821.8 billion  the lowest level since May 2009.

The reception of persons who have registered for the meeting and the distribution of voting tickets will commence at 11:00 (Finnish time).A. Matters on the agenda of the General MeetingAt the General Meeting  the following matters will be considered:1. Opening of the meeting2. Calling the meeting to order3. Election of persons to scrutinize the minutes and to supervise the counting of votes4. Recording the legality of the meeting5. Recording the attendance at the meeting and adoption of the list of votes6. Reducing the quantity of company's shares by way of issuing new company shares and by the redemption of company's own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes to the General Meeting that the General Meeting resolves on the reduction of the quantity of company's shares without reducing share capital by way of issuing new shares and by redemption of company's own shares  in such a way that each current 200 shares of the company shall correspond to one share of the company after the arrangements related to the reduction of the quantity of company's shares are completed. Prior to the reduction of the quantity of company's shares  the total number of shares in the company is 592 859 607.The purpose of the reduction of the quantity of company's shares is to increase the value of a single share and thus to improve the trade conditions of the shares and the reliability of the price formation of the shares. Thus  the Board of Directors considers that there is a particularly weighty financial reason for the company to reduce the quantity of company's shares. This arrangement shall not affect the equity of the company.It is proposed that the reduction of the quantity of company's shares shall be carried out so that the company shall  on 27 October 2023  issue new company shares to each shareholder of the company free of charge so that the number of all shares per book-entry accounts owned by the shareholders of the company are divisible by the number 200. The maximum quantity of company's own shares transferred by the company shall be 199 shares multiplied by the number of such book-entry accounts on 27 October 2023  on which the company's shares are held  and which are owned by the shareholders of the company.The number of company's shareholders as per 30 September 2023 was 17 177. Therefore  it is proposed that the maximum amount of new shares issued by the company in the share issue is 3 600 000 new shares of the company. The Board of Directors of the company is entitled to resolve on all other matters related to the issuance of shares free of charge.At the same time with the aforementioned issue of company's new shares  the company shall redeem free of charge a number of shares from each shareholder of the company. The number of shares to be redeemed by the company will be determined according to the redemption ratio of 200/1. In other words  for every 200 shares of the company 199 company shares shall be redeemed. The Board of Directors of the company shall be entitled to resolve on all other matters related to the redemptions of shares.The company's shares  which are redeemed in connection with the reduction of the quantity of company's shares  shall be annulled immediately following the redemption by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the company.The reduction of the quantity of company's shares shall be carried out in the book- entry system after the end of trading day on Nasdaq Helsinki on 27 October 2023. The annulment of the shares and the company's new total number of shares are entered in the trade register approximately on 30 October 2023 at the latest. Trading with the company's new total number of shares on Nasdaq Helsinki will begin approximately on 30 October 2023. If necessary  the trading with the company's share on Nasdaq Helsinki shall be temporarily interrupted in order to perform necessary technical measures in the trading facility after 27 October 2023.The arrangement  if it is realized  will not require the shareholders to take any action. No part of the arrangement shall be carried out unless all the other parts of the arrangement are carried out as well.7. Authorization of the Board of Directors to decide on a share issue as well as other option rights and other special rights entitling to shares in the companyThe Board of Directors proposes to the General Meeting  that the General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to decide on a share issue with and/or without payment  either in one or in several occasions  including right to resolve on option rights and other rights entitling to shares pursuant to the Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act so that the number of new shares issued based on the authorization or number of shares issued based on option rights and other special rights entitling to the shares pursuant to the Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish companies Act  could increase by a total maximum amount of 10 000 000 shares (after reduction of quantity of shares as described in item 6 of this agenda; the said amount equals to 2 000 000 000 shares before the reduction of quantity of shares as described in item 6 of this agenda). The authorization does not exclude the Board’s right to decide also on directed issue of shares or option rights and other special rights pursuant to the Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act. It is proposed that the authorization may be used for important arrangements from the company’s point of view e.g. to strengthen the capital structure  to finance investments  for acquisitions and business transactions or other business arrangements  or to expand ownership structure  or for other purposes resolved by the Board involving a weighty financial reason for issuing shares or option rights or special rights entitling to shares pursuant to the Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act. The share issue may be executed by deviating from the shareholders' pre-emptive subscription right provided the company has a weighty financial reason for that. It is proposed that the authorization is in force until 30 June 2024.8. Closing of the meetingB.

Confirmation of the capital increase must take place no later than 31 December 2023. The new shares to be issued when the share capital is increased: shall be of the same nature as the existing shares  shall be in registered form or dematerialised  and shall have the same rights and benefits as the existing shares  and will participate in particular in the result of the Company for the entire current financial year. The new shares will be subscribed by contribution in cash at an issue price of five (5.00) euros per share. The new shares will be fully paid up. As the issue price is lower than the par value of the existing shares  the issue price of all new shares will be fully allocated to the available ""capital"" account. There will be no share premium. Immediately after the issue of new shares  all shares (new and existing shares) shall have the same representative value in the capital (and the same par value). The Company will request the admission of new shares to trading on the Euronext Brussels regulated market. The new shares will be offered in a public offering in Belgium. Subject to the relevant legal provisions  the new shares may also be offered via one or more public offerings/or private investments to institutional  qualified  professional or other investors in Belgium  in other jurisdictions outside Belgium  pursuant to a decision of (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) an ad hoc committee which shall be authorised to continue the implementation of the operation (see the composition and powers below  point 5 of the agenda) (hereinafter the ""Committee"") (each of (i) and (ii) acting individually  with power to sub-delegate and substitute). 1Existing shareholders of the Company will have a statutory preferential right to underwrite new shares in accordance with articles 7:188 and 7:189 of the CAC. Each existing share will give to the shareholder a statutory preferential right. The statutory preferential right shall be in the form of a coupon  detached from each share. The statutory preferential rights may be exercised and negotiated  separately from the existing shares  including for the benefit of persons who are not shareholders yet  for a public underwriting period of at least 15 calendar days  whose start and end dates shall be set by (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) the Committee (each of (i) and (ii) acting individually  with the power to sub-delegate and to substitute). The Company will request that the statutory preferential rights be admitted to trading on the Euronext Brussels regulated market during the public underwriting period. Subject to the relevant statutory provisions  the statutory preferential rights shall then be freely tradeable on the Euronext Brussels regulated market  separately from existing shares  including for the benefit of persons who are not shareholders yet  during the public underwriting period. Holders of statutory preference rights may  during the public subscription period  subscribe for the new shares at the following ratio: thirteen (13) new shares for three (3) statutory preference rights (the ""Subscription Ratio""). Subject to the relevant statutory provisions  the statutory preferential rights shall give the right to subscribe to the new shares at the Subscription Ratio. The statutory preferential rights cannot be used to underwrite new fractional shares  as appropriate. Moreover  registered preferential rights may not be combined with dematerialised preferential rights to underwrite new shares. Dematerialised preferential rights held on different securities accounts may not be combined to underwrite new shares. Company shareholders or persons having acquired statutory preferential rights who do not hold a sufficient number of statutory preferential rights to underwrite a round number of new shares at the Subscription Ratio  may  during the public underwriting period  either acquire additional statutory preferential rights to underwrite new shares at the Subscription Ratio  or sell all or part of their statutory preferential rights. Subject to the foregoing  the Company will prepare a prospectus for public offering in Belgium of new shares and the admission to trading of new shares and statutory preferential rights on the Euronext Brussels regulated market  which must be approved by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (hereinafter the ""FSMA"") in accordance with the applicable law. It is accepted that relevant legal provisions in jurisdictions other than Belgium may restrict or prohibit shareholders or other holders of statutory preferential rights outside Belgium to underwrite new shares  to negotiate statutory preferential rights or to exercise statutory preferential rights. Unless otherwise decided by (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) the Committee (each of (i) and acting individually  with the power to sub-delegate and to substitute)  the Company shall not be required to offer new shares or statutory preferential rights to the public in jurisdictions outside Belgium.The statutory preferential rights which are not exercised within the public underwriting period 1 scrips""   shall not be sold nor invested and will become null and void and will therefore have no value.If the statutory preferential rights are not exercised during the public underwriting period  the remaining shares may be underwritten  in whole or in part  by 3D NV 2   Stéphan Sonneville SA 3 4 To avoid any misunderstanding  statutory preferential rights (a) in respect of which no valid subscription form has been received in due course or (b) in respect of which the full issue price (of shares to which they entitle) has not been paid in due course  shall equally be deemed as not having been exercised.

31062,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/reports-that-china-has-been-dumping-treasury-bonds-have-been-greatly-exaggerated-22b84092,The Tell: Reports that China has been dumping Treasury bonds have been greatly exaggerated,Data purporting to show that China has been dumping its holdings of Treasury bonds have caught the attention of market bears and the financial press.,Data purporting to show that China has been dumping its holdings of Treasury bonds have caught the attention of market bears and the financial press.But one economist believes these claims have been greatly exaggerated. And he’s got the numbers to back this up.In a blog post published this week that caught the attention of some on Wall Street  Brad Setser  an economist and senior fellow at the Council for Foreign Relations  showed that a popular U.S. government data series on holdings of U.S. assets by foreign buyers doesn’t tell the whole story.Setser found that the only notable shift in the composition of China’s foreign securities haul over the past eight years — at least as far as the U.S. is concerned — has been that Beijing’s reserve managers have favored agency debt like mortgage bonds over Treasurys.Although China has slightly pared back its Treasury holdings over the past two years  its total exposure to U.S. assets appears to have changed little going back to 2015  contrary to claims that China has been actively “de-dollarizing” as geopolitical tensions with the U.S. have flared.“China has not been dumping its Treasury holdings  but people highlighting the TIC data to argue that China is dumping don’t understand the nuances of that data ” Setser said Thursday during a phone interview with MarketWatch.“The small reduction in their holdings is most likely due to a decision not to reinvest the proceeds back into the market.”Assuming Setser’s calculations are correct  it would mean the surge in Treasury yields over the past three months has had little to do with selling by one of the biggest foreign holders of U.S. debt securities.To be sure  Wall Street bond-market analysts have more readily blamed the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy  stubborn inflation  and worries about the U.S.’s ballooning debt load as the primary drivers behind the selloff. But bearish voices on social media and elsewhere have fixated on signs of China selling to support their argument that foreign governments are souring on U.S. debt  potentially creating more problems for the U.S. economy.Perhaps the most important piece of Setser’s analysis is this: China is widely believed to manage some of its dollar-denominated reserves through foreign custodians like Euroclear  based in Belgium  and Clearstream  which is based in Luxembourg. These entities handle the mundane tasks of warehousing and protecting securities. Based in part on their location  the finer points of their holdings aren’t as easily monitored by U.S. authorities.Because of this  the monthly Treasury International Capital report — better known by the abbreviation “TIC” — data  seen as an authoritative record of countries’ holdings of U.S. securities  must be adjusted to incorporate some of these other foreign holdings.Setser’s complicated methodology uses other U.S. data sets aside from the TIC numbers  while also adjusting for falling bond prices with yields on long-dated Treasurys touching their highest levels in 16 years this month.The 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y yield stood at 4.711% Thursday afternoon in New York  while the yield on the 30-year bond BX:TMUBMUSD30Y stood at 4.887%. Both saw yields touch their highest levels since 2007 earlier this week.His conclusion: China’s U.S. dollar assets have been basically stable since 2015 at between $1.8 trillion and $1.9 trillion. Roughly half of that is believed to be invested in U.S. dollar-bonds  with roughly 40% of that amount consisting of Treasurys.BRAD SETSERAccording to the latest TIC report  which was released on Sept. 18  China’s Treasury holdings declined to $821.8 billion  the lowest level since May 2009.

This alliance aligns with Accor’s pioneering work and commitment to sustainable procurement  critical to achieving our scope 3 carbon emissions reduction targets. Cooperating and innovating jointly with our peers will provide the tangible tools needed to meet our environmental and social objectives.A major part of hospitality’s environmental  social and governance footprint lies with its suppliers. As the primary interface with supply chains  procurement functions and organizations have a decisive role to play in shaping more sustainable practices. HARP was created as a new way of measuring and improving supply chain sustainability performance  using EcoVadis’ sustainability rating data pools to create shared evaluation methodologies  empowering the companies involved to interact with their key suppliers  and facilitating the exchange of game-changing expertise to accelerate a unified drive towards best practices.Accor  through Astore  its international procurement organization specialized for all operational needs of hospitality industry  identified early the power of procurement to bridge the gap between sustainability vision and action  with this business function key to leading the sustainability efforts of suppliers across processes and solutions. This realization has seen Astore operate at the leading edge of sustainable procurement for several years now.The Group  via Astore  employs strict processes to ensure rigorous selection of suppliers who are increasingly responsible and comply with the requirements of the responsible procurement charter  a contractual prerequisite since 2017 and regularly updated to be in line with new regulations and the Group's commitments. Based on a supplier risk mapping on social  environmental  and ethical criteria  compliance with the responsible procurement charter by nominated suppliers is implemented through a robust control plan. Beyond the verification of contractual obligations  this control plan measures the sustainability performance of nominated suppliers based on increasingly demanding expectations.This ensures the minimization of supply chain risks and sustainability innovation in areas such as net-zero  human rights  diversity  etc.Accor procurement also plays a major role in most of the Group’s sustainability commitments. To achieve Accor's goal of eradicating single-use plastic products in the guest experience  procurement teams have implemented global and local sourcing of zero plastic alternatives  encouraging suppliers to transition and innovate. Accor has also reaffirmed its commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050 by signing several initiatives (e.g. SBTi  UNTWO). These initiatives aim to redefine its carbon trajectory to align it with the targets on limiting global warming set by the Paris Agreement. Including  an ambitious emission reduction target of -46% of absolute emissions on scope 1 & 2 and -28% of absolute emissions on scope 3 by 2030 (compared to the 2019 base year).Accor has also joined the ""Business Ambition for 1.5°C"" program  making Accor the first international hotel group to make a long-term commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. As part of Accor’s commitment to reach net-zero carbon by 2050  procurement has sourced green energy and energy savings solutions for both hotels and corporate headquarters – our Paris Corporate HQ is now 100% renewable energy-supplied.Procurement has also played a key role in responsible F&B sourcing in line with the Group’s Sustainable Food Charter commitments  for example increasing local and seasonal sourcing  organic products  and preferring suppliers with responsible fishing  responsible coffee & tea  and animal welfare practices. This enables Accor to align itself with the highest industry standards in sustainability while creating value for hotel owners and guests.HARP will accelerate the raising of hospitality suppliers’ accountability and sustainability levels  as well as furthering Accor’s ambitions to assist suppliers in industry wide efforts to address crucial elements of the sustainability challenge.Innovative and solution-based initiatives that focus on core business activities are crucial to realizing the hospitality industry’s vision for a sustainable future. This collaboration marks a crucial next step which Accor is very proud to be a part of  we are excited to be leading creative efforts alongside major hotel and procurement groups. The collaboration will no doubt deliver unmatched value to not only our suppliers but also our guests  as we continue to push for positive impact.

Confirmation of the capital increase must take place no later than 31 December 2023. The new shares to be issued when the share capital is increased: shall be of the same nature as the existing shares  shall be in registered form or dematerialised  and shall have the same rights and benefits as the existing shares  and will participate in particular in the result of the Company for the entire current financial year. The new shares will be subscribed by contribution in cash at an issue price of five (5.00) euros per share. The new shares will be fully paid up. As the issue price is lower than the par value of the existing shares  the issue price of all new shares will be fully allocated to the available ""capital"" account. There will be no share premium. Immediately after the issue of new shares  all shares (new and existing shares) shall have the same representative value in the capital (and the same par value). The Company will request the admission of new shares to trading on the Euronext Brussels regulated market. The new shares will be offered in a public offering in Belgium. Subject to the relevant legal provisions  the new shares may also be offered via one or more public offerings/or private investments to institutional  qualified  professional or other investors in Belgium  in other jurisdictions outside Belgium  pursuant to a decision of (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) an ad hoc committee which shall be authorised to continue the implementation of the operation (see the composition and powers below  point 5 of the agenda) (hereinafter the ""Committee"") (each of (i) and (ii) acting individually  with power to sub-delegate and substitute). 1Existing shareholders of the Company will have a statutory preferential right to underwrite new shares in accordance with articles 7:188 and 7:189 of the CAC. Each existing share will give to the shareholder a statutory preferential right. The statutory preferential right shall be in the form of a coupon  detached from each share. The statutory preferential rights may be exercised and negotiated  separately from the existing shares  including for the benefit of persons who are not shareholders yet  for a public underwriting period of at least 15 calendar days  whose start and end dates shall be set by (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) the Committee (each of (i) and (ii) acting individually  with the power to sub-delegate and to substitute). The Company will request that the statutory preferential rights be admitted to trading on the Euronext Brussels regulated market during the public underwriting period. Subject to the relevant statutory provisions  the statutory preferential rights shall then be freely tradeable on the Euronext Brussels regulated market  separately from existing shares  including for the benefit of persons who are not shareholders yet  during the public underwriting period. Holders of statutory preference rights may  during the public subscription period  subscribe for the new shares at the following ratio: thirteen (13) new shares for three (3) statutory preference rights (the ""Subscription Ratio""). Subject to the relevant statutory provisions  the statutory preferential rights shall give the right to subscribe to the new shares at the Subscription Ratio. The statutory preferential rights cannot be used to underwrite new fractional shares  as appropriate. Moreover  registered preferential rights may not be combined with dematerialised preferential rights to underwrite new shares. Dematerialised preferential rights held on different securities accounts may not be combined to underwrite new shares. Company shareholders or persons having acquired statutory preferential rights who do not hold a sufficient number of statutory preferential rights to underwrite a round number of new shares at the Subscription Ratio  may  during the public underwriting period  either acquire additional statutory preferential rights to underwrite new shares at the Subscription Ratio  or sell all or part of their statutory preferential rights. Subject to the foregoing  the Company will prepare a prospectus for public offering in Belgium of new shares and the admission to trading of new shares and statutory preferential rights on the Euronext Brussels regulated market  which must be approved by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (hereinafter the ""FSMA"") in accordance with the applicable law. It is accepted that relevant legal provisions in jurisdictions other than Belgium may restrict or prohibit shareholders or other holders of statutory preferential rights outside Belgium to underwrite new shares  to negotiate statutory preferential rights or to exercise statutory preferential rights. Unless otherwise decided by (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) the Committee (each of (i) and acting individually  with the power to sub-delegate and to substitute)  the Company shall not be required to offer new shares or statutory preferential rights to the public in jurisdictions outside Belgium.The statutory preferential rights which are not exercised within the public underwriting period 1 scrips""   shall not be sold nor invested and will become null and void and will therefore have no value.If the statutory preferential rights are not exercised during the public underwriting period  the remaining shares may be underwritten  in whole or in part  by 3D NV 2   Stéphan Sonneville SA 3 4 To avoid any misunderstanding  statutory preferential rights (a) in respect of which no valid subscription form has been received in due course or (b) in respect of which the full issue price (of shares to which they entitle) has not been paid in due course  shall equally be deemed as not having been exercised.

This nearly 7 000-square-meter retail complex is entirely controlled by the Group.The Ylang Ylang shopping Centre  which comprises a Carrefour supermarket (owned by the GBH Group)  the Mr. Bricolage and C'TAM chains (run by the Cananga Group)  and a 15-store retail arcade  opens its doors today. This new lifestyle and service center will benefit Mahoran families by offering a wide range of products and services  including ready-to-wear (OVS  Skechers…)  baby care (Bébé 9  Okaidi)  beauty  well-being  and jewelry (Beauty Success  The Body Shop  Oceanor…)  telecommunications (Orange  SFR  and Canal +)  and restaurants (Burger Yatrou…).CBo Territoria  a pioneer in the design  construction  and operation of green buildings in tropical environments  aims to obtain BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) certification for this site in 2024  becoming the first in the Indian Ocean region to achieve this distinction. In terms of building design  equipment  rainwater management  and waste reduction  this retail center demonstrates strong environmental goals. The thermal design adheres to the Mayénergie Plus (ADEME) reference system and the roof will be fitted with photovoltaic panels.The Group reaffirms its commitment to the second-most populous department in France  which receives significant development assistance from both the French government and the European Union. At the intersection of the departmental highways connecting the north  south  and west of the region  Ylang Ylang provides an innovative facility that matches the region's high aspirations in a previously under-equipped but unquestionably economically significant sector. It serves as a balanced complement to the services provided in the region's capital  Mamoudzou  and marks an important turning point in the region's development.This project is part of CBo Territoria's Impact Péi 2030* roadmap  which includes a strong social component  driven by a proactive approach to recruitment involving future shopkeepers  in partnership with the public employment agency  with the aim of optimizing economic spin-offs for the benefit of Tsingoni and central-western island residents. Thus  approximately 130 direct positions have been created.As an extension to the shopping center  CBo Territoria is pursuing its development in the area by building commercial properties. To that purpose  Pôle Emploi will be delivered an office building of 1 130 sq.m of usable floor space in the second quarter of 2024. In addition  the tertiary sector offer on this area is being further expanded by the launch of an office complex of 2 150 m² of usable floor space  and a retail park of 2 900 m² of usable floor space  both of which are already being marketed.“We are delighted to be a part of the Mahoran territory's structure and development by constructing this center of life and interchange. This economic dynamic is backed by a strong emphasis on environmental issues  with the first BREEAM-certified building delivered in the Indian Ocean region ” says Géraldine Neyret  Chief Executive Officer of CBo Territoria.* CBo Territoria is revitalizing its CSR activities to prepare for key international and European challenges in terms of climate  environment  and a long-term economic perspective. To that purpose  we have developed a virtuous dynamic for the regions in which we operate  as well as for our stakeholders  based on four essential principles: responsible citizens  environmental mobilization  energy efficiency  and committed employer.

This report explains how our financing impacts climate change  as...,ING publishes 2023 Climate ReportING today published its annual Climate Report. This report explains how our financing impacts climate change  as well as how climate change impacts our business. It includes our progress on steering the nine most carbon-intensive sectors in our loan portfolio towards global climate goals - our Terra approach - how we engage with clients to help them in their transitions  and our work to assess climate risks and take action to mitigate them.“Climate change is a fact and its effects are being felt all around us ” said ING CEO Steven van Rijswijk. “The latest climate science sends a clear warning that we only have a small window of opportunity to limit global warming to 1.5°C. I strongly believe that every step counts  every action is meaningful  and every tenth of a degree matters. We all – governments  NGOs  businesses and individuals – have a part to play  and we can all make the difference for present and future generations if we work together towards the same goals.”Putting sustainability at the heart of what we do is one of the two key pillars of our strategy. We’re proud of the progress we’re making  and how we're using our financing to contribute to the transition of our customers but we know we still have work to do. Change doesn’t happen overnight  and going green isn’t black and white. The reality is that even though we finance a lot of sustainable activities  we still finance more that’s not. Society is transitioning to a low-carbon economy. So are our clients  and so are we.Key takeaways from the report are:We continue to help set sector financing standards for decarbonisation. We’ve done so in steel and shipping and are collaborating on a new methodology for the aluminium sector.We’ve set 2030 and 2050 targets for not only upstream  but also the midstream and downstream parts of the oil & gas value chain. We’re also working to expand our approach into trade and commodity finance  with the aim of covering the full value chain of oil & gas under our Terra approach.We’re increasingly integrating climate into our decision-making and business processes.Besides oil & gas  we’re expanding our Terra approach into more areas including Business Banking (agriculture and transportation  in the Netherlands) and global commercial real estate.We make specific calls on sector level to governments and regulators to more firmly guide the transition with harmonised policies and incentives that accelerate the decarbonisation of the global economy.As insights on climate action are evolving rapidly  we continue to improve our approach. This report provides us and our stakeholders with the opportunity to reflect on the progress we've been making  and to look ahead to the areas where we can strive to do more  aim to go faster  drive increased collaboration and call for greater guidance.The 2023 Climate Report is available for download here.Note for editorsFor further information on ING  please visit www.ing.com.

Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The ATO platform  which has been successfully developed  has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T and other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). cGvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. BioSenic has been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early Phase IIa study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol.2) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform developed by BioSenic  with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. ALLOB has recently been evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late-delayed union. However  in June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in this exploratory Phase IIb clinical trial  interpreted as a failure of a too early cell injection  just after fracture. BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (choice between early or late treatment).Note: Biosenic has reevaluated a previous important and years-long clinical development program. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient subpopulation. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. This leads to a next generation of JTA  off-the-shelf enhanced viscosupplement to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives are intended to provide effective lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic (OA) pain and inflammation.The company  will nevertheless focus its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

With this project  Amoéba aims to develop a dedicated industrial site of over 3 000 sq.m for the bio-production of its biocontrol agent. This major project is part of the industrialization plan launched by Amoéba in preparation for the commercialization of its plant protection products expected for early 2025.Continuing to develop the biocontrol application:Collaboration with Nissan Chemical CorporationOn March 31  2023  Amoéba announced that  under a material transfer agreement  Nissan Chemical Corporation has launched a study to assess the performance of a mixture combining one of its products with an experimental biocontrol product from Amoéba.Creation of the AXPERA brandAs part of its pre-commercialization plan  Amoéba has developed an international brand for its biocontrol solution  reflecting the values of innovation  performance  responsibility and renewal. On June 5  2023  it announced that the brand name for its biocontrol solutions would be AXPERA  with its release planned for early 2025.Field tests continuing to make progress The objectives of the tests are primarily to:Assess AXPERA's efficacy and selectivity in the field on new targets (e.g. Arboriculture  Aromatic and ornamental plants  Strawberry  Garlic)Confirm AXPERA's efficacy and selectivity on mildew and Uncinula necator or powdery mildew affecting grapes.Position the product within leading local agricultural programs in Europe.Assess AXPERA's efficacy and selectivity with field tests for Soybean Rust in Brazil and Black Sigatoka affecting Bananas.Consolidate our efficacy data to further strengthen the applications for approval of the formulated product.Since 2019 and at the date of the half-year report  the Company has carried out 620 tests  including 200 partner tests. It will continue with its tests in 2023.FinancingThe Company announced the cancellation of the eighth optional tranche of 80 convertible bonds and the signing of a support contract with Redbridge Debt and Treasury Advisory  which aims to support the Company with adapting its financial strategy to its new industrial transformation challenges.Alongside this  Amoéba signed a new €9 million simple bond financing agreement with Nice & Green (see press release from February 15  2023 )with a view to launching its industrial project immediately.)with a view to launching its industrial project immediately. Amoéba also obtained €5.9m of funding from BPI France under the France 2030 program following its application for the ""Agrifood Capacity and Resilience"" call for projects.

Cash horizon secured through to the end of 2024. NFL BIOSCIENCES (Euronext Growth Paris - FR0014003XT0 - ALNFL)  a biopharmaceutical company developing botanical drugs for the treatment of addictions  is reporting its results for the first half of 2023  approved by the Board of Directors on October 5  2023. On this occasion  NFL Biosciences looks back on its recent progress  including the promising results of the PRECESTO exploratory study  and confirms that the strategy for reporting the CESTO II results will make it possible to take into account the entire study  which will remain double blind through to 12 months of monitoring  with the results of this Phase 2b study expected in July 2024. October 12  2023 at 2:30 pm CET - Webinar for shareholders and investors NFL Biosciences will discuss the promising results of the Phase 2a PRECESTO exploratory study  which demonstrated a clinically relevant effect of NFL-101 on the reduction of satisfaction with cigarettes  and the development strategy of CESTO II  its Phase 2b clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of NFL-101  currently underway on 318 smokers in 8 clinical investigation centers. NFL Biosciences executives will also discuss the development of NFL-301  a drug candidate to reduce alcohol consumption. >> Click here to register1. Promising results for the PRECESTO clinical trial PRECESTO is the second study after CESTO which highlights the effect of NFL-101 in terms of reducing smoking satisfaction. The clinically relevant effect is also more prolonged than expected. These results confirm the therapeutic interest of NFL-101 administered on its own or in combination with nicotine replacement therapies  which reduce withdrawal symptoms. They corroborate the results of the patent application filed in the United States in October 2022  increasing the probability of a patent being issued that would offer protection through to 2042 as a minimum. A detailed presentation of the results is appended. Optimization of the strategy for reporting on the CESTO II clinical trial Reminder: What is the CESTO II study? CESTO II is a multicentric  randomized  double blind and placebo-controlled phase 2b clinical trial. The trial is being conducted as follows: • Three arms (two dose arms and one placebo arm); • 318 smokers  aged 18 and over; • Monitoring over 12 months (CESTO2  NCT04571216); 1 Or type this webpage address in your browser: https://www.boursedirect.fr/fr/formations#webinaires 2 • The subjects receive two initial subcutaneous injections one week apart. Additional follow-up injections could be provided after three and six months for subjects who have not stopped smoking by these dates. This study's primary objectives are to select the best dose and assess the efficacy of NFL-101 versus placebo. The main criterion is continued abstinence for four weeks and the key secondary criterion is continued abstinence for six months  measured from 15 days after the first administration and confirmed by measuring exhaled CO. Other secondary criteria are also being studied  including continued abstinence for three months  nine months and 12 months  continued abstinence at the end of the treatment for three months and six months  and continued abstinence during the last three months of the study. A number of exploratory criteria will then be analyzed. The recruitment of subjects started in January 2022  gradually mobilizing a total of eight Clinical Investigation Centers (CIC) at CHU university hospital centers (Bordeaux  Clermont-Ferrand  Dijon  Lorient  Marseille  Montpellier  Poitiers and Rennes)  as well as the Eurofins-Optimed research institute (Grenoble). The final and 318th randomization was carried out at the start of May 2023. Data analysis and strategy for reporting the results An analysis of the results had been announced after reaching six months of monitoring for the 318th subject. Under this reporting strategy  the analysis of continued abstinence rates based on the data for the first six months monitored involved unblinding the study. This limited the opportunities to capitalize on the data collected between the 6th and 12th months  which would be considered as open data. Maintaining the blind during the planned 12 months of monitoring would make it possible to maximize the use of all the data collected during the CESTO II study. The observation of a more prolonged effect than expected during the PRECESTO study calls for a certain level of caution concerning an early review of the results leading to an unblinding before the end of the planned 12- month monitoring period. If an immune response is triggered by the administration of NFL-101  this could  in addition to an immediate effect that would support the success of an attempt to stop smoking  result in a longerterm effect in terms of preventing or managing relapses. The CESTO II study includes a hierarchy within the criteria for analysis: there is one primary criterion  then one key secondary criterion  six secondary criteria and a number of exploratory criteria. Each of the secondary criteria has a high level of clinical relevance. Maintaining the blind during the 12 months of monitoring will then make it possible to fully capitalize on the results obtained concerning these secondary criteria. For these three reasons  and because the CESTO II study has been the focus of the majority of the Company's resources for a total of around €8m  the decision has been taken to maximize the use of the data generated. This involves maintaining the blind through to the end of the planned observation period. The provisional schedule is as follows: • Final visit for the final subject included: start of May 2024 • Completion of the audits of the centers and review of the data collected: end-June 2024 • Unblinding and transfer of data for statistical analysis: mid-July 2024 • Reporting of results for the primary criterion  the key secondary criterion and the secondary criteria: end-July 2024 It is important to remember that the Company continues to be subject to the blind condition  in the same way as the subjects  the clinical centers and the Eurofins Optimed CRO. Collaboration with the CEA to study the mechanism of action of NFL-101 In February 2023  NFL Biosciences set up a research partnership with the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) to study the mechanism of action of its drug candidate NFL-101. This study is being led by the CEA's Paris-Saclay Pharmacological Neuroimaging team. It will focus on following  by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging  the modifications in the cerebral function associated with the development of tobacco addiction in mice  in order to highlight the central effects of NFL-101 treatment. The results are expected before the end of the first quarter of 2024. 3 Co-development of NFL-301  a drug candidate to reduce alcohol consumption Under the co-development agreement set up at the start of 2022  NFL Biosciences and its industrial partner Athena Pharmaceutiques have developed a prolonged-release form of kudzu plant extracts in microgranule form  NFL-301. NFL Biosciences aims to develop the first oral delivery drug based on kudzu extracts to tackle excessive alcohol consumption. NFL is preparing a pre-IND in the United States  which is expected to be submitted before the end of the fourth quarter of 2023  with a view to obtaining FDA approval for the manufacturing process  product quality and development strategy through to the MA. There are no plans for any significant spending on the development of NFL-301 over the next nine months. The current work primarily concerns regulatory and consultation aspects. Extension of intellectual property NFL Biosciences has continued moving forward with its intellectual property protection strategy for NFL-101 and NFL-301. Patent application for NFL-301: a patent application has been filed in the United States for the formulation of NFL-301 with a commitment to extending this globally. This first patent application for NFL-301 aims to protect prolonged-release formulations of extracts of kudzu  a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine  as well as their uses for the treatment of alcohol consumption reduction. Patent approval on NFL-101: NFL Biosciences has three patent families granting it extensive international protection for its drug candidate NFL-101  including Europe  the United States  China and Japan. Partnership strategy Looking beyond the studies underway (CESTO-II and the collaboration with CEA-Saclay)  NFL BIOSCIENCES will focus on continuing to develop NFL-101 in partnership with pharmaceutical companies that are interested in the addiction field. As part of its normal business operations  the Company has already had discussions with several international pharmaceutical companies. Considering the positive results seen with PRECESTO  these discussions could be ramped up. Regarding the partnership with THEMIS PHARMACEUTICALS in India  the development strategy in this country is also being reassessed following the results of the PRECESTO clinical trial. NFL Biosciences has been invited to attend two major business conferences over the coming months  where its discussions with pharmaceutical companies and institutional investors will continue: • Jefferies Healthcare annual conference (London  November 14-16  2023) • JP Morgan Healthcare annual conference (San Francisco  January 8-11  2024) Diversified sources of financing set up at the start of 2023: cash runway to the fourth quarter of 2024 At the start of 2023  NFL Biosciences successfully rolled out its financing strategy by applying for various grants and advances  and calling on the financial markets. In total  €4.2m were received during the first quarter of 2023 and €0.7m are still to be received as findings are generated confirming the success of the trials  representing a total secured amount of €4.9m (€3m through a capital increase and €1.9m of repayable advances or grants). This has enabled NFL Biosciences to secure financing to drive progress with its priority projects  and it has a cash horizon that now runs through to the fourth quarter of 2024. NFL Biosciences will continue to benefit from an organization with limited fixed costs. Looking further ahead  NFL Biosciences will need additional financing which  independently or combined  may come from (1) capital increases  (2) non-dilutive financing and (3) partnerships with pharmaceutical companies. Governance changes On February 27  2023  the Board of Directors appointed Dr Ignacio Faus  the Company's Chief Executive Officer  as Chairman of the Board of Directors for a period that will not exceed his term of office as a director  i.e. through to the end of the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting held in 2024 to approve the financial statements for the year ending December 31  2023. 4 On June 27  2023  the shareholders approved the appointment of Ms Dominique Côté as an independent director. Her three-year term of office will expire at the end of the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting held in 2026 to approve the financial statements for the year ending December 31  2025. 2023 first-half earnings The financial statements for the first half of 2023 (January 1  2023 - June 30  2023)  prepared in accordance with French GAAP  were approved by the Board of Directors during its meeting on October 5  2023.

This amount corresponds to part of the operating grant awarded by Bpifrance (total amount of €200K). Still in the clinical trials development stage  NFL Biosciences did not record any revenues during the last two years. In line with the resources allocated to drive progress with the programs presented above  and the Company's operations  EBIT came to €(2.4)m for the first half of 2023  compared with €(1.3)m for the same period in 2022. Payroll and social security contributions totaled €307K for four people at June 30  2023  compared with €254K for three people at June 30  2022. During the first half of 2023  NFL Biosciences recorded a research tax credit (CIR) of €203K  compared with €101K for the first half of 2022  with this change reflecting the ramping up of its research programs. Over the period  NFL Biosciences received €161K of prefinancing from the research tax credit reported in 2022  which totaled €397K. Financial income and expenses for the first half of 2023  which came to €71K  compared with €108K one year earlier  take into account the remuneration from investments of cash surpluses for €32K and the reversal of depreciation concerning the liquidity agreement for €39K. As a result  NFL Biosciences recorded €(2.1)m of net income over the period  compared with €(1.1)m at June 30  2022. At June 30  2023  the Company had €1.9m of shareholders' equity and €3.4m of available cash. Cash and cash equivalents reflect the capital increase carried out at the end of January 2023 (€3.0m)  as well as the advances granted by Bpifrance for the NFL-101 and NFL-301 clinical trials (€1.1m). In the third quarter of 2023  the Company received €550K of proceeds from the exercising of the BSA and BSPCE warrants from end-June and July 2023 for a total of €550K  as well as the first installment of the grant for the PRECESTO study for €140K. 5 Outlook for 2023 Dr Ignacio Faus  NFL Biosciences Chairman of the Board and CEO: ""We are very satisfied with the progress made in the past few months. We carried out the PRECESTO Phase 2a clinical trial while respecting the budget and timeframes that were set. The results achieved with PRECESTO  which are presented in detail in this press release  are very promising. PRECESTO is the first placebo-controlled clinical trial for NFL-101. We have shown that NFL-101 has a greater effect than placebo on reducing smoking satisfaction. For CESTO II  we also aim to complete this clinical trial on budget and on time. After reviewing the PRECESTO results  the Board of Directors decided to modify the schedule for reporting the CESTO-II results with a view to maximizing the study's potential. With regard to NFL-301  our product for reducing alcohol consumption  we have made progress with developing a new product formulation. Over the next nine months our development will continue moving forward. As we have already mentioned  NFL Biosciences has a very robust approach in place for managing fixed costs. We use the funds that are allocated to us with the greatest care and we focus them primarily on funding scientific studies. Thanks to this  the Company's cash horizon can be extended through to the end of 2024. Given the small size of the company  we will prioritize partnerships for the development of NFL-101 beyond the studies that are underway. Discussions have been started with major American and European pharmaceutical companies and  considering the positive results achieved with PRECESTO  they could now be accelerated"".Description",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,neutral,0.07,0.87,0.06,True,English,"['NFL BIOSCIENCES', 'FIRST-HALF BUSINESS', 'EARNINGS UPDATE', 'October', '01:12', 'placebo-controlled phase 2b clinical trial', 'PRECESTO Phase 2a exploratory study', 'Phase 2a PRECESTO exploratory study', 'CHU university hospital centers', 'eight Clinical Investigation Centers', 'two initial subcutaneous injections', 'multicentric, randomized, double blind', 'Phase 2b clinical study', 'CESTO II clinical trial', '8 clinical investigation centers', 'Phase 2b study', 'PRECESTO clinical trial', 'Additional follow-up injections', '€3m fundraising round', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'Eurofins-Optimed research institute', 'two dose arms', 'key secondary criterion', 'Other secondary criteria', 'CESTO II study', 'one placebo arm', 'continued abstinence rates', 'CESTO II results', 'NFL Biosciences executives', 'last three months', 'first six months', 'exploratory criteria', 'PRECESTO study', 'entire study', 'second study', 'Three arms', 'best dose', 'main criterion', 'first half', 'first administration', '2023 FIRST-HALF BUSINESS', 'EARNINGS UPDATE', 'drug candidate', 'smoking cessation', 'alcohol consumption', 'New formulation', 'France Relance', 'stimulus plan', 'Cash position', 'Cash horizon', 'biopharmaceutical company', 'botanical drugs', 'recent progress', 'therapeutic interest', 'replacement therapies', 'withdrawal symptoms', 'United States', 'detailed presentation', 'webpage address', 'primary objectives', 'four weeks', '318th randomization', '318th subject', 'early review', 'nine months', '12th months', 'relevant effect', 'prolonged effect', 'patent application', 'detailed analysis', 'smoking satisfaction', 'Promising results', 'reporting strategy', 'open data', 'development strategy', 'Data analysis', '12 months', 'July', 'Co-development', 'January', 'February', 'Bpifrance', 'September', 'end', 'ALNFL', 'treatment', 'addictions', 'Board', 'Directors', 'October', 'occasion', 'account', 'monitoring', 'Webinar', 'shareholders', 'investors', 'NFL-101', 'reduction', 'cigarettes', 'efficacy', '318 smokers', 'NFL-30', 'terms', 'combination', 'probability', 'protection', 'minimum', 'Optimization', 'browser', 'boursedirect', 'formations', 'subjects', 'dates', '15 days', 'number', 'recruitment', 'total', 'CIC', 'Bordeaux', 'Clermont-Ferrand', 'Dijon', 'Lorient', 'Marseille', 'Montpellier', 'Poitiers', 'Rennes', 'Grenoble', 'final', 'start', 'May', 'opportunities', '6th', 'use', 'observation', 'level', 'caution', '2024', '2:30']",2023-10-05,2023-10-06,marketscreener.com

It is moving its primary listing from London to New York.Another heavyweight  Smurfit Kappa  said earlier this month that it also plans to quit the Irish exchange for New York as part of a merger with a US peer.Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment is expected to leave the Irish market soon after it decided earlier this year to take out a listing in the US.These departures have prompted Zurich to announce the closure of its Irish Equity Fund.This fund invests in stocks listed on the Irish stock exchange.Zurich told brokers: “As the number and size of stocks listed on the exchange has reduced  the fund is becoming more concentrated as a result. For that reason  Zurich have taken the decision to close the fund.”It will close early next year.Zurich said it will no longer accept single premiums or switches into the fund.Regular premiums will continue to be invested in it and switches out of and withdrawals from the fund are permitted until the fund closes in early 2024.“We will be in contact with you in the coming months to confirm the closure date and to outline the closure process including customer communications ” it said in an email to investors and brokers.Broker Liam Ferguson  of Tullamore-based Ferga.com  said: “The closure of Zurich Life’s Irish Equity fund shows that the departure of some of the big hitters like Diageo  CRH and Flutter from Euronext Dublin has ripple effects.”Mr Ferguson said the Zurich Life Irish Equity Fund would typically own around 20 Irish shares  including Ryanair  Kerry Group  Kingspan  AIB  Bank of Ireland and Glanbia .When a Zurich Life policyholder chose to invest in this fund  the fund would buy more shares in each of the 20 companies.When this Zurich Life fund closes  it will no longer be buying Dublin-listed shares  he said.Mr Ferguson said that from a Zurich Life customer’s point of view  the closure should not have a dramatic impact on their investments.The Irish Equity fund was one of Zurich Life’s smaller funds and very few customers would have all of their investment or pension funds invested in it alone.He said: “Customers who did invest in this fund enjoyed a good return – the fund was up 12.8pc per year over the three years to the end of August this year.”Those that are invested in it will be offered another equity fund from the Zurich portfolio  Mr Ferguson said.He said the closure reinforces the advice that investors should diversify and keep their portfolio spread across industries and global regions rather than having all eggs in one basket.Zurich was contacted  but did not want to comment.,neutral,0.02,0.83,0.15,mixed,0.33,0.18,0.49,True,English,"['Irish equities fund', 'Dublin stock market', 'company delistings', 'Zurich', 'face', 'Construction materials giant CRH', 'Zurich Life Irish Equity Fund', 'The Irish Equity fund', 'Paddy Power owner', 'Tullamore-based Ferga.com', 'Broker Liam Ferguson', 'Zurich Life policyholder', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'Zurich Life customer', 'Zurich Life fund', 'Irish market', 'Irish exchange', '20 Irish shares', 'customer communications', 'Mr Ferguson', 'huge blow', 'Euronext Dublin', 'largest company', 'New York', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'single premiums', 'Regular premiums', 'coming months', 'big hitters', 'ripple effects', 'Kerry Group', 'dramatic impact', 'smaller funds', 'pension funds', 'good return', 'three years', 'global regions', 'one basket', 'Dublin-listed shares', 'Investment company', 'big companies', 'primary listing', 'US peer', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Zurich portfolio', '20 companies', 'response', 'number', 'London', 'heavyweight', 'part', 'merger', 'stocks', 'brokers', 'size', 'result', 'reason', 'decision', 'withdrawals', 'early', 'contact', 'date', 'process', 'email', 'investors', 'Diageo', 'Ryanair', 'Kingspan', 'AIB', 'Bank', 'Ireland', 'Glanbia', 'point', 'view', 'investments', 'customers', 'end', 'August', 'advice', 'industries', 'eggs']",2023-10-05,2023-10-06,independent.ie

December wheat BL2Z3 on Paris-based Euronext settled down 0.,"Updates with closing pricePARIS  Oct 6 (Reuters) - Euronext wheat ended slightly lower on Friday after a choppy week as traders grappled with mixed signs about supply from the Black Sea region.December wheat BL2Z3 on Paris-based Euronext settled down 0.2% at 236.00 euros ($249.83) a metric ton.Over the week  the contract was little changed  after recovering from a three-week low of 232.00 euro struck on Monday and again on Thursday.Renewed worries about the war in Ukraine pushed wheat futures higher in Chicago and Paris at Thursday's close  with attention focused on reports that a cargo ship hit a mine in the Black Sea.But reaction to the news subsided on Friday as the vessel suffered only minor damage while overall export competition from large Black Sea supplies continued to curb prices.“The mine exploding on the ship off the Ukrainian coast has created a lot of attention but the market is not very worried ” one German trader said.“Even though Russian attacks could stop the new Ukrainian shipping corridor quickly  Black Sea export supplies are so big it would not really be a big change for world supplies ” the trader said.Traders are watching to see if the mine incident affects Ukrainian efforts to re-establish a sea corridor to replace a safe export channel suspended in July when Russia pulled out of a Black Sea grain deal.At the same time  Ukraine is continuing to export via land and inland waterway routes through the European Union  with traders citing competitive prices to Germany and Italy.EU wheat exports  which are lagging last season's  have been reliant on Morocco and China. Traders estimate large sales of French wheat to China in September totaled at least 1 million metric tons.“China appears to be the main buyer of wheat outside of Russia and other Black Sea sources currently. China's national holiday week is ending and there are hopes Chinese buyers could return to the market next week "" another trader said.Dry weather was also a concern for wheat markets as it threatens yields in upcoming southern hemisphere harvests and planting in Ukraine.In France  farmers had sown 2% of the expected soft wheat area for next year's harvest by Oct. 2  farm office FranceAgriMer said on Friday.($1 = 0.9446 euros)(Reporting by Gus Trompiz in Paris and Michael Hogan in Hamburg; Editing by Rod Nickel)((gus.trompiz@thomsonreuters.com; +33 1 49 49 52 18; Reuters Messaging: gus.trompiz.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq  Inc.",neutral,0.16,0.83,0.01,negative,0.03,0.24,0.73,True,English,"['Black Sea supply', 'Paris wheat', 'quiet end', 'week', 'focus', 'upcoming southern hemisphere harvests', 'Black Sea grain deal', 'other Black Sea sources', 'new Ukrainian shipping corridor', 'Black Sea export supplies', 'large Black Sea supplies', 'Black Sea region', 'overall export competition', 'safe export channel', '1 million metric tons', 'December wheat BL2Z3', 'EU wheat exports', 'soft wheat area', 'national holiday week', 'one German trader', 'sea corridor', 'world supplies', 'large sales', 'Ukrainian coast', 'Ukrainian efforts', 'Euronext wheat', 'wheat futures', 'French wheat', 'wheat markets', 'closing price', 'choppy week', 'mixed signs', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'three-week low', 'minor damage', 'Russian attacks', 'big change', 'same time', 'waterway routes', 'European Union', 'main buyer', 'Chinese buyers', 'Dry weather', 'next year', 'farm office', 'Gus Trompiz', 'Michael Hogan', 'Rod Nickel', 'cargo ship', 'competitive prices', 'Reuters Messaging', 'mine incident', 'Updates', 'Friday', 'traders', 'supply', '236.00 euros', 'contract', '232.00 euro', 'Monday', 'Thursday', 'worries', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'Chicago', 'attention', 'reports', 'reaction', 'news', 'vessel', 'lot', 'July', 'land', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Morocco', 'China', 'September', 'hopes', 'concern', 'yields', 'planting', 'France', 'farmers', 'Oct.', '0.9446 euros', 'Hamburg', 'Editing', 'views', 'opinions', 'author', 'Nasdaq']",2023-10-06,2023-10-06,nasdaq.com
