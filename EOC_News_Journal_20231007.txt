Drawing on other sources  he estimated that China's overall US-bond holdings had been relatively stable since 2015.Though China's holdings appear to be slipping in official US Treasury International Capital data  the metric reflects only foreign holdings in US custodians  or the financial institutions that safeguard the assets  Setser said.""If a simple adjustment is made for Treasuries held by offshore custodians like Belgium's Euroclear  China's reported holdings of US assets look to be basically stable at between $1.8 and $1.9 trillion "" he wrote.Brad Setser/Council on Foreign RelationsAdded to that  the US data fails to capture US asset holdings that were handed over to third-party management. China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange is known to hold accounts at global bond and hedge funds  as well as private-equity firms  Setser said.AdvertisementAdvertisementHe added that even where China had reduced its Treasury holdings  the sales were much smaller than other data suggested and purchases of US debt in other forms  such agency bonds  had increased.Agency bonds are issued by government-sponsored enterprises  and some of the top issuers are US-backed firms such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.In fact  Beijing's agency bonds once outpaced its Treasury assets  Setser said. Though it moved away from that market during the Federal Reserve's quantitative-easing era  soaring yields on agency debt have brought back China's buying habit.In 2022 and the first six months of 2023  China purchased over $100 billion in agency debt and sold just $40 billion in Treasurys  he estimated.AdvertisementAdvertisement""Bottom line: the only interesting evolution in China's reserves in the past six years has been the shift into Agencies "" he wrote. ""That has resulted in a small reduction in China's Treasury holdings — but it also shows that it is a mistake to equate a reduction in China's Treasury holdings with a reduction in the share of China's reserves held in US bonds or the US dollar.""",neutral,0.04,0.8,0.16,mixed,0.19,0.15,0.66,True,English,"['former US official', 'Treasury bonds', 'China', 'yields', 'mystery', 'official US Treasury International Capital data', 'app Email address', 'blowout jobs report', 'Torsten Sløk', 'first six months', 'former Treasury official', 'strong economic data', 'official US data', 'worst market crashes', 'Apollo Global Management', 'past six years', 'overall US-bond holdings', 'US Treasury yields', 'US asset holdings', 'US debt assets', 'Treasury assets', 'other data', 'Treasury holdings', 'US bonds', 'US custodians', 'US assets', 'US dollar', 'third-party management', 'global bond', 'soaring yields', 'agency debt', 'large part', 'agency bonds', 'NEW LOOK', 'inside scoop', 'biggest stories', 'Read preview', 'favorite topics', 'personalized feed', 'Privacy Policy', 'bond-market rout', 'large sale', 'Foreign Relations', 'central bankers', 'rate hikes', 'bond rout', '$300 billion worth', 'incomplete picture', 'other sources', 'financial institutions', 'simple adjustment', 'offshore custodians', 'State Administration', 'Foreign Exchange', 'hedge funds', 'private-equity firms', 'other forms', 'government-sponsored enterprises', 'top issuers', 'US-backed firms', 'Fannie Mae', 'Freddie Mac', 'Federal Reserve', 'quantitative-easing era', 'buying habit', 'Bottom line', 'interesting evolution', 'foreign holdings', 'Brad Setser', 'small reduction', '16 years', 'China', 'stockpile', 'Treasurys', 'Beijing', 'today', 'markets', 'business', 'Something', 'Terms', 'Service', 'time', 'Advertisement', 'Council', 'highs', 'economists', 'explanations', 'history', 'inflation', 'Friday', 'fuel', 'country', 'Treasuries', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'accounts', 'sales', 'purchases', 'fact', 'reserves', 'shift', 'Agencies', 'mistake', 'share']",2023-10-06,2023-10-07,markets.businessinsider.com

The JP Morgan index managers said that they (FPIs) are mostly registered here "" a source said.In an active fund  the managers of the fund are free to decide their investment plans within the index as against a passively managed fund that 'tracks' an index and hence represents stickier flows. From a broader perspective  domestic fiscal developments or the global view on emerging markets could be factors that lead to churn in actively managed fund allocations.The JP Morgan index managers expressed optimism about the prevailing settlement process through tax certificates while acknowledging significant improvements in the turnaround time for FPI registrations.""These were the reasons the FPIs gave positive feedback to the index committee about India's inclusion this time after years of waiting and watching. This time around  73% of the investors representing 90% of the AUM agreed for index inclusion as against 50% the last time "" a source said.Last month  JP Morgan said that India will be included in its GBI-EM Global Index suite starting June 2024 and is expected to reach the maximum weight of 10% in the GBI-EM Global Diversified Index (GBI-EM GD) with inclusion of government bonds to be staggered over a 10-month period. The GBI-EM GD accounts for $213 billion of the estimated $236 billion benchmarked to the GBI-EM index family  JP Morgan said.At present  23 government bonds  which fall under the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) fully accessible route (FAR) category are eligible for index inclusion.""The index managers said that there would be conditions on trading metrics such as the bid-offer spreads of the eligible bonds. If the spreads are too wide or if the bond is lacking in liquidity  it can be excluded by the active fund managers and replaced with a liquid security. The overall weights will be decided based on the outstanding of each security "" a source said.The sources said that some discussions on tax structures were continuing between investors and the finance ministry  with the former presenting a case for how index inclusion-related flows would lead to lower borrowing costs for the Centre. Some discussions on the use of Belgium-based clearing platform Euroclear were also ongoing although investors are said to have communicated that the absence of the overseas clearing platform would not be a major hurdle.""When it comes to creating conducive conditions  the central bank has been very helpful and has held regular discussion with the overseas entities regarding any operational procedures "" a source said.",neutral,0.23,0.75,0.02,positive,0.7,0.29,0.02,True,English,"['JP Morgan Index', 'Most funds', 'foreign inflows', 'JP Morgan emerging market bond index', 'The JP Morgan index managers', 'GBI-EM Global Index suite', 'GBI-EM Global Diversified Index', 'The GBI-EM GD', 'GBI-EM index family', 'next calendar year', 'domestic fiscal developments', 'prevailing settlement process', 'Belgium-based clearing platform', 'overseas clearing platform', 'index inclusion-related flows', 'foreign portfolio investors', 'active fund managers', 'market participants', 'emerging markets', 'bond indices', 'global view', 'index committee', 'overseas flows', 'global investors', 'active funds', 'stickier flows', 'overseas entities', 'Many funds', 'fresh allocations', 'recent conversations', 'investment plans', 'broader perspective', 'tax certificates', 'significant improvements', 'turnaround time', 'FPI registrations', 'positive feedback', 'maximum weight', 'government bonds', '10-month period', 'Reserve Bank', 'accessible route', 'FAR) category', 'trading metrics', 'eligible bonds', 'overall weights', 'tax structures', 'finance ministry', 'borrowing costs', 'major hurdle', 'central bank', 'regular discussion', 'operational procedures', 'fund allocations', 'bid-offer spreads', 'liquid security', 'conducive conditions', 'total AUM', 'Mumbai', 'India', 'impact', 'December', 'assets', 'management', 'platforms', 'sources', 'matter', '$300 billion-AUM', 'positioning', 'March', 'FPIs', 'hence', 'factors', 'optimism', 'reasons', 'years', 'June', 'liquidity', 'outstanding', 'discussions', 'case', 'Centre', 'use', 'Euroclear', 'absence']",2023-10-06,2023-10-07,economictimes.indiatimes.com

The key event behind this development is the forthcoming inclusion of India in the GBI-EM Global Index suite from June 2024.The country's inclusion in the index suite will allow a 10% maximum weight in GBI-EM GD  a move that incorporates government bonds sanctioned by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This development will provide a significant boost to India's financial markets and is expected to attract substantial foreign investments.In addition to the index inclusion  ongoing dialogues between investors and the finance ministry on tax structures are also playing a crucial role. These discussions involve operational procedures related to tax certificates and the potential use of Euroclear  a Belgium-based clearing platform.These factors combined are expected to have a profound impact on the Indian economy  with JP Morgan's active funds playing a pivotal role in this transformation. The bank's index managers and registered Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) are set to guide these funds  further underlining their influence on the country's economic landscape.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

This unwinding corrects an accumulation of foreign-owned dollars and dollar denominated assets since the Second World War both in and outside the US financial system.Furthermore  collapsing collateral values  which are increasingly required backing for changing values in over $400 trillion nominal in interest rate swaps are a new driver for the crisis  forcing bond liquidation  driving prices down and yields higher: we are in a doom-loop.What action can the authorities take to ensure that counterparty risk from widespread failures won’t take out inadequately capitalised regulated exchanges?It seems that they acted some time ago by giving central security depositories (The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation  Euroclear  and Clearstream) the right to pool securities on their registers and lend them out as collateral. Your investments  which you think you may own can be absorbed into the failing financial system without your knowledge.This seems particularly relevant  given the appointment of JPMorgan Chase as custodian of the large gold ETF  SPDR Trust (ticker GLD). In a test case in the New York courts concerning Lehman’s failure  JPMC was given legal protection should it seize its customer’s assets.This important erosion of property rights is poorly understood. But as the financial distortions are unwound  leading to unintended consequences such as bank failures and ultimately the collapse of the dollar-based fiat currency regime  the implication is that holders of physical gold ETFs will be left owning an empty shell at a time when they might have expected some protection from the collapse of the value of credit.IntroductionIn today’s complex markets it is difficult for the layman to understand their workings. It has always been about the expansion and limitation of bank credit  which must never be confused with money  and which from the dawn of history has been physical metal  particularly gold. But that is the medium of exchange of last resort  hoarded by individuals  and in recent centuries by central banks. And the layman’s understanding is further undermined by state propaganda which has dominated markets particularly since the suspension of the gold standard in America in 1933  which had lasted a century. Subsequent events have intensified monetary disinformation  leading to a global fiat money system based on the US dollar.In order to give us all the illusion of price stability the Breton Woods Agreement was designed to promote the dollar as a gold substitute for all other currencies. That aspect of the illusion ended in 1971. Since then  to maintain the dollar’s credibility the US Government increasingly resorted to market manipulation. First  they tried selling gold into the market in the early seventies  which was readily bought and failed to stop the gold price from continuing to rise. The next wheeze was to create artificial demand for dollars in an attempt to support its purchasing power  measured against commodities and other currencies. This led to the expansion of derivative markets  which diverted speculative demand for commodities thereby suppressing their prices below where they would otherwise be. The expansion of the London bullion market which created paper gold  and the general adoption of the dollar not just to settle cross-border trade and commodity pricing but to replace gold in central banks’ reserves was all part of the deception.Over the fifty-two years since Bretton Woods was suspended  huge imbalances accumulated. In last week’s article I showed a table of bank and shadow bank dollar balances  onshore and offshore  which I repeat below.The offshore element is considerably larger than that registered in the US Treasury’s TIC numbers  which in itself tells us that foreign interest in onshore dollar investments and bank balances exceeds US GDP by a fair margin on its own. The offshore element is based on the Bank for International Settlements analysis of dollar deposits and obligations outside the US financial system which we can equate with the eurodollar market. In the main  they are currency forwards and swaps where one leg is in US dollars.Now that the financial bubble inflated by zero and negative interest rates is being lanced  these credit balances are bound to diminish. We can see why this is the case just with onshore long-term securities  comprised of bonds and equities  to which we must add the estimated $10.7 trillion of eurodollar long term bonds. That’s nearly $37 trillion in foreign-owned long-term investments overhanging US financial markets as bond yields start soaring  which is already in process. Including offshore eurodollars  it is a tsunami of dollar debt threatening to break on America’s shores.The role of collateral in the LDI crisisWhat is generally not understood by the layman is that it is inflated investments which underpin many over-the-counter derivative positions by acting as collateral. A problem arises when the value of collateral falls  triggering further calls. This attracted public attention in the UK when rising gilt yields threatened liability driven investment schemes  an example that we can use to improve our wider understanding of the role of collateral in derivative contracts  and the dangers presented by a collapse of the entire collateral system.Liability driven investment (LDI) was being used by UK pension funds to enhance their returns. Defined benefit schemes faced with expensive final salary commitments to their beneficiaries were unable to meet these commitments from their investments when central banks reduced interest rates to the zero bound and through QE suppressed bond yields to minimal levels. The only solution for these DB schemes was to enhance their returns through leverage.Typically  this was being achieved through a LDI scheme. It allowed a pension fund to protect itself from falling interest rates  which increases a pension fund’s future liabilities through net present value calculations. An LDI scheme provided leverage  so that the income on a gilt would be multiplied three of four times  allowing a pension fund to cover its future liabilities.The pension fund invested in an LDI scheme has effectively entered into a leveraged interest rate swap with the LDI provider. A rising interest rate imparts a negative value to the swap  fixed income stream becomes worth less than the yield offered in the market. This requires the pension fund to put up collateral to the LDI provider. And leverage multiplies the collateral called. But pension funds tend to be fully invested  and don’t have that liquidity to hand  and were exposed to a radical increase in bond yields.The crisis was triggered when markets became spooked by Liz Truss’s proposed budget in September 2022. Yields for the 10-year gilt rapidly rose from 3.88% to 4.5%. And for the 30-year maturity from 2.7% to 4.8%. In the latter case  the value of this gilt fell by 13% in a matter of days.This forced pension funds to liquidate assets  including their gilts which is why the Bank of England had to step in to support the gilt market. And only when it was apparent that the authorities were stabilising gilt prices  panic among pension fund managers and LDI providers subsided.LDI is going globalGilt yields have now risen to even higher levels today  with the ten-year gilt yielding 4.63% and the 30-year 5.07%  so far without the LDI panic returning. Obviously  that episode alerted pension fund managers to the dangers  and they will have addressed their LDI risk accordingly. But the same cannot be said for the wider use of collateral in international markets  for which the 10-year US Treasury note is the “risk-free” yardstick. And in Europe  it is the ten-year German bund against which other euro-area bonds are compared. The chart below shows how these yields have risen recently.LDI contracts are essentially interest rate swaps  exchanging a floating rate (in their case volatile gilt yields) for a fixed rate  usually enhanced through leverage. These characteristics are similar to those of the global interest rate swap market  which is enormous. According to the Bank for International Settlements at end-2022 it amounted to a nominal value of $405.5 trillion  of which $145.5 trillion is in dollars and $109.3 trillion equivalent in euros. With a shift in the global inflation and interest rate outlook  this is leading to mounting collateral demand from those who have taken the fixed rate leg. It is developing into a major crisis which probably requires much more than central bank intervention  such as that deployed by the Bank of England in the case of LDIs.Furthermore  collateral values backing these derivatives and other leveraged commitments have fallen sharply  adding to enormous and escalating amounts of collateral top-ups being required. And this is occurring at a time when bank credit is tightening  which is bound to lead to higher market rates for bond yields anyway  even without collateral demand from interest rate swaps being unwound.This is rapidly turning into a doom-loop  similar to that exposed by the UK’s LDI crisis  but involving the dollar  the euro  and all other major currencies. Additionally  US banks are probably heading towards a trillion dollars in mark to market losses on their bond positions  and as borrowing costs continue to rise the damage to their P&L accounts funding their bond holdings is increasing.Perhaps this persuaded the Fed to go easy on interest rate policy  the FOMC having put it on pause last month. If so  it didn’t work  because US Treasury note yields rose sharply in the wake of the last FOMC statement. And then there is the commercial real estate crisis in America  to which regional banks are particularly exposed. This is a situation which is already out of control  with escalating collateral demand forcing liquidation of bonds  driving borrowing costs and bond yields inexorably higher.It is becoming rapidly apparent to lenders that collateral values are likely to continue to fall  particularly for longer durations  and that leverage is the road to disaster. One question this raises  is that in their long-term planning have the authorities foreseen a possible collateral crisis of this sort and taken action to deal with it if it becomes reality. This question  but not the motivation is addressed in a new book by David Rogers Webb  The Great Taking.The taking of your securities for collateralWebb’s analysis initially centres on the dematerialisation of securities from certificate form into book entry on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation. It is the forerunner of Europe’s Clearstream and Euroclear. These are central securities depositories  closely allied to central clearing counterparties. Without the investing public being aware of the implications  certificated property ownership of securities has been replaced with a “security entitlement”.The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation also has a securities financing transaction clearing facility. From its website  we see that:“The SFT Clearing service introduces central clearing for equity securities financing transactions  including lending  borrowing and Repo to:Support central clearing of institutional clients’ equity SFTs intermediated by sponsoring members.Support central clearing of equity SFTs between full service NSCC members.Maximize capital efficiency and mitigates systemic risks by introducing more membership and cleared transaction opportunities for market participants.”[i]This confirms that pools of collateral are made available to institutions  without the knowledge of those who possess securities entitlements that there is another claim on them. They no longer have clear title to their investments.Since the US’s Uniform Commercial Code enacting these changes was introduced  other jurisdictions such as the European Union and UK have followed suite. Besides the erosion of property rights for owners of securities  the objective appears to be to give institutions and hedge funds access to everyone’s property for collateral purposes. And where losses occur such as in a systemic failure  instead of the central securities depository taking the losses  it is those with the newly defined securities entitlements: in other words  you and me.Undoubtedly  the framers of the Uniform Commercial Code had the protection of thinly capitalised exchanges in regulated markets in mind. We expect our transaction settlements to be guaranteed by regulated exchanges. But in a financial crisis leading to multiple counterparty failures  regulated markets cannot extend this protection. The solution has been to take this risk away from them and centralise it in central securities depositories  giving them the power to use the pools of securities under their control to ensure deliveries can continue under all circumstances. Not only does this allow collateral lending  but it transfers systemic risk from regulated exchanges to pools of securities entitlements.It appears that the corruption of security holders’ rights doesn’t stop there  as the Safe Harbour clause in US bankruptcy law legislation can also apply. The relationship between central securities depositories  such as the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation  and central clearing counterparties such as a systemically important bank enables this to happen.In a test case in New York between Lehman Brothers creditors and JPMorgan Chase which acted as Lehman’s clearing agent  the creditors sought to reclaim $8.6bn from JPMorgan Chase.[ii] This was the amount which was seized by the bank as if it was collateral in the days leading to Lehman’s failure. Prior to the seizure  it was an obligation to Lehman in the form of deposits and securities without a lien. Indeed  in the 92 page ruling  there were many references to the legal status of these obligations.It could be argued that without the safe harbour provisions in US bankruptcy law  the seizure of these assets would have been illegal. Indeed  this is the situation demonstrated under UK law  when JPMorgan was fined £33.32m by the Financial Services Authority in June 2010 for failing to ensure that client money  in other words funds which were custodial  was not properly segregated from the bank’s liabilities.We learn two things from these different rulings. The first is that following the precedent of the US court in New York  JPMorgan has the power to ignore the distinction between assets held as collateral and assets which the bank has an obligation to discharge to a depositor. And secondly  this US bank  which happens to be the largest and the Fed’s primary conduit into commercial banking has failed to distinguish between that relationship in US law and its legal and regulatory obligations in other jurisdictions  such as the UK.JPMorgan’s relationship with goldAt the outset  it is worth noting that regulatory bodies tend to give large banks the benefit of the doubt  only looking closely at their compliance activities when they can no longer be ignored. Consequently  large banks have been known to act as if regulations don’t exist. The example above  where it was absolutely plain that JPMorgan Chase was in breach of the regulations with respect to custodial client money in London may or may not have been an exception. We are entitled to assume that some of the smartest lawyers and compliance officers are employed by JPMorgan Chase who should have known better.This lack of respect for the law was demonstrated in an important case in the gold market  when JPMorgan Chase’s global head of precious metals trading and board member of the London Bullion Market Association was found guilty of attempted price manipulation  commodities fraud  wire fraud and spoofing prices in gold  silver  platinum  and palladium futures. And it is not as if this was an isolated case: it had been going on for eight years involving thousands of unlawful trading sequences. And another colleague heading up the New York gold desk was also found guilty. That was in July 2019. Finally  in 2020 the bank itself pleaded guilty to unlawful trading in precious metals futures markets and was heavily fined.Inexplicably  with this track record JPMorgan Chase Bank was recently appointed joint custodian of SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) alongside HSBC. This ETF is the largest in existence by far and its sponsor is a subsidiary of the World Gold Council. Why the WGC sanctioned the appointment of a bank whose senior dealers in precious metals have been found guilty of manipulating gold prices and jailed is a mystery. It is not as if having one custodian represents more risk than two. Furthermore  HSBC stores all GLD bullion in its London vaults  so that it is subject to English property law and securities regulation in every respect.JPMorgan Chase is reported to be considering the transfer of GLD’s bullion to its vaults in New York. It is thought that their vault is linked underground to the Fed’s vault  with the Fed on the north side of Liberty Street and Chase Bank across the road.[iii] It is in this context that we return to David Webb’s analysis of central counterparties  ownership of securities as property being replaced with a “security entitlement”  and the free use of that security entitlement as collateral without the knowledge or agreement of the entitled. And according to the ruling of the New York court effectively extending this facility to JPMorgan Chase as a central clearing counterparty  we may be assembling a picture which will allow JPMorgan Chase to use GLD’s bullion as collateral  or perhaps to lease or swap it  or alternatively to dispose of it in return for a book entry credit.Our suspicions will be increased when we think through the implications of the proximity of JPMorgan Chase’s vault to the Fed’s vault across the road and circumstantial evidence of a tunnel between the two. Stored in the Fed’s vault is gold for the New York Fed  earmarked for foreign central banks. And when we remember the difficulty Germany had getting the New York Fed to return a paltry 300 tonnes  doubtless our suspicions will go into overdrive.Undoubtedly  GLD’s trustee The Bank of New York Mellon and the World Gold Council have some serious questions to answer as to why JPMorgan Chase was appointed a custodian. Here are just a few suggestions:Did the Trustee of the World Gold Council come under pressure or recommendation from any government organisation or monetary authority to appoint JPMorgan Chase a custodian to the SPDR Trust?Were the Trustee and Council not aware that JPMorgan Chase has a history of market manipulation in gold contracts  and that the bank had pleaded guilty. According to the Office of Public Affairs in the US Department of Justice: “In September 2020  JPMorgan admitted to committing wire fraud in connection with: (1) unlawful trading in the markets for precious metals futures contracts; and (2) unlawful trading in the markets for U.S. Treasury futures contracts and in the secondary (cash) market for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds. JPMorgan entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement through which it paid more than $920 million in a criminal monetary penalty  criminal disgorgement  and victim compensation  with parallel resolutions by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities Exchange Commission announced on the same day.”[iv]Furthermore  that two of their senior staff were on trial when JPMorgan Chase was appointed custodian  one of which served on the board of the LBMA and ran JPMorgan’s global precious metals desk  and the other an executive director and trader on the New York precious metal desk? And that both men were subsequently jailed and fined for market manipulation in August?[v]Almost certainly  the Trustee and the World Gold Council’s management won’t be called upon to answer these questions. But the legal position of GLD shareholders’ underlying property assets is compromised by these developments.Furthermore  authorised participants can borrow their shares from a centralised securities depository and redeem them for physical gold. By hedging their position in futures or London’s forward markets  they are under no pressure to return the gold and close their stock loan. Given this facility  far from GLD being a secure investment in gold bullion  it may already be being used as a source of liquidity for bullion dealers.ConclusionThere can be little doubt that access to GLD’s property would be a partial solution to urgent problems arising from over fifty years of official suppression of the gold price. As I have written before  after extensive and careful research  analyst Frank Veneroso concluded as long ago as 2002 that between 10 000 and 14 000 tonnes of central bank gold were either leased or swapped. And he further concluded that much of that gold “was adorning Asian women” so would not be returned.We know that the Bank of England arranges these contracts for its central bank clients. We can only assume that the New York Fed similarly arranges these income generating activities on behalf of earmarked gold in its custody. Worse still is the thought that the New York Fed might have sold off earmarked gold into the markets  which would explain why it refused to let Bundesbank representatives inspect its gold  and initially proved extremely reluctant to return only 300 tonnes out of 1 536 tonnes of Germany’s gold supposedly held in the New York vault. And presumably  it was the Bundesbank’s experience which prompted the Dutch Central Bank to repatriate 122 tonnes of its gold from New York  leaving 190 tonnes behind at the New York Fed.With the failing of the fiat currency regime  the chickens of gold leasing and price suppression are now coming home to roost. It is becoming apparent that at a minimum the stagflationary conditions of the 1970s are returning  when gold rose from the official rate of $35 per ounce to over $800. And the Fed funds rate rose from about 6% to nearly 20%. After fifty-two years of currency debasement  the starting point for a new rise in the gold price is somewhere between $1500—$2000. And arguably  the dollar is in a far worse position today than it was when President Nixon suspended the Bretton Woods Agreement.The legal position in the US is shared with the EU and UK  whereby holders of shares in ETFs could find the property in them plundered through the agency of JPMorgan Chase and other central clearing counterparties  where  it seems  their status permits them to deploy bullion and other private property as they see fit.The bullion banks are currently trying to close their paper shorts and to go long  benefiting from the ignorance of speculators  who believe that higher interest rates are bad for gold. That may be true in markets devoid of systemic and inflation risks  but only these fellows below would take this seriously in the developing situation.Currently  bond yields are rising strongly  which means that collateral values are falling. It amounts to a credit contraction of up to 30% on longer dated bonds so far. And where collateral backs leveraged interest rate swap positions  calls can be catastrophic.Fairly quickly  the gold price can be expected to reflect systemic and currency risks  which will trump any meme the three wise monkeys might come up with. Driving the dollar’s falling value measured in goods will be the funding outlook for the US Government. With interest costs likely to rise to $1.5 trillion in the fiscal year just started and the onset of economic stagnation if not outright recession  the budget deficit could easily top $3.5 trillion  perhaps eight or nine per cent of expenditure. And this is at a time of diminishing foreign appetite for US Treasuries.This takes us back to the enormous mountain of dollar credit in foreign hands  quantified in the table at the beginning of the article. Long term investments  totalling $26.113 trillion  plus a further $10.7 trillion in Eurobonds will all fall in value as interest rates continue to rise. There can be no doubt that foreigners will sell these positions down. Their only problem is what to do with cash dollars  which already amount to over $100 trillion. Other currencies are mostly less attractive than the dollar. There is only one thing to be done  and that is to follow the Singaporeans  who have the prescience to accumulate hard real money without counterparty risk  which is physical gold.And finally  there are geopolitical considerations. The deteriorating collateral position is surely being observed with concern in Asia and the Global South. The sudden rise in US Treasury bond yields is signalling that a global version of the UK’s liability driven investment debacle is already developing  in which case the collapse of financial market values could escalate rapidly from here.It is against this background that Russia and Saudi Arabia are driving up energy prices  leading to rising CPI inflation and expectations of higher interest rates to come. Commercial banks will almost certainly intensify credit restrictions as well. Viewed from outside America  it all amounts to intolerable pressures on the US and Eurozone credit systems. And if Russia  perhaps followed by China decide to deploy their gold reserves in order to secure the value of their currencies  it is bound to be the coup de grace for the fiat currency system.[i] See https://dtcclearning.com/products-and-services/equities-clearing/sft-clearing.html[ii] See https://www.nysb.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/198038_134_opinion.pdf[iii] See Ronan Manly’s article at https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/ronan-manly/keys-gold-vaults-new-york-fed-part-2-auxiliary-vault/[iv] See https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-jp-morgan-precious-metals-traders-sentenced-prison[v] Ibid.Reprinted with the author’s permission.The Best of Alasdair Macleod,neutral,0.14,0.86,0.01,negative,0.02,0.17,0.81,True,English,"['Financial System', 'dollar-based fiat currency regime', 'global fiat money system', 'eurodollar long term bonds', 'shadow bank dollar balances', 'Second World War', 'International Settlements analysis', 'failing financial system', 'central security depositories', 'negative interest rates', 'The Depository Trust', 'New York courts', 'Breton Woods Agreement', 'US financial system', 'central banks’ reserves', 'London bullion market', 'onshore long-term securities', 'financial asset values', 'large gold ETF', 'foreign-owned long-term investments', 'interest rate swaps', 'onshore dollar investments', 'physical gold ETFs', 'collapsing collateral values', 'dollar denominated assets', 'falling bond prices', 'US financial markets', 'eurodollar market', 'currency forwards', 'foreign interest', 'bank balances', 'financial transactions', 'financial distortions', 'financial bubble', 'new driver', 'SPDR Trust', 'physical metal', 'Bretton Woods', 'US dollar', 'credit balances', 'US Government', 'US Treasury', 'US GDP', 'bond liquidation', 'foreign-owned dollars', 'dollar liquidation', 'dollar deposits', 'dollar debt', 'collateral side', 'significant problems', 'foreign hands', 'counterparty risk', 'widespread failures', 'regulated exchanges', 'Clearing Corporation', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'important erosion', 'property rights', 'unintended consequences', 'bank failures', 'empty shell', 'last resort', 'recent centuries', 'state propaganda', 'Subsequent events', 'monetary disinformation', 'price stability', 'other currencies', 'market manipulation', 'early seventies', 'next wheeze', 'artificial demand', 'purchasing power', 'speculative demand', 'general adoption', 'cross-border trade', 'commodity pricing', 'fifty-two years', 'huge imbalances', 'last week', 'offshore element', 'TIC numbers', 'fair margin', 'one leg', 'offshore eurodollars', 'gold standard', 'gold substitute', 'gold price', 'paper gold', 'dollar credit', 'bond yields', 'bank credit', 'complex markets', 'derivative markets', 'veritable tsunami', 'test case', 'legal protection', 'article', 'time', 'unwinding', 'nominal', 'crisis', 'doom-loop', 'authorities', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'registers', 'knowledge', 'appointment', 'custodian', 'ticker', 'GLD', 'Lehman', 'JPMC', 'customer', 'collapse', 'holders', 'Introduction', 'today', 'layman', 'workings', 'expansion', 'limitation', 'dawn', 'history', 'medium', 'individuals', 'understanding', 'suspension', 'America', 'illusion', 'aspect', 'credibility', 'attempt', 'commodities', 'deception', 'obligations', 'main', 'zero', 'equities', 'process']",2023-10-06,2023-10-07,lewrockwell.com
31134,Euroclear,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-really-dumping-treasury-bonds-002534002.html?ref=biztoc.com,Is China really dumping Treasury bonds and sending yields higher? A former US official explains the mystery,A large swath of China's US-bond holdings is not accounted for in official Treasury data  Brad Setser wrote for the Council on Foreign Relations.,"ReutersChina is not dumping its stockpile of US bonds  Brad Setser  a former Treasury official  wrote.A large part of China's holdings is not accounted for in official US data  he said.While it has sold some Treasurys  Beijing has bought up US debt in the form of agency bonds.China isn't fueling the bond-market rout with a large sale of its Treasury holdings but is instead reshuffling its US debt assets  Brad Setser  a former Treasury official  wrote for the Council on Foreign Relations.With US Treasury yields surging to highs not seen in 16 years  economists have been looking for explanations for what is now one of the worst market crashes in history.To be sure  central bankers have suggested more rate hikes are necessary to slow inflation  and strong economic data such as Friday's blowout jobs report has added fuel to the bond rout.Apollo Global Management's Torsten Sløk also pointed to China recently  citing official US data that showed the country had sold $300 billion worth of Treasurys since 2021.But Setser said such data presented an incomplete picture. Drawing on other sources  he estimated that China's overall US-bond holdings had been relatively stable since 2015.Though China's holdings appear to be slipping in official US Treasury International Capital data  the metric reflects only foreign holdings in US custodians  or the financial institutions that safeguard the assets  Setser said.""If a simple adjustment is made for Treasuries held by offshore custodians like Belgium's Euroclear  China's reported holdings of US assets look to be basically stable at between $1.8 and $1.9 trillion "" he wrote.Brad Setser/Council on Foreign RelationsAdded to that  the US data fails to capture US asset holdings that were handed over to third-party management. China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange is known to hold accounts at global bond and hedge funds  as well as private-equity firms  Setser said.He added that even where China had reduced its Treasury holdings  the sales were much smaller than other data suggested and purchases of US debt in other forms  such agency bonds  had increased.Story continuesAgency bonds are issued by government-sponsored enterprises  and some of the top issuers are US-backed firms such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.In fact  Beijing's agency bonds once outpaced its Treasury assets  Setser said. Though it moved away from that market during the Federal Reserve's quantitative-easing era  soaring yields on agency debt have brought back China's buying habit.In 2022 and the first six months of 2023  China purchased over $100 billion in agency debt and sold just $40 billion in Treasurys  he estimated.""Bottom line: the only interesting evolution in China's reserves in the past six years has been the shift into Agencies "" he wrote. ""That has resulted in a small reduction in China's Treasury holdings — but it also shows that it is a mistake to equate a reduction in China's Treasury holdings with a reduction in the share of China's reserves held in US bonds or the US dollar.""Read the original article on Business Insider",neutral,0.04,0.8,0.16,negative,0.03,0.2,0.77,True,English,"['former US official', 'Treasury bonds', 'China', 'yields', 'mystery', 'official US Treasury International Capital data', 'blowout jobs report', 'Torsten Sløk', 'first six months', 'former Treasury official', 'strong economic data', 'official US data', 'worst market crashes', 'Apollo Global Management', 'past six years', 'overall US-bond holdings', 'US Treasury yields', 'US asset holdings', 'US debt assets', 'Treasury assets', 'other data', 'Treasury holdings', 'US bonds', 'US custodians', 'US assets', 'US dollar', 'third-party management', 'global bond', 'soaring yields', 'agency debt', 'large part', 'agency bonds', 'bond-market rout', 'large sale', 'Foreign Relations', 'central bankers', 'rate hikes', 'bond rout', '$300 billion worth', 'incomplete picture', 'other sources', 'financial institutions', 'simple adjustment', 'offshore custodians', 'State Administration', 'Foreign Exchange', 'hedge funds', 'private-equity firms', 'other forms', 'government-sponsored enterprises', 'top issuers', 'US-backed firms', 'Fannie Mae', 'Freddie Mac', 'Federal Reserve', 'quantitative-easing era', 'buying habit', 'Bottom line', 'interesting evolution', 'original article', 'Business Insider', 'foreign holdings', 'Brad Setser', 'small reduction', '16 years', 'Reuters', 'China', 'stockpile', 'Treasurys', 'Beijing', 'Council', 'highs', 'economists', 'explanations', 'history', 'inflation', 'Friday', 'fuel', 'country', 'Treasuries', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'accounts', 'sales', 'purchases', 'fact', 'reserves', 'shift', 'Agencies', 'mistake', 'share']",2023-10-07,2023-10-07,finance.yahoo.com

This unwinding corrects an accumulation of foreign-owned dollars and dollar denominated assets since the Second World War both in and outside the US financial system.Furthermore  collapsing collateral values  which are increasingly required backing for changing values in over $400 trillion nominal in interest rate swaps are a new driver for the crisis  forcing bond liquidation  driving prices down and yields higher: we are in a doom-loop.What action can the authorities take to ensure that counterparty risk from widespread failures won’t take out inadequately capitalised regulated exchanges?It seems that they acted some time ago by giving central security depositories (The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation  Euroclear  and Clearstream) the right to pool securities on their registers and lend them out as collateral. Your investments  which you think you may own can be absorbed into the failing financial system without your knowledge.This seems particularly relevant  given the appointment of JPMorgan Chase as custodian of the large gold ETF  SPDR Trust (ticker GLD). In a test case in the New York courts concerning Lehman’s failure  JPMC was given legal protection should it seize its customer’s assets.This important erosion of property rights is poorly understood. But as the financial distortions are unwound  leading to unintended consequences such as bank failures and ultimately the collapse of the dollar-based fiat currency regime  the implication is that holders of physical gold ETFs will be left owning an empty shell at a time when they might have expected some protection from the collapse of the value of credit.IntroductionIn today’s complex markets it is difficult for the layman to understand their workings. It has always been about the expansion and limitation of bank credit  which must never be confused with money  and which from the dawn of history has been physical metal  particularly gold. But that is the medium of exchange of last resort  hoarded by individuals  and in recent centuries by central banks. And the layman’s understanding is further undermined by state propaganda which has dominated markets particularly since the suspension of the gold standard in America in 1933  which had lasted a century. Subsequent events have intensified monetary disinformation  leading to a global fiat money system based on the US dollar.In order to give us all the illusion of price stability the Breton Woods Agreement was designed to promote the dollar as a gold substitute for all other currencies. That aspect of the illusion ended in 1971. Since then  to maintain the dollar’s credibility the US Government increasingly resorted to market manipulation. First  they tried selling gold into the market in the early seventies  which was readily bought and failed to stop the gold price from continuing to rise. The next wheeze was to create artificial demand for dollars in an attempt to support its purchasing power  measured against commodities and other currencies. This led to the expansion of derivative markets  which diverted speculative demand for commodities thereby suppressing their prices below where they would otherwise be. The expansion of the London bullion market which created paper gold  and the general adoption of the dollar not just to settle cross-border trade and commodity pricing but to replace gold in central banks’ reserves was all part of the deception.Over the fifty-two years since Bretton Woods was suspended  huge imbalances accumulated. In last week’s article I showed a table of bank and shadow bank dollar balances  onshore and offshore  which I repeat below.The offshore element is considerably larger than that registered in the US Treasury’s TIC numbers  which in itself tells us that foreign interest in onshore dollar investments and bank balances exceeds US GDP by a fair margin on its own. The offshore element is based on the Bank for International Settlements analysis of dollar deposits and obligations outside the US financial system which we can equate with the eurodollar market. In the main  they are currency forwards and swaps where one leg is in US dollars.Now that the financial bubble inflated by zero and negative interest rates is being lanced  these credit balances are bound to diminish. We can see why this is the case just with onshore long-term securities  comprised of bonds and equities  to which we must add the estimated $10.7 trillion of eurodollar long term bonds. That’s nearly $37 trillion in foreign-owned long-term investments overhanging US financial markets as bond yields start soaring  which is already in process. Including offshore eurodollars  it is a tsunami of dollar debt threatening to break on America’s shores.The role of collateral in the LDI crisisWhat is generally not understood by the layman is that it is inflated investments which underpin many over-the-counter derivative positions by acting as collateral. A problem arises when the value of collateral falls  triggering further calls. This attracted public attention in the UK when rising gilt yields threatened liability driven investment schemes  an example that we can use to improve our wider understanding of the role of collateral in derivative contracts  and the dangers presented by a collapse of the entire collateral system.Liability driven investment (LDI) was being used by UK pension funds to enhance their returns. Defined benefit schemes faced with expensive final salary commitments to their beneficiaries were unable to meet these commitments from their investments when central banks reduced interest rates to the zero bound and through QE suppressed bond yields to minimal levels. The only solution for these DB schemes was to enhance their returns through leverage.Typically  this was being achieved through a LDI scheme. It allowed a pension fund to protect itself from falling interest rates  which increases a pension fund’s future liabilities through net present value calculations. An LDI scheme provided leverage  so that the income on a gilt would be multiplied three of four times  allowing a pension fund to cover its future liabilities.The pension fund invested in an LDI scheme has effectively entered into a leveraged interest rate swap with the LDI provider. A rising interest rate imparts a negative value to the swap  fixed income stream becomes worth less than the yield offered in the market. This requires the pension fund to put up collateral to the LDI provider. And leverage multiplies the collateral called. But pension funds tend to be fully invested  and don’t have that liquidity to hand  and were exposed to a radical increase in bond yields.The crisis was triggered when markets became spooked by Liz Truss’s proposed budget in September 2022. Yields for the 10-year gilt rapidly rose from 3.88% to 4.5%. And for the 30-year maturity from 2.7% to 4.8%. In the latter case  the value of this gilt fell by 13% in a matter of days.This forced pension funds to liquidate assets  including their gilts which is why the Bank of England had to step in to support the gilt market. And only when it was apparent that the authorities were stabilising gilt prices  panic among pension fund managers and LDI providers subsided.LDI is going globalGilt yields have now risen to even higher levels today  with the ten-year gilt yielding 4.63% and the 30-year 5.07%  so far without the LDI panic returning. Obviously  that episode alerted pension fund managers to the dangers  and they will have addressed their LDI risk accordingly. But the same cannot be said for the wider use of collateral in international markets  for which the 10-year US Treasury note is the “risk-free” yardstick. And in Europe  it is the ten-year German bund against which other euro-area bonds are compared. The chart below shows how these yields have risen recently.LDI contracts are essentially interest rate swaps  exchanging a floating rate (in their case volatile gilt yields) for a fixed rate  usually enhanced through leverage. These characteristics are similar to those of the global interest rate swap market  which is enormous. According to the Bank for International Settlements at end-2022 it amounted to a nominal value of $405.5 trillion  of which $145.5 trillion is in dollars and $109.3 trillion equivalent in euros. With a shift in the global inflation and interest rate outlook  this is leading to mounting collateral demand from those who have taken the fixed rate leg. It is developing into a major crisis which probably requires much more than central bank intervention  such as that deployed by the Bank of England in the case of LDIs.Furthermore  collateral values backing these derivatives and other leveraged commitments have fallen sharply  adding to enormous and escalating amounts of collateral top-ups being required. And this is occurring at a time when bank credit is tightening  which is bound to lead to higher market rates for bond yields anyway  even without collateral demand from interest rate swaps being unwound.This is rapidly turning into a doom-loop  similar to that exposed by the UK’s LDI crisis  but involving the dollar  the euro  and all other major currencies. Additionally  US banks are probably heading towards a trillion dollars in mark to market losses on their bond positions  and as borrowing costs continue to rise the damage to their P&L accounts funding their bond holdings is increasing.Perhaps this persuaded the Fed to go easy on interest rate policy  the FOMC having put it on pause last month. If so  it didn’t work  because US Treasury note yields rose sharply in the wake of the last FOMC statement. And then there is the commercial real estate crisis in America  to which regional banks are particularly exposed. This is a situation which is already out of control  with escalating collateral demand forcing liquidation of bonds  driving borrowing costs and bond yields inexorably higher.It is becoming rapidly apparent to lenders that collateral values are likely to continue to fall  particularly for longer durations  and that leverage is the road to disaster. One question this raises  is that in their long-term planning have the authorities foreseen a possible collateral crisis of this sort and taken action to deal with it if it becomes reality. This question  but not the motivation is addressed in a new book by David Rogers Webb  The Great Taking.The taking of your securities for collateralWebb’s analysis initially centres on the dematerialisation of securities from certificate form into book entry on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation. It is the forerunner of Europe’s Clearstream and Euroclear. These are central securities depositories  closely allied to central clearing counterparties. Without the investing public being aware of the implications  certificated property ownership of securities has been replaced with a “security entitlement”.The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation also has a securities financing transaction clearing facility. From its website  we see that:“The SFT Clearing service introduces central clearing for equity securities financing transactions  including lending  borrowing and Repo to:Support central clearing of institutional clients’ equity SFTs intermediated by sponsoring members.Support central clearing of equity SFTs between full service NSCC members.Maximize capital efficiency and mitigates systemic risks by introducing more membership and cleared transaction opportunities for market participants.”[i]This confirms that pools of collateral are made available to institutions  without the knowledge of those who possess securities entitlements that there is another claim on them. They no longer have clear title to their investments.Since the US’s Uniform Commercial Code enacting these changes was introduced  other jurisdictions such as the European Union and UK have followed suite. Besides the erosion of property rights for owners of securities  the objective appears to be to give institutions and hedge funds access to everyone’s property for collateral purposes. And where losses occur such as in a systemic failure  instead of the central securities depository taking the losses  it is those with the newly defined securities entitlements: in other words  you and me.Undoubtedly  the framers of the Uniform Commercial Code had the protection of thinly capitalised exchanges in regulated markets in mind. We expect our transaction settlements to be guaranteed by regulated exchanges. But in a financial crisis leading to multiple counterparty failures  regulated markets cannot extend this protection. The solution has been to take this risk away from them and centralise it in central securities depositories  giving them the power to use the pools of securities under their control to ensure deliveries can continue under all circumstances. Not only does this allow collateral lending  but it transfers systemic risk from regulated exchanges to pools of securities entitlements.It appears that the corruption of security holders’ rights doesn’t stop there  as the Safe Harbour clause in US bankruptcy law legislation can also apply. The relationship between central securities depositories  such as the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation  and central clearing counterparties such as a systemically important bank enables this to happen.In a test case in New York between Lehman Brothers creditors and JPMorgan Chase which acted as Lehman’s clearing agent  the creditors sought to reclaim $8.6bn from JPMorgan Chase.[ii] This was the amount which was seized by the bank as if it was collateral in the days leading to Lehman’s failure. Prior to the seizure  it was an obligation to Lehman in the form of deposits and securities without a lien. Indeed  in the 92 page ruling  there were many references to the legal status of these obligations.It could be argued that without the safe harbour provisions in US bankruptcy law  the seizure of these assets would have been illegal. Indeed  this is the situation demonstrated under UK law  when JPMorgan was fined £33.32m by the Financial Services Authority in June 2010 for failing to ensure that client money  in other words funds which were custodial  was not properly segregated from the bank’s liabilities.We learn two things from these different rulings. The first is that following the precedent of the US court in New York  JPMorgan has the power to ignore the distinction between assets held as collateral and assets which the bank has an obligation to discharge to a depositor. And secondly  this US bank  which happens to be the largest and the Fed’s primary conduit into commercial banking has failed to distinguish between that relationship in US law and its legal and regulatory obligations in other jurisdictions  such as the UK.JPMorgan’s relationship with goldAt the outset  it is worth noting that regulatory bodies tend to give large banks the benefit of the doubt  only looking closely at their compliance activities when they can no longer be ignored. Consequently  large banks have been known to act as if regulations don’t exist. The example above  where it was absolutely plain that JPMorgan Chase was in breach of the regulations with respect to custodial client money in London may or may not have been an exception. We are entitled to assume that some of the smartest lawyers and compliance officers are employed by JPMorgan Chase who should have known better.This lack of respect for the law was demonstrated in an important case in the gold market  when JPMorgan Chase’s global head of precious metals trading and board member of the London Bullion Market Association was found guilty of attempted price manipulation  commodities fraud  wire fraud and spoofing prices in gold  silver  platinum  and palladium futures. And it is not as if this was an isolated case: it had been going on for eight years involving thousands of unlawful trading sequences. And another colleague heading up the New York gold desk was also found guilty. That was in July 2019. Finally  in 2020 the bank itself pleaded guilty to unlawful trading in precious metals futures markets and was heavily fined.Inexplicably  with this track record JPMorgan Chase Bank was recently appointed joint custodian of SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) alongside HSBC. This ETF is the largest in existence by far and its sponsor is a subsidiary of the World Gold Council. Why the WGC sanctioned the appointment of a bank whose senior dealers in precious metals have been found guilty of manipulating gold prices and jailed is a mystery. It is not as if having one custodian represents more risk than two. Furthermore  HSBC stores all GLD bullion in its London vaults  so that it is subject to English property law and securities regulation in every respect.JPMorgan Chase is reported to be considering the transfer of GLD’s bullion to its vaults in New York. It is thought that their vault is linked underground to the Fed’s vault  with the Fed on the north side of Liberty Street and Chase Bank across the road.[iii] It is in this context that we return to David Webb’s analysis of central counterparties  ownership of securities as property being replaced with a “security entitlement”  and the free use of that security entitlement as collateral without the knowledge or agreement of the entitled. And according to the ruling of the New York court effectively extending this facility to JPMorgan Chase as a central clearing counterparty  we may be assembling a picture which will allow JPMorgan Chase to use GLD’s bullion as collateral  or perhaps to lease or swap it  or alternatively to dispose of it in return for a book entry credit.Our suspicions will be increased when we think through the implications of the proximity of JPMorgan Chase’s vault to the Fed’s vault across the road and circumstantial evidence of a tunnel between the two. Stored in the Fed’s vault is gold for the New York Fed  earmarked for foreign central banks. And when we remember the difficulty Germany had getting the New York Fed to return a paltry 300 tonnes  doubtless our suspicions will go into overdrive.Undoubtedly  GLD’s trustee The Bank of New York Mellon and the World Gold Council have some serious questions to answer as to why JPMorgan Chase was appointed a custodian. Here are just a few suggestions:Did the Trustee of the World Gold Council come under pressure or recommendation from any government organisation or monetary authority to appoint JPMorgan Chase a custodian to the SPDR Trust?Were the Trustee and Council not aware that JPMorgan Chase has a history of market manipulation in gold contracts  and that the bank had pleaded guilty. According to the Office of Public Affairs in the US Department of Justice: “In September 2020  JPMorgan admitted to committing wire fraud in connection with: (1) unlawful trading in the markets for precious metals futures contracts; and (2) unlawful trading in the markets for U.S. Treasury futures contracts and in the secondary (cash) market for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds. JPMorgan entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement through which it paid more than $920 million in a criminal monetary penalty  criminal disgorgement  and victim compensation  with parallel resolutions by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities Exchange Commission announced on the same day.”[iv]Furthermore  that two of their senior staff were on trial when JPMorgan Chase was appointed custodian  one of which served on the board of the LBMA and ran JPMorgan’s global precious metals desk  and the other an executive director and trader on the New York precious metal desk? And that both men were subsequently jailed and fined for market manipulation in August?[v]Almost certainly  the Trustee and the World Gold Council’s management won’t be called upon to answer these questions. But the legal position of GLD shareholders’ underlying property assets is compromised by these developments.Furthermore  authorised participants can borrow their shares from a centralised securities depository and redeem them for physical gold. By hedging their position in futures or London’s forward markets  they are under no pressure to return the gold and close their stock loan. Given this facility  far from GLD being a secure investment in gold bullion  it may already be being used as a source of liquidity for bullion dealers.ConclusionThere can be little doubt that access to GLD’s property would be a partial solution to urgent problems arising from over fifty years of official suppression of the gold price. As I have written before  after extensive and careful research  analyst Frank Veneroso concluded as long ago as 2002 that between 10 000 and 14 000 tonnes of central bank gold were either leased or swapped. And he further concluded that much of that gold “was adorning Asian women” so would not be returned.We know that the Bank of England arranges these contracts for its central bank clients. We can only assume that the New York Fed similarly arranges these income generating activities on behalf of earmarked gold in its custody. Worse still is the thought that the New York Fed might have sold off earmarked gold into the markets  which would explain why it refused to let Bundesbank representatives inspect its gold  and initially proved extremely reluctant to return only 300 tonnes out of 1 536 tonnes of Germany’s gold supposedly held in the New York vault. And presumably  it was the Bundesbank’s experience which prompted the Dutch Central Bank to repatriate 122 tonnes of its gold from New York  leaving 190 tonnes behind at the New York Fed.With the failing of the fiat currency regime  the chickens of gold leasing and price suppression are now coming home to roost. It is becoming apparent that at a minimum the stagflationary conditions of the 1970s are returning  when gold rose from the official rate of $35 per ounce to over $800. And the Fed funds rate rose from about 6% to nearly 20%. After fifty-two years of currency debasement  the starting point for a new rise in the gold price is somewhere between $1500—$2000. And arguably  the dollar is in a far worse position today than it was when President Nixon suspended the Bretton Woods Agreement.The legal position in the US is shared with the EU and UK  whereby holders of shares in ETFs could find the property in them plundered through the agency of JPMorgan Chase and other central clearing counterparties  where  it seems  their status permits them to deploy bullion and other private property as they see fit.The bullion banks are currently trying to close their paper shorts and to go long  benefiting from the ignorance of speculators  who believe that higher interest rates are bad for gold. That may be true in markets devoid of systemic and inflation risks  but only these fellows below would take this seriously in the developing situation.Currently  bond yields are rising strongly  which means that collateral values are falling. It amounts to a credit contraction of up to 30% on longer dated bonds so far. And where collateral backs leveraged interest rate swap positions  calls can be catastrophic.Fairly quickly  the gold price can be expected to reflect systemic and currency risks  which will trump any meme the three wise monkeys might come up with. Driving the dollar’s falling value measured in goods will be the funding outlook for the US Government. With interest costs likely to rise to $1.5 trillion in the fiscal year just started and the onset of economic stagnation if not outright recession  the budget deficit could easily top $3.5 trillion  perhaps eight or nine per cent of expenditure. And this is at a time of diminishing foreign appetite for US Treasuries.This takes us back to the enormous mountain of dollar credit in foreign hands  quantified in the table at the beginning of the article. Long term investments  totalling $26.113 trillion  plus a further $10.7 trillion in Eurobonds will all fall in value as interest rates continue to rise. There can be no doubt that foreigners will sell these positions down. Their only problem is what to do with cash dollars  which already amount to over $100 trillion. Other currencies are mostly less attractive than the dollar. There is only one thing to be done  and that is to follow the Singaporeans  who have the prescience to accumulate hard real money without counterparty risk  which is physical gold.And finally  there are geopolitical considerations. The deteriorating collateral position is surely being observed with concern in Asia and the Global South. The sudden rise in US Treasury bond yields is signalling that a global version of the UK’s liability driven investment debacle is already developing  in which case the collapse of financial market values could escalate rapidly from here.It is against this background that Russia and Saudi Arabia are driving up energy prices  leading to rising CPI inflation and expectations of higher interest rates to come. Commercial banks will almost certainly intensify credit restrictions as well. Viewed from outside America  it all amounts to intolerable pressures on the US and Eurozone credit systems. And if Russia  perhaps followed by China decide to deploy their gold reserves in order to secure the value of their currencies  it is bound to be the coup de grace for the fiat currency system.[i] See https://dtcclearning.com/products-and-services/equities-clearing/sft-clearing.html[ii] See https://www.nysb.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/198038_134_opinion.pdf[iii] See Ronan Manly’s article at https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/ronan-manly/keys-gold-vaults-new-york-fed-part-2-auxiliary-vault/[iv] See https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-jp-morgan-precious-metals-traders-sentenced-prison[v] Ibid.Reprinted with the author’s permission.The Best of Alasdair Macleod,neutral,0.14,0.86,0.01,negative,0.02,0.17,0.81,True,English,"['Financial System', 'dollar-based fiat currency regime', 'global fiat money system', 'eurodollar long term bonds', 'shadow bank dollar balances', 'Second World War', 'International Settlements analysis', 'failing financial system', 'central security depositories', 'negative interest rates', 'The Depository Trust', 'New York courts', 'Breton Woods Agreement', 'US financial system', 'central banks’ reserves', 'London bullion market', 'onshore long-term securities', 'financial asset values', 'large gold ETF', 'foreign-owned long-term investments', 'interest rate swaps', 'onshore dollar investments', 'physical gold ETFs', 'collapsing collateral values', 'dollar denominated assets', 'falling bond prices', 'US financial markets', 'eurodollar market', 'currency forwards', 'foreign interest', 'bank balances', 'financial transactions', 'financial distortions', 'financial bubble', 'new driver', 'SPDR Trust', 'physical metal', 'Bretton Woods', 'US dollar', 'credit balances', 'US Government', 'US Treasury', 'US GDP', 'bond liquidation', 'foreign-owned dollars', 'dollar liquidation', 'dollar deposits', 'dollar debt', 'collateral side', 'significant problems', 'foreign hands', 'counterparty risk', 'widespread failures', 'regulated exchanges', 'Clearing Corporation', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'important erosion', 'property rights', 'unintended consequences', 'bank failures', 'empty shell', 'last resort', 'recent centuries', 'state propaganda', 'Subsequent events', 'monetary disinformation', 'price stability', 'other currencies', 'market manipulation', 'early seventies', 'next wheeze', 'artificial demand', 'purchasing power', 'speculative demand', 'general adoption', 'cross-border trade', 'commodity pricing', 'fifty-two years', 'huge imbalances', 'last week', 'offshore element', 'TIC numbers', 'fair margin', 'one leg', 'offshore eurodollars', 'gold standard', 'gold substitute', 'gold price', 'paper gold', 'dollar credit', 'bond yields', 'bank credit', 'complex markets', 'derivative markets', 'veritable tsunami', 'test case', 'legal protection', 'article', 'time', 'unwinding', 'nominal', 'crisis', 'doom-loop', 'authorities', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'registers', 'knowledge', 'appointment', 'custodian', 'ticker', 'GLD', 'Lehman', 'JPMC', 'customer', 'collapse', 'holders', 'Introduction', 'today', 'layman', 'workings', 'expansion', 'limitation', 'dawn', 'history', 'medium', 'individuals', 'understanding', 'suspension', 'America', 'illusion', 'aspect', 'credibility', 'attempt', 'commodities', 'deception', 'obligations', 'main', 'zero', 'equities', 'process']",2023-10-06,2023-10-07,lewrockwell.com

Learn why I believe WOLTF is too pricey for me.,"Hammad Khan/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionAs explained in my previous article  Wolters Kluwer (OTCPK:WTKWY) (OTCPK:WOLTF) is one of the global leaders in professional information where it has obtained a very strong position in the health  tax and accounting and risk and compliance sector. Wolters Kluwer used to be just a publishing house but hasn't missed the digitalization  and the vast majority of its revenue is generated through digital formats (including software and online subscriptions to services) and that's definitely very appealing given the recurring nature of that revenue. That's also what got my attention  but it also is the reason why Wolters Kluwer tends to trade at a premium valuation and investors need to patiently wait on this one.Yahoo FinanceWolters Kluwer's primary listing is on Euronext Amsterdam where the stock is trading with WKL as ticker symbol. The average daily volume in Amsterdam is approximately 400 000 shares per day. As the company has 245 shares outstanding  the current market cap is roughly 29B EUR based on the current share price of just over 118 EUR. I will use the Euro as base currency throughout this article.Free cash flow remains strongIn the first half of this year  Wolters Kluwer announced pretty impressive growth results. As you can see below  health and tax and accounting still accounts for in excess of 50% of the total revenue  and the organic growth in both divisions was 6% and 8%  respectively.Wolters Kluwer Investor RelationsThe total revenue increased by about 5% while the organic growth rate was about 6% throughout all divisions.The company's gross margins remain exceptionally strong. As you can see below  the total COGS increased by just 37M EUR  resulting in a gross profit of 1.95B EUR  a 4.6% increase compared to the first half of 2022. Unfortunately the company had to deal with higher G&A expenses and the total operating expenses increased by about 8% to 1.31B EUR  resulting in a 1% decrease in the operating profit which fell to 632M EUR.Wolters Kluwer Investor RelationsThis doesn't mean the first semester was bad or weak. The company also recorded a net finance expense of just 11M EUR compared to 43M EUR in the first half of 2022. The explanation for this improvement is very straightforward. Wolters Kluwer has about 3.3B EUR in gross debt (mainly at fixed rates) but its balance sheet also contains in excess of 1.1B EUR in cash. And as interest rates in financial markets are increasing  the company is now actually earning money on that cash pile  and that explains the drastic reduction in the finance expenses.That situation will change as Wolters Kluwer will have to refinance its existing bonds. In May 2024  a 2.5% bond will have to be refinanced and that will very likely have to happen at a higher cost of debt. But the total interest rate won't be outrageous: Its 2031 bonds are trading with a yield to maturity of 4.1%. So while we will see the total amount of interest expenses increase  those increases should be very manageable.Wolters Kluwer Investor RelationsSo  interest income on the cash pile was a tremendous help in the first semester and that's the sole reason why Wolters Kluwer was able to report a 4% pre-tax income increase. The net income jumped to 479M EUR which represents about 1.94 EUR per share.In my previous article I was focusing on the free cash flow profile of Wolters Kluwer. The company reported total operating cash flow of 681M EUR in the first semester  but this includes about 176M EUR in taxes although only 142M EUR was due. There also was a 11M EUR working capital contribution and we should deduct the 34M EUR in lease payments.This means the underlying operating cash flow was approximately 670M EUR. The total capex was 157M EUR and this means the underlying free cash flow was 513M EUR. Divided over the current share count of 245M shares  the free cash flow was 2.09 EUR per share. Generating half a billion in free cash flow every semester sounds nice but it's not a performance I'm willing to pay 30 times free cash flow for.The updated guidance for 2023 doesn't change my opinion. As you can see below  Wolters Kluwer was able to increase its full-year guidance on the back of a strong first semester and it now expects its EPS to come in around 8% higher than last year. Keep in mind the EPS increase already includes the impact of an anticipated 1B EUR share buyback in 2023.Wolters Kluwer Investor RelationsThe free cash flow guidance looks strong but likely includes changes in the working capitalInvestment thesisWolters Kluwer is a leader in its sector  and the company is very well-managed on the operational front. However  the main question is whether or not you should pay 30 times earnings for Wolters Kluwer  and in the current investment climate  I'd argue the stock is a ""hold"" at best. Sure  the revenue and earnings will likely continue to increase at a mid-single digit rate for the next few years  but the analyst consensus estimates call for an EPS of less than 5 EUR in 2025 which means the current share price of 118 EUR would still represent 24 times the forward earnings.Meanwhile  I'm also not convinced spending so much cash on buying back their own shares at a 3.3% free cash flow yield and I'm surprised that is the best way to allocate cash.I'm on the sidelines. A great business  but too pricey for me.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
