31157,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.thejournal.ie/healthbeacon-poor-fortunes-irish-stock-exchange-analysis-6188853-Oct2023/,Why a former €98m company's poor fortunes could prove painful for Ireland's stock exchange,Paul O’Donoghue takes a look at HealthBeacon’s rollercoaster journey.,THE IRISH STOCK exchange has been hit by a series of high-profile departures in the last year or so  with the most recent body blow being the departure of the country’s two biggest public companies  CRH and Smurfit Kappa.New listings have dried up. No Irish companies have completed an IPO (initial public offering) so far this year  or the year before.Davy and Goodbody have both recently announced they will cut staff amid the downturn in new listings  while investment company Zurich is closing its Irish equity fund.One of the rare bright spots – excuse the preemptive pun – was HealthBeacon’s IPO in December 2021.The company was one of the 40 or so businesses which have completed Euronext’s ‘IPO Ready’ scheme  a six-month programme detailing the listing process for businesses.It was hoped that many graduates of the initiative  started in 2015  would go public within three to five years.So far  HealthBeacon has been the only one. In December 2021 it raised €25m in a move which valued the firm at €98 million.The Dublin-based company is focused on medical technology  with its flagship product being a ‘Smart Bin’ for people who self-inject at home.Aimed at those suffering from conditions such as diabetes  the product ensures patients keep on track with their medication routine.Its IPO was hailed as a “milestone” for the Irish exchange  with hopes that it could pave the way for other medium-sized businesses to follow suit.Jim Joyce  HealthBeacon’s CEO and co-founder  was shortlisted for Business & Finance magazine’s ‘business person of the year’ award  while the IPO was named as one of the ‘Deals of the Year’ by trade publication Finance Dublin.Investors were also optimistic. HealthBeacon’s share price soon rose to €6.24  bringing its value to over €100 million at a time when it had revenues of under €1 million.This was likely down to the company’s ambitious targets. HealthBeacon said it expected to sell 100 000 of its smart bins by the end of 2023.The pitch was one of exponential growth  with the company’s IPO prospectus highlighting a potential market of almost €10 billion in recurring revenue from the millions of Americans and Europeans who self-inject to treat their conditions.However  investors have faced disaster since. The company’s share price has fallen to €0.19 as of the time of writing  a drop of just over 95%.Joyce has departed as CEO  while sales targets for this year were cut amid as the company looks to get costs under control.Sales warningThe problems first became apparent around the middle of last year.In July HealthBeacon announced that supply issues meant it would hit its 100 000 sales target in early 2024  instead of the end of 2023.AdvertisementThis triggered an almost immediate fall in its share price to €2.80  with the price continuing to dip lower for the rest of the year.A key priority for the firm is reaching deals so that its smart bins are sold throughout US pharmacies  something Joyce said the firm was making good headway on.The stock rebounded somewhat to almost €2 by July 2023  before HealthBeacon issued another sales warning in September.The scale was alarming. While it had previously expected to be recording annual sales in the ‘mid-teen millions’ by the end of 2023  revenues this year will instead be just over €3m.HealthBeacon said it was still confident it could hit €17m in annual recurring revenue by the end of 2024. However  it added that it would need to raise €11 million to fund its costs before hitting a breakeven point in the middle of 2025.This is significantly more than the company is now worth – its market valuation has dropped to less than €4 million as of the time of writing.HealthBeacon could still turn things around  but whether it will get the chance to do so will now likely come down to whether investors are willing to keep backing the firm.In terms of the wider impact of the company’s troubles  there will likely be concern it could serve to deter other similar companies from going down the IPO route.Speaking to the Sunday Times shortly after the company’s flotation  Joyce was asked if the firm might have been better placed to wait to realise some of its potential before listing.“The sweet spot is the phase we’re at right now. If you wait too long  you’re going to get bought out ” he argued.It was a fair point. While Ireland has a good startup ecosystem  it has struggled to bring many of those firms from promising early or mid-stage businesses to true international scale.While going public is not right for every company  for many ambitious firms  the local stock market traditionally provided a reliable way to access the funds needed to go big.This is also the vision of the Irish market which Euronext has been pushing.As more established firms have looked to the US for access to more liquidity and bigger valuations  Euronext Dublin wants replacements.This is the obvious aim of its IPO ready programme – to have a stream of listings from solid indigenous businesses on the cusp of something more.A report published last week  commissioned by Euronext Dublin and stockbrokers  found the Irish exchange provides a major benefit to the economy and called for government supports.These included scrapping stamp duty on the trading of shares and tax incentives for retail investors to put money into public companies.While these could be a boost  the long-term success of the equity exchange will likely rest on how new listings perform.HealthBeacon appeared to represent the future. It is why its troubles could prove to be so painful for the wider market.,negative,0.0,0.02,0.98,mixed,0.13,0.3,0.57,True,English,"['former €98m company', 'poor fortunes', 'stock exchange', 'Ireland', 'three to five years', 'two biggest public companies', 'initial public offering', 'recent body blow', 'rare bright spots', 'other similar companies', 'good startup ecosystem', 'Irish equity fund', 'other medium-sized businesses', 'true international scale', 'solid indigenous businesses', 'local stock market', 'annual recurring revenue', 'IRISH STOCK exchange', 'many ambitious firms', 'IPO ready programme', 'The Dublin-based company', 'Irish companies', 'Irish exchange', 'Irish market', 'six-month programme', 'many graduates', 'ambitious targets', 'good headway', 'annual sales', 'market valuation', 'high-profile departures', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'preemptive pun', 'medical technology', 'Smart Bin', 'medication routine', 'Finance magazine', 'trade publication', 'Finance Dublin', 'exponential growth', 'sales targets', 'Sales warning', 'supply issues', '100,000 sales target', 'immediate fall', 'key priority', 'breakeven point', 'wider impact', 'Sunday Times', 'sweet spot', 'fair point', 'mid-stage businesses', 'established firms', 'bigger valuations', 'obvious aim', 'share price', 'potential market', 'New listings', 'IPO prospectus', 'IPO route', 'last year', 'listing process', 'flagship product', 'business person', 'year’ award', 'US pharmacies', 'teen millions', 'reliable way', 'Euronext Dublin', 'investment company', 'Jim Joyce', 'series', 'country', 'CRH', 'Davy', 'Goodbody', 'staff', 'downturn', 'Zurich', 'HealthBeacon', 'December', 'scheme', 'initiative', 'move', 'people', 'home', 'conditions', 'diabetes', 'patients', 'track', 'milestone', 'hopes', 'suit', 'CEO', 'founder', 'Deals', 'Investors', 'value', 'revenues', 'end', 'pitch', 'Americans', 'Europeans', 'disaster', 'writing', 'drop', 'costs', 'control', 'problems', 'first', 'middle', 'July', 'early', 'Advertisement', 'rest', 'something', 'September', 'things', 'chance', 'terms', 'troubles', 'concern', 'flotation', 'phase', 'Ireland', 'funds', 'vision', 'access', 'liquidity', 'replacements', 'stream', 'cusp', 'report', '40', '2025']",2023-10-07,2023-10-08,thejournal.ie

In a day-long inauguration event  CERN debuted Science Gateway to the President of the Swiss Confederation  ministers and other high-level authorities from CERN’s Member and Associate Member States  the project’s donors and partners in CERN’s research  education and outreach. Designed by world-renowned Renzo Piano Building Workshop  the new facility is open to visitors from around the world  from the age of five and upwards. It will allow CERN to significantly expand its portfolio of educational and outreach activities. CERN Science Gateway will be open to the public as of tomorrow  8 October 2023.The inauguration ceremony began with an address by Fabiola Gianotti  the CERN Director-General  who stressed the value of education and outreach with the public. “Sharing CERN’s research and the beauty and utility of science with the public has always been a key objective and activity of CERN  and with Science Gateway  as of tomorrow  we can expand significantly this component of our mission. We want to show the importance of fundamental research and its applications to society  infuse everyone who comes here with curiosity and a passion for science  and inspire young people to take up careers in Science  Technology  Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)” she said. “Science Gateway will be a place where scientists and the public can interact daily. For me  personally  Science Gateway is a dream that has become a reality and I am deeply grateful to all the people who have contributed  starting with our generous donors.”CERN  the European Laboratory for Particle Physics  is the home of the Large Hadron Collider  the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator.In his address  the President of the Swiss Confederation  Alain Berset  said: “Those familiar with Venn diagrams will agree that this invisible circle puts CERN at the intersection between Switzerland  France and Europe  thus symbolising its commitment to shared scientific and political values. CERN truly is an exceptional facility and one that enables Switzerland and Geneva to shine on the world stage.”The iconic building  inspired by the tubular structure of CERN’s accelerators  comprises five areas housing exhibitions  laboratories and an auditorium that can be flexibly configured into different spaces depending on requirements  as well as a shop and a restaurant.The transparent glass panels and bridges further represent CERN’s commitment to collaboration across borders and culture and open science that is accessible to all.Renzo Piano  chief architect of the project  said: “This will be a place where people meet: kids  students  adults  teachers and scientists  everybody attracted by the exploration of the Universe  from the infinitely vast to the infinitely small. It is a bridge  in both a metaphorical and a real sense. This building is fed by the energy of the Sun  landed in the middle of a newly grown forest.”Not only is the building visually striking  but CERN and the architects committed to it being fully carbon neutral  and almost 4000 square metres of solar panels supply more power than the building’s needs. Over 400 trees have been planted  situating the whole campus in a living forest.While the full project was launched in 2018  construction of the Science Gateway campus took just over two years  with the first stone of the building being laid on 21 June 2021.This new facility would not have been possible without the generous support of the CERN Science Gateway sponsors  who share the same values and  through their contributions  want to pay tribute to education and knowledge for the benefit of society. The overall cost of Science Gateway was about 100 million Swiss francs  and this was funded exclusively through donations. In particular  the Stellantis Foundation is the largest single donor and contributed 45 million Swiss francs towards the project. John Elkann  Chairman of Stellantis  said: “CERN is an example of how we can work together in harmony  using scientific knowledge and ingenuity for the greater good. Stellantis Foundation is proud to partner with such an institution as it opens to the public the new Science Gateway  which also celebrates a great innovator like Sergio Marchionne. My family and I strongly believe in the power of education  which is the mission of the Fondazione Agnelli: a commitment we reinforce today with conviction and passion.”As part of wider society  Stellantis takes action to advance human achievement. Stellantis  through its philanthropic activities and its Foundation  invests in individuals through education projects that spark innovation and excellence.The Fondation Hans Wilsdorf is also a major donor. Other donors are the LEGO foundation  the Loterie Romande  Ernst Göhner Stiftung  Rolex  the Carla Fendi Foundation  the Fondation Gelbert  Solvay  the Fondation Meyrinoise du Casino and the town of Meyrin. CERN thanks the République et Canton de Genève and the CERN and Society Foundation for their support.The ceremony took place in the new 900-seat auditorium  named after Sergio Marchionne  former CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  who recently passed away. Guests visited the education laboratories and the unique immersive exhibitions and enjoyed the Big Bang Café  the Collider Circle square and other areas of the Science Gateway campus.Throughout the day  guided by CERN scientists and children of CERN personnel  visitors were able to experience first-hand the range of Science Gateway’s opportunities  from interactive exhibitions to laboratories for hands-on experiments and immersive spaces. They also had the opportunity to appreciate CERN’s scientific breakthroughs and technologies  learn about the history of the Universe and admire the mysteries of the quantum world. Teenagers guided guests through various enquiry-based laboratory activities throughout the afternoon.Eliezer Rabinovici  President of the CERN Council  speaking on behalf of CERN’s Member and Associate Member States  said: “Today we celebrate the courage and passion to innovate that CERN has always demonstrated and the commitment to share the fruits of its research with people from all countries and of all ages. May the science leaders of tomorrow come from among the curious children who will fill this wonderful place with joy in the coming years.”The new centre is expected to host up to 500 000 visitors a year from across the world. Science Gateway will be free of charge and open 6 days a week  from Tuesday to Sunday.# # #About CERNCERN  the European Organization for Nuclear Research  is one of the world's leading laboratories for particle physics.

But the firm’s share price did not budge and is now down about 95pc since its IPO  just under two years ago.This is not how things were supposed to go for HealthBeacon.The Dublin-based company is focused on medical technology  with its flagship product being a ‘Smart Bin’ for people who self-inject at home.Aimed at those suffering from conditions such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis  the product ensures patients keep on track with their medication routine and securely shares their treatment data with family  caregivers and healthcare providers.The company’s listing on Euronext Dublin in December 2021 was a rare bright spot for an exchange which has been devastated by a series of high-profile departures. Making it better was HealthBeacon was an alumnus of Euronext’s ‘IPO Ready’ scheme  a six-month programme detailing the listing process for businesses.While dozens of firms have graduated since the initiative began in 2015  HealthBeacon was the first to take the plunge and list on the Irish exchange  raising €25m in a move which valued the firm at just under €100m.The move was hailed as a “milestone” transaction for the exchange  with hopes that it could serve as a beacon for other promising homegrown SMEs.But investors have had a rough ride since. Shares  which first listed at €5.85  hovered around the €5 mark before an update in July 2022 when the company announced “unanticipated delays” in the supply of parts  which it said would reduce the number of ‘Smart Bins’ it produced that year.Shares fell sharply to €2.80 – and kept dropping  hitting a low of €0.61 in March 2023.Shares rebounded to €1.90 by July  something Jim Joyce  HealthBeacon’s founder and CEO  attributed to progress the company was making with securing partnerships in the US.Joyce said it had reached deals with American pharmacy groups  whereby patients on certain types of medication would be offered the ‘Smart Bin’ product. He hailed this as a significant step forward.​However  then came the September update.HealthBeacon revealed Joyce had left  while also issuing a sales warning.The firm had previously guided that it would have annual recurring revenue in the “mid-teen millions” by the end of 2023. However  the update revealed it now expects that to be just €3.2m.HealthBeacon also primed that it will be looking for more cash: “To achieve cash break-even and scale at the pace now expected  the company has a gross funding requirement of approximately €11m over the next 18-24 months.”Though the interim results showed sales to the end of June were flat year-on-year at €0.9m  the firm has assured investors it is making headway and said it is on track to secure €17m of recurring revenue by the end of 2024.The key issue is now funding  and €11m is a lot to ask backers for  when the firm itself was valued at just under €4m at the time of writing.Decision time  with HealthBeacon’s future in the balance.,neutral,0.36,0.62,0.02,negative,0.01,0.22,0.77,True,English,"['€11m question', 'brave investors', 'HealthBeacon', 'other promising homegrown SMEs', 'next two years', 'rare bright spot', 'American pharmacy groups', 'next 18-24 months', 'IPO Ready’ scheme', 'gross funding requirement', 'annual recurring revenue', 'The Dublin-based company', 'Smart Bin’ product', 'Smart Bins', 'disastrous month', 'brave face', 'share price', 'flagship product', 'multiple sclerosis', 'treatment data', 'healthcare providers', 'high-profile departures', 'six-month programme', 'milestone” transaction', 'rough ride', 'unanticipated delays', 'significant step', 'teen millions', 'interim results', 'key issue', 'trading update', 'medical technology', 'medication routine', 'Euronext Dublin', 'listing process', 'September update', 'sales warning', 'Decision time', 'Irish exchange', 'Jim Joyce', 'medtech firm', 'hyperbole', 'HealthBeacon', 'statement', 'CEO', 'costs', 'things', 'progress', 'roll-out', 'people', 'conditions', 'diabetes', 'patients', 'track', 'family', 'caregivers', 'December', 'series', 'alumnus', 'businesses', 'dozens', 'firms', 'initiative', 'plunge', 'move', 'hopes', 'investors', 'Shares', '€5 mark', 'July', 'supply', 'parts', 'number', 'low', 'March', 'something', 'founder', 'partnerships', 'deals', 'types', 'end', 'cash', 'pace', 'June', 'headway', 'lot', 'backers', 'writing', 'future', 'balance']",2023-10-08,2023-10-08,independent.ie

Ireland has long directed programmes at indigenous firms in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors ,According to the Government’s White Paper on Enterprise published last year  SMEs and entrepreneurship are central to a national objective of diversified  sustainable growth. Ireland has long directed programmes at indigenous firms in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors  with a specific emphasis on expanding exports.The justification for this is obvious: exporting firms have been demonstrated to be bigger  to have greater productivity  to be more skill and capital intensive  and to providing better salaries than firms that are confined to the domestic market.With this in mind  and as the forthcoming Budget will be the first one since the publication of the White Paper  there is a compelling reason to take positive action to support and incentivise domestic businesses in this year’s budget so that they play a bigger role in the economy and ensure that we are not over-dependent on the multinational sector for jobs  investment and tax revenues.I believe that we have an opportunity to address a trend where the revenues from Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) provide us with the largest part of our annual tax take (€20bn in 2022). It is vital that we balance this with indigenous enterprises that can scale sufficiently and indeed become the FDIs of other markets  in due course.As recently as last week the Central Bank again highlighted the notable drop in export growth for goods and services from 13.9pc to just 0.2pc in 2023 and the forecast of growth for 2024 is 2.9pc.Furthermore  the Central Bank also commented that corporation tax accounts for 45pc of the growth in tax revenue and is concentrated in a small number of foreign owned firms. Tellingly  the Central Bank economics director told the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight that the growth in tax revenue over the last five years was almost identical to that in the period from 2002-2007. If  for whatever reason  one or more of our multinationals decided to leave  we would be exposed  and a hole blown in our tax take.Fortunately  though  the minister is conscious of these developments and has highlighted them many times  and Government has taken a number of steps to mitigate our exposure. €6bn in windfall corporation tax receipts have been transferred to the National Reserve Fund  and work is ongoing in relation to establishing a longer-term investment fund.While we still have time it is paramount that we reach the stage where we lessen our dependence on foreign investment and in this regard what is crucial is that Irish entrepreneurs believe they can compete on a level playing field and be rewarded for taking risks on the international stage. Under those circumstances Irish businesses will grow  pay tax  and create employment. I propose the following:​1) The Irish Stock Exchange (Euronext Dublin) is no longer attractive to Irish Companies whose primary focus is on scaling up  achieved by a bigger pool of investors and more opportunities to grow. It’s time we looked at our tax incentives for business owners who sell their own shares in companies as part of an initial public offering (IPO) or a tax credit scheme to make the IPO process cheaper for new businesses. This is not about matching the NY Stock Exchange but making our exchange more attractive and appealing.2) There is a significant number of Irish exporters and employers who are not clients of Enterprise Ireland or the Local Enterprise Offices. These companies have made it clear to me that they need encouraging tax measures in this year’s budget. Amending Capital Gains Tax and enhancing the Employment Investment and Incentive Scheme (EIIS) will be material and self-financing over a five year period.Ireland is one of only two EU countries that does not currently have an export credit guarantee scheme. Such a scheme would assist to level the playing field and help to introduce new players to our exports.We are very fortunate to have Enterprise Ireland and the work it does to help its clients navigate new markets – regrettably figures provided to me earlier in the year identified a worrying number of vacancies in Enterprise Ireland offices abroad.​3) Irish owned businesses feel discriminated against being excluded from the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP). We need to examine the extension of this to indigenous businesses.4) Many owner managers will tell you they don’t have the “band width” to absorb all the administrative burden associated with the Irish tax regime when it comes to indigenous businesses and entrepreneurs. Paperwork is seldom an entrepreneur strength and can strangle a profitable business. A review of the current system is overdue.The fact is that our indigenous enterprises are not active in international markets  with less than 10pc SMEs directly trading across borders. It is critical that this changes and I hope that Finance Minister Michael McGrath will take action to address this.​​​​​​​​Robert Troy is a Fianna Fáil TD who served as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise  Trade and Employment from July 2020 until his resignation in August 2022,neutral,0.19,0.8,0.01,mixed,0.36,0.28,0.36,True,English,"['Minister Michael McGrath', 'Robert Troy', 'small firms', 'Budget', 'export', 'Special Assignee Relief Programme', 'Fianna Fáil TD', 'Finance Minister Michael McGrath', 'windfall corporation tax receipts', 'Central Bank economics director', 'export credit guarantee scheme', 'The Irish Stock Exchange', 'NY Stock Exchange', 'initial public offering', 'two EU countries', 'Many owner managers', 'last five years', 'National Reserve Fund', 'tax credit scheme', 'Capital Gains Tax', 'longer-term investment fund', 'Local Enterprise Offices', 'level playing field', 'Irish tax regime', 'annual tax take', 'Foreign Direct Investment', 'Irish owned businesses', 'foreign owned firms', 'diversified, sustainable growth', 'Enterprise Ireland offices', 'five year period', 'foreign investment', 'Irish businesses', 'export growth', 'Irish exporters', 'national objective', 'last week', 'Incentive Scheme', 'tax revenue', 'tax incentives', 'tax measures', 'domestic businesses', 'new businesses', 'indigenous businesses', 'Irish entrepreneurs', 'White Paper', 'indigenous firms', 'specific emphasis', 'exporting firms', 'greater productivity', 'domestic market', 'bigger role', 'multinational sector', 'indigenous enterprises', 'other markets', 'due course', 'notable drop', 'Oireachtas Committee', 'Budgetary Oversight', 'Euronext Dublin', 'primary focus', 'bigger pool', 'business owners', 'new players', 'new markets', 'band width', 'administrative burden', 'profitable business', 'current system', 'international markets', 'Robert Troy', 'Irish Companies', 'small number', 'significant number', 'worrying number', 'Employment Investment', 'services sectors', 'compelling reason', 'positive action', 'largest part', 'international stage', 'IPO process', '10pc SMEs', 'forthcoming Budget', 'revenues', 'Government', 'programmes', 'manufacturing', 'exports', 'justification', 'salaries', 'mind', 'first', 'publication', 'economy', 'jobs', 'opportunity', 'trend', 'FDI', 'goods', '13.9pc', '0.2pc', 'forecast', '2.9pc', '45pc', 'multinationals', 'hole', 'developments', 'steps', 'exposure', 'work', 'relation', 'time', 'dependence', 'regard', 'risks', 'circumstances', 'investors', 'opportunities', 'shares', 'employers', 'clients', 'EIIS', 'financing', 'figures', 'vacancies', 'SARP', 'extension', 'strength', 'review', 'less', 'borders', 'State', 'Department', 'Trade', 'July', 'resign', '2024']",2023-10-08,2023-10-08,independent.ie
