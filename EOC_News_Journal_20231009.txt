The project continues to present challenges to the group from an operational and financial perspective  including those arising from the historical impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.“Maintaining the project’s strong safety record and completing the works remain key objectives of the group  along with resolution of the outstanding variations and claims.”The consolidated results for the company and its subsidiaries shows a turnover of €705 million in 2022  up from €626 million the previous year. Profit before tax was up by €1.2 million and accumulated profits at year’s end were €100 million.No details are given in the accounts as to the contribution of the hospital project to the year’s results.The group is in a number of joint ventures in the Republic and abroad. In Ireland “the industry remains in delicate circumstances with procurement reform and rebalancing of risk allocation long overdue”.Significant challenges existed due to the rise in construction costs caused by the outbreak of war in Ukraine  as well as due to the disruption and supply chain shortages caused by Covid-19. Likewise  the return of higher interest rates had stifled investment in public and private projects  the directors said.During 2022 the group employed an average of 825 staff  up 72 on the previous year  at a cost of €66 million.The subsidiary  BAM Property Ltd  has a property portfolio consisting of land banks  residential units and commercial properties  according to the accounts. A value of €65.7 million is given in the accounts for land held for property development.The group owns a development site at Castlelake  Carrigtwohill  Co Cork  where it plans to build a big residential development.In the Commercial Court in July a case taken in 2020 by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was re-entered by Bam into the fast-track court after a failed attempt at a negotiated settlement.BAM’s commercial director  Seamus Kealy  said “thousands of hours” had been devoted to settlement discussions between October 2021 and May 2023.A resolution would require various commitments from both sides regarding the overall completion date and final price for the hospital  he said. The settlement discussions were aimed at resolving thousands of claims involving hundreds of millions of euros  the court was told.Bam Contractors is owned by Royal Bam Group of the Netherlands  shares in which are quoted on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam.,neutral,0.26,0.73,0.01,mixed,0.1,0.28,0.63,True,English,"['BAM results', 'hospital developer', 'children', 'National Paediatric Hospital Development Board', 'strong safety record', 'supply chain shortages', 'higher interest rates', 'overall completion date', 'Euronext stock exchange', 'big residential development', 'new National Children', 'hospital legal bill', 'Dutch-owned Irish company', 'likely total cost', 'BAM Contractors Ltd', 'BAM Property Ltd', 'hospital building project', 'latest financial accounts', 'contentious construction disputes', 'hospital board', 'Royal Bam Group', 'property development', 'development site', 'new children', 'legal dispute', 'financial perspective', 'residential units', 'property portfolio', 'hospital project', 'lead contractor', 'cost overruns', 'Politics Expert', 'current portfolio', 'historical impact', 'Covid-19 pandemic', 'key objectives', 'outstanding variations', 'joint ventures', 'delicate circumstances', 'procurement reform', 'risk allocation', 'construction costs', 'private projects', 'commercial properties', 'Co Cork', 'failed attempt', 'commercial director', 'Seamus Kealy', 'various commitments', 'final price', 'Commercial Court', 'fast-track court', '€2 billion project', 'significant project', 'settlement discussions', 'pretax profit', 'consolidated results', 'Significant challenges', 'land banks', 'previous year', 'Dublin', 'delays', 'NPHDB', 'June', 'directors', 'report', 'READ', 'complexity', 'scale', 'operational', 'works', 'resolution', 'claims', 'subsidiaries', 'turnover', 'profits', 'end', 'details', 'contribution', 'number', 'Republic', 'Ireland', 'industry', 'rebalancing', 'rise', 'outbreak', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'disruption', 'return', 'investment', 'average', '825 staff', 'subsidiary', 'value', 'Castlelake', 'Carrigtwohill', 'July', 'case', 'thousands', 'hours', 'October', 'May', 'sides', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'euros', 'Netherlands', 'shares', 'Amsterdam']",2023-10-08,2023-10-09,irishtimes.com

But the firm’s share price did not budge and is now down about 95pc since its IPO  just under two years ago.This is not how things were supposed to go for HealthBeacon.The Dublin-based company is focused on medical technology  with its flagship product being a ‘Smart Bin’ for people who self-inject at home.Aimed at those suffering from conditions such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis  the product ensures patients keep on track with their medication routine and securely shares their treatment data with family  caregivers and healthcare providers.The company’s listing on Euronext Dublin in December 2021 was a rare bright spot for an exchange which has been devastated by a series of high-profile departures. Making it better was HealthBeacon was an alumnus of Euronext’s ‘IPO Ready’ scheme  a six-month programme detailing the listing process for businesses.While dozens of firms have graduated since the initiative began in 2015  HealthBeacon was the first to take the plunge and list on the Irish exchange  raising €25m in a move which valued the firm at just under €100m.The move was hailed as a “milestone” transaction for the exchange  with hopes that it could serve as a beacon for other promising homegrown SMEs.But investors have had a rough ride since. Shares  which first listed at €5.85  hovered around the €5 mark before an update in July 2022 when the company announced “unanticipated delays” in the supply of parts  which it said would reduce the number of ‘Smart Bins’ it produced that year.Shares fell sharply to €2.80 – and kept dropping  hitting a low of €0.61 in March 2023.Shares rebounded to €1.90 by July  something Jim Joyce  HealthBeacon’s founder and CEO  attributed to progress the company was making with securing partnerships in the US.Joyce said it had reached deals with American pharmacy groups  whereby patients on certain types of medication would be offered the ‘Smart Bin’ product. He hailed this as a significant step forward.​However  then came the September update.HealthBeacon revealed Joyce had left  while also issuing a sales warning.The firm had previously guided that it would have annual recurring revenue in the “mid-teen millions” by the end of 2023. However  the update revealed it now expects that to be just €3.2m.HealthBeacon also primed that it will be looking for more cash: “To achieve cash break-even and scale at the pace now expected  the company has a gross funding requirement of approximately €11m over the next 18-24 months.”Though the interim results showed sales to the end of June were flat year-on-year at €0.9m  the firm has assured investors it is making headway and said it is on track to secure €17m of recurring revenue by the end of 2024.The key issue is now funding  and €11m is a lot to ask backers for  when the firm itself was valued at just under €4m at the time of writing.Decision time  with HealthBeacon’s future in the balance.,neutral,0.36,0.62,0.02,negative,0.01,0.22,0.77,True,English,"['€11m question', 'brave investors', 'HealthBeacon', 'other promising homegrown SMEs', 'next two years', 'rare bright spot', 'American pharmacy groups', 'next 18-24 months', 'IPO Ready’ scheme', 'gross funding requirement', 'annual recurring revenue', 'The Dublin-based company', 'Smart Bin’ product', 'Smart Bins', 'disastrous month', 'brave face', 'share price', 'flagship product', 'multiple sclerosis', 'treatment data', 'healthcare providers', 'high-profile departures', 'six-month programme', 'milestone” transaction', 'rough ride', 'unanticipated delays', 'significant step', 'teen millions', 'interim results', 'key issue', 'trading update', 'medical technology', 'medication routine', 'Euronext Dublin', 'listing process', 'September update', 'sales warning', 'Decision time', 'Irish exchange', 'Jim Joyce', 'medtech firm', 'hyperbole', 'HealthBeacon', 'statement', 'CEO', 'costs', 'things', 'progress', 'roll-out', 'people', 'conditions', 'diabetes', 'patients', 'track', 'family', 'caregivers', 'December', 'series', 'alumnus', 'businesses', 'dozens', 'firms', 'initiative', 'plunge', 'move', 'hopes', 'investors', 'Shares', '€5 mark', 'July', 'supply', 'parts', 'number', 'low', 'March', 'something', 'founder', 'partnerships', 'deals', 'types', 'end', 'cash', 'pace', 'June', 'headway', 'lot', 'backers', 'writing', 'future', 'balance']",2023-10-08,2023-10-09,independent.ie

It is intended that the tools and initiatives will support and implement Euronext’s “Fit for 1.5°” commitment  under which it will develop products and services to assist companies and organizations to mitigate temperature increases. The new initiatives will also support the “Growth for Impact 2024” strategy  i.e.  the ambition to build the leading market infrastructure in Europe.One of the tools launched by Euronext is the “My ESG Profile ” a digital tool that will enable issuers to display their sustainability efforts and also provide investors a way to access and evaluate ESG data. Euronext will reportedly be the first stock exchange to make the non-financial data of issuers available to investors. It is envisaged that the tool will classify nearly 1 900 companies’ profiles on its website  including information regarding  among other things  GHG emissions and the percentage of women employed.Another tool announced by Euronext  and developed in partnership with Iceberg Data Law  is the Euronext Biodiversity Enablers Index  which takes into account the effect that companies and organizations can have on biodiversity. The index will rely on two new metrics: (i) a Dependency Exposure Score  which will identify companies that have a significant revenue dependency linked to biodiversity ecosystems; and (ii) a Biodiversity Avoided Impact  which will serve to identify companies that carry out innovative and efficient practices in biodiversity ecosystems.Euronext also revealed the launch of “Euronext Foundation ” which will promote and support local sustainable communities and projects across Europe in a number of areas  including financial literacy and diversity and inclusion.Taking the Temperature: Euronext’s “My ESG Profile” is a significant step towards closing the information gap between companies and investors. One caveat  however  is that the source of information is the issuer itself and as such is subject to the issuer’s data assessment and reporting choices. The data is not subject to external verification and is unaudited. There also does not appear to be any indication as to whether the information will be analyzed in any way in order to make the data comparable from company to company.,neutral,0.09,0.9,0.01,neutral,0.06,0.89,0.05,True,English,"['New Sustainable Investment Tools', 'ESG Initiatives', 'Euronext', 'Euronext Biodiversity Enablers Index', 'pan-European stock exchange', 'market infrastructure provider', 'leading market infrastructure', 'first stock exchange', 'Dependency Exposure Score', 'two new metrics', 'significant revenue dependency', 'local sustainable communities', 'Iceberg Data Law', 'sustainable finance', 'significant step', 'ESG Profile', 'sustainability efforts', 'other things', 'GHG emissions', 'biodiversity ecosystems', 'efficient practices', 'financial literacy', 'One caveat', 'reporting choices', 'external verification', 'non-financial data', 'ESG data', 'data assessment', 'new initiatives', 'imminent launch', 'temperature increases', 'Euronext Foundation', 'ESG tools', 'digital tool', 'information gap', '1,900 companies’ profiles', 'September', 'range', 'intention', 'issuers', 'website', 'Fit', '1.5°” commitment', 'products', 'services', 'organizations', 'Growth', 'Impact', '2024” strategy', 'ambition', 'My', 'investors', 'way', 'percentage', 'women', 'partnership', 'account', 'effect', 'innovative', 'projects', 'number', 'areas', 'inclusion', 'source', 'indication', 'order', 'company']",2023-10-09,2023-10-09,natlawreview.com
