31178,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/close-your-equity-hedge-and-go-overweight-european-stocks-says-deutsche-bank-264a0b22,Close your equity hedge and buy more European stocks  Deutsche Bank recommends,European bourses rallied hard Tuesday  as Deutsche Bank recommended closing its hedge on equity exposure and going overweight stocks.,European bourses rallied hard Tuesday  as Deutsche Bank recommended closing its hedge on equity exposure and going overweight stocks.Buoyed by a rebound on Wall Street at the start of the week  the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index XX:SXXP jumped 1.6% amid hopes the Federal Reserve was now minded to halt its cycle of interest rate rises.London-listed resources groups and China-sensitive German auto and engineering companies led the advance as sentiment was also lifted by reports Beijing was considering increasing its budget deficit to undertake a new stimulus for the world’s second-biggest economy.And more gains are likely  according to Maximilian Uleer  head of European equity and cross-asset strategy at Deutsche Bank. In a new note produced with colleague Carolin Raab  Uleer said the risks that have been weighing on equity markets in the third quarter are turning into opportunities.For example  the economic environment is improving  with eurozone purchasing manager surveys  which had declined for five months in a row  recently taking a turn for the better. Also  softer China growth is already factored in  Uleer noted  and even a mild U.S. recession “is widely anticipated by markets and would most likely have a limited impact on markets.”Monetary policy trajectory may also now be more supportive  says Uleer: “After the recent move in implied rates (higher rates  later cuts)  we now expect markets to be positively surprised by central banks next year.” On average  German bund yields fell by more than 100 basis points 12 months after the last rate hike and in nine out of 10 cases  Uleer said.In addition  expectations of earnings are “sufficiently negative.” After heavy downward revisions  forecasts now seem more realistic for this year and  with consensus growth of just 3%  potentially too negative for 2024. Uleer said he earnings growth next year of 5%.Given all this  Deutsche expects stock markets to recover in the fourth quarter and has a 2024 forecast for the Stoxx 600 of 510  sees the Euro Stoxx 50 XX:SX5E at 4 850 and the DAX index DX:DAX at 18 000.Uleer was wary of equities in July and recommended hedging by buying 3-month at-the-money put options on the Euro Stoxx 50 — a position that would have tripled in value. Now  traders should close that position  which expires next week  and go overweight into stocks  Uleer said.Chart shows Euro Stoxx 50 index (blue line)Overall  Uleer said Deutsche prefers equities over fixed income: “From a multi asset perspective  we like to take risk via an overweight in equities but prefer to buy long duration government bonds with high ratings over credit. We anticipate rates to come down and correlations between government bonds with high ratings and equities to turn negative.”,neutral,0.32,0.67,0.01,mixed,0.19,0.27,0.54,True,English,"['equity hedge', 'European stocks', 'Deutsche Bank', 'eurozone purchasing manager surveys', 'mild U.S. recession', 'long duration government bonds', 'Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index XX', 'DAX index DX', 'London-listed resources groups', 'China-sensitive German auto', 'colleague Carolin Raab', 'Monetary policy trajectory', 'German bund yields', 'heavy downward revisions', 'money put options', 'multi asset perspective', 'last rate hike', 'softer China growth', 'Euro Stoxx 50 index', 'XX:SX5E', 'interest rate', 'consensus growth', 'European bourses', 'equity exposure', 'Wall Street', 'Federal Reserve', 'engineering companies', 'budget deficit', 'new stimulus', 'biggest economy', 'European equity', 'cross-asset strategy', 'new note', 'third quarter', 'economic environment', 'five months', 'limited impact', 'recent move', 'central banks', 'fourth quarter', 'blue line', 'fixed income', 'high ratings', 'earnings growth', 'implied rates', 'higher rates', 'Deutsche Bank', 'equity markets', 'stock markets', 'Maximilian Uleer', 'hedge', 'stocks', 'rebound', 'start', 'week', 'SXXP', 'hopes', 'cycle', 'advance', 'sentiment', 'reports', 'Beijing', 'world', 'gains', 'head', 'risks', 'opportunities', 'example', 'turn', 'cuts', '100 basis', '10 cases', 'addition', 'expectations', 'forecasts', 'year', '2024 forecast', 'equities', 'July', '3-month', 'position', 'value', 'traders', 'Chart', 'overweight', 'credit', 'correlations']",2023-10-10,2023-10-10,marketwatch.com

Multiobus is a long-lasting partner that from the early years of Ebusco has shown its confidence through several orders.Today  Ebusco and Multiobus will sign a contract for 20 new Ebusco 2.2 buses at Busworld in Brussels  the largest bus exhibition in the world. This exhibition holds special significance due to its location since Belgium will soon become the home country for the 20 ordered buses. The 20 Ebusco 2.2 buses will be equipped with a battery pack of over 400 kWh  will have a low floor configuration  and will accompany the Multiobus fleet which already consists of several models of Ebusco. The in total 36 Ebusco buses will be operated by Multiobus but will be driving under the name of De Lijn  Belgium's largest public transport authority. Together  these buses will form the transport around Tienen - Belgium.Follow up ordersEbusco and Multiobus embarked on their electric journey together from the very beginning. In 2017  Multiobus took a significant step by becoming one of Ebusco's early clients  acquiring an initial fleet of four Ebusco 2.1 buses. Their dedication to zero emission transportation became evident in 2020 when they placed an additional order for ten Ebusco 2.2 buses  reaffirming their satisfaction and trust in Ebusco's products.Following the introduction of the Ebusco 3.0  Multiobus recognized the potential of this lightweight innovation and placed an order for two Ebusco 3.0 buses  which are currently in production. Now  with specific configuration requirements  and the already proven concept of the Ebusco 2.2  Ebusco and Multiobus are once again collaborating to provide sustainable and affordable transportation. Since the Ebusco 2.2 model has shown to be highly competitive in terms of TCO - Total Cost of Ownership  Multiobus ensures itself of an ecologically and economically choice.Olivier Van Mullem  CEO at Multiobus  comments: ""We've had a longstanding partnership with Ebusco  and their unwavering dedication continues to leave us impressed. Our belief in the future of electric mobility has been steadfast  and like Ebusco  we've faced scepticism for our commitment to this vision. Now  six years since our initial collaboration with Ebusco  we stand even more firmly behind our shared philosophy  hence this new order and extended partnership.""Brad van de Kerkhof  Account Manager Benelux at Ebusco comments: ""We are immensely proud of the cooperation with Multiobus and are grateful for their trust and friendship over the last years.We admire Multiobus immensely as they bravely took the lead in the transition towards zero emission transportation and we are looking forward to many more years of collaboration""",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,positive,0.76,0.23,0.01,True,English,"['fourth repeat order', '20 new Ebusco 2.2 buses', 'Ebusco N', 'Multiobus', 'October', '01:40', 'Brad van de Kerkhof', 'largest public transport authority', 'Olivier Van Mullem', 'low floor configuration', 'specific configuration requirements', 'Account Manager Benelux', 'zero emission transportation', 'largest bus exhibition', 'four Ebusco 2.1 buses', 'ten Ebusco 2.2 buses', 'two Ebusco 3.0 buses', '20 new Ebusco 2.2 buses', 'De Lijn', 'affordable transportation', 'electric buses', '20 ordered buses', 'new order', 'charging systems', 'energy storage', 'lasting partner', 'special significance', 'home country', 'battery pack', 'several models', 'electric journey', 'significant step', 'early clients', 'initial fleet', 'lightweight innovation', 'proven concept', 'economically choice', 'longstanding partnership', 'electric mobility', 'extended partnership', '20 Ebusco 2.2 buses', '36 Ebusco buses', 'early years', 'additional order', 'last years', 'Ebusco 2.2 model', 'several orders', 'Total Cost', 'unwavering dedication', 'initial collaboration', 'Multiobus fleet', 'Deurne', 'pioneer', 'frontrunner', 'development', 'contract', 'confidence', 'Busworld', 'Brussels', 'location', 'Belgium', 'The', '400 kWh', 'name', 'Tienen', 'beginning', 'satisfaction', 'trust', 'products', 'introduction', 'potential', 'production', 'sustainable', 'terms', 'TCO', 'Ownership', 'ecologically', 'CEO', 'belief', 'future', 'scepticism', 'commitment', 'vision', 'philosophy', 'cooperation', 'friendship', 'lead', 'transition', 'many', '09']",2023-10-09,2023-10-10,marketscreener.com

Euronav holds 8.23% of its shares in treasury. In compliance with Belgian takeover rules  CMB will launch a mandatory public takeover offer (""the Offer"") for all outstanding shares in the Company that are not already owned by CMB or its affiliates  at a price of $18.43 per share  reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the gross amount per share of any future distributions by Euronav to its shareholders with an ex-dividend date prior to the settlement date of the Offer. The Offer price will be paid in cash.The agreements to which the Company is party  namely the Fleet Sale for a price reflecting market value and the Settlement Agreement  fall within the scope of the related parties transactions procedure under Belgian law. They have been approved by the Euronav Supervisory Board  on the advice of the Independent Directors' Committee stating that a continuing governance  structural and strategic deadlock between Euronav's reference shareholders may adversely impact the Company's ability to adapt to customer expectation and market evolutions  which is expected to become value destructive in the longer term. More detail can be found in the announcement attached to this press release.Lieve Logghe  Euronav CFO and interim CEO  stated: ""After many months of uncertainty  the transaction announced today leverages the value that Euronav and its people have created through many years of hard work. It represents a balanced outcome for shareholders  who now have the choice between realising that value in cash or following Euronav in a new strategic direction under a new controlling shareholder.""Transaction detailsThe transaction consists of three distinct agreements  each of which is dependent upon the approval and implementation of the other two:i) CMB to purchase all Euronav shares held by Frontline CMB has entered into the Share Sale with Frontline to acquire all of the 57 479 744 Euronav shares currently owned by Frontline (representing 26.12% of Euronav's issued shares)  for a purchase price of USD 18.43 per share. The completion of the Share Sale is subject to merger control approvals and approval by a Special General Meeting (SGM) of Euronav shareholders of the conditionality of the Fleet Sale on the completion of the Share Sale in accordance with Article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations.ii) Frontline to acquire 24 VLCC tankers from Euronav for an aggregate purchase price of $2.35 billion  subject to completion of the Share Sale. The Vessel Sale from Euronav to Frontline covers vessels with an average age of 5.3 years (see list in appendix) and is subject to merger control approvals and approval by a Special General Meeting (SGM) of Euronav shareholders of the conditionality of the Fleet Sale and the Settlement Agreement on the completion of the Share Sale in accordance with Article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations. The cash price is subject to a price adjustment mechanism to reflect final delivery schedules.iii) Euronav's pending arbitration action against Frontline to be terminated. As an integrated part of a proposed package deal to resolve the deadlock  the arbitration action filed by Euronav in January 2023 following Frontline's withdrawal from their combination agreement will be terminated. No cash consideration is included in the Settlement Agreement. Without settlement  the case would have posed a significant obstacle to the resolution of the governance deadlock between the Company's reference shareholders.Mandatory takeover offer Following the completion of the Share Sale  expected in Q4 2023  CMB's shareholding will exceed the 30% threshold at which the acquirer is compelled under Belgian law to launch a mandatory takeover offer (""the Offer""). CMB will need to publish an Offer prospectus and launch its Offer for all outstanding Euronav shares. The Offer will be at a price of $18.43 per share  reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the gross amount per share of any future distributions by Euronav to its shareholders with an ex-dividend date prior to the settlement date of the Offer. The Offer price will be paid in cash. Until the completion of the Share Sale  the Company will not distribute any dividends to its shareholders.The Offer price is in line with Euronav's net asset value (NAV) and  as such  representative of the Company's intrinsic value in a context where most listed peers trade at a discount to NAV. Prior to the Offer launch  CMB will already hold a controlling stake in the Company.The Offer  once made  which will carry no acceptance threshold and will provide Euronav shareholders with a choice between selling at a price that reflects the Company's intrinsic value or remaining invested in a listed entity whose new controlling shareholder has stated an intention to change its strategic direction  as further outlined in CMB's press release of 9 October 2023.Euronav notes that CMB intends to maintain Euronav's listing on Euronext Brussels and the New York Stock Exchange  and therefore has no intention to launch a squeeze-out bid following the closing of the Offer.Indicative timetable9 October  2023 Announcement of proposed transaction Signature of the related contractsQ4 2023 Convening of Special General Meeting (SGM) announced2 November  2023 Euronav Q3 resultsQ4 2023 SGMQ4 2023 Share Sale completion and settlement Fleet Sale completion and settlementQ1 2024 CMB launches mandatory offer (MTO) for Euronav (art 5)Q1 2024 Targeted approval date of MTO ProspectusQ1/Q2 2024 Targeted close of acceptance period for MTOAPPENDIXList of vessels to be acquired by Frontline from the Euronav fleetBuild year No. Vessels2015 1 Dominica2016 9 Alboran  Alex  Alice  Andaman  Anne  Arafura  Aral  Desirade    Drenec2017 5 Amundsen  Aquitaine  Ardeche  Hatteras  Heron2019 1 Derius 2020 1 Dalis2021 4 Delos  Dickens  Diodorus  Doris2023 3 Camus  Cassius  ClovisContact: Brian Gallagher - Head of IR Communications & Management Board member Tel: +44 20 78 70 04 36 Email: IR@euronav.com Agreement between reference shareholders - 9 October 2023About Euronav NVEuronav is an independent tanker company engaged in the ocean transportation and storage of crude oil.

The offer to purchase and related materials may also be obtained (when available) for free by U.S. shareholders by contacting the information agent for the tender offer that will be named in the tender offer statement on Schedule TO.ANTWERP  Belgium  9 October 2023 - Yesterday evening  the Supervisory Board of Euronav NV (""EURN""  ""Euronav"" or ""the Company"") (NYSE: EURN & Euronext: EURN) approved the entry by Euronav into a partial fleet sale and an arbitration settlement  as part of a set of transactions involving Euronav's reference shareholders  Frontline plc/Famatown Finance Limited (""Frontline"") and CMB NV (""CMB"")  owners of respectively 26.124% and 22.929% of the shares in Euronav.The broader set of transactions comprises three interdependent agreements: (i) the sale by Frontline of all its Euronav shares to CMB   followed by a mandatory public takeover offer by CMB on all outstanding Euronav shares (the ""Share Sale""); (ii) the sale of part of the Euronav fleet (24 vessels) to Frontline (the ""Fleet Sale""); (iii) the settlement of the arbitration proceedings initiated by Euronav in connection with the termination by Frontline of the combination agreement dated 10 July 2022 (the ""Settlement Agreement"").Frontline  as counterparty to the Fleet Sale and the Settlement Agreement  is a related party of the Company within the meaning of IAS 24. The Fleet Sale and the Settlement Agreement (together the ""Related Party Transactions"") are therefore subject to the procedure provided for in Article 7:116 BCCA  which applies to any decision or transaction made in execution of a decision of the Supervisory Board of a listed company relating to a related party.During its meeting of 8 October 2023  the Supervisory Board has decided to enter into the transaction documents setting out the terms and conditions for the Related Party Transactions.The fundamental difference in view on the medium- to long-term strategy of the Company between Frontline and CMB has led to a strategic deadlock within the Company. This is reinforced by a structural deadlock resulting from the fact that each of Frontline and CMB has a blocking minority on structural decisions and the existence of various factions within the Supervisory Board. The Related Party Transactions form  together with the Share Sale  an integral solution for this deadlock.The Related Party Transactions are conditional upon completion of the Share Sale. In addition  the Fleet Sale and the Share Sale are conditional upon  inter alia  the obtention of regulatory approvals.A Committee of three independent members of Euronav's Supervisory Board has reviewed the terms and conditions of the transaction documents for the Related Party Transactions in accordance with the provisions of Article 7:116 BCCA and has issued a written reasoned advice to the Supervisory Board. In its advice  the Committee stated that it is of the view that in light of the integrated long-term solution to the deadlock within Euronav  the Fleet Sale and the Settlement Agreement are not manifestly unlawful in nature and that it is unlikely that the Fleet Sale and the Settlement Agreement would result in disadvantages to Euronav that are not outweighed by benefits to Euronav. The Committee therefore advised favourably on the proposed Fleet Sale and Settlement Agreement.The Share SaleThe Share Sale will trigger the requirement for CMB to launch a mandatory takeover offer on all shares of Euronav  at the same price as the Share Sale. Accordingly  all shareholders of Euronav will have the opportunity to sell their shares for the same price at which Frontline will have sold its shares to CMB.The Fleet SaleThe aggregate purchase price for the Fleet Sale amounts to USD 2.350 billion  payable in cash  which has been determined on the basis of an average of three broker valuations. The Committee of Independent members of the Supervisory Board further obtained asset valuations from another broker  which was in line with this valuation. The Committee further considered the Price/NAV ratios of selected precedent transactions  concluding on an average Price/NAV ratio of 0.9x and a median of 1.0x  which is in line with the ratio applied for the Fleet Sale. The Fleet Sale would provide capital to Euronav to implement  with CMB as controlling shareholder  strategic change through the acquisition of a more diversified fleet in the future.The SettlementThrough the Settlement Agreement  Euronav will waive its claims against Frontline in connection with the termination by Frontline of the combination agreement dated 10 July 2022  without financial compensation  subject to completion of the Share Sale. The Company has been requested by the reference shareholders to consider the deadlock solution as one package. Frontline has also indicated that it will not enter into the Fleet Sale or the Share Sale without the Settlement Agreement. On this basis  the Settlement Agreement is considered as an integrated part of a proposed package deal to resolve the deadlock. The Committee is of the opinion that the potential receipt of one-time compensatory damages would not outweigh the potential value destruction to the Company caused by the continuation of the governance deadlock over a longer period of time. In addition  the Committee notes that the arbitration proceedings will only be terminated following completion of the Share Sale.The assessment carried out by Euronav's statutory auditor in accordance with Article 7:116 BCCA provides as follows: Based on our assessment  nothing has come to our attention that makes us to believe that the financial and accounting data referred to in the opinion of the committee of independent members of the supervisory board dated 8 October 2023 or in the minutes of supervisory board dated 8 October 2023  motivating the proposed transaction  are not consistent in all material respects with the information available to us in the context of our assignment.The Committee has been assisted by Lazard BV/SRL as financial advisors  and by Linklaters LLP as legal advisors.Beschrijving",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.1,0.29,0.61,True,English,"['reference shareholders', 'Euronav', 'Agreement', 'October', '02:10', 'related parties transactions procedure', 'Frontline plc/Famatown Finance Limited', 'mandatory public takeover offer', 'AGREEMENT BETWEEN REFERENCE SHAREHOLDERS', ""Independent Directors' Committee"", 'new controlling shareholder', 'merger control approvals', 'Special General Meeting', 'final delivery schedules', 'continuing governance, structural', 'new strategic direction', 'Mandatory takeover offer', 'Belgian takeover rules', 'three interdependent agreements', 'three distinct agreements', 'pending arbitration action', 'price adjustment mechanism', 'two reference shareholders', 'The Vessel Sale', 'Euronav Supervisory Board', 'aggregate purchase price', 'outstanding Euronav shares', 'outstanding shares', 'Belgian law', 'Belgian Code', 'Fleet Sale', 'entrenched differences', '24 VLCC tankers', 'voting rights', 'gross amount', 'future distributions', 'ex-dividend date', 'strategic deadlock', 'customer expectation', 'market evolutions', 'longer term', 'More detail', 'press release', 'Lieve Logghe', 'interim CEO', 'many months', 'hard work', 'balanced outcome', 'average age', 'integrated part', 'package deal', 'combination agreement', 'significant obstacle', 'governance deadlock', 'Offer prospectus', 'Settlement Agreement', 'settlement date', 'Offer price', 'Euronav shareholders', 'Share Sale', 'The Company', 'other shareholders', 'cash consideration', 'Euronav NV', 'Euronav fleet', 'Euronav CFO', 'dollar basis', 'market value', 'many years', 'cash price', '57,479,744 Euronav shares', 'CMB NV', 'Transaction details', 'cash value', 'Frontline CMB', '5.3 years', 'Belgium', 'EURN', 'NYSE', 'Euronext', 'strategy', 'opportunity', 'investment', '26.12% stake', 'affiliates', 'acquisition', 'treasury', 'compliance', 'scope', 'advice', 'ability', 'announcement', 'uncertainty', 'people', 'choice', 'implementation', 'completion', 'SGM', 'conditionality', 'accordance', 'Article', 'Companies', 'Associations', 'vessels', 'list', 'appendix', 'January', 'withdrawal', 'case', 'resolution', 'Q4', 'shareholding', '30% threshold', 'acquirer']",2023-10-09,2023-10-10,marketscreener.com

Certolizumab pegol can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate. Certolizumab pegol in combination with MTX is also indicated for the treatment of severe  active and progressive RA in adults not previously treated with MTX or other DMARDs. Certolizumab pegol has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function  when given in combination with MTX.Certolizumab pegol  in combination with MTX  is also indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate. Certolizumab pegol can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.Certolizumab pegol is also indicated in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with severe active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)  comprising:Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) - adults with severe active AS who have had an inadequate response to  or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) without radiographic evidence of AS - adults with severe active axSpA without radiographic evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) who have had an inadequate response to  or are intolerant to NSAIDs.Certolizumab pegol is also indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.Cimzia® (certolizumab pegol) EU/EEA Important Safety Information2Cimzia® was studied in 4 049 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in controlled and open label trials for up to 92 months. The commonly reported adverse reactions (1-10%) in clinical trials with certolizumab pegol and post-marketing were viral infections (includes herpes zoster  papillomavirus  influenza)  bacterial infections (including abscess)  rash  headache (including migraine)  asthenia  leukopenia (including lymphopenia  neutropenia)  eosinophilic disorder  pain (any sites)  pyrexia  sensory abnormalities  hypertension  pruritus (any sites)  hepatitis (including hepatic enzyme increase)  injection site reactions  and nausea. Serious adverse reactions include sepsis  opportunistic infections  tuberculosis (including miliary  disseminated and extrapulmonary)  herpes zoster  lymphoma  leukaemia  solid organ tumours  angioneurotic oedema  cardiomyopathies (includes heart failure)  ischemic coronary artery disorders  pancytopenia  hypercoagulation (including thrombophlebitis  pulmonary embolism)  cerebrovascular accident  vasculitis  hepatitis/hepatopathy (includes cirrhosis)  and renal impairment/nephropathy (includes nephritis). In RA controlled clinical trials  4.4% of patients discontinued taking certolizumab pegol due to adverse events vs. 2.7% for placebo.Certolizumab pegol was initially studied in 325 patients with active axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in the AS001 clinical study for up to 4 years  which includes a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 24-week dose-blind period and a 156-week open-label treatment period. Certolizumab pegol was subsequently studied in 317 patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in a placebo-controlled study for 52 weeks (AS0006). Certolizumab pegol was also studied in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in a clinical study for up to 96 weeks  which included a 48-week open-label run-in phase (N=736) followed by a 48-week placebo-controlled phase (N=313) for patients in sustained remission (C-OPTIMISE). Certolizumab pegol was also studied in a 96-week open-label study in 89 axSpA patients with a history of documented anterior uveitis flares. In all 4 studies  the safety profile for these patients was consistent with the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis and previous experience with certolizumab pegol.Certolizumab pegol was studied in 409 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in a clinical study for up to 4 years which included a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 24-week dose-blind period and a 168-week open-label treatment period.The safety profile for axSpA and PsA patients treated with certolizumab pegol was consistent with the safety profile in RA and previous experience with certolizumab pegol.Certolizumab pegol was studied in 1112 patients with psoriasis in controlled and open-label studies for up to 3 years. In the Phase III program  the initial and maintenance periods were followed by a 96-week open-label treatment period. The long-term safety profile of certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 2 weeks and certolizumab pegol 200 mg every 2 weeks was generally similar and consistent with previous experience with certolizumab pegol.Certolizumab pegol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients  active tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis or opportunistic infections  and moderate to severe heart failure.Serious infections including sepsis  tuberculosis and opportunistic infections (e.g. histoplasmosis  nocardia  candidiasis) have been reported in patients receiving certolizumab pegol. Some of these events have been fatal. Before initiation of therapy with certolizumab pegol  all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive (latent) tuberculosis infection. If active tuberculosis is diagnosed prior to or during treatment  certolizumab pegol therapy must not be initiated and must be discontinued. If latent tuberculosis is diagnosed  appropriate anti- tuberculosis therapy must be started before initiating treatment with certolizumab pegol.Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including certolizumab pegol who are chronic carriers of the virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal outcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with certolizumab pegol. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with certolizumab pegol should be closely monitored and in the case of HBV reactivation Certolizumab pegol should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.TNF antagonists including certolizumab pegol may increase the risk of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis; of formation of autoantibodies and uncommonly of the development of a lupus-like syndrome; of severe hypersensitivity reactions. If a patient develops any of these adverse reactions  certolizumab pegol should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.With the current knowledge  a possible risk for the development of lymphomas  leukaemia or other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF antagonist cannot be excluded. Rare cases of neurological disorders  including seizure disorder  neuritis and peripheral neuropathy  have been reported in patients treated with certolizumab pegol.Adverse reactions of the haematologic system  including medically significant cytopenia  have been reported with certolizumab pegol. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g.  persistent fever  bruising  bleeding  pallor) while on certolizumab pegol. Consider discontinuation of certolizumab pegol therapy in patients with confirmed significant haematological abnormalities.The use of certolizumab pegol in combination with anakinra or abatacept is not recommended due to a potential increased risk of serious infections. As no data are available  certolizumab pegol should not be administered concurrently with live vaccines. The 14-day half-life of certolizumab pegol should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A patient who requires surgery while on certolizumab pegol should be closely monitored for infections.Please consult the full prescribing information in relation to other side effects  full safety and prescribing information.European SmPC date of revision April 2023. https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/cimzia-epar-product-information_en.pdf Last Accessed: October 2023About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.3 The therapeutic indications in the European Union are:Plaque psoriasis : Bimekizumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. 1Psoriatic arthritis : Bimekizumab is indicated alone or in combination with methotrexate  for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 1Axial Spondyloarthritis: Bimekizumab is indicated for the treatment of adults with active non radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  and for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to conventional therapy.1BIMZELX®▼(bimekizumab) EU/EEA* Important Safety Information1The most frequently reported adverse reactions with bimekizumab were upper respiratory tract infections (14.5%  14.6%  16.3% in plaque psoriasis (PSO)  psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)  respectively) and oral candidiasis (7.3%  2.3%  3.7% in PSO  PsA and axSpA  respectively). Common adverse reactions (≥1/100 to <1/10) were oral candidiasis  tinea infections  ear infections  herpes simplex infections  oropharyngeal candidiasis  gastroenteritis  folliculitis  headache  rash  dermatitis and eczema  acne  injection site reactions  fatigue. Elderly may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions such as oral candidiasis  dermatitis and eczema when using bimekizumab.Bimekizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients and in patients with clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis).Bimekizumab may increase the risk of infections. Treatment with bimekizumab must not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection. Patients treated with bimekizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient develops an infection the patient should be carefully monitored. If the infection becomes serious or is not responding to standard therapy  treatment should be discontinued until the infection resolves. Prior to initiating treatment with bimekizumab  patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Bimekizumab should not be given in patients with active TB. Patients receiving bimekizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB.Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with bimekizumab. Bimekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease  bimekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical management should be initiated.Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been observed with IL-17 inhibitors. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs  administration of bimekizumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.Live vaccines should not be given in patients treated with bimekizumab.Please consult the summary of product characteristics in relation to other side effects  full safety and prescribing information.European SmPC date of revision: June 2023.https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/bimzelx-epar-product- information_en.pdfLast accessed: October 2023.*EU/EEA means European Union/European Economic Area▼This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

Newave Energia will also rely on Voltalia for the construction and maintenance of electrical infrastructure.Newave Energia has acquired ready-to-build solar projects in the Arinos cluster  located in the state of Minas Gerais  in the south-east region of Brazil. Voltalia will also provide construction and maintenance services for the electrical infrastructure. Newave Energia's future photovoltaic power plants will produce the equivalent of the consumption of 1.3 million of the country's inhabitants and avoid the emission of approximately 350 kt of CO2 per year.The project that was sold is a part of the larger Arinos cluster. The cluster has a total potential capacity of over 1.8 gigawatts  and Voltalia is responsible for developing the entire cluster  including this sold project. The whole site will enjoy cost savings due to its size  and Newave Energia's project plays a significant role in this.This partnership with Newave Energia is a further demonstration of the appetite for projects developed by Voltalia. By the end of the year  in Brazil and other countries  more than 100 additional megawatts should be sold by Voltalia  along with construction and maintenance services.“Our success with the Arinos cluster demonstrates our skill in developing high-quality energy projects. It not only adds to our future project pipeline of sites to be built but also lets our partners contribute to renewable energy growth.
