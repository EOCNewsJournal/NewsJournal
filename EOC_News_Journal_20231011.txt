Estrogen plays an important role across organs and tissues and is pivotal in governing the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. It is at the heart of women’s health  due to its intricate role  and regulation of multiple functions.E4 is a key active pharmaceutical ingredient in both Mithra’s first E4-based combined oral contraceptive (COC) ESTELLE®  which is already marketed  and its next generation hormone therapy candidate for postmenopausal symptoms  DONESTA®. Robust data from preclinical and clinical studies underscoring E4's compelling safety and efficacy profile.Dr. Graham Dixon  Chief Scientific Officer of Mithra  said: “The symposium at the FIGO congress will provide an opportunity to present the vital role of estrogen in women’s health  and the potential groundbreaking characteristics of our E4 product to support healthcare professionals and women’s confidence in hormone therapy. While ongoing research promises deeper understanding  current data strongly suggests that E4's unique molecular mode of action and metabolism contribute notably to its selective pharmacological profile  suggesting its favorable benefit–risk ratio in transforming women's health. In particular  the exclusive and innovative profile of E4 shows its possible ability to significantly improve contraception and treatment of postmenopausal women  with a strong safety profile. We are grateful to our presenters  who are all leading experts in the field  and look forward to this opportunity to discuss the role of estrogens with the scientific community at FIGO.”Pre-clinical and clinical data have shown its proapoptotic effect on breast cancer tissue  indicating therapeutic promise. In postmenopausal patients with breast cancer  E4 shows objective antitumor effects  promising a valuable addition to breast cancer interventions. As a component in a COC with drospirenone and under development for menopausal hormone therapy  E4 demonstrates therapeutic efficacy beyond contraception. It elicits estrogenic activity in uterovaginal tissues  contributing to bone turnover  and shows positive effects on cardiovascular functions.

This represents a saving of up to 1 200 euros in case of failure compared with a traditional driving school. The aim is to maximize the driver's chances of success  and also to provide him/her with some follow-up after the driving test.A candidate already in training who has not yet completed more than 15 hours of driving lessons can subscribe to the "" Driving license Insurance "". For 19.90 euros per month  this insurance is available to all candidates wishing to complete their manual gearbox driver's license training with lePERMISLIBRE.Commenting on this new offer  Lucas TOURNEL  CEO of lePERMISLIBRE  says: ""This innovation tackles head-on the major challenges associated with obtaining a driving license  such as the often-prohibitive cost and the anxiety along with the fear of failure. We have designed our driving license insurance offer with this in mind and with this conviction  to guarantee everyone a more serene learning experience and assured mobility"".A new step forward on the roadmap and an additional source of revenue forPERMISLIBREAfter a first half-year marked by the development of new offerings  lePERMISLIBRE continues to revolutionize a market that hasn't seen such innovation since the arrival of online driving schools 10 years ago  and is poised to take on a challenge in a sector that needs change to meet the evolving needs of its customers.The ""Driving License Insurance"" is also expected to contribute to the company's sales growth from 2024.Next press release23 January 2024: 2023 annual revenueABOUT LEPERMISLIBREFounded in Lyon in 2014 and a pioneer of digital driving schools in France  lePERMISLIBRE is reinventing driving lessons by providing a disruptive offering compared to traditional players  more aligned with the new habits and lifestyles of the digital native generation that grew up with the development of digital technology. lePERMISLIBRE federates a community of more than 1 000 loyal  committed and passionate driving instructors  all of whom are State-qualified.

This exposes them to substantial compliance risk  according to a new Wolters Kluwer survey  with non-compliance resulting in hefty fines and  potentially  incarceration. The U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) estimates that the rule will impact approximately 32.6 million reporting companies in 2024 alone  with five million new reporting companies formed and registered every year going forward.The survey findings  reflecting input from 669 U.S.-based companies  as well as 328 law firms and accounting firms  are based on a questionnaire exploring general awareness of and readiness for complying with the CTA’s new beneficial ownership rule. While the rule will apply to half (51%) of the firms that participated in the survey  74% of those companies for which the CTA rule will be applicable indicated they only became aware of the rule by having taken the survey. Many respondents aware of the CTA were unsure (41%) whether the beneficial ownership rule  as implemented by FinCEN  would apply to them  despite their company’s reporting status and revenue size.“Lack of understanding regarding the applicability of beneficial ownership reporting is significant—41% are ‘unsure’ among companies we surveyed—as is the lack of awareness about the CTA in general ” said George May  Vice President and Segment Leader  Small Business  for CT Corporation  a Wolters Kluwer business.Among those respondents who felt the CTA applies to their organization  only 27% anticipate doing their own reporting  with 48% anticipating using third parties  and another 25% are unsure as to their plans.“These are troubling figures  given both the percentage of businesses that are subject to the reporting requirements and where their organizations stand today in terms of preparing for an effective date that is right around the corner ” May added.Feedback among CPA firms and law firms surveyed was similar  with only 54% confirming awareness of the CTA before having taken the survey  versus 46% who were unaware.“Small businesses will look to their CPA firms and law firms for guidance on the CTA. Yet among those advisors  awareness of the Act is mixed and there is a high degree of uncertainty on the part they want to play in supporting their clients ” said Ross Aronowitz  Vice President  CT Corporation Law Firm segment  Wolters Kluwer. “Determining a plan of action and executing on that plan will be essential for professional advisory firms subject to the rule—and for their clients—in complying with this new law.”The survey was conducted from June 15 to July 5 via Qualtrics  with Wolters Kluwer identified as the study sponsor.The beneficial ownership reporting rule  part of the CTA and issued by FinCEN in September 2022  will require companies to collect  document and monitor previously unreported data on a company’s primary owners via completion of a Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) report. Every person who owns or manages a limited liability company (LLC) needs to be aware of the new reporting requirement  first to determine if their company is subject to BOI reporting and  if so  to begin preparing to comply.More information on navigating the new beneficial ownership rule is available by visiting the CTA Resources page.For more than 130 years  Wolters Kluwer CT Corporation has been the leading provider of registered agent services  incorporation services  and legal entity compliance.

(""Company"". ""Farmacosmo"")  a company active in the Health  Pharma & Beauty sector  listed on the Euronext Growth Milan market of Borsa Italiana  announces that the Board of Directors met today and approved the consolidated half-year financial report as of June 30  2023. Fabio de Concilio  President and CEO of Farmacosmo  commented  ""The results achieved during the first half of 2023  influenced by the numerous investments made in the companies acquired during 2022 and 2023  show excellent progression in the retail channel with all portals growing both in terms of revenue and increase in marginality. The retail channel consists of the following portals: www.farmacosmo.it  www.profumeriaweb.com  www.pharmasi.it   www.baucosmesi.itThe Farmacosmo portal shows all KPIs improving and an average shopping cart in the first six months of Euro 98 and consistently above Euro 100 since July. Significant efficiency improvements have been made to the ProfumeriaWeb portal (acquired on 09/29/2022)  resulting in substantial cost savings and ongoing operations that have brought EBITDA to - 82 000 Euros compared to-660 000Eurosfor the entire 2022. The second half of the year leaves us strongly confident: logistics operations in Nola have been operational since July  leading to significant cost savings; in October  the launch of the new website is planned  with additional cost savings and the possibility to initiate marketing campaigns to further drive growth. The Pharmasi portal (acquired on 11/11/2022)  has shown revenue growth (+14% YoY) thanks to the many synergies and optimizations put in place by the joint work team with Farmacosmo; furthermore  aligning rates with those of Farmacosmo  significant savings have already been recorded. The Bau Cosmesi portal (acquired on 02/02/2023) has grown more than 130% over the previous year  and numerous initiatives have been put in place that will enable the brand to further establish itself in the PET segment: suppliers and available products on the portal have increased  and it will also sell dietary supplements for pets. Overall  the Group's portals recorded about 11 million visitors in the six-month period with a total number of items sold of about 4.6 million. Strategic initiatives for the development of physical pharmacies and digital services (ContactU.it  the telepsychology platform) reflect the initial structural and marketing investment costs. ContactU  launched in June 2023  is growing day by day: in early July we launched parental and couples telepsychology services. As of now  the platform boasts more than 100 active professionals  more than 1 000 therapies conducted and the launch of the first B2B services called 'the Psychological Wellness in the company'  thanks to 'the agreement with some companies. We look forward with confidence to the second half of the year  which will be characterized by the typical seasonality of online commerce  which records the principal volumes in October  November and December"". Key consolidated results as of June 30th 2023 Consolidated Sales Revenues amount to approximately Euro 36 7 million  showing a growth of 14% compared to approximately Euro 32 1 million in the same period of the previous year. The result is mainly related to the growth of the retail channel2 (+28% YoY)  and can be attributed to the organic growth of the farmacosmo.it portal and the contribution of the group's new portals. Notably  the first half of 2023 witnessed excellent progress for the www.baucosmesi.itportal  acquired in February 2023  with revenues reaching approximately Euro 240 000  an increase of over 130% compared to the previous year. On the other hand  the B2B channel saw a decline (-17% YoY)  resulting in B2B turnover accounting for 33% of consolidated revenue as of June 30  2023 (compared to 56% at the time of listing). This reflects the continued focus of Farmacosmo Group on its core and more profitable business segments  retail  and digital services. Costs for services amount to 5 250 thousand Euro:with an increase in Farmacosmo S.p.A. alone (+17% YoY)  influenced not only by organic growth (increased marketing and transportation expenses) but also by the costs associated with being a listed company. These costs impacted the previous fiscal semester for only one quarter  considering the company's listing took place at the end of March 2022. Additionally  the increase is mainly attributable to the consolidation of subsidiaries  which nevertheless benefit from numerous cost synergies such as transportation and packaging costs  whose rates are now aligned with those of the Parent Company. Please note that as of March and July  respectively  the Bau Cosmesi and ProfumeriaWeb logistics have been hosted at the Parent Company's logistics platform in Nola  resulting in significant cost savings and operational synergies due to the centralization of distribution activities. Both Bau Cosmesi and Profumeriaweb are managed with the proprietary software ""Delivery Manager"". Personnel costs amounted to 2 032 thousand Euro. The increase in Farmacosmo S.p.A. alone  approximately 37%  is mainly attributable to the need to expand the workforce by strengthening key management through the hiring of the Chief Financial Officer and other professional figures in various sectors. The retail channel consists of the following portals: www.farmacosmo.it  www.profumeriaweb.com  www.pharmasi.it  www.baucosmesi.itThis expansion was in line with previously planned investment initiatives and growth objectives  primarily occurring in the second half of 2022. The additional increase can be attributed to the inclusion in the scope of consolidation of the subsidiaries  which were however downsized by virtue of the centralization of some activities in the Parent Company. Consolidated EBITDA as of June 30th 2023 amounted to approximately Euro 30 thousand (-88% YoY)  positively impacted by Farmacosmo S.p.A for Euro 319 thousand (+34% YoY). Adjusting the EBITDA from the impact of one-off cost components (mainly related to Vin.Ci. S.r.l.)  the Company would report anAdjusted consolidated EBITDA of approximately Euro 150 000. Many cost and revenue synergies have already started to show results  considering that Vin.Ci. S.r.l. (ProfumeriaWeb portal) reported an EBITDA of approximately -82 000 Euros in the first half of 2023. The Bau Cosmesi portal  just 4 months after the acquisition  already shows a positive EBITDA of about 2 thousand Euro despite the numerous investments and the full startup phase. Strategic initiatives for the development of physical pharmacies ( Innovation Pharma and its subsidiaries) and the development of digital services (the launch of ContactU  the telepsychology service) negatively impact by approximately 200 000 Euros due to their startup phase and initial structural costs. Depreciation and amortization amounts to approximately 1 556 thousand euros  marking a 318% increase compared to the same period of the previous year. The increase is related to the capitalization of listing costs on Euronext Growth Milan and the depreciation generated by the consolidation of investments  the latter not present in the previous period. The consolidated operating result as of June 30  2023  records a loss of Euro 2 100 compared to a net loss of Euro 286 thousand as of June 30  2022  significantly impacted by the aforementioned depreciation. The Farmacosmo Group closes the first half of 2023 with a net loss of Euro 1 730 thousand. Consolidated net financial debt amounts to 1 3 million Euros compared to a positive cash position of 5 2 million Euros as of December 31  2022. This is due to the movement in working capital  influenced by a significant reduction in liabilities to suppliers of approximately 4 2 million Euros and an increase in inventory of approximately 1 7 million Euros  mainly as a result of the direct purchase of key high-margin products. In addition  the period was characterized by investments made for the launch of the ContactU telepsychology platform and to support the relaunch of ProfumeriaWeb. Significant events after the end of the period On August 3  2023  it was announced that Farmacosmo and Laboratorio Farmaceutico Erfo S.p.A. (""Erfo"")  Innovative SME and benefit corporation operating in the nutraceutical sector  both listed on Euronext Growth Milan of Borsa Italiana  have entered into a binding agreement to acquire the entire share capital of FRCM1 S.r.l. (""Target "" ""FarmaWoW"")  owned by MP Holding S.r.l.  which is attributable to Dr. Maria Palomba. The Target company is the owner of the FarmaWoW Portal  an e-commerce platform specializing in the Pharma&Beauty sectors with over 43 000 products in its catalog. The transaction involves the sale of 100% of the Target's share capital for a consideration of EUR 310 000  subject to the application of a price adjustment mechanism in favor of the buyer based on the PFN as of the closing date  expected by the essential deadline of September 30  2023. The ownership will be divided as follows: 51% by Farmacosmo  which will have control  and 49% by Erfo. The Company will be managed by a Board of Directors consisting of three members with two designated by Farmacosmo (including the CEO) and one by Erfo (Chairman of the Board of Directors). It is also noted that the price will be paid in two installments:the first  amounting to Euro 136 200.00  will be paid in cash on the Closing Date  with EUR 69 462.00 being borne by Farmacosmo and EUR 66 738.00 by Erfo.The remaining amount will be paid upon the determination of threshold values preceding the determination of any price adjustment. The portion to be paid by Farmacosmo will be settled through the transfer of Farmacosmo shares  conventionally valued at EUR 2.25  while the Erfo portion will be paid in cash. For any further details please refer to the Press Release issued on August 3rd 2023. Foreseeable development of management The first six months of 2023 have shown a particularly challenging socioeconomic and market context significantly influenced by inflationary impacts  geopolitical tensions related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict  and frequent interest rate hikes by the ECB and all central banks. The future scenario incorporates the effects of the gradual implementation of measures outlined in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) but also includes risks associated with the future evolution of the geopolitical situation due to the Russian military intervention in Ukrainian territory and the inflationary environment  which represents a significant element of macroeconomic uncertainty. Despite this challenging context  the Farmacosmo Group has continued to pursue its Industrial Plan by entering the pet market through the acquisition of the 'baucosmesi' portal in February 2023 and venturing into the digital services arena with the launch of ContactU in March 2023  a digital platform specializing in online psychology and psychotherapy services. The first six months of 2023 witnessed the consolidation of the Farmacosmo Group in the retail channel (the portals www.farmacosmo.it www.profumeriaweb.com www.phàrmasi.it www.baucosmesi.it)  accounting for approximately 67% of the total turnover. In the second half of the year  further consolidation of these portals is expected due to the seasonal nature of the business and the anticipated revenue growth from the new portals  driven by an increase in active customers and average order value (AOV). Lastly  the second half of the year 2023 will be characterized by the typical seasonality of the online commerce market  with the main volumes occurring in October  November and December.Additionally  the second half of 2023 will see the continued development of the online telepsychology platform ContactU with the launch of couple and parental counseling services in July 2023  as well as the development of the FarmaWoW platform. . *** The company announced today that it has received the resignation of its independent director  Giuseppe Vita  from the position of director of the company's board  effective immediately.

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALTME)  a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME)  announces a positive update on survival at 18 months for patients receivingNOX-A12with the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab and radiotherapy  and provides an overview on upcoming clinical development plans forNOX-A12in the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma. The percentage of patients who were alive 18 months after start of therapy of NOX-A12 with the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab and radiotherapy is currently 50% (with the possibility to increase to 67% with the next patient reaching 18 months) which exceeds by 10-fold the 18-month survival of 5% observed in the matched group of patients receiving standard of care1. Since neither bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) alone  nor bevacizumab plus radiotherapy have previously shown to extend survival  the strong increase in survival can be attributed to the complementary mechanism of action of NOX-A12 with bevacizumab and radiotherapy2. The survival rate of the NOX-A12 triple combination also exceeds the 18-month survival of 20% seen in the patients with high levels of the NOX-A12 predictive biomarker EG12 receiving NOX-A12 + radiotherapy alone3  which further supports NOX-A12's potential to synergize with VEGF inhibition in glioblastoma (see figure below). Matched reference cohort of 20 patients from Giordano et al (2022 SNO Poster)  Chinot et al (2014) New England Journal of Medicine  Gilbert et al (2014) New England Journal of Medicine  Herrlinger et al (2016) J Clin Oncology NOX-A12 + radiotherapy survival data from Giordano et al (2023 ASCO Poster)Fig. Overall Survival at 18 months: NOX-A12 Combinations Improve Survival in Chemotherapy-Resistant Incompletely Resected Glioblastoma Patients The median overall survival has now reached 18 months and is expected to improve further as the remaining patients continue to receive treatment or follow-up care4. Two of the three living patients are clinically stable despite radiographic tumor progression at last report from treating clinicians  including the patient who achieved complete response  now completing 22 months therapy. As a reminder  the matched standard of care reference cohort achieved a median overall survival of 10.5 months. The NOX-A12-based therapy has now delivered median overall survival exceeding all the relevant competitor studies conducted in the US or EU involving newly diagnosed  chemotherapy-resistant (MGMT unmethylated) glioblastoma patients despite recruiting more difficult to treat patients whose tumors could not be fully removed by surgery5. NOX-A12 in combination with bevacizumab and radiotherapy continues to show an excellent safety and tolerability profile similar to that noted in previous publications. In the upcoming 6 months the key regulatory steps for NOX-A12 program in brain cancer will include the following: Q4 2023 - Request advice in October from US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on next trial design and eligibility for expedited regulatory pathways  such as Fast-Track Designation. Feedback expected in late December.Fast-Track Designation. Feedback expected in late December. Q1 2024 - Submit IND 6 application for glioblastoma with the US FDA along with expedited regulatory pathway access request. Successful IND filing and feedback targeted by end of Q1 2024. In a clinical study  measuring the median Overall Survival (mOS) is one way to assess how well a new treatment works. The longer the patients remain alive  the longer it takes to reach mOS. mOS can only be calculated when more than half of patients in the study have deceased. See TME Pharma 's Press Release dated 13 September 2023 for a competing benchmark therapies against chemotherapy resistant glioblastoma in development in the US or EU . Investigational New Drug (IND)   the authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug or biological product to patients in the US.TME Pharma plans to keep the market updated on the progress of these regulatory discussions. The goal is to have an FDA approved clinical trial protocol in glioblastoma with an expedited regulatory path by the beginning of April 2024 in order to secure the funding for the necessary clinical trial via partnership  investment or other strategic transaction types. ""We believe that survival data from the NOX-A12 bevacizumab expansion arm is now sufficiently mature and have made the decision to request advice from the US regulatory authority in the coming weeks. Once we have feedback from the FDA  we plan to submit an IND and request access to an expedited pathway for approval. We believe that having a clear path to marketing approval in brain cancer  validated by FDA  will significantly increase the attractiveness of NOX-A12 to investors and potential partners."" said Aram Mangasarian  CEO of TME Pharma. ""While we believe that the FDA will request a randomized clinical trial examining two doses of NOX-A12 combined with bevacizumab and radiotherapy and to compare these two dose regimens against standard of care as a next step  they may also request that these two doses of NOX-A12 be tested only with radiotherapy (without bevacizumab) in order to quantify precisely the benefit of the combination with NOX-A12 and bevacizumab  which would add two additional arms to the clinical trial. We anticipate that an additional trial or an expansion of the upcoming trial would be required for full approval."" For more information  please contact: TME Pharma N.V.

The company's oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck's Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France  Spain and the United States. The company's second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development. Further information can be found at: www.tmepharma.com. TME Pharma® and the TME Pharma logo are registered trademarks.
