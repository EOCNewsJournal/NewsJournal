The prime destination was Belgium  which hosts a trading centre in Antwerp with nearly 500 years of history.It is estimated that 84% of the world's rough diamonds and 50% of the polished diamonds pass through Antwerp  making the city a key pillar in global commerce.""Belgium plays an important role in diamonds trade and what we want is to do is to cut off Russian diamonds completely from our retail markets "" De Croo said. ""The best way to do that is a full traceability system to exclude Russian diamonds from the markets.""Traceability refers to a technology that digitally scans each diamond and its modifications in order to track its journey across markets  ensure the piece is always the same and boost credibility in the notoriously secretive industry.The hot-button issue of banning Russian diamonds has long been on the agenda of Western allies but progress has been slow going  causing Kyiv's visible frustration.The process is being coordinated at the EU and G7 levels in order to expand the ban's geographic scope as much as possible and therefore prevent outlawed diamonds from falling underground and popping up somewhere else under a different guise.""It has taken some time because we want to avoid that diamond bans will be circumvented "" De Croo said.""If you only do it on the wholesale market  then it will be traded to other diamond centres in the world and we will still have them in our shops. It will make no difference for Russia.""According to De Croo  the traceability system should be in place by 1 January 2024  a quite ambitious deadline given that each package of sanction entails arduous negotiations among member states and is always vulnerable to national vetoes.'Make Russia pay'During the joint press conference with President Zelenskyy  the prime minister also announced plans to set up a €1.7 billion fund to support Ukraine's reconstruction. The fund will be financed by taxing the proceedings obtained from the Russian-owned assets that have been immobilised as a result of EU sanctions.Over €180 billion in assets of the Russian Central Bank have been reportedly frozen at Euroclear  a Brussels-based financial services company  representing the largest amount by far in any member state.However  under current EU rules  De Croo noted  the Belgian government is not allowed to either access the assets or manage the proceedings  meaning it can only resort to taxation to extract additional funds for Ukraine.""We've always been clear from the start: any taxation on the Russian assets  it will not go into our budget  it will directly go to the Ukrainians "" De Croo said.""If at some point access to those proceeds would be legally possible  of course  we would be an enthusiastic partner in that.""The European Commission has promised to present a legislative text to ""make Russia pay"" by managing the immobilised assets  possibly through a windfall tax. But the proposal has been delayed several times and still lacks a presentation date.ADVERTISEMENTThe European Central Bank  financial experts and legal scholars have all raised serious concerns about the unprecedented initiative  warning the unilateral move could trigger financial instability and damage the euro's credibility.",neutral,0.34,0.64,0.02,negative,0.02,0.23,0.74,True,English,"['Zelenskyy surprise visit', 'Russian diamonds', 'Belgian PM', 'Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo', 'Brussels-based financial services company', 'The European Central Bank', 'The European Commission', 'Russian Central Bank', 'joint press conference', 'President Volodymr Zelenskyy', 'other diamond centres', 'current EU rules', 'Eastern member states', 'Russian blood diamonds', 'full traceability system', 'Belgian government', 'prime destination', 'European Union', 'President Zelenskyy', 'financial experts', 'financial instability', 'Russian war', 'Russian diamonds', 'Western countries', 'surprise visit', 'Wednesday afternoon', 'Ukrainian leader', 'restrictive measure', 'repeated pleas', 'important source', 'full-scale invasion', 'trading centre', 'key pillar', 'global commerce', 'important role', 'best way', 'secretive industry', 'hot-button issue', 'Western allies', 'visible frustration', 'G7 levels', 'geographic scope', 'different guise', 'diamond bans', 'wholesale market', 'ambitious deadline', 'arduous negotiations', 'national vetoes', 'largest amount', 'additional funds', 'enthusiastic partner', 'legislative text', 'windfall tax', 'presentation date', 'legal scholars', 'serious concerns', 'unprecedented initiative', 'unilateral move', 'rough diamonds', 'polished diamonds', 'diamonds trade', 'Russian assets', 'retail markets', '€1.7 billion fund', 'EU sanctions', 'Russian-owned assets', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'reporters', '11 packages', 'Kremlin', 'February', 'Kyiv', 'revenue', 'Ukraine', 'country', 'Belgium', 'Antwerp', '500 years', 'history', 'world', 'city', 'technology', 'modifications', 'order', 'journey', 'piece', 'credibility', 'agenda', 'progress', 'process', 'outlawed', 'time', 'shops', 'difference', 'place', '1 January', 'plans', 'reconstruction', 'proceedings', 'result', 'Euroclear', 'taxation', 'start', 'budget', 'Ukrainians', 'point', 'access', 'proceeds', 'proposal']",2023-10-11,2023-10-12,euronews.com

Then this plan is for you.Speaking at the start of annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  she added that ""we must continue to impose severe and increasing costs on Russia and continue efforts to ensure that Russia pays for the damage it has caused.""Currently  more than €200bn in Russian assets sit in clearing houses such as the Belgium-based Euroclear  which has already earned €1.5bn in interest over the €141bn it currently holds  in part due to proceeds gained from reinvesting those funds.The European Commission has discussed options to transfer interest income to Ukraine to support the war effort. But so far efforts have been bogged down by legal uncertainty and political disagreement.France and Germany have both resisted EU plans to tax the frozen assets  while European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde warned that it could undermine the Eurozone's financial stability.In March  a joint report by Kyiv  the European Commission  the World Bank  and the United Nations estimated that rebuilding infrastructure in the war-torn country will cost €400bn.EU officials have estimated that the windfall profit from Russia's frozen assets in Europe could provide €3bn a year to rebuild Ukraine.Yellen's comments come as US financial aid to Ukraine is increasingly subject to political wrangling and bickering.Speaking alongside Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg during a surprise visit to Brussels on Wednesday  Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine ""needs some support from the leaders. That is why I'm here today.""Last week  EU foreign ministers had already travelled to Kyiv to dispel rumours that EU and US support is wavering.Yellen  on Wednesday  seemed to do the same.

Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend. ArrowRight The intensifying push to use the assets for Ukraine comes as U.S. and European governments that support Kyiv encounter new domestic political roadblocks for their plans to send taxpayer money to the war effort  although officials insist the matters are unrelated. The Kremlin has an estimated $300 billion frozen in various bank accounts throughout Western countries  but experts have warned that simply taking that money would face legal challenges and pose major financial risks.Congress dropped U.S. aid to Ukraine last month from a measure to extend government operations into November at the urging of House Republicans  a growing number of whom strongly oppose assistance for Ukraine’s war effort resisting Russia’s aggression. The White House had sought $20.6 billion for Ukraine over the summer  but the Senate pared that back to $6 billion  and then the House forced all of it out of the short-term spending law.U.S. officials are adamant that Russian bank reserves are not a substitute for new emergency military and economic aid from Washington  which Ukraine needs to survive the next several months of the war. Even the most aggressive and optimistic advocates for redirecting the bank holdings believe it would take months — if not more than a year — for the money to reach Kyiv. And most of Russia’s reserves by far are held in Europe  where central bankers have expressed strong reservations about the impact of a seizure on their economies. If Washington acted alone  it could only make use of the estimated $5 billion held in the United States — a tiny share of the $300 billion of Russian money held around the world.AdvertisementBut within the Biden administration  the case for encouraging the West to redirect the assets is growing  even as some U.S. officials worry that the money might not be able to be used to pay to fight the war  but only for reconstruction.On Wednesday  meeting with leading Western financial officials in Morocco  Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen endorsed a European proposal to tax the wartime earnings of the Russian bank assets and transfer the proceeds to Ukraine — an intermediate step that could take effect quickly. Ukrainian officials have discussed using the tax proceeds along with some of the seized Russian assets as collateral to raise far greater sums from private investors  according to two other people with knowledge of the matter  who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. That would free Ukraine to borrow money on capital markets without having to risk as much of its own scarce reserves.On Wednesday  the Belgian government announced the creation of a $1.8 billion fund for Ukraine paid for by tax revenue from profits generated on seized Russian central bank assets. Most of the Russian money held in Europe is at the Belgian-based clearinghouse Euroclear. (The money will be used to help Ukraine with military support  civilian aid and refugee assistance  a government spokesman said.)Besides the GOP divisions over Ukraine  NATO member Slovakia recently elected a pro-Russian leader opposed to additional aid for Kyiv. Using Russian reserves would have the obvious political upside of not imposing greater costs on Western taxpayers.Advertisement“It is certainly back now as part of the discussion ” said one person briefed on internal talks by senior U.S. and European financial officials. “The U.S. has become much more open to not just seizing  but also using the Russian reserves.”In the years before launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine  Russia amassed $600 billion in foreign currencies from selling oil and gas to the West. This “war chest” was intended to give the Kremlin a financial backstop against the West if it ever were hit with broad economic sanctions.To safeguard the money  Russian President Vladimir Putin put more than half of the funds in Western accounts  with roughly $200 billion kept in Europe alone. Then Russia sent troops on a failed mission to decapitate the government in Kyiv in February 2022. Within days  the U.S. and European governments froze the assets  cutting Putin off from the reserves and eliciting a sharp rebuke from Moscow.AdvertisementSince then  the funds have sat untouched in bank accounts in countries such as France  Germany and Austria  with smaller amounts sequestered in Japan  Australia  the United States and Canada. In May  the Group of Seven Western industrialized nations announced in a joint statement that the assets “will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine.”But as the war has turned into a protracted stalemate  a growing chorus of experts has pushed for more immediate action.Share this article ShareIn September  Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe  who has been influential with Biden for decades  published a 124-page report articulating the legality of seizing the funds. Tribe’s position echoed the calls of Larry Summers  another Harvard professor who also has informally advised Biden for decades. Summers has joined former World Bank president Robert B. Zoellick and former U.S. State Department counselor Philip D. Zelikow in backing the economic case for redirecting the assets.AdvertisementIn Congress  meanwhile  Sens. James E. Risch (R-Idaho) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) also have released a bipartisan bill to authorize the administration to act.“It would be insane — literally insane — to say that we can’t do this until post-armistice  until hostilities have already ended ” Tribe said in an interview. “I’ve done my best to persuade them  because there’s no good argument against doing this  and the need now is greater than ever.”Summers has discussed the matter with senior Ukrainian officials  including the country’s prime minister and finance minister  according to one person familiar with the matter  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private exchange.“This is the rare case where the politically expedient thing is also the right thing to do ” Summers said. “Using Russian reserves rather than American taxpayer money is the right thing on economic grounds and moral grounds. It is surely better politics  and without accessing Russian resources  it’s inevitable that support for Ukraine will cannibalize support for other priorities like climate change  pandemic prevention and Africa.”AdvertisementSome Western nations have moved to facilitate such a strategy. Canada last year passed a budget implementation bill that gave its government new powers to seize the assets of individuals or entities on its sanctions list and to put the proceeds toward compensating victims and reconstructing foreign states “adversely affected by a grave breach of international peace and security.”Chrystia Freeland  Canada’s deputy prime minister and finance minister  has said she can “think of no more appropriate source of that funding than confiscated Russian assets.”“For sure  this is kind of pushing the boundary of sanctions  seizure  forfeiture ” said a Western government official with knowledge of discussions about the matter  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the subject. “But there seems to kind of an internationally growing consensus of … who is going to pay for this? Is this a Western responsibility  or does the Kremlin have a role to play as well?”AdvertisementAnd  yet  enormous legal and financial hurdles remain.If the Europeans were to confiscate the funds  some financial experts fear other governments would decide to take their money out of the euro zone more broadly.Lee C. Buchheit  a professor at the University of Edinburgh Law School  and Paul Stephan  a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law  also have written that “outright expropriation” would trigger constitutional safeguards unless the country involved is at war with the United States  which is not the case with Russia.“The constraint has not been a lack of policy imagination or political will; it has been the lack of an available legal pathway ” said Daleep Singh  who served as deputy director at the White House National Economic Council for Biden and now is at PGIM Fixed Income.,neutral,0.06,0.5,0.44,negative,0.03,0.33,0.65,True,English,"['$300 billion war chest', 'U.S.', 'push', 'Moscow', 'Kyiv', 'Treasury Secretary Janet L.

China’s EV market is the largest in the world with more than 4 million EVs sold in 2022  the equivalent of five times that sold in the US.3 For decades  China has dominated the global market for rare earth metals  which provides an inherent supply chain advantage for domestic production.Solar power technology is another area experiencing rapid growth in China. This year alone  China is expected to add an additional 30% capacity  or 95 to 120 gigawatts (GW) of solar power.4 Moreover  China is home to some of the world’s largest solar panel manufacturers  including Xinyi Solar  which controls 30% of the global market share.5Story continues“We believe China is currently undergoing an environmental renaissance  pledging hundreds of billions of dollars to environmental protection projects and policies ” said Jonathan Krane  Chief Executive Officer of KraneShares. “Chinese companies focused on contributing to a more environmentally sustainable economy may potentially benefit from this focused initiative.”“KGRN presents a compelling investment opportunity for those seeking to gain exposure to industries that are not only experiencing rapid growth  but are also actively addressing environmental challenges "" explains Dr. Xiaolin Chen  Head of International at KraneShares.

Name : EKINOPS ISIN Code : FR0011466069 Mnemonic code : EKI Number of shares: 26 801 716  Attachments   Original Link   Original Document…,"EKINOPS (Euronext Paris - FR0011466069 - EKI)  a leading supplier of telecommunications solutions for telecom operators and enterprises  has published its revenue for the third quarter of 2023 (July 1 - September 30  2023).Ekinops reported consolidated revenue of €27.8 million in Q3 2023  down -15% year-on-year. At constant exchange rates  quarterly sales declined by -13%.In addition to a very high basis for comparison (+36% growth in Q3 2022)  the Group's Q3 performance was impacted by a less buoyant market environment  marked by declining demand and a macroeconomic slowdown. In this context  Access equipment sales were notably affected in France and Asia-Pacific.For the first nine months of 2023  consolidated revenue was €98.8 million  representing total growth of +3% vs. the same period last year  which represented a particularly high basis for comparison (+28% growth). At constant exchange rates  growth was up +4% over the period.The first nine months of 2023 were characterized by the brisk growth in Optical Transport  up +23%  with sales notably doubling in France since the start of the year and increasing by +19% in North America.Sales for Access solutions were down -10% over the period  with a -19% decline in Q3 alone (reminder: H1 2023 sales declined -5%). In addition to an unfavorable basis for comparison (+26% over nine months in 2022)  this decline results from a depressed economic environment  marked by: (i) the slowdown in demand and a growing reluctance among customers to make investments; (ii) more complicated and expensive access to financing for operators; and (iii) cautious inventory management by major operators who had overstocked in response to the electronic components shortage in 2022.Driven by the success of network virtualization solutions and services  Software & Services posted robust Q3 growth (+44%)  accounting for 20% of the Group's total quarterly revenue. As of end-September  Software & Services revenue increased by 13%  representing 15% of the Group's total revenue (vs. 14% a year earlier).The first nine months showed +6% growth internationally  and a -3% decline in France. International business accounted for 66% of Ekinops' total revenue  versus 64% a year earlier.North America reported sales of €25.0 million  up +18% Y-o-Y (+22% in USD)  driven by strong demand for Optical Transport equipment. This strategic region now accounts for 26% of Group revenue over the period (vs. 22% one year prior).The EMEA region (Europe  excluding France  the Middle East and Africa)  representing 39% of Ekinops' revenue  recorded solid growth of +11% over the first nine months  with an increase in all business lines (+7% for Access equipment and +17% for Optical Transport solutions).At end-September 2023  revenue for Asia-Pacific - which remains highly concentrated and reliant on just a few key accounts - was down -64% (reminder: revenue up +36% on the same period last year). Over nine months  the region accounted for 2% of Ekinops' total revenue.Lastly  in its domestic market  sales were down -3% Y-o-Y. In Q3  the downturn was -24% in France (reminder: +59% growth in Q3 2022)  due to large inventories among key accounts for Access equipment  the main source of revenue in this market. Conversely  Optical Transport sustained its vigorous momentum with sales doubling since the beginning of the year. Ekinops generated 34% of its nine-month revenue in France.Didier Brédy  Chairman and CEO of Ekinops  said:""Given last year's particularly challenging comparative figures  Ekinops' third-quarter performance was penalized by the market environment  higher financing costs and large inventories at our operator customers. Our Access activity was impacted by the health of enterprises - our equipment end-users - and therefore by the economic conjuncture.

This building is rented to COVERGUARD  a major player on the market of personal protective equipment (PPE)  as part of a 9-year fixed-term lease.This new site  which is particularly attractive for transports- and logistics-related businesses  is located in the Business Parc (Parc d’Activité) of “la Dombes” in MIONNAY  located about twenty kilometres away from Lyon  on the North-East of the city. This site benefits from direct access to the A46 French highway  which is the Eastern bypass of Lyon.The 15.000 sq.m building is made of two cells for storage and orders preparation  of 6.500 sq.m each  and one office block of 1 500 sq.m. This site hosts the logistics business  but also the new headquarters of COVERGUARD  as part of a 9-year fixed-term lease.Historically located in the Lyon area  COVERGUARD is a major player on the market of personal protective equipment (PPE). The group designs  makes and distributes a full range of products for people’s protection on the workplace.This building  developed by JMG PARTNERS  testifies to ARGAN’s and COVERGUARD’s common ambition in terms of sustainable development and demonstrates benchmark standards regarding energy management. The site is Aut0nom®-labelled  i.e.  “the warehouse that generates and uses its own green energy”. By installing a photovoltaic power station on the roof  coupled with batteries for energy storage  renewable and carbon free energy is thus generated and used locally. On afull-year basis  the generated energy covers all the needs of COVERGUARD in terms of heating  cooling and lighting. Additionally  gas is banned  and highly CO 2 -emitting boilers are replaced by electric heat pumps that increase energy efficiency by a multiple and strongly limit emissions.Jean-Claude Le Lan  Founder and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of ARGAN concluded: “The Lyon region is a major logistics platform and is structurally in a situation of undersupply. With this new development  which is the second in the span of a few months on the Eastern bypass of Lyon  ARGAN is strengthening its premium positioning by investing at the heart of the French logistics backbone.”Financial calendar 2024 (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: 2023 Annual SalesJanuary 18: 2023 Annual ResultsMarch 21: Annual General MeetingAbout ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

This building is rented to COVERGUARD  a major player on the market of personal protective equipment (PPE)  as part of a 9-year fixed-term lease.This new site  which is particularly attractive for transports- and logistics-related businesses  is located in the Business Parc (Parc d’Activité) of “la Dombes” in MIONNAY  located about twenty kilometres away from Lyon  on the North-East of the city. This site benefits from direct access to the A46 French highway  which is the Eastern bypass of Lyon.The 15.000 sq.m building is made of two cells for storage and orders preparation  of 6.500 sq.m each  and one office block of 1 500 sq.m. This site hosts the logistics business  but also the new headquarters of COVERGUARD  as part of a 9-year fixed-term lease.Historically located in the Lyon area  COVERGUARD is a major player on the market of personal protective equipment (PPE). The group designs  makes and distributes a full range of products for people’s protection on the workplace.This building  developed by JMG PARTNERS  testifies to ARGAN’s and COVERGUARD’s common ambition in terms of sustainable development and demonstrates benchmark standards regarding energy management. The site is Aut0nom®-labelled  i.e.  “the warehouse that generates and uses its own green energy”. By installing a photovoltaic power station on the roof  coupled with batteries for energy storage  renewable and carbon free energy is thus generated and used locally. On afull-year basis  the generated energy covers all the needs of COVERGUARD in terms of heating  cooling and lighting. Additionally  gas is banned  and highly CO 2 -emitting boilers are replaced by electric heat pumps that increase energy efficiency by a multiple and strongly limit emissions.Jean-Claude Le Lan  Founder and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of ARGAN concluded: “The Lyon region is a major logistics platform and is structurally in a situation of undersupply. With this new development  which is the second in the span of a few months on the Eastern bypass of Lyon  ARGAN is strengthening its premium positioning by investing at the heart of the French logistics backbone.”Financial calendar 2024 (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: 2023 Annual SalesJanuary 18: 2023 Annual ResultsMarch 21: Annual General MeetingAbout ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

The repo...,PARIS – A new report from Accor  the world leading global hospitality group  has revealed a need to focus on balance and belonging as the global meetings and events sector continues to recover and drive strategic growth for 2024 and beyond.The report  titled “Meeting Expectations: The Future of Meetings & Events” addresses the transformation that the M&E sector has undergone in recent years and explores the fundamental shifts impacting the industry as it continues to evolve and recover.The global business landscape is undergoing a profound transformation. The way we live  work  and interact has been reshaped over the last few years  and the ripple effects of these changes have created new opportunities in the meetings and events industry. The pandemic was a defining moment for the industry. We were thrust into a world of virtual gatherings  with in-person events grinding to a halt. Yet  we adapted and evolved. That evolution continues today and the one thread that connects all the trends we forecast is the human connection. Today  more than ever  it is about the human need to meet  share and thrive. Sophie Hulgard  Chief Sales Officer  AccorComing out of the pandemic there were fears that the events industry might struggle to reclaim its audience. Today that audience has largely returned and is expected to rise far beyond its 2019 peak in the years to come. This is great news for the sector but it also brings fresh challenges and opportunities that will alter the way events are booked  planned and executed.The total global meeting industry worldwide is forecast1 to be worth $1.78bn by 2030  added Hulgard. That’s because being in a room with people matters - it’s powerful and it’s valuable.Accor’s Meetings & Events Industry Forecast survey data reinforces this predicted growth trajectory. 78% of respondents said that their or their clients’ expenditure had increased since 2022  with 36% saying it had increased by more than 25%. Looking to 2024 the growth is expected to continue with 80% of surveyed experts expecting increased spend in 2024  with 30% saying it would rise by more than 25%.According to the Accor research  continued growth is forecast across all meeting and event sizes in 2024. Three-quarters (78%) expect the number of small and medium sized meetings (under 100 delegates) to increase next year  and the same number said they expect the number of meetings of over 100 delegates to increase. More than half (57%) predict a rise in large meetings (over 300 delegates) to increase and almost three-forth (78%) said it would be “very important” for their industry to attend exhibitions  conferences and tradeshows in 2024.Reconfirming the value of meeting in real life (IRL)  33% of meetings planners expect in excess of 40% more revenue from face-to-face meetings vs a virtual meeting  and the majority  80%  would not be happy to use video-conferencing to close deals in 2024.The new Accor report  “MEETING EXPECTATIONS: THE FUTURE OF MEETINGS & EVENTS” reveals five trends expected to shape the growth of the industry.1/“Softer Productivity”The work hard  play hard ethos once associated with business and events is changing in line with the demands of new lifestyles.Key Take-away: Balance purpose and productivity2/“Selling Belonging”The meetings and events sector is all about one thing: people. Human connection and fostering a sense of belonging are the cornerstones of successful event design.Key Take-away: Celebrate the human connection. Sell belonging.3/“Designing Experiences”Event bookers are looking for a return on their investment  but they are more than ever looking for ROX  a return on experience.Key Take-away: Create memorable experiences that forge meaningful connections4/“Green Gatherings”Positive impact is the differentiator  and  more than ever  the sector has the green light to drive change. Green credentials are no longer a bonus for events – they will be a deciding factor in who secures the business.Key Take-away: Sustainability should be the first thought  not the afterthought5/“Disruptive Technology”In-person conferences are now a vital way of bringing together people who may only see one another through laptop screens.Key Take-away: Digital has reach. Face to face has value. Being in the room matters.The Meetings & Events industry has demonstrated its resilience  innovation  and adaptability. The trends outlined in this report stem from the DNA of the sector – face to face business matters. The human connection goes with commercial success  it makes business stronger. As the industry continues to drive recovery globally  it is the commitment to forging meaningful connections  being a catalyst for commercial and cultural growth and creating a sense of belonging that will ensure the sector exceeds its forecast growth. Travel is back  and  for the M&E sector  it’s belonging and balance that will drive the bottom line in 2024.

At constant exchange rates  quarterly sales declined by -13%.In addition to a very high basis for comparison (+36% growth in Q3 2022)  the Group's Q3 performance was impacted by a less buoyant market environment  marked by declining demand and a macroeconomic slowdown. In this context  Access equipment sales were notably affected in France and Asia-Pacific.For the first nine months of 2023  consolidated revenue was €98.8 million  representing total growth of +3% vs. the same period last year  which represented a particularly high basis for comparison (+28% growth). At constant exchange rates  growth was up +4% over the period.Growth of +23% for Optical Transport over nine monthsThe first nine months of 2023 were characterized by the brisk growth in Optical Transport  up +23%  with sales notably doubling in France since the start of the year and increasing by +19% in North America.Sales for Access solutions were down -10% over the period  with a -19% decline in Q3 alone (reminder: H1 2023 sales declined -5%). In addition to an unfavorable basis for comparison (+26% over nine months in 2022)  this decline results from a depressed economic environment  marked by: (i) the slowdown in demand and a growing reluctance among customers to make investments; (ii) more complicated and expensive access to financing for operators; and (iii) cautious inventory management by major operators who had overstocked in response to the electronic components shortage in 2022.Driven by the success of network virtualization solutions and services  Software & Services posted robust Q3 growth (+44%)  accounting for 20% of the Group's total quarterly revenue. As of end-September  Software & Services revenue increased by 13%  representing 15% of the Group's total revenue (vs. 14% a year earlier).Growth of +22% in North America (in US dollars)The first nine months showed +6% growth internationally  and a -3% decline in France. International business accounted for 66% of Ekinops' total revenue  versus 64% a year earlier.North America reported sales of €25.0 million  up +18% Y-o-Y (+22% in USD)  driven by strong demand for Optical Transport equipment. This strategic region now accounts for 26% of Group revenue over the period (vs. 22% one year prior).The EMEA region (Europe  excluding France  the Middle East and Africa)  representing 39% of Ekinops' revenue  recorded solid growth of +11% over the first nine months  with an increase in all business lines (+7% for Access equipment and +17% for Optical Transport solutions).At end-September 2023  revenue for Asia-Pacific – which remains highly concentrated and reliant on just a few key accounts – was down -64% (reminder: revenue up +36% on the same period last year). Over nine months  the region accounted for 2% of Ekinops' total revenue.Lastly  in its domestic market  sales were down -3% Y-o-Y. In Q3  the downturn was -24% in France (reminder: +59% growth in Q3 2022)  due to large inventories among key accounts for Access equipment  the main source of revenue in this market. Conversely  Optical Transport sustained its vigorous momentum with sales doubling since the beginning of the year. Ekinops generated 34% of its nine-month revenue in France.Didier Brédy  Chairman and CEO of Ekinops  said:""Given last year's particularly challenging comparative figures  Ekinops' third-quarter performance was penalized by the market environment  higher financing costs and large inventories at our operator customers. Our Access activity was impacted by the health of enterprises – our equipment end-users – and therefore by the economic conjuncture. On the other hand  Optical Transport maintained strong momentum  with revenue expected to top our 2023 targets  driven by sustained demand for bandwidth.We remain optimistic for the future as the Group will benefit from the rebound in Access equipment sales as the economy recovers  from the growth of Optical Transport sales which continues to outperform the market  and from Software & Services contribution to revenue.""OutlookIn H2 2023  Ekinops is operating in a complex economic and market environment where visibility is weaker. As a result  and in light of its Q3 performance  Ekinops is adjusting its 2023 guidance as follows:single-digit revenue growth   versus growth of over +12% as previously targeted;  versus growth of over +12% as previously targeted; EBITDA margin between 13% and 17%  versus a previous target range between 15% and 19%.In terms of external growth  Ekinops maintains its ambition to complete a transaction in the months ahead  favoring a non-dilutive source of financing.All press releases are published after Euronext Paris market close.More information on Ekinops website: https://www.ekinops.com/EKINOPS ContactDidier BrédyChairman and CEOcontact@ekinops.comInvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92momnes@actus.frPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2244617/Ekinops_Q3_2023_results.jpgLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/814911/4335317/Ekinops_Logo.jpgView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ekinops-2023-nine-month-revenue-98-8-million-up-3-301953989.htmlSOURCE Ekinops",neutral,0.04,0.95,0.01,mixed,0.12,0.24,0.64,True,English,"['Ekinops 2023 nine-month revenue', 'October', '01:13', 'less buoyant market environment', 'constant exchange rates', 'cautious inventory management', 'electronic components shortage', 'Didier Brédy', 'challenging comparative figures', 'previous target range', 'network virtualization solutions', 'The EMEA region', 'higher financing costs', 'first nine months', 'Optical Transport solutions', 'Optical Transport equipment', ""Ekinops' third-quarter performance"", 'total quarterly revenue', 'Optical Transport sales', 'Access equipment sales', 'single-digit revenue growth', ""Ekinops' total revenue"", 'robust Q3 growth', 'first 9 months', 'Access solutions', 'telecommunications solutions', 'economic environment', 'quarterly sales', 'expensive access', 'Access activity', 'total growth', 'leading supplier', 'third quarter', 'audited data', 'high basis', 'North America', 'unfavorable basis', 'growing reluctance', 'US dollars', 'International business', 'strategic region', 'Middle East', 'business lines', 'key accounts', 'domestic market', 'large inventories', 'main source', 'vigorous momentum', 'economic conjuncture', 'other hand', 'strong momentum', 'complex economic', 'EBITDA margin', 'Q3 performance', 'Q1 revenue', 'Q2 revenue', '9-month revenue', 'consolidated revenue', 'nine-month revenue', 'H1 2023 sales', 'declining demand', 'strong demand', 'sustained demand', 'telecom operators', 'major operators', ""Ekinops' revenue"", 'Euronext Paris', 'macroeconomic slowdown', 'operator customers', 'Services contribution', 'Q3 revenue', 'brisk growth', 'solid growth', 'same period', 'Services revenue', 'Group revenue', 'FY 2023 guidance', '36% growth', '28% growth', '+6% growth', '+59% growth', 'PRNewswire', 'enterprises', 'July', 'September', 'IFRS', 'year', 'addition', 'comparison', 'context', 'France', 'Asia-Pacific', 'start', 'decline', 'depressed', 'investments', 'complicated', 'response', 'success', 'Software', 'USD', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'increase', 'downturn', 'beginning', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'health', 'end-users', '2023 targets', 'bandwidth', 'future', 'rebound', 'economy', 'Outlook', 'H2', 'visibility', 'result', 'light', 'terms']",2023-10-11,2023-10-12,marketscreener.com

Authorization to the chairman of the meetingComplete proposals:Re item 1 on the agenda:The Board of Directors proposes to change the nominal value of the Company’s shares through a reverse share split at a consolidation ratio of 1.000:1.The purpose of the reverse share split is to optimize the Company’s cost structure by reducing the number of Shareholders. 82% of the Company’s current Shareholders owns less than 1 000 shares (less value than DKK 1 000) each  and the issuer costs for the Company associated herewith amounts to more than DKK 400 000 per year. Reference is made to company announcement 16/2023 where the proposal is further accounted for.The reverse share split implies that every 1 000 of the Company’s shares each with a nominal value of DKK 1.00 will be consolidated into 1 new share with a nominal value of DKK 1 000. Shareholdings below 1 000 shares and excess shares following the share consolidation will be redeemed by the Company as described below.Following the General Meeting’s approval of the reverse share split  a mandatory four-week redemption period will initiate. During the redemption period trading in the Company’s shares will continue in the ordinary course and Shareholders will have the opportunity to buy and sell existing shares with a nominal value of DKK 1 00 each  including for the purpose of owning enough shares to match the above-mentioned conversion ratios before the redemption and share consolidation takes effect.After expiration of the four-week redemption period  any Shareholder’s holdings of shares below 1 000 shares  as well as any excess shares (calculated on an “after consolidation” basis)  will be redeemed by the Company in accordance with the principles of the Danish Companies Act §§ 70 - 72 at a price of DKK 0 94 per share with a nominal value of DKK 1.00. The redemption price is equivalent to the market price determined as the volume weighted average price of the Company’s shares over the last 5 trading days during the period 4.-10. October 2023.The cash payment will be made to each Shareholder's account associated with the respective share deposit.After the Company's redemption  the redeemed shares with a nominal value of DKK 1.00 each will be consolidated into shares with a nominal value of DKK 1 000 each. The Company will hold these shares with a nominal value of DKK 1 000 as part of the Company’s treasury shareholdings until the next General Meeting in the Company  where the Board of Directors will make a proposal pertaining to the handing of the treasury shares aimed at maximizing value for the Shareholders. The excess number of redeemed shares with a nominal value of DKK 1.00 each  that is insufficient to match the consolidation-ratio  will be canceled through a capital reduction  cf. item 2 on the agenda.Following the completion of the share consolidation  the new shares with a nominal value of DKK 1 000 each will be issued under a new permanent ISIN code in VP SECURITIES A/S (“Euronext Securities”) and will be admitted to trading and officially listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen. The expected dates for redemption and issuance in Euronext Securities  as well as the admission to trading and official listing of the new permanent ISIN code on Nasdaq Copenhagen  will be announced in connection with the publication of the statutory four-week redemption notice. After the completion of the share consolidation  all Shareholders will receive an updated statement from Euronext Securities  indicating the new number of shares in their share deposit account each with a nominal value of DKK 1 000.---oo0oo---The adoption of the Board of Directors proposal will lead to the following amendments to Section 2.1 and Section 6.6. of the articles of association  effective from the expiry of the statutory four-week redemption period:Section 2.1. will be amended to the following :“2.1. Selskabets aktiekapital udgør nominelt kr. 35.312.241 fordelt i aktier à nominelt kr. 1.000 eller multipla heraf. /2.1 The Company’s nominal share capital is DKK 35 312 241 divided into shares of DKK 1 000 each or multiples thereof.”andSection 6.6. will be amended to the following :“6.6. Hvert aktiebeløb på nominelt kr. 1.000 giver én stemme. En person  der er registeret som indehaver af aktier i selskabet i VP Securities A/S  og som handler i erhvervsmæssig sammenhæng på vegne af andre fysiske eller juridiske personer  herunder indehavere af American Depositary Shares  der repræsenterer aktier i selskabet  kan udøve stemmerettigheder tilknyttet disse aktier på en måde  der ikke er identisk med udøvelsen af stemmerettighederne  der er tilknyttet andre aktier i selskabet  som en sådan person er indehaver af. /6.6. Each share with a nominal value of DKK 1 000 entitles the holder to one vote. A person registered as a holder of shares in the company with VP Securities A/S  and who trades in a professional capacity on behalf of other natural or legal persons  including holders of American Depositary Shares representing shares in the company  may exercise voting rights associated with these shares in a manner that is not identical to the exercise of voting rights associated with other shares in the company that such a person holds.”Re item 2 on the agenda:The Board of Directors proposes to complete a reduction of the Company's share capital by a nominal amount of DKK 241 by canceling treasury shares (241 shares with a nominal value of DKK 1.00 each) as part of the implementation of the reverse stock split. The proposal is made with the aim of ensuring that the Company's share capital  after the aforementioned share consolidation  is divisible by DKK 1 000. Consequently  after the share consolidation  there will be a whole number of shares with a nominal value of DKK 1 000.The treasury shares will be repurchased from the Company's Shareholders for a total amount of DKK 227  in accordance with Section 188  paragraph 1  no. 2 of the Companies Act.The adoption of the proposal will lead to the following amendment to Section 2.1 of the articles of association  effective from the implementation of the capital reduction and after the expiry of the statutory four-week creditor notification period:Section 2.1. will be amended to the following :“2.1. Selskabets aktiekapital udgør nominelt kr. 35.312.000 fordelt i aktier à nominelt kr. 1.000 eller multipla heraf. /2.1 The Company’s nominal share capital is DKK 35 312 000 divided into shares of DKK 1 000 each or multiples thereof.”As the Board of Directors’ proposal is submitted as part of the implementation of the aforementioned reverse share split  the proposal shall lapse if the General Meeting does not approve the reverse share split  as described under agenda item 1.Re item 3 on the agenda:The Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting elects KPMG Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab (CVR no. 25 57 81 98) as new auditor for the Company with immediate effect.The proposal is motivated by a reduction of complexity in the business. Following the expected final settlement of the US Security class action case  the Company has no commercial activity left and therefore the Company’s auditor competences are no more related to a global group with US representation and dual listing but more related to a small business with limited complexity and activity where the choice of auditor should reflect the new situation for the Company.Re item 4 on the agenda:The Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting authorizes the chairman of the General Meeting (with the right of substitution) to apply for registration with the Danish Business Authority (Erhvervsstyrelsen) of the resolutions passed and to make any alteration of or addition to the resolutions passed and the Company’s articles of association as may be required to obtain registration or may be suggested as expedient.Adoption criteria:Proposal 1  must be passed by at least 9/10 of the votes cast as well as the share capital represented at the General Meeting. Proposal 2  must be passed by at least 2/3 of the votes cast as well as the share capital represented at the General Meeting. Passing of proposals 3 and 4 may be adopted by a simple majority of votes.Information about capital and voting rightsAt the date of the convening notice  the Company’s share capital amounts to nominally DKK 35.312.241  divided into shares in the denomination of DKK 1 00 which each confers one vote upon the holder.Record date:A Shareholder's right to attend a General Meeting and to vote shall be determined in proportion to the shares held by such Shareholder as of the record date. The shares held by each Shareholder as of the record date shall be determined based on the entry in the shareholders’ register regarding the Shareholder's ownership and any notifications to the Company from the Shareholder regarding his ownership not yet recorded in the shareholders’ register.The record date shall be 26 October2023.Admission and voting cards  etc.:Shareholders  proxy holders and any accompanying advisers must present an admission card in order to be admitted to the General Meeting.Admission cards may be requested as follows:By submitting a completed  dated and signed registration form to the Company’s email contact@orphazyme.comAdmission confirmations will be distributed by e-mail.Requests for admission cards must reach our e-mail by 27 October 2023  at 11:59 PM (CEST).Any Shareholder is entitled to attend by proxy and to attend accompanied by an adviser.

This includes both the scaling of 3.0 casco production in Deurne and the start of production with international assembly partners. It is encouraging to see that our assembly partners have swiftly started the Ebusco 3.0 bus assembly and we can confirm that the first shipments are expected in the fourth quarter of this year.The delivery of Ebusco 3.0 buses to Transdev has continued at a steady pace during the quarter. In addition  we are currently in the vehicle acceptance phase with two customers  who will start operations with the Ebusco 3.0 in the fourth quarter of this year. The operational performance of the Ebusco 3.0 exceeds our and our clients' expectations. The buses in operation demonstrate outstanding energy efficiency  with a real-road energy consumption of 0.65 kWh per kilometre while regularly driving over 500 kilometres per day on a single charge.It is very gratifying to see that  despite the challenges we face  customers consistently place their trust in us. This is reflected by  for instance  the seventh order we received from Stadtwerke Munich. Furthermore  we continue to receive highly positive feedback from amongst others Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) and Transdev with respect to the operational performance and drivability of both the Ebusco 2.2 and Ebusco 3.0.It is clear that our operational performance is not where we would like it to be. It is therefore crucial that we remain focused on executing our plans to improve this performance. The dedication I see from our colleagues every day makes me proud and gives me the confidence that we will make it happen together.""Outlook 2023Despite the supply chain imbalance and personnel shortages that are still impacting operations  Ebusco has delivered 138 buses to date. As a result of these developments combined with the ramp up in Deurne and at our assembly partners Ebusco provides the following outlook for the full year 2023:250-300 buses contributing to revenue;Revenue of EUR 145-165 million;A significant EBITDA improvement in 2H23 compared to 1H23.Furthermore  we reiterate our previous guidance to achieve a positive EBITDA in 2024 and will update the capital markets on our FY 2024 outlook in December 2023.As mentioned at our half year results  Ebusco secured a two-year financing facility of €41.5 million  in addition to its already existing bank guarantee credit facility of €50 million. The financing facility of €41.5 million is undrawn and management has implemented several cost savings and working capital improvement projects.Order book Q3During the third quarter  Ebusco gained new orders for 54 buses. New contracts were signed with repeat customer and innovation partner Stadtwerke Munich as well as Fraport  a new customer  opening up the airport bus market. More recently Ebusco and Deutsche Bahn extended their partnership for delivery of electric buses until 2026. The order book at the end of the third quarter is reflected below.Type Fixed contracts Call off Options Total Ebusco 2.2 121 229 765 1 115 Ebusco 3.0 573 0 135 708 Total 694 229 900 1 823We continue to see robust tender activity scheduled for deliveries in 2024 and 2025 and expect to further increase our order book in the coming period.

The contract was signed on October 4th following a competitive selection process.As part of this agreement  Waga Energy will fund the construction of an RNG facility using its patented WAGABOX® technology  to upgrade landfill gas into pipeline-quality RNG. Waga Energy will operate the facility for an initial 20-year term  sharing revenues with Chester County Solid Waste Authority  an intergovernmental solid waste management agency which operates the LLARC site.The WAGABOX® unit will process up to 2 000 scfm (3 200 m3/h) of landfill gas to produce over 450 000 MMBtu (130 GWh/y) of RNG per year. The low carbon RNG produced by the LLARC WAGABOX® will avoid over 27 000 tons of eqCO2 per year  compared to using fossil fuels  equivalent to avoiding emissions from 2.8 million gallons of gasoline per year  based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) calculation methodology[1].The LLARC Landfill receives around 280 000 tons of waste per year. The resulting landfill gas is already captured to prevent direct methane emissions to the atmosphere. Once operational  the WAGABOX® facility will optimize the energy recovered  providing the local community with clean  local and renewable energy  using the existing infrastructure.This is the sixth landfill gas to RNG upgrading project undertaken by Waga Energy in the United States. A WAGABOX® unit was commissioned last May in Canada  and 17 more are in operation in Europe.Robert Watts  Executive Director  Chester County Solid Waste Authority  said: “We are very excited to be working with Waga Energy to upgrade our landfill gas to pipeline-quality RNG.”Guénaël Prince  Chief Executive Officer of Waga Energy Inc. (USA)  said: ""We are honored to have been selected as Chester County Solid Waste Authority's partner for this project  which will benefit the local community both environmentally and economically. By implementing the best-in-class landfill gas upgrading technology  the LLARC RNG WAGABOX® will reduce greenhouse gas emissions while generating additional revenues.”About Waga EnergyWaga Energy (EPA: WAGA) produces competitively priced Renewable Natural Gas by upgrading landfill gas using a patented purification technology called WAGABOX®. The RNG produced is injected directly into the gas distribution networks that supply individuals and businesses  providing a substitute for natural gas. Waga Energy finances  builds and operates its WAGABOX® units under long-term contracts with landfill operators for the supply of raw gas  and generates income by selling the RNG it produces. Waga Energy operates eighteen WAGABOX® units in France  Spain and Canada  representing an installed capacity of 2 270 000 MMBtu (665 GWh/y). Sixteen units are under construction in France  Canada  and the US. Each project initiated by Waga Energy contributes to the fight against global warming and helps the energy transition.About the Chester County Solid Waste AuthorityThe Chester County Commissioners established the Chester County Solid Waste Authority (CCSWA) in August 1984. In September 1984  the CCSWA became owner and operator of the LLARC Landfill  a 600-acre property located in Honey Brook  Salisbury  and Caernarvon townships that includes 160 acres of landfills. The mission of CCSWA is to manage all discarded materials in the LLARC service area with minimum environmental impact and with an overall long-term goal of zero waste.

The Group records  in an inflationary background  an EBITDA margin of 23% (compared with 12% in 2019  before the pandemic). Depreciation  reversals and amortization of assets arising from the PPA as well as goodwill amortization reduces operating income  but these have no effect on the Group's cash position and are mostly non-recurring.The sharp rise in the share of proprietary products  the internationalization of our activities and the implementation of synergies between the Group's various entities should continue to fuel the virtuous dynamics underway  in terms of both business growth and earnings.In €m June 30  2023 June 30  2022 % change In vitro diagnostics & R&D products revenues 59.2 83.7 -29% Of which core business revenues 59.2 43.0 +37% Operating subsidies and other revenues 0.2 0.6 - Total revenues 59.4 84.3 -30% Cost of goods sold -31.8 -43.4 -27% Adjusted gross margin1 27.5 40.9 -33% Gross margin 24.0 40.9 R&D expenses -3.1 -1.4 +121% Marketing and sales expenses -7.8 -8.9 -12% G&A expenses -5.4 -6.3 -14% Amortisation of intangible assets acquired through business combinations -5.8 -1.0 - Amortisation of goodwill -1.4 -1.4 - Operating result 4.1 22.0 - Adjusted operating result3 11.2 24.4 -54% Adjusted EBITDA1 13.4 26.0 -49% Financial result -1.3 0.4 - Extraordinary result 0.1 -0.1 - Taxes -0.7 -3.1 -77% Net result 2.2 19.2 - Adjusted net result3 9.4 20.6 -54% June 30  2023 Dec 31st  2022 Cash before DID acquisition advance (28.06.23) 89.0 85.9 Financial debt excluding leasing 101.0 108.0 Shareholders’ equity 174.9 172.7Strong growth in core activitiesEurobio Scientific recorded sales of €59.2m in the first half of 2023 from its core business  with activities related to the detection of COVID now not significant. Excluding exceptional sales from the COVID business (€40.6m in H1 2022)  growth for the first half of 2023 was +37%  and +7% on a pro forma basis.In transplantation  the Group is successfully pursuing its previously announced strategy of replacing its historical distribution contract for One Lambda tests with its own products  i.e. those of its subsidiary GenDx  whose innovative proprietary tests are gradually replacing the distribution products  with a very positive impact on the Group's gross margin.The three main effects of the acquisition of GenDx are:a very significant increase in sales generated by proprietary products  which share reached 30% of total sales compared with 18% of core business sales in 2022 a strong growth in international sales  which will account for 35% of sales in the first half  compared to 25% of core business sales in 2022  anda gross margin1 maintained at a high level  46.5%  in line with the previous year's figure for the same period (48.5%)  which included the exceptional activity linked to COVID  a major contributor to profitability. This margin is significantly higher than the 33.8% achieved by the Group in 2019 before the start of the pandemic. Gross margin is adjusted to exclude the non-recurring reversal of the value identified in the purchase price allocation (PPA) and corresponding to the inventory of products manufactured by GenDx at the time of the acquisition and sold since.High EBITDA1 margin of 23% against a backdrop of R&D intensification and inflationAt 30 June 2023  operating expenses were broadly stable at €16.3m  compared with €16.6m in the first half of 2022  with a rise in R&D expenses offset by a fall in sales and marketing and G&A expenses.In line with the Group's strategy of increasing the share of proprietary products  R&D expenditure rose to €3.1m from €1.4m a year earlier  with the integration of GenDx's molecular biology development activities. Thanks to this acquisition  the Group now has a mature R&D and bioinformatics team  renowned in the field of NGS (new generation sequencing).Conversely  marketing and sales costs fell by around €1m to €7.8m due to the decline in COVID business in France  and general and administrative costs were also reduced by almost €1m. The Group is pursuing its efforts to structure what has become an international group  while keeping a tight rein on costs.EBITDA reached €13.4m  giving an EBITDA margin of 23%. By way of comparison  in 2019  before the start of the pandemic  the Group posted EBITDA of €7m  representing 12% of sales.Operating profit was €4.1m  due to non-cash and mostly non-recurrent items: reversal of the value of inventory allocated to the PPA (€3.5m)  amortization of intangible assets arising from the PPA  mainly relating to GenDx  and amortization of goodwill. Adjusted for their impact  operating profit reached €11.2m.Interest expense on the Group's borrowings  which was kept under control thanks to the interest rate hedging contracts put in place by the company  was partially offset by interest generated by cash investments  resulting in net interest expense of only €1.3m.After a tax expense of €0.7m  net profit amounted to €2.2m at 30 June 2023. Restated for the impact of the mostly non -recurring items listed above  it reached €9.4m.11.4m cash flow from operations and very limited financial debtEurobio Scientific generated operating cash flow of €11.4m in the 1st half  representing a cash conversion ratio of 85% of EBITDA.With the advance fund transfer for the DID acquisition  Eurobio Scientific had a cash of €89m at 30 June 2023  with total financial debt of €101m  leading to a net financial debt of €12m  compared with €22m at 31 December 2022.Accelerating strategic deploymentThe Group is successfully pursuing its strategy of targeted geographic and technological expansion  with the ambition of becoming a major international company in the specialty diagnostics market  offering its customers a comprehensive offering based on molecular diagnostics with its own solutions and those of its partners.With 30% of proprietary products and 35% of its sales outside France in the first half of 2023  the Group's strategic deployment is gathering pace  driven by organic growth - which is increasingly benefiting from synergies between the Group's different entities - and external growth. The Group remains active in both these areas  with its entry into the Italian market in early July 2023 through the acquisition of DID  and the purchase in March 2023 of the GenDx product distribution business in France from Bedia Genomics. These acquisitions will accelerate the Group's development by continuing to roll out the distribution of its own products internationally  and by harnessing the synergies generated by the acquisitions already made.Next financial meeting2023 FY revenues: January 30  2024  after market closesAbout Eurobio ScientificEurobio Scientific is a key player in the field of specialty in vitro diagnostics.

At IDWeek…,Saint-Herblain (France)  October 11  2023 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  announces today it will present on the mosquito-borne chikungunya disease at several leading scientific conferences during the fourth quarter of 2023.At IDWeek  the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)  Valneva will support the roundtable discussion “Chikungunya is an Increasing Global Threat: The Need for Better Protection” taking place on October 14  2023 at 6:00 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) in Boston  Massachusetts.At the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) 2023 Annual Meeting in Chicago  Illinois  Valneva will hold two chikungunya presentations on October 20  2023 at 11:00 am and 12:15 pm Central Daylight Time (CDT).

The Company will also display two posters at the event  including “Dynamic disease transmission model recreating the 2017 Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak in Anzio  Italy: the impact of vaccination  global warming  and viral importation.”Finally  during the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) European Congress taking place November 12 - 15  2023 in Copenhagen  Denmark  Valneva will display three posters titled: “Global Burden of Disease Study on Chikungunya: Estimating Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and Cost Burden”  “A systematic literature review and meta-analysis of clinical chikungunya outcomes” and “Transmission Dynamics and Vaccination Strategies for Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV): An Outbreak Simulation Study in Rome  Italy.”About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20321. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries2. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas3 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against the chikungunya virus and Lyme disease.Valneva Investor and Media ContactsLaetitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the progress  timing  results and completion of research  development and clinical trials for product candidates  to regulatory approval of product candidates and review of existing products.

31301,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/10/11/2758027/0/en/Shareholder-Letter.html,Shareholder Letter,Dear Shareholders    We write to you today with a deep sense of responsibility and transparency  driven by our commitment to the principles of sound......,"Dear Shareholders We write to you today with a deep sense of responsibility and transparency  driven by our commitment to the principles of sound corporate governance and the long-term success of Mithra. We believe it is our duty to address recent developments concerning the request of some shareholders for the upcoming Special General Meeting of Shareholders (""SGM"") to be held on October 30  2023. The SGM will be followed by an Extraordinary Meeting of Shareholders (""EGM""). The main topics of the SGM and EGM relate to the strategic financing that has been secured by the Company  and are a matter of great significance to our company and its future.It has come to our attention that a group of shareholders that submitted 6.1% of the outstanding shares of the Company has called for the anticipated mandate termination of all 4 independent board members  on a total of 6 board members  and the proposed appointment of a new independent board member.We believe that at the heart of this issue lies an important discussion with the so-called “Uteron Sellers”  as the shareholders that submitted the aforementioned additional items to the SGM include several representatives of the Uteron Sellers.The Uteron Sellers are a group of individuals and entities that were amongst the former owners of Estelle  which was acquired  through the intermediation of the Uteron Sellers  by Mithra from Actavis. This happened before the Company’s IPO in 2015. In 2019  the payments that could have become payable to the Uteron Sellers were re-set at EUR 250 million  and an amount of ca. EUR 79 million (of which ca. EUR 14 million under the 2015 agreement) has already been paid by the Company to the Uteron Sellers between 2015 and 2021. See also the Company's Annual Reports for this period. As of today  under such contracts  the Company would have a nominal outstanding obligation of EUR 185 million  which is reported at a present value of EUR 82.6 million in the company books at June 30  2023 according to IFRS accounting principles.The previous and current board members have been having discussions with the Uteron Sellers in relation to these agreements  including in relation to the validity and lawfulness thereof  to lift this unreasonable burden. Amongst the current six board members  only four have no conflict of interest with regards to this matter. Those are the four independent board members who were appointed at the last general shareholders’ meeting in May 2023. The Company  supported by the four non-conflicted independent board members  is confident that its position has strong merits and is in the interest of both the Company and its stakeholders.Given all these elements and taking into account the proposed resolution which is now being tabled by some shareholders closely related to the Uteron Sellers  we think it is important to provide appropriate understanding and ensure proper corporate governance to the shareholders so that they can vote on the resolutions in your and Mithra’s best interests.We are also aware that questions have been raised about the proposal to increase the remuneration of non-executive board members  which is one of the items on the agenda of the SGM. To put things in context  the intention of aligning board compensation to international standards was supported unanimously by all board members in a way to retain and attract competent and independent talents.Your trust is of paramount importance to us  and the management and the board remain committed to upholding the highest standards of corporate governance and accountability. We will continue to act in the best interests of all stakeholders and will work tirelessly to navigate through these challenges and secure a bright future for Mithra  focused on Women’s Heath and a flagship for pharmaceutical companies in Belgium and the Liège region.Should the mandate of the four independent board members be terminated by the SGM  the remaining board members at that time will need to propose additional new board members in order for the Company to have a board that meets the requirements of Belgian law and relevant corporate governance standards.Thank you for your continued confidence in our company.Sincerely On behalf of Mithra Pharmaceuticals SAFor more information  please contact:Mithra Pharmaceuticals SAAlex Sokolowski  PhDHead of Investor Relationsinvestorrelations@mithra.com+32 (0)4 349 28 22Frédérique DepraetereCommunications Directorinfo@mithra.com+32 (0)4 349 28 22About MithraMithra Pharmaceuticals SA (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming Women’s Health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

This brisk sales momentum clearly reflects structural growth in the cybersecurity sector boosted by the opening up of information systems  the ever-present threat of cybercrime and tightening regulations. However  it also testifies to the ideal positioning that WALLIX has built up through continuous intelligent enhancement of its offering  which is now recognized by world-renowned analytics firms such as Gartner  KuppingerCole and Frost & Sullivan.Sales organization  which is also key to sustaining our growth model  was restructured and optimized during the period. The new system pools and streamlines skills by rallying the sales force around shared targets  thereby triggering a new spurt of momentum that will contribute to future growth.While these structural measures generate costs in the short term  they will undoubtedly raise our Company to a new level and boost our confidence in our ability to continue gaining market share  improve our operating performance considerably from the second half of 2023 onwards and reach breakeven in 2024.""Acceleration of business in the first halfBusiness growth accelerated in the first half of 2023  with turnover up 26.4% to €13.9 million  up 29.2% excluding Russia. Consolidated since May 16  2023  Kleverware contributed turnover of €0.2 million for the first half.Over the period as a whole  contract acquisitions kept up a sustained pace with 225 new contracts signed  bringing the total number of active contracts to 2 525 at June 30  2023  up 25% over 12 months.This return to high growth rates is taking place amid a controlled shift towards a subscription model that will guarantee a constant flow of recurring business and better long-term financial visibility.Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) for the first half totaled €1.4 million  up 26.2% versus H1 2022  representing €17.0 million in recurring business on an annual basis.Improvement in the operating expenses/turnover ratio before non-recurring expensesDuring the first half  WALLIX implemented a new sales organization  thereby generating restructuring costs  and incurred non-recurring expenses mainly related to its acquisition and financing policy. These expenses totaled €1.5 million and are not likely to be repeated in the future.Excluding non-recurring items  structural operating expenses remained under control  as a result of which the operating expenses/turnover ratio improved 17 percentage points versus H1 2022.This improvement was achieved despite the Company's ongoing active hiring policy  as a result of which the average headcount increased 14% year-on-year from 214 FTEs in H1 2022 to 244 in H1 2023.The Company posted an operating loss of €6.1 million. Excluding non-recurring items  the operating loss amounted to €4.6 million compared to €4.2 million in H1 2022.After a tax credit of €0.6 million  net loss Group share amounted to €5.4 million.Cash position strengthened in H1 2023Following the first half fundraising campaign comprising a €5.5 million capital increase and a €5 million convertible bond issue  gross cash and cash equivalents amounted to €20.6 million at June 30  2023 compared to €13.5 million at December 31  2022. Financing requirements remained under control at €2.6 million compared to €4.7 million in H1 2022  mainly related to capitalized development costs.Net cash and cash equivalents amounted to €13.6 million  putting WALLIX in a strong financial position from which to look ahead confidently to the next stages of its organic development while analyzing acquisition opportunities.Streamlined sales organization and enhanced offering to reach breakeven in 2024WALLIX delivered a solid first half in terms of sales  confirming its target to step up organic growth in 2023 with a strong focus on recurring business generated from subscription offers and SaaS solutions.In order to sustain sales momentum  the organization has been optimized by rallying the various departments involved in revenue generation around shared targets and processes across all regions. Management structure has been streamlined in order to promote a more efficient approach at country level propelled by a uniform and centralized driving force. Combined with the various growth drivers implemented by the Group  the new organizational system will enable it to maintain strong growth.The first half was also marked by innovation and the enhancement of the Group's offering.

31305,EuroNext,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/veon-sole-rightful-owner-kyivstar-145100879.html,VEON is the sole and rightful owner of Kyivstar,Company responds to speculation about Kyivstar Amsterdam  12 October 2023 – VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services ,VEON Ltd.Company responds to speculation about KyivstarAmsterdam  12 October 2023 – VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  issues the following clarification regarding the developments in Ukraine  in response to recent press reports and in order to address the questions raised by VEON’s international debt and equity investors.On 6 October 2023  the Security Services of Ukraine (SSU) announced that the Ukrainian courts are seizing all “corporate rights” of Mikhail Fridman  Peter Aven and Andrei Kosogov in 20 Ukrainian companies that these individuals beneficially own  while criminal proceedings  unrelated to Kyivstar or VEON  are in progress. This announcement was incorrectly characterized by some Ukrainian media as a “seizure” or “freezing” of “Kyivstar’s assets”. On 9 October 2023  Ukrainian media further reported  with a headline which incorrectly targets Kyivstar  that the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine is separately finalizing a lawsuit in the Ukraine High Anti-Corruption Court to confiscate any Ukrainian assets of M. Fridman.At present  neither VEON nor Kyivstar have received any official communication from the Ukrainian authorities or courts regarding these matters. The only information that VEON has at the moment is from its share registrar in Ukraine  which confirms that any ownership changes to Kyivstar are currently not permitted.While VEON does not comment on unconfirmed reports in principle  the escalation of the rhetoric and the questions that VEON received from its debt and equity investors necessitate that the Company clarifies the following facts.First and foremost  VEON is and remains Kyivstar’s sole and rightful owner. None of the individuals mentioned in the SSU announcement referenced above own any shares in VEON or Kyivstar.As previously stated  VEON is an Amsterdam-headquartered  Nasdaq- and Euronext Amsterdam-listed company with an international debt and equity investor base that includes US  EU and UK individuals and institutions. VEON has no controlling or majority shareholder. The individuals mentioned in the SSU announcement cannot exercise any rights regarding VEON or Kyivstar  are not a part of either company’s governance mechanisms  including boards  nor do they have the ability to control or influence decisions made by VEON or Kyivstar. They do not derive benefits from VEON or any of its operating companies. Any actions aimed at the rights  benefits or funds of the aforementioned individuals cannot legitimately be directed toward Kyivstar or VEON.Story continuesVEON notes and welcomes the subsequent clarification by the SSU1 noting that “The seizure of corporate rights of Ukrainian companies does not affect the protection of the interests of foreign investors and owners of shares of corporate rights  does not hinder their economic activity and the possibility of receiving dividends.” Underlining the duties to employees  customers and investors  VEON and Kyivstar intend to use all available avenues to protect the rights of VEON and Kyivstar.VEON deeply values its investors’ support for its strategic choices  including its exit from Russia – one of the most significant corporate exits given VEON’s public listing and the relative size of the asset – and appreciates the support it has received from US  UK and EU regulators over the course of the past 19 months as a Nasdaq- and Euronext Amsterdam-listed company.Kyivstar  with the full support of its parent company VEON  continues to serve its 25 million customers and keeps not only its own customers  but also the broader country connected through extremely challenging conditions  with 94% network availability and full operational integrity in line with the national security priorities of Ukraine. VEON and Kyivstar are fully committed to continue serving Ukraine  as demonstrated by the USD 600 million investment pledge for the recovery and reconstruction of the country.About VEONVEON is a digital operator that provides converged connectivity and digital services to nearly 160 million customers. Operating across six countries that are home to more than 7% of the world’s population  VEON is transforming lives through technology-driven services that empower individuals and drive economic growth.

Instead of being tied to the standard monthly/30-day payout period  Worldline FlexCommissions provides software and independent sales organization partners with the opportunity to choose the frequency at which they receive their revenue-sharing profits. The new payout feature is available for Worldline's revenue-sharing program partners with merchants processing on the North American e-commerce solution.The ability to receive fast and increased access to funds allows software vendors more agility to manage business expenses and invest the profits back into their business for further growth. FlexCommissions also enables tailored allocation with the option to divide the frequency and distribution of payouts based on factors like region  industry  or department – for example  a government software provider choosing to receive payouts for specific municipalities at a custom time.""We built FlexCommissions based on requests from several of our key partners who were looking to receive more frequent payouts than the standard industry revenue sharing timing so that they could better control cash flow and operationalize their payment profits sooner "" said Anthony Chalhoub  Managing Director  North America. ""Seeing the success in our pilots led us to roll out the feature capability for all our partners  allowing them to make better financial predictions  and improve budgeting and decision-making.""Story continuesMany processors offer revenue sharing but have processing minimums or specific product platform and feature usage requirements to qualify. Both FlexCommissions and Worldline's standard revenue sharing requires no minimums. FlexCommissions is also competitively priced with a transparent flat monthly fee  often making the offering more affordable for partners than the common use of percentage-based fees for features from other payment processors.""Whether in the bootstrapping phase or an established software business  increased cash flow and access to funds can play a significant role in supporting growth "" said Anthony Chalhoub. ""FlexCommissions provides a mechanism to our partners to access much needed funds significantly sooner than the industry standard with no minimum threshold  including specific segments of their merchants for strategic purposes  making it unique in the market.""FlexCommissions is available in North America on the Worldline e-commerce solution.

This site  which is the largest green hydrogen plant in Baden-Württemberg  will be the first to supply hydrogen directly to an industrial park. It is also the first in a network of many plants that will be operated by Lhyfe and supply green hydrogen nationwide in Germany in the coming years. Lhyfe's ambition is to become a major player in green hydrogen delivered in bulk (for the broad market) in Germany and in France by 2025. The groundbreaking ceremony for the production plant will take place today.The project in Schwäbisch Gmünd represents a milestone in the market ramp-up of green hydrogen in Germany and exemplifies the integration of renewable gas into local ecosystems. The plant  which will use renewable electricity secured from hydro  wind and solar power purchase agreements  should be commissioned in the second half of 2024. The hydrogen will be used partly in the ""H2-Aspen"" industrial park and at a JET H2 hydrogen filling station. Last January  Lhyfe and the joint venture JET H2 signed an agreement for the construction of the hydrogen filling station in Schwäbisch Gmünd. The project  which is funded by the state of Baden-Württemberg and the EU  among others  thus supports a sustainable neighbourhood solution for the local industry and lays the foundation for future climate-friendly infrastructure on the site. This project  which is part of the HyFIVE (Hydrogen For Innovative Vehicles) project  is supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through a €6.4 grant agreement.""The project demonstrates the economic viability of hydrogen solutions in the transport and industry sectors and also supports the state of Baden-Württemberg in its efforts to become a model region for the development of hydrogen refueling infrastructure. We very much welcome the fact that the state and the city of Schwäbisch Gmünd want to implement their ambitious goals for a hydrogen economy based on renewable energies and that we are taking this step together. With the construction of the production plant  we are making an important contribution to the goals of the federal government "" says Luc Graré  Head of Central & Eastern Europe at Lhyfe.“Through cooperations like this  Schwäbisch Gmünd is developing into a model region for the nationwide development of a hydrogen and filling station network as a central supply infrastructure. Schwäbisch Gmünd is part of the model region of the state of Baden-Württemberg and  with the completion of the plant  will then also be the largest hydrogen producer in the state. We are thus creating a basis for marketing the land in Aspen  which will enable the companies to produce climate-neutrally”  states Richard Arnold  major of Schwäbisch Gmünd in Germany.Today  Lhyfe's growth is backed by a solid business pipeline representing a total installed production capacity of 10.3 GW across Europe. These projects will contribute to the decarbonisation of mobility and industry with green renewable hydrogen on an industrial scale. In 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the world's first large-scale green hydrogen production plant linked to a wind farm in France. In 2022  the world's first offshore pilot platform for the production of green hydrogen was inaugurated at the port of Saint-Nazaire. This makes Lhyfe the first company globally to have already started offshore hydrogen production  based on a production capacity of up to 400 kg/day. In addition to the production of green hydrogen  Lhyfe is researching the reoxygenation of the oceans.For an interview with the spokespersons above  please contact the press department.Click to access the Lhyfe Media Kit (press kit and visuals)About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen. Its production sites and portfolio of projects intend to provide access to green and renewable hydrogen in industrial quantities  and enable the creation of a virtuous energy model capable of decarbonising entire sectors of industry and transport.In 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the first industrial-scale green hydrogen production plant in the world to be interconnected with a wind farm.

(""DGB"" or ""the Group"") (Euronext: DGB: NL0009169515)  a leading carbon project developer and ecosystem restoration company  provides a market update regarding its listing status on Euronext Amsterdam.On 13 April 2021  Euronext Amsterdam implemented a new rule  essentially meaning that companies without a Public Interest Entity audit (""PIE audit"") firm in the Netherlands face delisting. On 13 April 2023  DGB received a letter from Euronext Amsterdam stating that  if unresolved by 6 November 2023  Euronext would start the delisting process of the Company.Vereniging MidkapNL  an association representing the interests of Dutch small and mid-cap companies aiming to enhance the listing environment for medium-sized and smaller publicly traded companies and collectively advocate for the interests of this group of listed companies  strongly voiced concerns about Euronext's new delisting policy due to various circumstances and developments:- The shortage of (PIE) audit firms is a structural problem in the Dutch accounting sector beyond the control of the companies involved;- Despite significant efforts of the respective listed companies  it proved impossible to secure a contract with a PIE audit firn - a situation unprecedented;- There's a delay in the upcoming legislation for mandatory audit appointments due to political reasons beyond the companies' control;- Euronext Amsterdam hasn't adequately addressed the concerns of the affected listed companies and their stakeholders;- A new PIE-audit firm from a different EU country has shown interest in the Dutch market  expressing a willingness to audit companies listed on Euronext Amsterdam in the near future.Following discussions between Vereniging MidkapNL and Euronext Amsterdam  as well as bilateral talks with all affected listed companies  Euronext Amsterdam has made adjustments to its penalty bench policy. A market notice has been issued on 11 October 2023 in this regard. The changes made by Euronext Amsterdam are:- The new criterion is to provide a signed assignment letter from a PIE audit firm for the review of the annual accounts for the fiscal year 2024. It is no longer a prerequisite to publish an audited annual report to prevent delisting;- Euronext Amsterdam provides the affected listed companies additional time until 15 January 2024 to meet the new  eased rule. The criterion to leave the penalty bench remains unchanged: publishing an annual report audited by a PIE audit firm;- The deadline for delisting has been revised and moved from 6 November 2023 to 18 January 2024.Vereniging MidkapNL responds: ""Vereniging Midkap is pleased that Euronext has provided additional time  even though we initially requested a longer period. The affected companies now have about three months to provide a signed assignment letter from a PIE accounting firm. For shareholders and investors in the affected listed companies  this step means that delisting in the short term has been averted. Vereniging MidkapNL will continue to support the affected companies in their efforts to retain their stock market listing. It will also continue the constructive dialogue with Euronext Amsterdam in the interest of investors and listed companies.""DGB had already taken proactive measures to ensure its listing on a robust exchange. As part of its contingency plan  DGB has prepared an organizational restructuring and potential migration to Euronext Growth in Dublin. As a first step  the board of directors  on 27 March 2023  announced the engagement of KPMG Ireland to audit its new wholly-owned Dublin-based holding company.The Board of Directors is content with the policy adjustment of Euronext Amsterdam. While keeping its contingency plan in place  DGB looks forward to exploring all possibilities.
