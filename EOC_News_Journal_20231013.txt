He made the comments after meeting with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in Brussels.Profits worth €1.7 billion ($1.8 billion) that have been generated from seized Russian funds will be handed over to Kiev next year and will be spent on military equipment  humanitarian support  and reconstruction  according to De Croo.Home to NATO and the European Union headquarters  Belgium also pledged to send F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in 2025 and provide training to Ukrainian personnel.Following the meeting with De Croo  Zelensky wrote on his Telegram channel that he discussed ways of “how Russia's frozen assets can be used now  without wasting time  to compensate for the damage” and thanked the Belgian leader for “principled work on the asset freeze.”In July  a major EU clearing house  Belgium-based Euroclear  revealed that of the €2.28 billion it earned in the first half of 2023  it accrued more than €1.7 billion in profit from frozen Russian assets.In financial results for the first six months of this year  Euroclear reported “a substantial growth in operating income” driven partly by “higher interest earnings  including a material rise linked to the application of international sanctions on Russia.” Euroclear’s income  excluding Russian assets  amounted to €538 million.It's estimated that Euroclear holds €196.6 billion worth of Russian assets  the vast majority of which is owned by the country’s central bank. The EU has frozen €207 billion in Russian assets and reserves since the beginning of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine.For some time  Brussels has been investigating ways to use proceeds from frozen Russian funds to cover the cost of reconstruction in Ukraine after the conflict.In September  Bloomberg reported that EU officials scheduled discussions to outline the bloc’s plans to impose a windfall tax on profits generated from the immobilized assets. The Russian central bank’s funds blocked in the EU are expected to create some €3 billion in windfall profits.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.06,0.8,0.13,negative,0.03,0.36,0.61,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU state', 'profits', 'Ukraine', 'Prime Minister Alexander De Croo', 'major EU clearing house', 'Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky', 'European Union headquarters', 'F-16 fighter jets', 'higher interest earnings', 'first six months', 'Russian central bank', 'Ukrainian personnel', 'first half', 'The EU', 'EU officials', 'Russian assets', 'tax revenue', 'military equipment', 'humanitarian support', 'Telegram channel', 'frozen assets', 'Belgian leader', 'principled work', 'asset freeze', 'financial results', 'substantial growth', 'material rise', 'international sanctions', '€196.6 billion worth', 'vast majority', 'military operation', 'windfall tax', 'immobilized assets', 'business section', 'Russian funds', 'operating income', 'windfall profits', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'taxes', 'Ukraine', 'country', 'Wednesday', 'comments', 'Brussels', 'Kiev', 'reconstruction', 'NATO', 'training', 'meeting', 'ways', 'time', 'damage', 'July', 'year', 'application', 'reserves', 'beginning', 'Moscow', 'proceeds', 'cost', 'conflict', 'September', 'Bloomberg', 'discussions', 'bloc', 'plans', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-10-12,2023-10-13,rt.com

(""DGB"" or ""the Group"") (Euronext: DGB: NL0009169515)  a leading carbon project developer and ecosystem restoration company  provides a market update regarding its listing status on Euronext Amsterdam.On 13 April 2021  Euronext Amsterdam implemented a new rule  essentially meaning that companies without a Public Interest Entity audit (""PIE audit"") firm in the Netherlands face delisting. On 13 April 2023  DGB received a letter from Euronext Amsterdam stating that  if unresolved by 6 November 2023  Euronext would start the delisting process of the Company.Vereniging MidkapNL  an association representing the interests of Dutch small and mid-cap companies aiming to enhance the listing environment for medium-sized and smaller publicly traded companies and collectively advocate for the interests of this group of listed companies  strongly voiced concerns about Euronext's new delisting policy due to various circumstances and developments:The shortage of (PIE) audit firms is a structural problem in the Dutch accounting sector beyond the control of the companies involved;Despite significant efforts of the respective listed companies  it proved impossible to secure a contract with a PIE audit firn - a situation unprecedented;There's a delay in the upcoming legislation for mandatory audit appointments due to political reasons beyond the companies' control;Euronext Amsterdam hasn't adequately addressed the concerns of the affected listed companies and their stakeholders;A new PIE-audit firm from a different EU country has shown interest in the Dutch market  expressing a willingness to audit companies listed on Euronext Amsterdam in the near future.Following discussions between Vereniging MidkapNL and Euronext Amsterdam  as well as bilateral talks with all affected listed companies  Euronext Amsterdam has made adjustments to its penalty bench policy. A market notice has been issued on 11 October 2023 in this regard. The changes made by Euronext Amsterdam are:The new criterion is to provide a signed assignment letter from a PIE audit firm for the review of the annual accounts for the fiscal year 2024. It is no longer a prerequisite to publish an audited annual report to prevent delisting;Euronext Amsterdam provides the affected listed companies additional time until 15 January 2024 to meet the new  eased rule. The criterion to leave the penalty bench remains unchanged: publishing an annual report audited by a PIE audit firm;The deadline for delisting has been revised and moved from 6 November 2023 to 18 January 2024.Vereniging MidkapNL responds: ""Vereniging Midkap is pleased that Euronext has provided additional time  even though we initially requested a longer period. The affected companies now have about three months to provide a signed assignment letter from a PIE accounting firm. For shareholders and investors in the affected listed companies  this step means that delisting in the short term has been averted. Vereniging MidkapNL will continue to support the affected companies in their efforts to retain their stock market listing. It will also continue the constructive dialogue with Euronext Amsterdam in the interest of investors and listed companies.""DGB had already taken proactive measures to ensure its listing on a robust exchange. As part of its contingency plan  DGB has prepared an organizational restructuring and potential migration to Euronext Growth in Dublin. As a first step  the board of directors  on 27 March 2023  announced the engagement of KPMG Ireland to audit its new wholly-owned Dublin-based holding company.The Board of Directors is content with the policy adjustment of Euronext Amsterdam.

However  the lack of compatible donor as well as graft failure  graft instability  and poor graft function are still major challenges that must be overcome to reach a positive therapeutic outcome. Thus  so far there are neither optimal nor long-term therapeutic solutions for APDS1 patients and new alternative treatments are highly regarded.The study published here aims at exploring an alternative therapeutic strategy by correcting the mutated PIK3CD gene associated to APDS1 by gene editing. This article describes a TALEN®-mediated gene insertion strategy that allows targeted correction of the dominant gain-of-function mutation of the PIK3CD gene by insertion of a functional sequence in a precise manner. Results show efficient gene insertion in APDS1 patients’ T-cells  normalization of PI3K signaling and rescue of T-cell cytotoxic functions.Preclinical results demonstrated that:The PIK3CD gene can be efficiently corrected by TALEN®-mediated gene insertion of the functional PIK3CD DNA sequence vectorized by AAV  in healthy donor and APDS1 patient T-cells.TALEN®-mediated PIK3CD gene correction rescues PI3K signaling in APDS1 patient T-cells.TALEN®-mediated PIK3CD gene correction normalizes the transcriptomic status of APDS1 patient CD8+ T-cells and rescues their cytolytic activity.In summary  we demonstrate that the PIK3CD dominant gain of function mutation associated to APDS1 can be successfully corrected in APDS1 patient T-cells using TALEN® gene editing and AAV-based DNA repair matrix. This correction rescues the cytolytic function of APDS1 T-cells  normalizes their intracellular phospho-AKT levels found at basal and at activated states as well as the transcriptomic signature of certain genes involve in T-cells’ cytolytic function  activation  and fitness.“This successful demonstration of PIK3CD gene correction warrants the development of a gene therapy approach to treat p110δ dysregulations in a long-term fashion. This proof-of-concept study paves the way for the future development of a bona fide gene surgery candidate to potentially cure APDS1” said Julien Valton  Ph.D.  Vice President Gene Therapy at Cellectis.Rescuing the Cytolytic Function of APDS1 Patient T-cells via TALEN-mediated PIK3CD Gene CorrectionPoggi L.1 2  Chentout L.1 2  Lizot S.3  Boyne A. 4  Juillerat A.4  Moiani A.3  Luka M.5 6  Carbone.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  issues the following clarification regarding the developments in Ukraine  in response to recent press reports and in order to address the questions raised by VEON’s international debt and equity investors.On 6 October 2023  the Security Services of Ukraine (SSU) announced that the Ukrainian courts are seizing all “corporate rights” of Mikhail Fridman  Peter Aven and Andrei Kosogov in 20 Ukrainian companies that these individuals beneficially own  while criminal proceedings  unrelated to Kyivstar or VEON  are in progress. This announcement was incorrectly characterized by some Ukrainian media as a “seizure” or “freezing” of “Kyivstar’s assets”. On 9 October 2023  Ukrainian media further reported  with a headline which incorrectly targets Kyivstar  that the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine is separately finalizing a lawsuit in the Ukraine High Anti-Corruption Court to confiscate any Ukrainian assets of M. Fridman.At present  neither VEON nor Kyivstar have received any official communication from the Ukrainian authorities or courts regarding these matters. The only information that VEON has at the moment is from its share registrar in Ukraine  which confirms that any ownership changes to Kyivstar are currently not permitted.While VEON does not comment on unconfirmed reports in principle  the escalation of the rhetoric and the questions that VEON received from its debt and equity investors necessitate that the Company clarifies the following facts.First and foremost  VEON is and remains Kyivstar’s sole and rightful owner. None of the individuals mentioned in the SSU announcement referenced above own any shares in VEON or Kyivstar.As previously stated  VEON is an Amsterdam-headquartered  Nasdaq- and Euronext Amsterdam-listed company with an international debt and equity investor base that includes US  EU and UK individuals and institutions. VEON has no controlling or majority shareholder. The individuals mentioned in the SSU announcement cannot exercise any rights regarding VEON or Kyivstar  are not a part of either company’s governance mechanisms  including boards  nor do they have the ability to control or influence decisions made by VEON or Kyivstar. They do not derive benefits from VEON or any of its operating companies. Any actions aimed at the rights  benefits or funds of the aforementioned individuals cannot legitimately be directed toward Kyivstar or VEON.VEON notes and welcomes the subsequent clarification by the SSU1 noting that “The seizure of corporate rights of Ukrainian companies does not affect the protection of the interests of foreign investors and owners of shares of corporate rights  does not hinder their economic activity and the possibility of receiving dividends.” Underlining the duties to employees  customers and investors  VEON and Kyivstar intend to use all available avenues to protect the rights of VEON and Kyivstar.VEON deeply values its investors’ support for its strategic choices  including its exit from Russia – one of the most significant corporate exits given VEON’s public listing and the relative size of the asset – and appreciates the support it has received from US  UK and EU regulators over the course of the past 19 months as a Nasdaq- and Euronext Amsterdam-listed company.Kyivstar  with the full support of its parent company VEON  continues to serve its 25 million customers and keeps not only its own customers  but also the broader country connected through extremely challenging conditions  with 94% network availability and full operational integrity in line with the national security priorities of Ukraine. VEON and Kyivstar are fully committed to continue serving Ukraine  as demonstrated by the USD 600 million investment pledge for the recovery and reconstruction of the country.About VEONVEON is a digital operator that provides converged connectivity and digital services to nearly 160 million customers. Operating across six countries that are home to more than 7% of the world’s population  VEON is transforming lives through technology-driven services that empower individuals and drive economic growth.

This site  which is the largest green hydrogen plant in Baden-Württemberg  will be the first to supply hydrogen directly to an industrial park. It is also the first in a network of many plants that will be operated by Lhyfe and supply green hydrogen nationwide in Germany in the coming years. Lhyfe's ambition is to become a major player in green hydrogen delivered in bulk (for the broad market) in Germany and in France by 2025. The groundbreaking ceremony for the production plant will take place today.The project in Schwäbisch Gmünd represents a milestone in the market ramp-up of green hydrogen in Germany and exemplifies the integration of renewable gas into local ecosystems. The plant  which will use renewable electricity secured from hydro  wind and solar power purchase agreements  should be commissioned in the second half of 2024. The hydrogen will be used partly in the ""H2-Aspen"" industrial park and at a JET H2 hydrogen filling station. Last January  Lhyfe and the joint venture JET H2 signed an agreement for the construction of the hydrogen filling station in Schwäbisch Gmünd. The project  which is funded by the state of Baden-Württemberg and the EU  among others  thus supports a sustainable neighbourhood solution for the local industry and lays the foundation for future climate-friendly infrastructure on the site. This project  which is part of the HyFIVE (Hydrogen For Innovative Vehicles) project  is supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through a €6.4 grant agreement.""The project demonstrates the economic viability of hydrogen solutions in the transport and industry sectors and also supports the state of Baden-Württemberg in its efforts to become a model region for the development of hydrogen refueling infrastructure. We very much welcome the fact that the state and the city of Schwäbisch Gmünd want to implement their ambitious goals for a hydrogen economy based on renewable energies and that we are taking this step together. With the construction of the production plant  we are making an important contribution to the goals of the federal government "" says Luc Graré  Head of Central & Eastern Europe at Lhyfe.“Through cooperations like this  Schwäbisch Gmünd is developing into a model region for the nationwide development of a hydrogen and filling station network as a central supply infrastructure. Schwäbisch Gmünd is part of the model region of the state of Baden-Württemberg and  with the completion of the plant  will then also be the largest hydrogen producer in the state. We are thus creating a basis for marketing the land in Aspen  which will enable the companies to produce climate-neutrally”  states Richard Arnold  major of Schwäbisch Gmünd in Germany.Today  Lhyfe's growth is backed by a solid business pipeline representing a total installed production capacity of 10.3 GW across Europe. These projects will contribute to the decarbonisation of mobility and industry with green renewable hydrogen on an industrial scale. In 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the world's first large-scale green hydrogen production plant linked to a wind farm in France. In 2022  the world's first offshore pilot platform for the production of green hydrogen was inaugurated at the port of Saint-Nazaire. This makes Lhyfe the first company globally to have already started offshore hydrogen production  based on a production capacity of up to 400 kg/day. In addition to the production of green hydrogen  Lhyfe is researching the reoxygenation of the oceans.For an interview with the spokespersons above  please contact the press department.Click to access the Lhyfe Media Kit (press kit and visuals)About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

This brisk sales momentum clearly reflects structural growth in the cybersecurity sector boosted by the opening up of information systems  the ever-present threat of cybercrime and tightening regulations. However  it also testifies to the ideal positioning that WALLIX has built up through continuous intelligent enhancement of its offering  which is now recognized by world-renowned analytics firms such as Gartner  KuppingerCole and Frost & Sullivan.Sales organization  which is also key to sustaining our growth model  was restructured and optimized during the period. The new system pools and streamlines skills by rallying the sales force around shared targets  thereby triggering a new spurt of momentum that will contribute to future growth.While these structural measures generate costs in the short term  they will undoubtedly raise our Company to a new level and boost our confidence in our ability to continue gaining market share  improve our operating performance considerably from the second half of 2023 onwards and reach breakeven in 2024.”Acceleration of business in the first halfBusiness growth accelerated in the first half of 2023  with turnover up 26.4% to €13.9 million  up 29.2% excluding Russia. Consolidated since May 16  2023  Kleverware contributed turnover of €0.2 million for the first half.Over the period as a whole  contract acquisitions kept up a sustained pace with 225 new contracts signed  bringing the total number of active contracts to 2 525 at June 30  2023  up 25% over 12 months.This return to high growth rates is taking place amid a controlled shift towards a subscription model that will guarantee a constant flow of recurring business and better long-term financial visibility.Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) for the first half totaled €1.4 million  up 26.2% versus H1 2022  representing €17.0 million in recurring business on an annual basis.Improvement in the operating expenses/turnover ratio before non-recurring expensesDuring the first half  WALLIX implemented a new sales organization  thereby generating restructuring costs  and incurred non-recurring expenses mainly related to its acquisition and financing policy. These expenses totaled €1.5 million and are not likely to be repeated in the future.Excluding non-recurring items  structural operating expenses remained under control  as a result of which the operating expenses/turnover ratio improved 17 percentage points versus H1 2022.This improvement was achieved despite the Company's ongoing active hiring policy  as a result of which the average headcount increased 14% year-on-year from 214 FTEs in H1 2022 to 244 in H1 2023.The Company posted an operating loss of €6.1 million. Excluding non-recurring items  the operating loss amounted to €4.6 million compared to €4.2 million in H1 2022.After a tax credit of €0.6 million  net loss Group share amounted to €5.4 million.Cash position strengthened in H1 2023Following the first half fundraising campaign comprising a €5.5 million capital increase and a €5 million convertible bond issue  gross cash and cash equivalents amounted to €20.6 million at June 30  2023 compared to €13.5 million at December 31  2022. Financing requirements remained under control at €2.6 million compared to €4.7 million in H1 2022  mainly related to capitalized development costs.Net cash and cash equivalents amounted to €13.6 million  putting WALLIX in a strong financial position from which to look ahead confidently to the next stages of its organic development while analyzing acquisition opportunities.Streamlined sales organization and enhanced offering to reach breakeven in 2024WALLIX delivered a solid first half in terms of sales  confirming its target to step up organic growth in 2023 with a strong focus on recurring business generated from subscription offers and SaaS solutions.In order to sustain sales momentum  the organization has been optimized by rallying the various departments involved in revenue generation around shared targets and processes across all regions. Management structure has been streamlined in order to promote a more efficient approach at country level propelled by a uniform and centralized driving force. Combined with the various growth drivers implemented by the Group  the new organizational system will enable it to maintain strong growth.The first half was also marked by innovation and the enhancement of the Group's offering.

Mathieu Boulanger  Roctool CEO: ""The implementation of Roctool technology continues  and we can only be very proud of the first six months of the year. I'd like to thank all my teams for their hard work. Even though the economic climate is uncertain  and the stock market is being rocked by inflation and rising interest rates  our solutions have continued to win over customers and prospects in the first half of the year  and our results have continued to improve over the last 3 years. Our partnership strategy is beginning to bear fruit  and we are mobilized for the second half of the year  especially as we now have players such as ENRX on our side. With visibility reduced in the second half of the year  our priority is to secure new projects and deliver them before the end of the year. Consolidated figures (in K€) H1 2023 H1 2022 ∆ vs22 S1 2021 ∆ vs21 Sales figures 5 099 4 125 24% 2 900 76% EBITDA 285 (26) - (909) - As % of sales 5 6% -0 6% -31% EBIT (Operating income) 249 37 - (1 099) - Net income of consolidated companies 8 80 - (1 197) - Sales came to 5.1€m  up +24% vs. H1 2022 and +76% vs. H1 2021  driven by sustained dynamism across all markets. In line with expectations  sales grew across all sectors (beauty  consumer goods  industry and energy)  and R&D made significant progress in future growth segments such as solar energy  hydrogen and low-carbon packaging. The company's commitment to eco-responsible packaging is taking shape with new projects in the beauty sector  and the development of ground-breaking innovations. In addition  this half-year underlines once again the success of Roctool's internationalization strategy  with nearly 90% of sales generated outside France. 1 / 3Solid overall results First-half year results continue the very positive trend of previous years. Driven by the strong appeal of its solutions  Roctool reported a +68% increase in equipment sales to 3.3€ million compared with H1 2022. Operating expenses were up +8% to 3.5€m  compared with 3.2€m in H1 2022. This included an increase in personnel costs of +7% vs. 2022  representing -40% of sales (vs. -46% of sales in 2022)  and an increase in other operating costs of +10%  representing -27% of sales (vs. - 30% of sales in 2022). Strong business growth in the first half of the year necessitated some technical reinforcements  but the cost of key raw materials and components for Roctool technology was carefully managed  despite inflation. The Group EBITDA was positive at 0.3€m  versus 0.0€m in H1 2022. This improvement in operating performance illustrates the positive trajectory Roctool has embarked upon. Thus  after the impact of financial income (-0.2M€ due to exchange rate effects)  exceptional income and corporate income tax  net income remains very close to last year's level (vs. +0.1 M€ in H1 2022  and -1.2M€ in 2021). Strengthening the financial structure The company's cash position improved to 1.5 M€ at June 30  2022  compared with 0.8 M€ at December 31  2022. Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of June 2023 stood at €2.6 million  versus €2.3 million at December 31  2022. Reduced visibility for the second half First-half results and the signature in September of a major partnership with ENRX  confirm the acceleration of Roctool's development. With strategic choices already made more than two years ago  the company is continuing its deployment in the luxury and beauty sectors  with an increasingly virtuous and appealing packaging offering  and is also continuing to equip automotive transformers to help them improve process performance and part quality. The order portfolio is lower this summer than last year  but the sales momentum is very strong to promote Roctool solutions and generate new opportunities.

Ilmenite production was up 32% quarter-on-quarter  as operations were consistently stable  and this robust production is expected to continue in Q4.Following strong product pricing in H1 2023  weaker global economic activity impacted the markets for Kenmare’s products in Q3  although demand for our high-quality ilmenite remains resilient. Shipments were impacted by the loading of two vessels completing after quarter-end  meaning they will be attributed to Q4.We completed a share buy-back of $30 million during the quarter  representing 5.9% of our share capital  as part of our policy to supplement shareholder returns when resources permit.”Q3 2023 overviewLost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.21 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 30 September 2023 (30 September 2022: 0.03)Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 414 600 tonnes in Q3 2023  a 7% decrease compared to Q3 2022 (443 900 tonnes)  driven by lower ore grades  but up 30% on Q2 2023Ilmenite production of 291 200 tonnes in Q3 2023  a 4% decrease compared to Q3 2022 (304 700 tonnes) due to lower HMC processed  but up 32% on Q2 2023Primary zircon production of 14 100 tonnes  an 18% decrease compared to Q3 2022 (17 300 tonnes)  due to lower HMC processed and a build of intermediate stockpiles  but up 22% on Q2 2023Total shipments of finished products of 163 400 tonnes  a 43% decrease compared to Q3 2022 (285 600 tonnes) as two large ilmenite shipments completed after quarter-end – these will be recorded as Q4 2023 shipmentsKenmare remains on track to achieve revised 2023 production guidanceThe Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”) for the upgrade and relocation of Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) A is expected in H1 2024  with orders already placed for the replacement dredges given their long lead timesWeaker global economic activity led to lower average prices achieved for ilmenite in Q3 2023  although demand remains strong for Kenmare’s high quality productsContracted zircon prices remained largely stable although reduced global construction activity is impacting ceramics demand  with zircon spot prices coming under increasing pressureOperations updateProduction from the Moma Mine in Q3 2023 was as follows:Q3 2023 Q3 2022 Q3 2022 Q2 2023 Q2 2023 tonnes tonnes % variance tonnes % variance Excavated ore1 10 822 000 10 424 000 4% 9 606 000 13% Grade1 4.32% 4.95% -13% 4.03% 7% Production HMC production 414 600 443 900 -7% 318 900 30% HMC processed 412 900 440 500 -6% 322 900 28% Ilmenite 291 200 304 700 -4% 221 300 32% Primary zircon 14 100 17 300 -18% 11 600 22% Rutile 2 700 2 600 4% 1 900 42% Concentrates2 14 700 13 000 13% 10 400 41% Shipments 163 400 285 600 -43% 285 100 -43%1. Excavated ore tonnage and grade prior to any floor losses.2. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.Kenmare’s rolling 12-month LTIFR to 30 September 2023 was 0.21 per 200 000 hours worked (Q3 2022: 0.03)  with two lost time injuries recorded during Q3 2023. Kenmare is committed to ensuring the health and safety of its employees and contractors across its operations. The Company continues to focus on the training and development of its employees and contractors to be proactive and consistent in the identification  assessment  management and mitigation of potential health and safety risks.HMC production was 414 600 tonnes in Q3 2023  representing a 7% decrease compared to Q3 2022 (443 900 tonnes). This was a product of a 13% decrease in ore grades to 4.32% (Q3 2022: 4.95%) partially offset by a 4% increase in excavated ore volumes to 10.8 million tonnes (Q3 2022: 10.4 million tonnes). HMC recoveries improved at all Wet Concentrator Plants. The introduction of clean water to spiral separation at WCP A has had a meaningful impact and WCP C is now mining ore after the tailings crossing.Ilmenite production was 291 200 tonnes  the strongest quarterly production of the year to date. However  it represented a 4% decrease compared to Q3 2022 (304 700 tonnes) due to the reduction in HMC processed.Primary zircon production was 14 100 tonnes in Q3 2023  an 18% decrease compared to Q3 2022 (17 300 tonnes). Recoveries were impacted in Q3 2023 by power reliability issues leading to increased stock spillage. The Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply (“RUPS”) is now back in service following implementation of design corrections and it will help protect against grid power instability. Lower utilisation of the circuit caused a build-up of intermediate feedstocks  which are expected to be largely drawn down in Q4 2023.Rutile production was 2 700 tonnes  up 4% on the prior year and 42% on the prior quarter (Q3 2022: 2 600 tonnes  Q2 2023: 1 900 tonnes). This reflects increased rutile feed grade in HMC and improved recoveries as a result of separation equipment upgrades.Concentrates production was 14 700 tonnes  up 13% on Q3 2022 (13 000 tonnes)  benefitting from increased feed availability and debottlenecking of the circuit  which facilitated increased throughputs.Total shipments in Q3 2023 were 163 400 tonnes  a 43% decrease compared to Q3 2022 (285 600 tonnes)  largely due to two ilmenite shipments being completed after quarter-end and falling into Q4 2023. Shipments comprised 143 200 tonnes of ilmenite  9 200 tonnes of primary zircon  and 11 000 tonnes of concentrates.Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q3 2023 was 16 700 tonnes  compared to 15 000 tonnes at the end of Q2 2023. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q3 2023 was 288 400 tonnes  compared to 129 000 tonnes at the end of Q2 2023  reflecting shipments carried into Q4 2023.Capital projects updateThe DFS for the WCP A upgrade and transition to Nataka is scheduled for completion in H1 2024. Studies have been completed for the replacement dredges  which are long lead time items  and an order has been placed  thereby providing price certainty on the construction costs for this important element of the project. The construction  transportation and installation costs of the dredges are now expected to be approximately 15% higher than the Pre-Feasibility Study estimate.Market updateDemand for titanium feedstocks and zircon softened in Q3  reflecting weaker global economic activity  and consequently Kenmare achieved lower average prices compared to the previous quarter. Despite the current headwinds  the Company believes the medium- and long-term fundamentals for all of its products remain strong.Pigment production in China  one of Kenmare’s key markets  continues at high levels supported by new capacity. Pigment exports from China are at record levels and competing aggressively in the global market  with major producers outside of China lowering utilisations and closing selected plants in response.Feedstock supply has remained flat during the year. Ilmenite concentrates entering China remain the largest source of new supply offsetting supply disruptions at several large operations outside China  which are continuing in Q4 2023. This is coupled with major producers reducing their supply to the market  reflecting the weaker demand.Demand for high-quality ilmenite has been more resilient than other titanium feedstocks  benefiting from the strong pigment production in China and the thriving titanium metal market  supporting relatively stable demand for Kenmare’s ilmenite products.Kenmare expects to achieve higher sales volumes in Q4 2023  as the loading of some vessels at the end of Q3 was completed after quarter-end so these will be recorded in Q4. Some other shipments were also delayed by customers from Q3 into Q4.Demand for zircon is following a similar trend to ilmenite. Subdued global construction activity is impacting demand for ceramics and this is flowing through to the zircon market. Contracted prices have remained relatively stable  although spot prices have come under increasing pressure.Kenmare expects to achieve strong zircon sales in Q4 2023  with contracts in place for most of its volume.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Michael StarkeInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresouces.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

In these studies  bimekizumab demonstrated clinical meaningful improvements for these outcomes over placebo at Week 16  with improvements increasing for patients remaining in the studies through Week 48. In addition  improvements in disease severity were seen over time  with the majority of patients with severe hidradenitis suppurativa at baseline shifting to mild-to-moderate disease according to the IHS4 dynamic classification system "" said Professor Christos C. Zouboulis  President of the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation  Director of the Departments of Dermatology  Venereology  Allergology and Immunology  Städtisches Klinikum Dessau  and Founding Professor of Dermatology and Venereology at the Brandenburg Medical School  Germany.The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab in HS have not been established  and it is not approved for use in HS by any regulatory authority worldwide. In the U.S.  the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab have not been established for any indication and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Data were pooled from the BE HEARD I and II studies  which included an initial (Weeks 0–16) and maintenance treatment period (Weeks 16–48).1 2 3 4 Adult patients (N=1 014) were randomized 2:2:2:1 (initial/maintenance) to receive  either bimekizumab 320 mg every two weeks (Q2W) /Q2W (n=288); bimekizumab Q2W/every four weeks (Q4W); n=292; bimekizumab Q4W/Q4W (n=288) or placebo/bimekizumab Q2W (n=146).1 2 3 4Highlights from the pooled data analysis (BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II)Bimekizumab-treated patients showed higher response rates in the primary endpoint (HiSCR50) at Week 16 vs. placebo (58 percent Q2W/Q2W  55.9 percent Q2W/Q4W  56.1 percent Q4W/Q4W vs. 33.4 percent for placebo). † 1 Improvements increased for patients through Week 48 with almost 8 in 10 achieving HiSCR50. ‡ 1 At Week 48  the response in patients who switched from placebo to bimekizumab at Week 16 approached that reached by patients on bimekizumab from baseline (70.5 percent [n=74/105]). ‡1Improvements increased for patients through Week 48 with almost 8 in 10 achieving HiSCR50.

According to the International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4)  at baseline  83.7–88.4 percent of the enrolled patients across bimekizumab dosing regimens had severe HS. 3 A post hoc analysis showed that at Week 16 higher proportions of bimekizumab-treated patients had mild HS vs. placebo (24.6­–27.2 percent vs. 15.3 percent). 3 Similar trends were observed for patients with HS (25.8–28.0 percent vs. 17.1 percent). 3 Improvements in IHS4 categories were sustained over time across bimekizumab groups. At Week 48  37.3–40.1 percent had mild HS and 23.8–25.3 percent had moderate HS. 3A post hoc analysis showed that at Week 16 higher proportions of bimekizumab-treated patients had mild HS vs. placebo (24.6­–27.2 percent vs. 15.3 percent). Similar trends were observed for patients with HS (25.8–28.0 percent vs. 17.1 percent). Improvements in IHS4 categories were sustained over time across bimekizumab groups. At Week 48  37.3–40.1 percent had mild HS and 23.8–25.3 percent had moderate HS. Analyses showed that regardless of weight and body mass index category  a higher proportion of patients treated with bimekizumab vs. placebo achieved clinical response at Week 16 (HiSCR50  HiSCR75 and HiSCR90) with increasing levels of response between Week 16 and Week 48. 4The safety profile of bimekizumab across BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II was consistent with previous studies with no new safety signals observed.1 The most frequently reported TEAEs in 995 patients receiving ≥1 dose of bimekizumab were hidradenitis (18.7 percent)  oral candidiasis (11.2 percent)  and coronavirus infection (10.8 percent).1 Serious treatment emergent adverse events were reported in 7.0 percent Q4W/Q4W  4.5 percent Q2W/Q4W and 8.1 percent Q2W/Q2W patients.1Notes to editors:†Modified non-responder imputation‡Observed Case¥ Last Observation Carried OverAbout Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic  recurring  painful  and debilitating inflammatory skin disease.7 8 The main symptoms are nodules  abscesses  and pus-discharging fistulas (channels leading out of the skin)  which typically occur in the armpits  groin  and buttocks.7 8 People with HS experience flare-ups of the disease as well as severe pain  which can have a major impact on quality of life.7 8HS most commonly develops in early adulthood and affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries.7 8 Approximately one-third of people with HS have a family history of HS  and lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity can also play a crucial role in the clinical course of HS.7 8The symptoms of pain  discharge  and scarring are not only a physical burden. People with HS also experience stigma: worrying about or directly experiencing negative attitudes and reactions from society in response to their symptoms.9 These feelings can lead to embarrassment  social isolation  low self-esteem  and sexual life impairment  and impact all areas of life  including interpersonal relationships  education  and work.10About BE HEARD I and BE HEARD IIBE HEARD I and BE HEARD II are randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).5 6 The two studies had a combined enrollment of 1 014 participants with a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe HS.5 6 The primary endpoint in both studies was HiSCR50 at Week 16.5 6 A key secondary endpoint was HiSCR75 at Week 16.5 6 HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 are defined as at least either a 50 or 75 percent reduction from baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count  with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.5 6About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.11 In the U.S.  the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab have not been established for any indication and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT: +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comU.S. CommunicationsNicole HergaT: +1.773.960.5349email nicole.herga@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

Before change in working capital requirementsArthur Sadoun  Chairman and CEO of Publicis Groupe:“ Despite a macroeconomic context that became more difficult over the quarter  we delivered strong organic growth of +5.3% in Q3  ahead of expectations.Our media capabilities  which continued to gain market share  and Epsilon’s data offer were the main drivers of this performance  achieving high single-digit and double-digit growth respectively. At a moment when the comparable consulting firms experienced project delays  Publicis Sapient nonetheless continued to grow  and Creative confirmed its resilience once again  in spite of industry-wide cuts to classic advertising activities.All of our regions posted solid organic growth  with the US at +3.2% on top of double digits in the last two years  Europe at a standout +10.7% and APAC improving again at +3.8%.Looking at our journey since the pandemic  the acceleration of our growth amid persistent macroeconomic challenges is clearly visible  with Q3 at +22% compared to 2019 levels  coming after +20% in Q2 and +18% in Q1.Today we have a differentiated go-to-market  that allows us to gain market share; a uniquely balanced revenue mix that makes us more resilient to business cycles; and a platform organization that enables us to post industry high financial ratios.This gives us the confidence to further upgrade our 2023 guidance  even in a context of rising global socio-economic tensions. We now expect to deliver +5.5% to 6% organic growth for the full year  while upgrading our operating margin to 18% and free cash flow at close to 1.7 billion euros.For the rest of the year  we intend to lead what we believe to be the two major priorities for our industry today: bringing our teams back together in person  and accelerating the AI-ification of our operations  which we are uniquely able to do through Publicis Sapient. ”* **NET REVENUE IN Q3 2023Publicis Groupe's net revenue in Q3 2023 was 3 241 million euros  broadly stable compared to 3 237 million euros in Q3 2022. Exchange rate variations had a 189 million euros negative impact. The acquisitions (net of disposals) have a positive impact of 32 million euros this quarter.Organic growth was +5.3% in Q3 2023 compared to 2022. Media  one third of revenue  continued to experience strong new business momentum and grew high-single digit on top of double-digit last year. Data and tech activities  another third or revenue  posted very solid growth overall. On the one hand  in a context of slowdown in digital business transformation experienced by comparable consulting firms  Publicis Sapient nonetheless achieved a +1.2% organic growth despite a very strong comparable base of +18% in Q3 2022. On the other hand  Epsilon’s strong performance further accelerated to double-digits with +10.5% organic growth in Q3 after double-digits also last year  benefitting from increased client demand for first-party data management. Creative  the remaining third  posted a resilient performance with organic growth in the low-single digits for the quarter.Breakdown of Q3 2023 Net revenue by regionEUR million Net revenue Reported Organic Q3 2023 Q3 2022 Growth growth North America 1 999 2 076 -3.7% +3.0% Europe 769 694 +10.8% +10.7% Asia Pacific 288 303 -5.0% +3.8% Middle East & Africa 95 90 +5.6% +18.2% Latin America 90 74 +21.6% +6.9% Total 3 241 3 237 +0.1% +5.3%North America net revenue was up +3.0% organically in Q3 2023.

Media grew mid-single digit on top of double digits last year. Creative activities were slightly negative on the quarter  affected by localized cuts in classic advertising and on top of a high base in Q3 last year. Epsilon posted double-digit organic growth this quarter on top of +14% in Q3 2022  largely driven by digital media and data divisions.

Unlimitail has already converted its first 13 retail partners  representing together more than 120 million loyalty customers.OutlookThanks to the strength of its model and a better than expected Q3 performance  the Groupe is in a position to upgrade once again its 2023 guidance despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.When it comes to organic growth  the Groupe now aims at +5.5% to 6% for the full year  compared to circa +5% previously.Our +5.5% is solid and factors in:Economic and social tensions that are likely to continue to affect client spend Further delays in digital business transformation And negative end of year adjustments of advertisers’ budgets.Organic growth could move closer to the higher end of the guidance range under the following assumptions:Fewer cuts in classic advertising A faster ramp up in new business Some positive impact from increased client budgets in Q4.This means that Q4 organic growth is now expected between +3% and +5% at a stretch.The Groupe anticipates to continue to deliver industry-high financial ratios  upgrading its operating margin guidance to 18% (from ‘close to 18%’ previously) and its free cash flow before working capital requirements to close to 1.7 billion euros (from ‘at least 1.6 billion euros’ previously).New businessEUROPESanten France (Health)  Glaxo Smith Kline (Health)  Comité Colbert (Creative)  Speedy (Data)

There is a compelling need for new treatment options that can offer high and durable clinical response "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB. ""Data presented at EADV showed that over 48 weeks many patients treated with bimekizumab achieved high thresholds of response. These findings suggest that inhibition of IL-17F in addition to IL-17A represents a promising treatment approach in moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.""""The bimekizumab Phase 3 clinical trial program in hidradenitis suppurativa included the more stringent clinical outcomes of HiSCR75  HiSCR90 and HiSCR100 in addition to the standard HiSCR50. In these studies  bimekizumab demonstrated clinical meaningful improvements for these outcomes over placebo at Week 16  with improvements increasing for patients remaining in the studies through Week 48. In addition  improvements in disease severity were seen over time  with the majority of patients with severe hidradenitis suppurativa at baseline shifting to mild to moderate disease according to the IHS4 dynamic classification system "" said Professor Christos C. Zouboulis  President of the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation  Director of the Departments of Dermatology  Venereology  Allergology and Immunology  Städtisches Klinikum Dessau  and Founding Professor of Dermatology and Venereology at the Brandenburg Medical School  Germany.The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab in HS have not been established  and it is not approved for use in HS by any regulatory authority worldwide.Data were pooled from the BE HEARD I and II studies  which included an initial (Weeks 0-16) and maintenance treatment period (Weeks 16-48).1 2 3 4 Adult patients (n=1 014) were randomized 2:2:2:1 (initial/maintenance) to receive  either bimekizumab 320 mg every two weeks (Q2W) /Q2W (n=288); bimekizumab Q2W/every four weeks (Q4W); n=292; bimekizumab Q4W/Q4W (n=288) or placebo/bimekizumab Q2W (n=146).1 2 3 4Highlights from the pooled data analysis (BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II)Bimekizumab-treated patients showed higher response rates in the primary endpoint (HiSCR50) at Week 16 vs. placebo (58 percent Q2W/Q2W  55.9 percent Q2W/Q4W  56.1 percent Q4W/Q4W vs. 33.4 percent for placebo). †1 Improvements increased for patients through Week 48 with almost 8 in 10 achieving HiSCR50. ‡1 At Week 48  the response in patients who switched from placebo to bimekizumab at Week 16 approached that reached by patients on bimekizumab from baseline (70.5 percent [n=74/105]). ‡1A similar trend was seen in the more stringent HiSCR75 and HiSCR90 endpoints through Week 48. ‡1 5 6 Bimekizumab-treated patients had improved responses at Week 48 with approximately 6 in 10 patients achieving HiSCR75. ‡1 Analysis of the most stringent endpoint  HiSCR100  showed numerically higher responses in bimekizumab patients vs. placebo at Week 16  and improved responses at Week 48 with approximately 3 out of 10 patients achieving HiSCR100. Patients who switched from placebo to bimekizumab at Week 16 demonstrated a similar trend in HiSCR100 rates at Week 48. ‡1Across all bimekizumab treatment groups  over 8 out of 10 patients who achieved HiSCR50 at Week 16 (n=160 Q2W/Q2W; n=155 Q2W/Q4W; n=152 Q4W/Q4W)  maintained the response through Week 48. ‡2 In addition  across all bimekizumab treatment groups  more than 8 out of 10 patients who achieved an abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count of 0 1 or 2 at Week 16 (n=104 Q2W/Q2W  n=99 Q2W/Q4W; n=87 Q4W/Q4W) maintained this response to Week 48. ‡2According to the International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4)  at baseline  83.7-88.4 percent of the enrolled patients across bimekizumab dosing regimens had severe HS. 3 A post hoc analysis showed that at Week 16 higher proportions of bimekizumab-treated patients had mild HS vs. placebo (24.6¬-27.2 percent vs. 15.3 percent). 3 Similar trends were observed for patients with moderate HS (25.8-28.0 percent vs. 17.1 percent). 3 Improvements in IHS4 categories were sustained over time across bimekizumab groups. At Week 48  37.3-40.1 percent had mild HS and 23.8-25.3 percent had moderate HS. 3Analyses showed that regardless of weight and body mass index category  a higher proportion of patients treated with bimekizumab vs. placebo achieved clinical response at Week 16 (HiSCR50  HiSCR75 and HiSCR90) with increasing levels of response between Week 16 and Week 48. 4The safety profile of bimekizumab across BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II was consistent with previous studies with no new safety signals observed.1 The most frequently reported TEAEs in 995 patients receiving ≥1 dose of bimekizumab were hidradenitis (18.7 percent)  oral candidiasis (11.2 percent)  and coronavirus infection (10.8 percent).1 Serious treatment emergent adverse events were reported in 7.0 percent Q4W/Q4W  4.5 percent Q2W/Q4W and 8.1 percent Q2W/Q2W patients.1Notes to editors:†Modified non-responder imputation‡Observed CaseAbout Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic  recurring  painful  and debilitating inflammatory skin disease  that is associated with systemic manifestations.7 8 The main symptoms are nodules  abscesses  and pus-discharging fistulas (channels leading out of the skin) which typically occur in the armpits  groin  and buttocks.7 8 People with HS experience flare-ups of the disease as well as severe pain  which can have a major impact on quality of life.7.8 HS most commonly develops in early adulthood and affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries.7 8 Approximately one third of people with HS have a family history of HS  and lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity can also play a crucial role in the clinical course of HS.7 8 The symptoms of pain  discharge and scarring are not only a physical burden. People with HS also experience stigma: worrying about  or directly experiencing  negative attitudes and reactions from society in response to their symptoms.9 These feelings can lead to embarrassment  social isolation  low self-esteem and sexual life impairment  and impact all areas of life  including interpersonal relationships  education  and work.10About BE HEARD I and BE HEARD IIBE HEARD I and BE HEARD II are randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).5 6 The two studies had a combined enrolment of 1 014 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe HS.5 6 The primary endpoint in both studies was HiSCR50 at Week 16.5 6 A key secondary endpoint was HiSCR75 at Week 16.5 6 HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 are defined as at least either a 50 or 75 percent reduction from baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count  with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.5 6About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.11 The therapeutic indications in the European Union are:Plaque psoriasis : Bimekizumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. 12Psoriatic arthritis : Bimekizumab  alone or in combination with methotrexate  is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 12Axial Spondyloarthritis: Bimekizumab is indicated for the treatment of adults with active non radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)  and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  and for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to conventional therapy.12BIMZELX®▼(bimekizumab) EU/EEA* Important Safety InformationThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with bimekizumab were upper respiratory tract infections (14.5%  14.6%  16.3% in plaque psoriasis (PSO)  psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)  respectively) and oral candidiasis (7.3%  2.3%  3.7% in PSO  PsA and axSpA  respectively). Common adverse reactions (≥1/100 to <1/10) were oral candidiasis  tinea infections  ear infections  herpes simplex infections  oropharyngeal candidiasis  gastroenteritis  folliculitis  headache  rash  dermatitis and eczema  acne  injection site reactions  fatigue. Elderly may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions such as oral candidiasis  dermatitis and eczema when using bimekizumab.Bimekizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients and in patients with clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis).Bimekizumab may increase the risk of infections. Treatment with bimekizumab must not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection. Patients treated with bimekizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient develops an infection the patient should be carefully monitored. If the infection becomes serious or is not responding to standard therapy  treatment should be discontinued until the infection resolves. Prior to initiating treatment with bimekizumab  patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Bimekizumab should not be given in patients with active TB. Patients receiving bimekizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB.Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with bimekizumab. Bimekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease  bimekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical management should be initiated.Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been observed with IL-17 inhibitors. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs  administration of bimekizumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.Live vaccines should not be given in patients treated with bimekizumab.Please consult the summary of product characteristics in relation to other side effects  full safety and prescribing information.http://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/bimzelx-epar-product-information_en.pdfEuropean SmPC date of revision: June 2023.Last accessed: October 2023.*EU/EEA means European Union/European Economic Area▼ This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

Before change in working capital requirementsArthur Sadoun  Chairman and CEO of Publicis Groupe:“ Despite a macroeconomic context that became more difficult over the quarter  we delivered strong organic growth of +5.3% in Q3  ahead of expectations.Our media capabilities  which continued to gain market share  and Epsilon’s data offer were the main drivers of this performance  achieving high single-digit and double-digit growth respectively. At a moment when the comparable consulting firms experienced project delays  Publicis Sapient nonetheless continued to grow  and Creative confirmed its resilience once again  in spite of industry-wide cuts to classic advertising activities.All of our regions posted solid organic growth  with the US at +3.2% on top of double digits in the last two years  Europe at a standout +10.7% and APAC improving again at +3.8%.Looking at our journey since the pandemic  the acceleration of our growth amid persistent macroeconomic challenges is clearly visible  with Q3 at +22% compared to 2019 levels  coming after +20% in Q2 and +18% in Q1.Today we have a differentiated go-to-market  that allows us to gain market share; a uniquely balanced revenue mix that makes us more resilient to business cycles; and a platform organization that enables us to post industry high financial ratios.This gives us the confidence to further upgrade our 2023 guidance  even in a context of rising global socio-economic tensions. We now expect to deliver +5.5% to 6% organic growth for the full year  while upgrading our operating margin to 18% and free cash flow at close to 1.7 billion euros.For the rest of the year  we intend to lead what we believe to be the two major priorities for our industry today: bringing our teams back together in person  and accelerating the AI-ification of our operations  which we are uniquely able to do through Publicis Sapient. ”* **NET REVENUE IN Q3 2023Publicis Groupe's net revenue in Q3 2023 was 3 241 million euros  broadly stable compared to 3 237 million euros in Q3 2022.

performance  the Groupe is in a position to upgrade once again its 2023 guidance despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.When it comes to organic growth  the Groupe now aims at +5.5% to 6% for the full year  compared to circa +5% previously.Our +5.5% is solid and factors in:Economic and social tensions that are likely to continue to affect client spend Further delays in digital business transformation And negative end of year adjustments of advertisers’ budgets.Organic growth could move closer to the higher end of the guidance range under the following assumptions:Fewer cuts in classic advertising A faster ramp up in new business Some positive impact from increased client budgets in Q4.This means that Q4 organic growth is now expected between +3% and +5% at a stretch.The Groupe anticipates to continue to deliver industry-high financial ratios  upgrading its operating margin guidance to 18% (from ‘close to 18%’ previously) and its free cash flow before working capital requirements to close to 1.7 billion euros (from ‘at least 1.6 billion euros’ previously).New businessEUROPESanten France (Health)  Glaxo Smith Kline (Health)  Comité Colbert (Creative)  Speedy (Data)

31360,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.kyivpost.com/post/22702,‘I Got the News Via Telegram’ – Kyivstar CEO On Telecom Company Being ‘Nationalised’,In an exclusive with Kyiv Post  Kyivstar CEO Oleksandr Komarov discusses government actions regarding possible nationalization of his company and potential damage to future investment in Ukraine.,Kyivstar CEO Oleksandr Komarov was driving in his car when the he heard news that would upend his entire week  see him have to calm investor nerves and send ripples of concern through the international business community. On Oct. 6  the Security Services of Ukraine (SBU) announced that Ukrainian courts were seizing all “corporate rights” of three Russian oligarchs  Mikhail Fridman  Peter Aven  and Andrey Kosogov. “I got this news from the SBU Telegram channel ” he told Kyiv Post in an exclusive interview. “We were not told in advance. And I want to underline that so far  neither Kyivstar nor VEON received any formal court decisions. “So somehow all our understanding is actually based on this announcement. As Komarov explains  the announcement “indirectly affects Kyivstar” due to the ownership structures of various other companies. “Kyivstar is the biggest telecom provider in Ukraine ” says Komarov. “[We have] 24 million mobile customers  more than 1 million households  more than 1 million TV customers. “Kyivstar is an international entity  100 percent owned by the VEON company ” he says. “VEON is a public international entity that is operating in six countries  including Ukraine and is listed on NASDAQ and Euronext  and [VEON] is partially owned by the Letter One company that is actually partially owned by Mr. Fridman.” Clarifying Fridman’s role in Kyivstar  Komarov adds: “There is no role. No. He’s one of the minority investors into the VEON business.” More on this topic Terrahawk Paladin: Ukraine's New Drone Destroyer Arriving Just in Time for Winter The new British air defense system will be an essential addition to the defense of critical infrastructure against anticipated attacks by unmanned aerial vehicles and incoming missiles.The recent move against Fridman is part of ongoing attempts by Kyiv to strip Russian oligarchs who help finance Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine of their assets. Since February of last year  numerous companies and business interests either owned by the Russian state or majority-owned by Russian oligarchs have been nationalized by the Ukrainian government  such as the Ocean Plaza shopping mall in Kyiv. Such cases where entities belonged to the Russian state or majority-owned by Russian oligarchs have been relatively uncontroversial  but the Kyivstar case has raised concerns in Kyivstar and among the wider international business community. Komarov says: “What I feel right now is a kind of third wave [of asset seizures] with  I will say  very controversial cases from my perspective  without a clear  legitimate way how these assets can be nationalized and confiscated.” “But it looks like that government is considering how to approach this… group of assets.” Not only is the role of Russian owners far less clear cut  but Kyivstar is a major company with major international investors – a group of people Ukraine is seeking to woo in order to help recover and rebuild from damage cause by Russia’s full-scale invasion. The SBU’s announcement about the seizure of Fridman’s assets sparked media speculation that the Ukrainian government was seeking to nationalize one of the country’s largest private infrastructure companies.Kyivstar is the biggest telecom provider in Ukraine.Anna Derevyanko  Executive Director European Business Association  told Kyiv Post: “Investors  especially international ones  pay special attention to how Ukraine treats investors  how it supports business and how it creates the appropriate conditions for doing business. “And  especially now  they closely monitor any decisions regarding the work of investors. Therefore  in any decisions related to business the rule of law has to work well ” she said. “Moreover  it’s very important to respect private property rights as each decision shouldn’t disrupt an investor’s decision to enter the country but show that the country respects and welcomes business.” Komarov is keen to stress the difference between Kyivstar and other businesses that have been nationalized by the Ukrainian government. “There’s a very big difference  because when there is a state-owned Russian asset and we are in a war against Russia  I think it's very reasonable [to confiscate it] ” he says. Komarov adds that it’s also a reasonable approach when considering “private entities directly controlled by Russian individuals.” But he adds: “The biggest difference with VEON is it is an international public entity partially owned and its minority ownership by the structure that is partially owned by a structure that is partially owned by Russian individuals. “And this is where I see the biggest difference  the biggest difference that there is no legitimate  internationally recognized  legitimate way to nationalize  to confiscate such type of assets.”[There could] be a kind of big reputational risk for the Ukrainian government and Ukraine.,neutral,0.14,0.82,0.04,mixed,0.08,0.32,0.6,True,English,"['Kyivstar CEO', 'Telecom Company', 'News', 'Telegram', 'Executive Director European Business Association', 'new British air defense system', 'Ocean Plaza shopping mall', 'largest private infrastructure companies', 'wider international business community', 'Kyivstar CEO Oleksandr Komarov', 'New Drone Destroyer', 'topic Terrahawk Paladin', 'unmanned aerial vehicles', 'less clear cut', '24 million mobile customers', '1 million TV customers', 'various other companies', 'private property rights', 'big reputational risk', 'biggest telecom provider', 'public international entity', 'international public entity', 'Letter One company', 'SBU Telegram channel', 'clear, legitimate way', 'state-owned Russian asset', 'formal court decisions', 'three Russian oligarchs', 'major international investors', 'critical infrastructure', 'numerous companies', 'major company', '1 million households', 'corporate rights', 'asset seizures', 'other businesses', 'private entities', 'legitimate, internationally', 'big difference', 'business interests', 'Russian state', 'Russian owners', 'Russian individuals', 'biggest difference', 'entire week', 'Security Services', 'Ukrainian courts', 'Peter Aven', 'Andrey Kosogov', 'exclusive interview', 'ownership structures', 'six countries', 'essential addition', 'incoming missiles', 'recent move', 'ongoing attempts', 'full-scale invasion', 'last year', 'Such cases', 'third wave', 'controversial cases', 'damage cause', 'The SBU', 'media speculation', 'Anna Derevyanko', 'special attention', 'appropriate conditions', 'reasonable approach', 'minority ownership', 'Ukrainian government', 'VEON company', 'VEON business', 'minority investors', 'investor nerves', 'Kyiv Post', 'Mikhail Fridman', 'Mr. Fridman', 'Kyivstar case', 'car', 'news', 'ripples', 'concern', 'Oct.', 'Ukraine', 'advance', 'understanding', 'announcement', 'NASDAQ', 'Euronext', 'role', 'No.', 'Time', 'Winter', 'attacks', 'part', 'Moscow', 'assets', 'February', 'kind', 'perspective', 'group', 'people', 'order', 'country', 'work', 'rule', 'law', 'war', 'type']",2023-10-13,2023-10-13,kyivpost.com

At constant exchange rates  quarterly sales declined by -13%.In addition to a very high basis for comparison (+36% growth in Q3 2022)  the Group's Q3 performance was impacted by a less buoyant market environment  marked by declining demand and a macroeconomic slowdown. In this context  Access equipment sales were notably affected in France and Asia-Pacific .For the first nine months of 2023  consolidated revenue was €98.8 million  representing total growth of +3% vs. the same period last year  which represented a particularly high basis for comparison (+28% growth). At constant exchange rates  growth was up +4% over the period.Growth of +23% for Optical Transport over nine monthsThe first nine months of 2023 were characterized by the brisk growth in Optical Transport  up +23%  with sales notably doubling in France since the start of the year and increasing by +19% in North America .Sales for Access solutions were down -10% over the period  with a -19% decline in Q3 alone (reminder: H1 2023 sales declined -5%). In addition to an unfavorable basis for comparison (+26% over nine months in 2022)  this decline results from a depressed economic environment  marked by: (i) the slowdown in demand and a growing reluctance among customers to make investments; (ii) more complicated and expensive access to financing for operators; and (iii) cautious inventory management by major operators who had overstocked in response to the electronic components shortage in 2022.Driven by the success of network virtualization solutions and services  Software & Services posted robust Q3 growth (+44%)  accounting for 20% of the Group's total quarterly revenue. As of end-September  Software & Services revenue increased by 13%  representing 15% of the Group's total revenue (vs. 14% a year earlier).Growth of +22% in North America (in US dollars)The first nine months showed +6% growth internationally  and a -3% decline in France . International business accounted for 66% of Ekinops' total revenue  versus 64% a year earlier.North America reported sales of €25.0 million  up +18% Y-o-Y (+22% in USD)  driven by strong demand for Optical Transport equipment. This strategic region now accounts for 26% of Group revenue over the period (vs. 22% one year prior).The EMEA region ( Europe  excluding France  the Middle East and Africa )  representing 39% of Ekinops' revenue  recorded solid growth of +11% over the first nine months  with an increase in all business lines (+7% for Access equipment and +17% for Optical Transport solutions).At end-September 2023  revenue for Asia-Pacific - which remains highly concentrated and reliant on just a few key accounts - was down -64% (reminder: revenue up +36% on the same period last year). Over nine months  the region accounted for 2% of Ekinops' total revenue.Lastly  in its domestic market  sales were down -3% Y-o-Y. In Q3  the downturn was -24% in France (reminder: +59% growth in Q3 2022)  due to large inventories among key accounts for Access equipment  the main source of revenue in this market. Conversely  Optical Transport sustained its vigorous momentum with sales doubling since the beginning of the year. Ekinops generated 34% of its nine-month revenue in France .Didier Brédy  Chairman and CEO of Ekinops  said:""Given last year's particularly challenging comparative figures  Ekinops' third-quarter performance was penalized by the market environment  higher financing costs and large inventories at our operator customers. Our Access activity was impacted by the health of enterprises - our equipment end-users - and therefore by the economic conjuncture. On the other hand  Optical Transport maintained strong momentum  with revenue expected to top our 2023 targets  driven by sustained demand for bandwidth.We remain optimistic for the future as the Group will benefit from the rebound in Access equipment sales as the economy recovers  from the growth of Optical Transport sales which continues to outperform the market  and from Software & Services contribution to revenue.""OutlookIn H2 2023  Ekinops is operating in a complex economic and market environment where visibility is weaker. As a result  and in light of its Q3 performance  Ekinops is adjusting its 2023 guidance as follows:single-digit revenue growth   versus growth of over +12% as previously targeted;  versus growth of over +12% as previously targeted; EBITDA margin between 13% and 17%  versus a previous target range between 15% and 19%.In terms of external growth  Ekinops maintains its ambition to complete a transaction in the months ahead  favoring a non-dilutive source of financing.All press releases are published after Euronext Paris market close.More information on Ekinops website: https://www.ekinops.com/EKINOPS ContactDidier BrédyChairman and CEO[email protected]InvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92[email protected]Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2244617/Ekinops_Q3_2023_results.jpgLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/814911/4335317/Ekinops_Logo.jpgSOURCE Ekinops",neutral,0.03,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.1,0.24,0.66,True,English,"['Ekinops 2023 nine-month revenue', 'less buoyant market environment', 'constant exchange rates', 'cautious inventory management', 'electronic components shortage', 'Didier Brédy', 'challenging comparative figures', 'previous target range', 'network virtualization solutions', 'higher financing costs', 'first nine months', 'Optical Transport equipment', 'Optical Transport solutions', ""Ekinops' third-quarter performance"", 'total quarterly revenue', 'Optical Transport sales', 'Access equipment sales', 'single-digit revenue growth', ""Ekinops' total revenue"", 'robust Q3 growth', 'first 9 months', 'Access solutions', 'telecommunications solutions', 'economic environment', 'equipment end-users', 'quarterly sales', 'expensive access', 'Access activity', 'total growth', 'leading supplier', 'third quarter', 'audited data', 'high basis', 'North America', 'unfavorable basis', 'growing reluctance', 'US dollars', 'International business', 'Middle East', 'business lines', 'key accounts', 'domestic market', 'large inventories', 'main source', 'vigorous momentum', 'economic conjuncture', 'other hand', 'strong momentum', 'complex economic', 'EBITDA margin', 'Q3 performance', 'Q1 revenue', 'Q2 revenue', '9-month revenue', 'consolidated revenue', 'nine-month revenue', 'H1 2023 sales', 'declining demand', 'strong demand', 'sustained demand', 'telecom operators', 'major operators', 'strategic region', 'EMEA region', ""Ekinops' revenue"", 'Euronext Paris', 'macroeconomic slowdown', 'operator customers', 'Services contribution', 'Q3 revenue', 'brisk growth', 'solid growth', 'same period', 'Services revenue', 'last year', 'Group revenue', 'FY 2023 guidance', '36% growth', '28% growth', '+6% growth', '+59% growth', 'PRNewswire', 'enterprises', 'July', 'September', 'IFRS', 'addition', 'comparison', 'context', 'France', 'Asia-Pacific', 'start', 'decline', 'depressed', 'investments', 'complicated', 'response', 'success', 'Software', 'USD', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'increase', 'downturn', 'beginning', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'health', '2023 targets', 'bandwidth', 'future', 'rebound', 'economy', 'Outlook', 'H2', 'visibility', 'result', 'light']",2023-10-06,2023-10-13,finanznachrichten.de
