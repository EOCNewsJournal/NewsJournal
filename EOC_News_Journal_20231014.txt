AFPThe overall cost could rise to as high as $1 trillion  depending on how long the war lasts  its intensity  and its geographic spread  according to independent think tank Council on Foreign Relations.How much of the costs could Russian assets cover?Since the beginning of the war  Washington has confiscated assets used in criminal activity  but the assets in question are a different matter; the US and Western allies have frozen more than $300 billion in Russian central bank foreign currency assets through sanctions.The governments holding these immobilised Russian assets are the ones whose taxpayers have been providing Ukraine with aid packages since the war has started.The question of how to take Russia’s assets  however  is a delicate matter. Some European officials have called for their full seizure  but others have raised serious legal concerns.The assets are legally under Russian ownership  however they are held abroad  with a significant portion in Europe and another at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Europe wants G7 political support for imposing a windfall tax on €200 billion worth of Russian central bank assets in European banks  rather than confiscating the underlying assets themselves.This solution is expected to yield €3 billion in windfall profits.Belgium determined to step upOf the €200 billion held in Europe  around €125 billion is managed by Belgian financial services firm Euroclear.Belgium intends to go ahead and collect €2.3 billion in taxes on the Russian frozen assets and use them to help reconstruct Ukraine  a spokesperson for Belgium's prime minister said on Wednesday.The European Commission said in July it would present a proposal on whether there was a legally sound way to use the funds once the G7 agreed to the measure in principle.If the EU goes ahead with a formal proposal for the windfall option  it would require the backing of all member states before it could be adopted.,neutral,0.05,0.81,0.14,negative,0.03,0.28,0.69,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Ukraine reconstruction', 'G7', 'Russian central bank foreign currency assets', 'US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'massive overnight missile attack', 'independent think tank Council', 'Belgian financial services firm', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Federal Reserve Bank', 'previous joint assessment', 'World Bank Group', 'serious legal concerns', 'World Bank-IMF conference', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'The European Commission', 'G7 political support', 'Foreign Relations', 'Russian assets', 'Russian ownership', 'European officials', 'European banks', 'underlying assets', 'strongest economies', 'extraordinary revenues', 'private entities', 'applicable laws', 'particular clearinghouses', 'United Nations', 'Police expert', 'industrial area', 'Ukrainian capital', 'geographic spread', 'criminal activity', 'different matter', 'Western allies', 'aid packages', 'delicate matter', 'full seizure', 'significant portion', 'New York', 'windfall tax', '€200 billion worth', 'prime minister', 'sound way', 'windfall option', 'member states', 'common statement', 'windfall proceeds', 'war-torn country', 'full-scale invasion', 'windfall profits', 'formal proposal', 'overall cost', 'Ukraine', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'Representatives', 'Marrakech', 'ways', 'reconstruction', 'recovery', 'compliance', 'move', 'funds', 'September', 'Moscow', 'costs', 'damage', 'neighbour', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'dollars', 'sum', 'Government', 'year', '24 February', '2022 GDP', 'Kyiv', 'AFP', 'intensity', 'beginning', 'Washington', 'question', 'sanctions', 'taxpayers', 'others', 'solution', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'taxes', 'spokesperson', 'Wednesday', 'July', 'measure', 'principle', 'backing']",2023-10-13,2023-10-14,euronews.com

The Offer is made to the Shareholders resident in the United States on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other Shareholders to whom an offer is made. Any informational documents  including the Offer Memorandum  are being disseminated to US shareholders on a basis comparable to the method that such documents are provided to the other Shareholders. As permitted under the Tier I Exemption  the Settlement is based on the applicable Dutch law provisions  which differ from the settlement procedures customary in the United States  particularly as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered. The Offer  which is subject to Dutch law  is being made to the US shareholders in accordance with the applicable US securities laws  and applicable exemptions thereunder  in particular the Tier I Exemption. To the extent the Offer is subject to US securities laws  those laws only apply to US shareholders and will not give rise to claims on the part of any other person.

Each Shareholder is urged to consult its independent professional advisors immediately regarding the tax consequences of acceptance or non-acceptance of the Offer. It may be difficult for US Shareholders to enforce their rights and claims arising out of the US federal securities laws  since the Offeror and the Company are located in a country other than the United States  and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of a country other than the United States. US Shareholders may not be able to sue a non-US company or its officers or directors in a non-US court for violations of the US federal securities laws.

Revenue growth over the first 9 months was driven mainly by sales by Spine Innovations  consolidated in July 2022.As announced  third-quarter revenue was automatically impacted by a less favorable impact from change in scope.Sales in Asia amounted to €1.2 million over 9 months (up 34% on the same period in 2022). However  the third quarter saw a slowdown due to temporary problems with the Australian distributor of prosthetic discs and more stringent regulations  particularly in China and Vietnam. Specific sales and marketing initiatives have been implemented for Asia (approval of new products  targeted training initiatives)  which should support sales in this area.Sales continued to grow in Latin America  reaching €2.3 million over the first 9 months (up 8% on the same period in 2022). The region benefited from the first Spine Innovations sales in Mexico and the development of the Mont Blanc range in Chile.Sales in Europe remained solid  increasing by 101% to €3.6 million in the period to end-September.

(“Exor” or the “Company”) announces the results of the Tender Offer set out in the Offer Memorandum published by the Company on 13 September 2023 (the “Offer Memorandum”). The Tender Offer closed at 17:40 CET on 12 October 2023.25 424 248 Ordinary Shares were validly tendered by Qualifying Shareholders in the Tender Offer and  following application of the scaling-down mechanism set out in the Offer Memorandum  8 873 452 Ordinary Shares will be purchased at a price per Ordinary Share of EUR 84.5217  for a total consideration of EUR 750 million. This represents 3.8% of the Ordinary Shares issued in the share capital of Exor. The Strike Price of the Tender Offer  determined in the manner described in the Offer Memorandum is equal to the Reference VWAP.The Tender Offer was oversubscribed  and the aggregate value of the Ordinary Shares validly tendered by Qualifying Shareholders at a price at or below the Strike Price (or as Strike Price Tenders) exceeded EUR 750 million. Because the aggregate number of all Ordinary Shares validly tendered at or below the Strike Price exceeds EUR 750 million  tenders will be accepted as follows  in line with the Offer Memorandum:all tenders at a price below the Strike Price or as Strike Price Tenders will be purchased in full;tenders at the Strike Price will be scaled down by 19.32% so that the total consideration for the Ordinary Shares purchased in the Tender Offer does not exceed EUR 750 million; andall tenders at a price higher than the Strike Price will be rejected and will not be purchased in the Tender Offer.The settlement of the Tender Offer is expected to take place on or around 17 October 2023.Exor will start the process of cancelling the Ordinary Shares acquired as part of the Tender Offer and other 4.1 million Ordinary Shares currently held in treasury  representing 5.6% of the Ordinary Shares issued in the share capital of Exor (the “share cancellation”).In accordance with its Irrevocable Undertaking  2 386 226 Ordinary Shares will be purchased from Giovanni Agnelli B.V. as part of the Tender Offer. After settlement  Giovanni Agnelli B.V. will hold 122 957 146 Ordinary Shares  representing 52.5% of the Ordinary Shares issued in the share capital of the Company before the share cancellation.As previously announced  Exor will complement the Tender Offer with on-market share buybacks on Euronext Amsterdam up to the remainder of the announced €1 billion share buyback program.Terms used but not defined in this announcement have the meaning assigned to them in the Offer Memorandum.About ExorExor N.V.

However  margins on variable costs suffered further erosion during the half-year  hitting a low point as many projects sold in 2021  generating margin erosion  are now delivered.While production remains buoyant  the operating income of this business benefited from slightly lower fixed costs which are the first visible effects of the action plan implemented in 2023 to adjust the cost structure to the expected decrease in production in 2024 and 2025.Real Estate Development revenue is up 16.3% to €36.4 million. Its operating income amounted to €2.0 million. The operating margin stood at 5.5% of revenue  compared to 3.5% in the first half of 2022  indicating effective margin management.Amidst a market downturn  the Land Development business posted revenue of €15.5 million and operating income of €1.6 million  resulting in an operating margin of 10.3%.B2C Renovation posted sustained  profitable growth  with revenue up 6.4% to €28.1 million. Its operating income rose to €2 million  accounting for 7.1% of revenue  compared to 5.3% the previous year  underlining the relevance of its business model  based partly on franchising.Over the first half of 2023  these three diversification sectors brought in €80 million in revenue and generated operating income of €5.6 million  resulting in an operating profit margin of 7%.With a financial loss of -€0.5 million and €5.6 million tax  net income from ongoing operations amounted to €15.4 million  i.e. 2.8% of revenue.The group share of net income amounted to €14.6 million.The financial structure of the group is very strong. The group share of equity at June 30th  2023 amounted to €195.3 million and its cash position stood at €170.0 million. Net cash amounted to €71.5 million.Discontinuation of the B2B renovation business – Judicial liquidation of the L'Atelier des Compagnons subsidiaryThe group confirms its exit from the B2B Renovation business  announced in its press release dated June 9th  2023.The judicial reorganization initiated by the L'Atelier des Compagnons subsidiary on June 13th  2023 has since been converted by the commercial court into a judicial liquidation.Since the group no longer has control over this subsidiary  it is no longer consolidated in the June 30th  2023 financial statements. In accordance with IFRS 5  the B2B Renovation business has been classified as discontinued operations and is recognized under “income from discontinued operations.” Its revenue  as well as its pre-tax gains and losses  do not contribute to the corresponding lines of the consolidated income statement. The 2022 comparative income statement has also been restated.Operations that put margin before volumeAt the end of August 2023  the order intake mirrored the challenging conditions of the real estate market (sharp increase in interest rates and stricter financing terms) as well as the managerial decisions made since March 2022 to:- Accelerate the development of the B2C Renovation business- Maintain the group's financial equilibrium by ensuring strong margins across all its businessesHome Building BusinessIn this context  at the end of August  the Home Building business posted an order intake representing revenue of €398.8 million. This reflects a decrease of 39.8% in value and 44.8% in volume compared to the corresponding period in 2022.With construction costs starting to stabilize in the last two months  the average selling price  which had surged in the past two years  is now rising at a more gradual pace. Over 8 months  it amounted to €166.2k excluding tax compared to €154.5k excluding tax at the end of December 2022.In this challenging market environment  the group expects to increase its market share due to its leading position  its strong financial structure (which attracts customers seeking reliable companies)  its focus on medium to high-end offerings  and its nationwide presence.The current market environment will create opportunities for gaining market shares and progressively taking over construction projects from defaulting builders.Land and Real Estate Development BusinessesAt the end of August 2023  the order book (reserved land for which a deed has not yet been signed) for the Land Development business stood at €16.0 million  representing 204 lots.On the same date  the Real Estate Development business backlog was €137.7 million (including €54 million related to a Hibana program signed in June 2023) and the total potential inventory to be delivered (including projects where a preliminary land deal has been signed) represented 1 870 housing units and potential revenue of €406.4 million. The group remains focused on small and medium-sized projects aimed at first-time homebuyers or large-volume sales. It is also closely monitoring the pre-booking rate.B2C Renovation BusinessThis business continues to grow steadily. At the end of August 2023  “general contractor” order intake amounted to €27.5 million. Order intake from the franchisee network (intermediated revenue) increased by 24.8% to €65.4 million.The growth of this business is expected to pick up speed in the coming months  fueled by rather positive market conditions (government subsidies  increasing energy costs  emerging needs  etc.) and an expansion of the sales network:- Recruitment of new ILLICO Travaux franchisees (160 franchises to date) and CAMIF Habitat (32 franchises to date)- Gradual expansion of the general contractor “renovation/extension” offer in all of the group's construction branches- In the fourth quarter of 2023  creation of a franchise network dedicated to energy renovation under the Rénovert brandA solid foundation for weathering the current crisisFor 2023  the group confirms annual revenue growth (on a like-for-like basis) of between 5% and 7%  with improved operating profitability.In 2024  the group expects market conditions to remain challenging  especially in the first quarter  and confirms a decline in production (around 25 to 30%) that it has been anticipating for several months now.Nevertheless  the group can count on:1. The fundamentals of its business model  which have demonstrated resilience during past crises (high adaptability thanks to significant cost variability  limited inventories  18-month visibility  etc.)2. Its extremely sound financials  which ensure continued trust from all its stakeholders  including customers  suppliers  subcontractors  guarantors  banks  etc.3. Strict oversight of its financial equilibrium (aligning selling prices with inflation  increasing its gross margin  managing working capital  etc.)4. Measures taken as early as 2022 to adapt to the market downturn (group-wide cost-reduction plan  optimization of the sales network  consolidation of structural costs  etc.)5. Opportunities to take over construction sites from defaulting builders.In the current landscape  Hexaom can leverage its top-tier position and quality offering to capture a larger market share in an industry that is trending towards ever more consolidation.Lastly  the group will continue to benefit from the contribution of its diversified Real Estate Development  Land Development and Services businesses  and from an acceleration in the B2C Renovation business.Considering these factors and its solid financial structure  the group's management is confident in its ability to navigate this market cycle and come out even more resilient in all its business lines.Information meeting  October 5th  2023 at 10:00 am via webcast.If you would like to attend this presentation  please send your request to hexaom@edifice-communication.com and you will receive a link to join.Next press release: 2023 Q3 Revenue  November 6 th  2023  after market close.ABOUT THE GROUPSince 1919  five generations of the same family have successively taken over the helm of HEXAOM  a group that drives and federates an ecosystem of 46 brands and subsidiaries with complementary expertise.

Positive results from a Phase 2b study (STREAM-AD) showed that amlitelimab significantly improved signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults whose disease cannot be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical medications are not a recommended treatment approach. These detailed results were presented today as part of a late-breaking session at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 2023 Congress in Berlin. The Phase 3 program for amlitelimab in atopic dermatitis is on track to start in the first half of 2024. This program is part of Sanofi’s immunology strategy built around exploring disruptive mechanisms of action designed to deliver first and best-in-class treatments for people living with chronic inflammatory diseases.In this dose-ranging study  subcutaneous treatment with amlitelimab resulted in statistically significant improvements in the primary endpoint of percent change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score from baseline at 16 weeks compared to placebo for all four doses that were studied. Among these  patients treated with amlitelimab 250 mg Q4W with 500 mg loading dose (LD) had the numerically highest response versus placebo  showing a 61.5% reduction in EASI from baseline at week 16 (P<0.0001) and a 64.4% reduction at week 24 (P<0.0001) vs. 29.4% at week 16 and 27.6% at week 24 for placebo.Professor Stephan Weidinger  M.D  Ph.DDirector  Professor  Chair of Department of Dermatology and Allergy  University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein“These results are exciting news for patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who continue to suffer from symptoms including persistent itch and skin lesions  despite available treatment options. Across all four doses studied  we saw consistent improvements in important signs and symptoms of the disease with an unremarkable safety profile. These data also add to the growing body of evidence that targeting OX40-Ligand potentially stops the inflammatory cascade across multiple pathways resulting in significant benefit for patients.”Across amlitelimab doses  clinically meaningful and nominally significant improvements were seen in all key secondary endpoints at weeks 16 and 24  including Investigator Global Assessment response of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear skin) (IGA 0/1)  75% reduction from baseline in EASI (EASI-75) and weekly average reduction of Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale ≥4 points from baseline (PP-NRS ≥4)  with the exception of the 250 mg (no LD) in IGA 0/1 at Week 16 (p=0.0562).22.1% and 45.5% of patients treated with amlitelimab 250 mg with LD achieved IGA 0/1 at weeks 16 and 24  respectively  compared to 5.1% and 11.4% of placebo patients (P=0.0022 and P<0.0001). Of patients treated with that same dose  40.3% and 54.5% achieved EASI-75 at weeks 16 and 24  respectively  versus 11.4% and 17.7% on placebo (both P<0.0001).Across all doses at weeks 16 and 24  amlitelimab treatment substantially reduced levels of biomarkers elevated in atopic dermatitis  including Th2-related IL-13 and TARC  Th17/Th22-related IL-17A and IL-22  and blood eosinophil counts  with significant reduction observed as early as week 4 in the 250 mg with LD arm.Houman Ashrafian  M.D.  Ph.D.Global Head of Research & Development  Sanofi“The data presented at EADV provide more detailed insight into amlitelimab’s potential as a best-in-class therapy for people with atopic dermatitis. In addition  our ability to pursue a differentiated dosing regimen could be very meaningful to patients. We look forward to initiating a larger Phase 3 development program for amlitelimab in atopic dermatitis in the first half of 2024  which further underscores our commitment to delivering a diverse range of solutions for this chronic condition.”Amlitelimab was well-tolerated in the study across all dose arms and no new safety concerns were identified. The overall rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 67.4% for amlitelimab and 60.3% for placebo. TEAEs more commonly observed with amlitelimab compared to placebo included nasopharyngitis (11.0% amlitelimab  9.0% placebo)  COVID-19 (7.7% amlitelimab  6.4% placebo) and headache (6.1% amlitelimab  2.6% placebo). Worsening of atopic dermatitis was more commonly observed with placebo compared to amlitelimab (38.5% placebo  17.1% amlitelimab). No adverse events such as fever or chills  oral ulcers or imbalances with conjunctivitis were observed across doses.Amlitelimab is a fully human non-depleting monoclonal antibody that binds to OX40-Ligand  a key immune regulator  and has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment for a range of immune-mediated diseases and inflammatory disorders  including moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and asthma. By targeting OX40-Ligand  amlitelimab aims to restore balance between pro-inflammatory and regulatory T cells.Amlitelimab is currently under clinical investigation  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About STREAM-ADSTREAM-AD  a Phase 2b study  is a randomized double-blind  placebo-controlled study  evaluating amlitelimab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease was inadequately controlled with topical therapies or where such therapies were not advisable. This study is designed with two parts and is double-blind through both. The first part is a 24-week treatment period and the second part  which is still ongoing  is a 36-week maintenance/withdrawal period.The primary endpoint is percentage change in EASI from baseline at 16 weeks. Key secondary endpoints include change in EASI from baseline at 24 weeks  percentage of patients with a response of IGA 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear skin) and a reduction from baseline ≥ 2 points at 16 and 24 weeks  percentage of patients with at least a 75% reduction from baseline in EASI at 16 and 24 weeks  and proportion of patients with improvement (reduction) of weekly average of pruritus NRS ≥ 4 with a baseline pruritus of ≥ 4 from baseline at 16 and 24 weeks.In the first part  participants were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous amlitelimab every four weeks or placebo. The doses were: 250 mg with 500 mg loading dose [LD] (n=77)  250 mg without LD (n=78)  125 mg without LD (n=77)  62.5 mg without LD  (n=79) or placebo (n=79).The study enrolled 390 people in Australia  Bulgaria  Canada  Czechia  Germany  Hungary  Japan  Poland  Spain  Taiwan  the United Kingdom and the United States.About Sanofi’s Immunology PipelineThrough world-class R&D and a laser focus on patients  Sanofi discovers  develops and delivers first and best-in-class treatments that improve the lives of people living with chronic inflammatory diseases.

No adverse events such as fever or chills  oral ulcers or imbalances with conjunctivitis were observed across doses.Amlitelimab is a fully human non-depleting monoclonal antibody that binds to OX40-Ligand  a key immune regulator  and has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment for a range of immune-mediated diseases and inflammatory disorders  including moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and asthma. By targeting OX40-Ligand  amlitelimab aims to restore balance between pro-inflammatory and regulatory T cells.Amlitelimab is currently under clinical investigation  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About STREAM-ADSTREAM-AD  a Phase 2b study  is a randomized double-blind  placebo-controlled study  evaluating amlitelimab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease was inadequately controlled with topical therapies or where such therapies were not advisable. This study is designed with two parts and is double-blind through both. The first part is a 24-week treatment period and the second part  which is still ongoing  is a 36-week maintenance/withdrawal period.The primary endpoint is percentage change in EASI from baseline at 16 weeks. Key secondary endpoints include change in EASI from baseline at 24 weeks  percentage of patients with a response of IGA 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear skin) and a reduction from baseline ≥ 2 points at 16 and 24 weeks  percentage of patients with at least a 75% reduction from baseline in EASI at 16 and 24 weeks  and proportion of patients with improvement (reduction) of weekly average of pruritus NRS ≥ 4 with a baseline pruritus of ≥ 4 from baseline at 16 and 24 weeks.In the first part  participants were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous amlitelimab every four weeks or placebo. The doses were: 250 mg with 500 mg loading dose [LD] (n=77)  250 mg without LD (n=78)  125 mg without LD (n=77)  62.5 mg without LD  (n=79) or placebo (n=79).The study enrolled 390 people in Australia  Bulgaria  Canada  Czechia  Germany  Hungary  Japan  Poland  Spain  Taiwan  the United Kingdom and the United States.About Sanofi’s Immunology PipelineThrough world-class R&D and a laser focus on patients  Sanofi discovers  develops and delivers first and best-in-class treatments that improve the lives of people living with chronic inflammatory diseases.

HealthBeacon floated on the stock market in late 2021  raising €25m  with its shares then quoted at just under €6.00. It had a market capitalisation of close to €100m.HealthBeacon has developed a digital health platform aimed at improving patient support and ensuring they adhere to home injection regimes.But the company now faces an uncertain future.It announced earlier this month that it only had about €500 000 of cash left on its books  and that the money was sufficient to let it continue trading until the middle or end of November. It was also engaged in funding talks.“Since the announcement on 5 October 2023  the company has explored various financing options to improve its short term working capital position as well as longer term funding requirements including discussions with key stakeholders and other providers of capital  and explored the potential sale of its business divisions ” a statement from the company said on Friday.But it warned that no alternative financing options have yet been secured and that it’s continuing to pursue possibilities.“Whilst the company has looked to extend its cash runway and has been carefully managing its working capital  the short term working capital position has deteriorated ” it cautioned.Last month  the company told investors that it had a gross funding requirement of about €11m over the next 18 to 24 months.“The board now believes the company only has sufficient cash to continue to trade until the last week of October 2023 ” it said on Friday. “The board now believes the company is in a highly constrained financial position and requires additional financing urgently in order to continue as a going concern. The company continues to explore all options to raise finance and otherwise to maximise the interests of creditors and other stakeholders.”The company had warned investors last month that because of the “scale and complexity” of implementations for its technology across key channels has seen the deployments take nine months longer than previously anticipated.That would delay revenue streams and forced the firm to take steps to manage its cash burn.

The AMF has approved this First Supplement after having verified that the information it contains is complete  coherent and comprehensible. This approval is not favourable opinion on the Issuer and on the quality of the Notes described in this First Supplement. Investors should make their own assessment of the opportunity to invest in such Notes.1.1 RISK FACTORS 1.1.1 In section ""RISK FACTORS"" on pages 15 and 16  risk factor ""Liquidity risks"" is deleted and replaced as follows: Liquidity risks The Issuer's liquidity risk is defined as the risk of not being able to meet its payment obligations under the Notes when they fall due  because of the temporary lags between the amortization profile of its assets and liabilities. A number of exceptional measures taken by governments  central banks and regulators as well as a downgrade in Société Générale group's (including the Issuer  the ""Group"") external rating or in the sovereign rating of the French State could have a significant negative impact on the Issuer's cost of financing  its access to liquidity. Moreover  a lack of liquidity could have a significant negative impact on the Issuer's capacity to repay the Notes on a short-term period. As of 30 June 2023  the maximum exposure of the Issuer for the next 180 days could be estimated up to 2.50 billion euros  representing the maximum cumulated amount of Notes falling due under this period. From a long-term perspective  the negative impact is lowered due to the ability of the Issuer to gather the necessary cash-flows under the collateralised assets. Furthermore  in past crises (such as the 2008 financial crisis  the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis  the tensions on the financial markets linked to the Covid-19 pandemic before the intervention of the central banks or more recently the tensions linked to the crisis in Ukraine)  access to financing from European banks was intermittently restricted or subject to less favorable conditions. If unfavorable debt market conditions were to reappear following a new systemic or Group- specific crisis  the effect on the liquidity of the European financial sector in general could be very significantly unfavorable and could lead to an increase in remuneration for newly issued notes  and thus have a negative impact on the average interest margin between the cover pool assets and the Notes of Société Générale SCF  without affecting its financial situation and its social accounts. In any case  if the Issuer is not able to cover its liquidity needs  the Issuer's ability to make payments under the Notes may be negatively affected. As a result  Noteholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment in the Notes. However  as a specialized credit institution  the Issuer is subject to the production of indicators making it possible to measure  manage and monitor this risk (see section entitled ""Summary of the legislation and regulations relating to sociétés de crédit foncier and other legal issues""). As of 30 June 2023  none of the threshold of these indicators has been triggered. With respect to the liquidity coverage requirements pursuant to the CRD V package (as defined below)  as of 30 June 2023  the Issuer is not obliged to hold stocks of liquid assets to maintain its liquidity coverage ratio (""Liquidity Coverage Ratio"") beyond 100%. Nonetheless  the Issuer's Liquidity Coverage Ratio is structurally higher than 100%. At the date of this Base Prospectus  the Issuer also complies with the minimum requirement of 100% regarding the net stable funding ratio (""Net Stable Funding Ratio""). To finance any temporary liquidity needs  the Issuer also benefits from the ALM management tools and instruments provided to it by the laws and regulations applicable to SCF in order to fund temporary liquidity needs. See section entitled ""Summary of the legislation and regulations relating to SCF and other legal issues"" for the full list of these tools and instruments. 1.1.2 In section ""RISK FACTORS"" on pages 18 to 19  the risk factors under sub-category ""Credit risks"" are deleted and replaced as follows: Credit risks The Issuer is the only entity which has obligations to pay principal and interest in respect of the Notes. The Notes will not be obligations or responsibilities of any other entity  including (but not limited to) Société Générale (in any capacity but in particular in its capacity as Borrower  Collateral Provider  Arranger  Calculation Agent  Dealer  Fiscal Agent  Paying Agent and Principal Paying Agent) or any company within the Group  or the shareholders or directors or agents of any company in the same group of companies as any of them. As of 30 June 2023  the outstanding amount of Notes issued by the Issuer is €12.22 billion (without interest). 3The ability of the Issuer to make payments under the Notes depends on the creditworthiness of its debtors and globally on the credit quality of its assets which consist (i) initially in the loans made available to the Borrower (Société Générale) under the Facility Agreement  and therefore the financial soundness and conduct of the Borrower could adversely affect the Issuer's results of operations and financial position and (ii) following the occurrence of an event of default of the Borrower under the Facility Agreement  in the public exposures transferred (remis en pleine propriété à titre de garantie) as Collateral Security under the Collateral Security Agreement. 3.1.1 Credit risks on Société Générale The Issuer is directly exposed on Société Générale as sole Borrower under the loans granted under the Facility Agreement. However  this credit risk is covered by the transfer of full title by way of assignment (remise en pleine propriété à titre de garantie) of a portfolio of assets that meet regulatory eligibility criteria and the requirement for Société Générale to maintain at any time a minimum level of cover ratio between the public exposures transferred as Collateral Security and the outstanding amount of the loans made available under the Facility Agreement  as specified under the Collateral Security Agreement (see section entitled ""Relationship between Société Générale SCF and Société Générale""). It is worth noting that the Issuer shall maintain at any time a minimum legal cover ratio of 105% and the cover ratio of the Issuer as of 30 June 2023 certified by the Cover Pool Monitor was 135.18%. Failure to maintain compliance with such requirements may result in  if not remedied  a mandatory repayment event under the Facility Agreement and  if Société Générale cannot repay in full the loans granted under the Facility Agreement and the public exposures transferred as Collateral Security are not sufficient to pay in full the amounts payable under the Notes  the Issuer may have insufficient funds to meet its obligations under the Notes. As a result  Noteholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment in the Notes. 3.1.2 Credit risks on the assets of the Issuer Debtors' ability to pay following enforcement of the Collateral Security The debtors are either public entities or private entities whose obligations are secured by public entities complying with the eligibility criteria provided for by Article L.513-4 of the French Monetary and Financial Code. Therefore  the Issuer may be exposed to the occurrence of credit risk in relation to the debtors. As of 30 June 2023  the public exposures transferred (remis en pleine propriété à titre de garantie) as Collateral Security amounted to €16 568.6 million and were mainly constituted of loans to French local authorities. If following enforcement of the Collateral Security pursuant to the Collateral Security Agreements  the Issuer does not receive the full amount due from such debtors  or as the case may be  by their guarantors  in respect of such public entities' exposures  this may affect the ability of the Issuer to make payments under the Notes. None of the Borrower under the Facility Agreement  the Issuer or any other party to the Programme does guarantee or warrant full and timely payment by the debtors of any sums payable under such public entities' exposures. As a result  the Issuer's ability to meet its obligations under the Notes may be materially adversely affected. However  this risk can be assessed as relatively low as all public exposures of the Collateral Security fall into the investment grade category with more than 81% of the Collateral Security being exposed to French sovereign risk and for which observed loss rate is close to zero  as of the date of the Base Prospectus. No prior notification to debtors under the public exposures transferred as Collateral Security The Collateral Security Agreement will provide that the relevant public exposures will be transferred (remis en pleine propriété à titre de garantie) as Collateral Security pursuant to the provisions of Article L.211-38 of the French Monetary and Financial Code  without notification or information of the debtors under such public exposures. Such debtors will only be notified in case of enforcement of the Collateral Security by the Issuer. As long as no such notification has taken place  any payments made by the debtors under the relevant public exposures will continue to be validly made by such debtors to Société Générale. Each debtor may further raise defences (which may include  as applicable  any set-off right) against the Issuer arising from such debtor's relationship with its creditor to the extent that such defences (i) are existing prior to the notification of the transfer of the relevant public exposures or (ii) arise out of mutual claims (compensation de créances connexes) between the debtor and its creditor which are closely connected with that public exposures (irrespective of whether such notification has been made before or after such claims have arisen). 4",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.1,0.16,0.74,True,English,"['Societe Generale', 'First Supplement', 'Base Prospectus', 'SCF', '12 October', '11:05', 'SOCIÉTÉ GÉNÉRALE SCF', '20,000,000,000 Euro Medium Term Note Programme', 'Obligations Foncières FIRST SUPPLEMENT', 'des marchés financiers', 'Eurozone sovereign debt crisis', '2022 half year financial statements', 'other significant new factor', 'Luxembourg Stock Exchange', 'significant negative impact', 'two (2) working days', 'maximum cumulated amount', 'Group"") external rating', 'The Base Prospectus', '2008 financial crisis', 'payment obligations', 'sovereign rating', 'MARCHES FINANCIERS', 'risk factor', 'other statement', 'maximum exposure', 'next 180 days', 'same meaning', 'competent authority', 'material mistake', 'material inaccuracy', 'Authorised Offeror', 'Euronext Paris', 'favourable opinion', 'temporary lags', 'amortization profile', 'exceptional measures', 'central banks', 'French State', '2.50 billion euros', 'long-term perspective', 'necessary cash-flows', 'past crises', 'Prospectus Regulation', 'offer period', 'regulated market', 'short-term period', 'Liquidity risks', 'Final Terms', 'collateralised assets', 'The AMF', 'approval number', 'issue', 'AUGUST', 'conjunction', 'visa', 'respect', 'purpose', 'article', 'Application', 'standards', 'completeness', 'comprehensibility', 'consistency', 'endorsement', 'quality', 'Notes', 'Investors', 'assessment', 'suitability', 'information', 'case', 'publication', 'extent', 'reference', 'accordance', 'applicable', 'right', 'acceptances', 'closing', 'delivery', 'withdrawal', 'websites', 'AUTORITE', '12 October', 'capacity', 'opportunity', 'section', 'pages', 'liabilities', 'governments', 'regulators', 'downgrade', 'cost', 'financing', 'access', 'lack', '30 June', 'tensions', '1.1']",2023-10-13,2023-10-14,marketscreener.com
