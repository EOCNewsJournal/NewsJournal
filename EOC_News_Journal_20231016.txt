31397,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.boersen-zeitung.de/english/overdue-reaction,Overdue reaction,Deutsche Börse is launching a new consultation with market participants to consider raising the cap limit in the DAX from 10% to 15%. This is the right move  and it is also long overdue.,Surprisingly  it took a long time for the exchange to address one of the central reasons for this delisting  namely the cap limit in the DAX. By capping the weighting of heavyweight stocks in the index at a maximum of 10%  investors following the index are indirectly forced to repeatedly sell shares of growing giants since their index weight is trimmed if it exceeds the 10% threshold – and index trackers must follow suit. In the past ten years  this has happened a whopping 38 times with four companies. It's understandable that this index requirement infuriated Linde's management and was a reason for the company's shift away from the trading floor in Frankfurt. It could also make companies like SAP  Allianz  Siemens  or Deutsche Telekom rethink their strategies in the medium term.,negative,0.05,0.29,0.65,negative,0.02,0.27,0.71,True,English,"['Overdue reaction', 'past ten years', 'long time', 'central reasons', 'cap limit', 'heavyweight stocks', 'growing giants', 'trading floor', 'Deutsche Telekom', 'medium term', 'index weight', 'index trackers', 'index requirement', 'four companies', 'exchange', 'delisting', 'DAX', 'weighting', 'maximum', 'investors', 'shares', '10% threshold', 'suit', 'Linde', 'management', 'company', 'Frankfurt', 'SAP', 'Allianz', 'Siemens', 'strategies']",2023-10-16,2023-10-16,boersen-zeitung.de

The report also sheds light on the challenges faced by firms across the Asia-Pacific region and embarks on an exploration of how technology can be used to foster engagement  improve work-life balance  and drive revenue growth.More than 600 firms across Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) and the South East Asia (SEA) region participated in the survey  conducted by Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting (TAA) Asia Pacific APAC. The top three strategic goals of all firms across the APAC regions surveyed are: revenue growth  improving workflow standardizing processes and improving employee effectiveness.Survey highlights include:Almost 70 percent of those firms who consider themselves to be innovators and digital leaders are now on the cloud for all solutions  compared with only 41 percent of those firms who consider themselves to be mainstream or conservative in their adoption of technology.80 percent of firms expecting low or no financial growth in the 2024 financial year consider themselves to be mainstream or lagging in technology uptake.51 percent of ANZ firms and 59 percent of SEA firms look to advancements in technology to protect sensitive data; however  74 percent of SEA firms and 79 percent of ANZ firms are still sharing information with clients via email with attached links  resulting in significant vulnerability for firms who are already at heightened risk of cyber-attack.77 percent of firms report an increased demand for advisory services over the last 12 - 24 months; this compares to last year’s findings  where only 40 percent of respondents saw this level of increased demand.65 percent of firms that expect high financial growth are relying on technology to help attract and retain clients and increase service offerings.Izzy Silva  Wolters Kluwer Tax and Accounting APAC Managing Director  said: “The 2023 Accounting Industry Survey results reinforce that the adoption of technology and cloud-based solutions that improve workflows and employee effectiveness will continue to be key for accounting firms seeking to achieve their strategic goals. While sustainable revenue growth remains key for firms across the region  finding solutions that create the capacity to enable this growth is critical.”Survey says innovative firms continue to lead the wayThe survey also found that firms expecting high financial growth this year fully embrace the cloud  with 73 percent already using cloud-based solutions for all their needs  compared to 54 percent of all surveyed. Embracing technology and staying ahead of the curve will be vital for firms aiming to maintain a competitive edge.While innovative firms are experiencing positive benefits from their adoption of cloud solutions  there are still further efficiencies to be gained. Rakesh Naidu  Wolters Kluwer Tax and Accounting APAC Head of Product  said:“By embracing tools early on and finding innovative ways to leverage their capabilities  firms can create exceptional value for their clients. Across Asia Pacific  Wolters Kluwer inspires productivity  innovation and collaboration through CCH iFirm solutions  as well as leading knowledge solutions such as CCH iKnow.”About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG.

Its shares have tanked since then  with its market capitalisation now just €1.2m.HealthBeacon has developed a digital health platform aimed at improving patient support and ensuring they adhere to home injection regimes.It announced earlier this month that it only had about €500 000 of cash left on its books  and that the money was sufficient to let it continue trading until the middle or end of November.
