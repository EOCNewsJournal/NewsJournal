31411,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wisdomtree-launches-us-multi-asset-190019992.html,WisdomTree Launches US Multi-Asset ETF in Europe,WisdomTree has launched a multi-asset ETF that offers alternative exposure to the traditional 60/40 portfolio via a basket of U.S. equities and Treasury futures. The WisdomTree US Efficient Core UCITS ETF (NTSX) is listed on the London Stock Exchange  Deutsche Boerse and Euronext Milan with a total expense ratio of 0.20%.,WisdomTree has launched a multi-asset ETF that offers alternative exposure to the traditional 60/40 portfolio via a basket of U.S. equities and Treasury futures.The WisdomTree US Efficient Core UCITS ETF (NTSX) is listed on the London Stock Exchange  Deutsche Boerse and Euronext Milan with a total expense ratio of 0.20%.NTSX is self-indexed and aims to deliver up to 90% exposure to U.S. large caps and 60% to U.S. Treasury futures in a bid to provide a “more capital-efficient alternative to the traditional 60/40 portfolio”.The asset manager said the exchange-traded fund is a leveraged version of the 60/40 portfolio  allowing investors to receive a similar level of volatility as a 100% equity portfolio but with a better Sharpe ratio than a traditional allocation.The U.S. equity bucket will be selected from the 500 largest companies by market capitalization with an added ESG  or environmental  social and governance  screen.The 60% U.S. Treasury futures exposure is then overlaid on top  with the remaining 10% of the portfolio used as cash for the futures collateral.According to WisdomTree  the futures portfolio comprises five equally weighted U.S. Treasury futures contracts with maturities of two to 30 years that are rebalanced quarterly.The fund is already listed in the U.S. and has amassed $825 million since it launched in 2018.Diversification Beyond All Equities“We believe investors can look at this ETF as a core U.S. equity replacement. NTSX can provide greater return enhancement  risk management and diversification potential versus a 100% equity portfolio ” Pierre Debru  head of quantitative research and multi-asset solutions at WisdomTree  said.“It may have similar volatility to a 100% equity allocation over market cycles  but our research shows it can help reduce drawdowns and potentially provide higher risk-adjusted returns too ” he added.He also said the fund could also be used to replace a combination of stocks and bonds to “free up space for allocations to other diversifiers and alternative strategies.”Story continuesAlexis Marinof  head of Europe at WisdomTree  said: “NTSX can help investors create optimal portfolio blends and magnify portfolio exposures through the same concept that drives their asset allocation.”In August  WisdomTree expanded its range of short and leveraged ETFs after it unveiled the WisdomTree CAC 40 3x Daily Leveraged (3CAC) and WisdomTree CAC 40 3x Daily Short (3CAS).A month earlier  it closed three fixed-income ETFs due to low demand.ETFS Capital  etf.com’s parent company  owns 10.2% of WisdomTree’s shares outstanding.Permalink | © Copyright 2023 etf.com.

This situation arises despite a previous SPAC merger with Vistas Media Acquisition Company and a recent injection of a $5 million investment from SRMG Ventures.The company  which was initially valued at over $500 million following its 2022 SPAC merger  has violated Nasdaq's ""continued listing requirements"" due to its share price falling below $1 for 30 consecutive business days. In response to this challenge  Anghami may possibly implement a reverse share split to regain compliance by April 2nd  2024 if it fails to maintain a closing price of over $1 each for ten consecutive trading days.This news comes in spite of Anghami's full-year 2022 report showing positive financial growth  with a 35.6% YoY revenue increase and an uptick in paying subscribers to 1.52 million out of its 120 million users across 16 MENA countries. The Q1 2023 gross profit margin stood at 23%  contributing to a $3.1 million YoY EBITDA increase.In order to navigate these challenges  Anghami has implemented cost-cutting measures including reducing its workforce by 22% and decreasing cloud computing expenses by 19%. Co-founder Elie Habib denied rumors of delisting from NASDAQ to list on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange in 2023.Despite rumors of a potential acquisition by Spotify (NYSE: )  no deal has been made so far. In 2022  Anghami acquired live events company Spotlight but also laid off 22 percent of its staff. Meanwhile  Deezer  another streaming service owned by Access Industries and listed on Euronext Paris following its own SPAC merger  has been grappling with subscriber and stock-price issues  with shares recently closing at €2.64 each.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Insurance contracts in Europe and credit card issuance in Spain spearheaded this upswing.However  the number of unique users engaging with the registered email service decreased by 18% to 1 653  compared to the same period last year. Traffic was largely driven by notifications related to infrastructure services and insurance.In September alone  the throughput for registered email exceeded 426 000  averaging around 258 messages sent per user per month.There was a minor decrease in registered SMS traffic compared to Q2 2022  primarily used by insurance and utilities companies in Europe.

Engaged with operations  hands-on  and deeply understanding and leveraging Aramis Group’s culture  they are both highly talented individuals who have significantly contributed to the Group’s development since joining. Their promotion aligns perfectly with our values and leadership principles which favor the daily development of our teams and internal promotion.”Fabien Geerolf joined Aramisauto  the Group’s subsidiary in France  as CFO over two years ago  while the company was heading towards an unprecedented market environment (sudden decline in the pre-registered car market and massive inflation in the used car one). Owing to his expertise and leadership skills  and in collaboration with Romain Boscher  CEO of Aramisauto  and the rest of the French management team  Fabien managed to steer Aramisauto in the right direction  all the while keeping Aramis Group’s top objective in sight: to delight its customers with an unparalleled offer of cars and services. Fabien  37  graduated from HEC. Before joining Aramisauto  he had held CFO positions for 5 years  including a two-year stint as CFO for Safran - Aircraft Interior's German division.

Over the years  Ivan demonstrated his proficiency in leading major transformational projects efficiently and with a team-oriented approach. He also demonstrated his ability to integrate technological strategies with business goals  without losing sight of Aramis Group’s emphasis on customer satisfaction. In his new role as Group CTO  Ivan’s primary mission is to accelerate the convergence of Aramis Group’s IT platforms across its six local subsidiaries. He will lead the development of central tools  tailored to support the needs of local teams. By building effective and sophisticated business solutions that improve the daily experience of both Aramis Group’s customers and teams  he will assist the Group to further innovate  fuel its profitable growth  and consolidate its leadership in the digital automotive industry.

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALTME)  a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME)  announces the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) has published an abstract on the ongoing NOX-A12 GLORIA Phase 1/2 trial in first-line brain cancer (glioblastoma). The data will be presented in an oral presentation at the ESMO Congress by Dr. Julian Layer  one of the investigators of the GLORIA trial  on Saturday  October 21  2023  starting at 11:15 a.m. CEST in Madrid  Spain. The abstract highlights an in-depth analysis of how the combination of radiotherapy and the CXCL12 inhibitor NOX-A12 remodels the immune tumor microenvironment in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Results from matched pre- and post-treatment analysis of tumor tissue from the GLORIA trial support the modes of action of treatment with radiotherapy and NOX-A12 (1) to counteract vasculogenesis  i.e. the de novo creation of blood vessels from bone marrow-derived cells after radiotherapy  and (2) to modulate the tumor immune microenvironment leading to proliferation and clustering of cytotoxic T cells in tumor tissue. Details of the oral presentation at the ESMO Congress 2023 are as follows: Title: Spatial remodeling of the immune tumor microenvironment after radiotherapy of CXCL12 inhibition in glioblastoma in the Phase 1/2 GLORIA trial Speaker:Dr. Julian Layer University of Bonn  Germany Session: Mini Oral 508MO Lecture Time and Date: 11:15-11:20 a.m. CEST  Saturday  October 21  2023 The full abstract is available online via the ESMO Congress websiteand the TME Pharmawebsite.

The company's oncology-focusedpipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-linedata from the NOX-A12three dose-escalationcohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12 radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-linedata with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in combination with Merck's Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-linetherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Prodways Group's business was notably penalized by the weakness in printer deliveries  which had been anticipated for several months  in addition to an unfavorable economic situation that impacted short-cycle activities  particularly print-on-demand services. Overall  over the first 9 months of the year  Prodways Group's revenues are relatively stable  supported by the resilience of the medical sector  particularly for sales of 3D Materials and Audiology  two high value-added activities.Revenue by division(€ million) Q3 2023 Q3 2022 Change (%) Organic change (%) 9 months 2023 9 months 2022 Change (%) Organic change (%) Systems 8 4 9 2 -8% -8% 32 5 35 8 -9% -9% Products 7 5 8 0 -6% -6% 26 6 23 3 +14% +5% Structure & Intra-Group Eliminations -0 1 0 0 n.a n.a -0 2 -0 2 n.a n.a Consolidated revenue 15 9 17 2 -8% -8% 58 9 58 8 +0% -3%Division Systems: Solid recurring revenues but few new printer deliveriesRevenues from the Systems division (which includes sales of 3D printers  3D Materials and 3D Software) decreased by 8% this quarter compared to the 3rd quarter 2022. The increase in sales of 3D materials continues to support the business  including through significant order intake for 2024. On the other hand  shipments of new 3D printers remain low  as anticipated by the group earlier this year. Finally  regarding sales of 3D Software  commercial activity in the quarter was good and allowed Prodways to win new customers. The sustained growth in SaaS sales is driving the activity but has the effect of smoothing out revenues over time.Products Division: a difficult economic environmentThe Products division includes Digital Manufacturing (print-on-demand services) and Integrated Businesses (mainly the manufacture of custom parts for audiology). This division has been on a positive trajectory since the beginning of the year  with growth of +14% over the first nine months (including +5% organic) but is affected by the slowdown in economic activity in the third quarter.In Digital Manufacturing  the slowdown in orders from our industrial customers in France was partially offset by the dynamism of activity in Germany  driven by several recurring series production projects.In audiology  sales remain resilient  demonstrating the attractiveness of this high value-added sector  in which Prodways strengthened its position in 2022. Since the start of the year  growth in this business has been underpinned by orders for custom-made noise protection (both for industrial and private customers)  whose effectiveness compared with traditional noise plugs has been proven beyond doubt.Outlook & GuidanceThe slowdown in business in the third quarter of 2023 makes the achievement of the 2023 guidance uncertain. As a reminder  this guidance was ""around +5% sales growth and ""around 8% current EBITDA margin"". Prodways Group remains determined to navigate this demanding economic environment with prudence and perseverance. The company continues to adapt to market challenges while investing in innovation and improvement of its products and services in order to maintain its position as a reference player on the 3D printing market.About Prodways GroupProdways Group is a specialist in industrial and professional 3D printing with a unique positioning as an integrated European player.

The other offer concerns the purchase of all PXT3003 intellectual property and related contracts  for a worldwide exploitation except for China (see below).In both cases  the estimated total lower value  including revenues indexed to sales of the future drug  is higher than €250m. Initial payments  staggered from signature of the definitive agreement to market authorization  represent at least €60m. The balance will be paid once marketing authorization is obtained. Depending on the various projections of future revenues from drug sales  total revenues could reach between €250m and up to €800m for Pharnext over the duration of the rights.As a reminder  these potential agreements would complement the licensing agreement already signed in 2017 granting GeneNet (a research and development joint venture controlled by Tasly Pharmaceutical and owned 30% by Pharnext) with the commercialization rights for PXT3003 in CMT1A in Greater China (Mainland China  Hong Kong  Taiwan and Macau)  and already generated an investment of €30m by Tasly in Pharnext.These two binding offers received by Pharnext represent a critical step in the development and commercialization of this promising drug candidate. The names of the parties involved and financial details remain confidential for the time being. In line with the announced process  Pharnext is currently reviewing the offers received and intend to select a potential partner with a view to signing a definitive agreement by the end of October.The signature of such agreements could cover Pharnext's financing needs  and thus terminate the OCEANE-BSA financing line subscribed by Global Tech Opportunities 13. Pharnext will communicate on the progress of this final phase as soon as possible.In addition  in order to cover its short-term financing needs and secure the valuation process for its main asset  Pharnext announces that it has asked and obtained GTO 13's agreement to subscribe to additional financing of €2.5m over the next few days by issuing OCEANE-BSA bonds. This additional financing will be announced through usual press releases when drawings are effected.Hugo Brugière  Manager of Pharnext  said: “It's a tremendous victory for ambition over pessimism. No one gave us much hope of success when we took over the company in 2022  and even less so when we announced that we would reveal its full value potential in early 2023. Today  after months of thorough analysis of our available data by candidate companies  and before the read-out of top-line results of the Phase III clinical study  we received bids valuing our asset at over a quarter billion euros. We are therefore serene and enthusiastic as we analyze the best options cyrstalize the offers.”About Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A (‘CMT1A')Charcot-Marie-Tooth (‘CMT') disease encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited  severe  debilitating  progressive and chronic peripheral neuropathies. CMT1A  the most common type of CMT  is an orphan disease with a prevalence of 1/5000 people affecting about 150 000 people in Europe and the U.S. and about 1 500 000 people worldwide. The genetic mutation responsible for CMT1A is a duplication of the PMP22 gene coding for a peripheral myelin protein. The duplication of this gene results in overexpression of the PMP22 protein and failure of Schwann cells to produce normal myelin (neuronal sheath). The lack of a normal myelin structure and function leads to abnormal peripheral nerve conduction and axonal loss. As a result of peripheral nerve degradation  patients suffer from progressive muscle atrophy in both the legs and arms causing problems with walking  running and balance as well as abnormal hand functioning. They might also suffer from mild to moderate sensory disorders. First symptoms usually appear during adolescence and will progressively evolve throughout life. Patients with the most severe form of CMT1A end up in wheelchairs  representing at least 5% of cases. To date  no curative or symptomatic medications have been approved and treatment consists of supportive care such as orthotics  leg braces  physical and occupational therapy or surgery.

Pharnext has a first-in-class drug candidate  PXT3003  in development for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)  a rare  debilitating  inherited peripheral neuropathy. PXT3003 benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. In 2018  PXT3003 completed a Phase III clinical trial  the PLEO-CMT trial  with encouraging topline results. This trial was followed by an open-label extension study  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial  with 120 patients continuing treatment with PXT3003. Long-term data suggest a sustained benefit  safety  and efficacy  after 6 years of total trial time. An international pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003  the PREMIER trial  enrolling 387 CMT1A patients was completed in August 2023. PREMIER topline results are expected in Q4 2023. PXT3003 originated from the Pleotherapy™ R&D approach. Pharnext draws the attention of investors to the financial and other risk factors detailed in its financial reports.

Moreover  other operating expenses rose 23.5% to €5.3 million  reflecting the increase in subcontracting commitments along with marketing and publishing costs to support games sales.As a result  operating EBITDA including tax credits (French and Canadian) amounted to €1.1 million in H1 2023  down €0.8 million versus H1 2022.After depreciation  amortization  and provisions (€(0.5) million) and deferred taxes (€(0.2) million)  operating EBIT including tax credits amounted to €0.4 million in H1 2023 versus €1.9 million the previous year.The Group posted a €1.3 million non-recurring expense in H1 2023  compared to a €0.5 million expense the previous year. The company has strategically redirected certain assets in the pre-production phase  developed within the Paris studio. This realignment resulted in the withdrawal of a portion of the asset not in line with the new development priorities  amounting to €1.4 million.Finally  DON'T NOD posted a €0.9 million net loss Group share in H1 2023  compared to net income Group share of €1.7 million in H1 2022.A strengthened financial structureASSETS 31/12/2022 30/06/2023 EQUITY & LIABILITIES 31/12/2022 30/06/2023 Fixed assets 52 974 65 153 Shareholders' equity 88 073 132 631 Inventories & work in progress - - Provisions 2 286 2 264 Trade receivables 3 538 3 599 Borrowings 4 324 3 688 Other receivables 8 814 12 266 Trade payables 1 498 2 064 Cash & cash equivalent 34 907 64 227 Other payables 4 052 4 597 TOTAL 100 233 145 244 TOTAL 100 233 145 244In H1 2023  DON'T NOD generated positive gross operating cash flow of €1.4 million versus €2.2 million in H1 2022.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYIncluding the dividend to be paid in October (record date in September)  Volta Finance posted another positive monthly performance in September 2023 (+1.6%) and has now delivered a YTD performance of 18.6%.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** performed as follows: +0.7% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +3.7% for CLO Equity tranches  -1.4% for CLO Debt tranches and -0.1% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS. This month  being long USD against Euro provided circa +0.5% of performance.September recorded another strong month for leveraged loans with US and European markets moving up again (ELLI was up 1.1% while US LLI was up c.1.0% according to Pitchbook LCD) even though some market softness started to show at the end of the month alongside other credit markets. This impacted some of our US CLO debt exposures that were marked lower at the end of the month.In terms of cashflows  Volta received €0.8m of distributions through the month  and a cumulative total of €25.8m in cashflow generation over the last 6 months. In addition  Volta received some principal repayments from one Bank Balance Sheet transaction for €1.5m reducing further the Bank Balance Sheet exposure to 1.8%.Regarding the European warehouse exposure  we can report that the CLO priced in September and is expected to close in November. The warehouse IRR is expected to be above 20% and Volta is rolling its current exposure into the CLO Equity and the CLO single B tranche. Overall  we expect over 15% IRR from the blended investment.Through the month  we also partially sold 2 US CLO debts and opened another US warehouse to be able to benefit from market volatility.As of end of September 2023  Volta’s NAV was €238.3m  i.e. €6.51 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 1.48% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.08% as at 31 July 2023  0.40% as at 30 June 2023.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

The Idylla™ PIK3CA- AKT1 Mutation Assay  which was developed in collaboration with LifeArc  covers the entire process from FFPE sample to result  including fully integrated sample preparation  liberation of nucleic acids  real-time PCR amplification and detection  and data analysis. With a turnaround time of approximately 150 minutes  the Assay provides a rapid actionable solution which can be seamlessly integrated into virtually any laboratory workflow.The APIS Breast Cancer Subtyping Kit (RUO1) is a gene expression assay based on a real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The kit detects and enables relative gene expression quantification of ten human mRNA target genes extracted from formalin-fixed  paraffin embedded (FFPE) pre-operative core needle biopsies (CNB) or FFPE resected breast tumour tissue. The manual kit will be distributed by Biocartis in selected European countries ahead of an Idylla™ version of the assay becoming available. While the manual kit already offers a reduced time for results interpretation (as compared to current IHC2 based workflows)  the future Idylla™ version of the Breast Cancer Subtyping Assay will further benefit from the workflow and decentralization advantages of the Idylla™ Platform.The APIS ESR1 Mutations Kit (RUO1) is an advanced real-time PCR assay for the sensitive and precise detection of mutations within the estrogen receptor gene. The kit detects eleven ESR1 mutations in circulating free DNA from plasma samples. Biocartis will distribute the manual kit via its commercial network with an initial focus on Europe and will explore  together with APIS  the opportunity of also developing a fully automated version of the APIS ESR1 Mutations Kit on the Idylla™ Platform.Roger Moody  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “With 1 in 8 women diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime  it is important to us to deliver continuous improvements in patient care during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. While we have seen marked improvements in outcomes for early detected breast cancer  metastatic breast cancer remains a significant challenge. I am very pleased that Biocartis can contribute to the further research of this important disease by launching three new biomarker assays at once. We are fortunate to collaborate with APIS to make these innovative products available to our customers.”Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women  accounting for 11.7% of all cancer cases globally. Annually  it is estimated that there are over 2.3 million new cases of breast cancer worldwide.3 Despite recent advances in treatment strategies leading to improved survival  metastatic breast cancer remains largely incurable and is responsible for over 600 000 deaths annually worldwide.4 5 The American Cancer Society reports a five-year survival rate of 99% for localized breast cancer and only 27% for breast cancers with distant metastases2.Invasive breast cancer is classified into distinct categories with differing tumor behavior and prognosis.6 Based on the expression of hormone receptors that are present in breast cancer cells (HER2  ER  PR)7 and a proliferation marker (Ki67)8   the main molecular subtypes of invasive breast cancer can be distinguished.9 10 The presence or absence of these markers can guide patient management. The detection of these markers is routinely performed with IHC. The APIS Breast Cancer Subtyping Kit aims to address a number of unmet needs in the current practice  including improving reproducibility and accuracy in the Ki67 proliferation measurement  assessing low HER2 expression status and offering faster subtyping as compared to IHC.The most common breast cancer subtype is Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer and endocrine therapy is the main therapeutic option for this group. While endocrine therapy is effective  as cancer progresses  many tumors  eventually become resistant.11 Mutations in the estrogen receptor (ESR1) gene are a common mechanism of endocrine resistance12 13 and are associated with a shorter progression-free survival.14 New therapeutic options are becoming available that have the potential to overcome ESR1 mutation-mediated resistance.15 ESR1 mutation monitoring has the potential for playing a key role in monitoring disease progression and appearance of resistance in breast cancer patients receiving endocrine therapy.16 17 Further research is  however  needed to better understand the potential value of ESR1 mutations monitoring and the APIS ESR1 Mutations Kit aims to be a valuable tool to support such research.The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is an important cell signaling pathway with an important role in cell growth  proliferation  survival  and metabolism.18 In breast cancer this pathway is deregulated in as much as 40% of hormone receptor-positive  HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients. A common mechanism of such deregulation are somatic mutations in the PIK3CA or AKT1 genes. New therapeutic options are becoming available that target mutated PIK3CA or AKT119 20 and require new tools to aid in the sensitive detection of relevant gene mutations. The Idylla™ PIK3CA-AKT1 Mutation Assay aims to offer a sensitive  rapid and easy-to-use tool to further study the role of PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations in metastatic breast cancer.--- END ---More information:Investor Relations Biocartise-mail ir@biocartis.comAbout BiocartisWith its revolutionary and proprietary Idylla™ Platform  Biocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) aspires to enable personalized medicine for patients around the world through universal access to molecular testing  by making molecular testing actionable  convenient  fast and suitable for any lab.

The Idylla™ PIK3CA- AKT1 Mutation Assay  which was developed in collaboration with LifeArc  covers the entire process from FFPE sample to result  including fully integrated sample preparation  liberation of nucleic acids  real-time PCR amplification and detection  and data analysis. With a turnaround time of approximately 150 minutes  the Assay provides a rapid actionable solution which can be seamlessly integrated into virtually any laboratory workflow.The APIS Breast Cancer Subtyping Kit (RUO1) is a gene expression assay based on a real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The kit detects and enables relative gene expression quantification of ten human mRNA target genes extracted from formalin-fixed  paraffin embedded (FFPE) pre-operative core needle biopsies (CNB) or FFPE resected breast tumour tissue. The manual kit will be distributed by Biocartis in selected European countries ahead of an Idylla™ version of the assay becoming available. While the manual kit already offers a reduced time for results interpretation (as compared to current IHC2 based workflows)  the future Idylla™ version of the Breast Cancer Subtyping Assay will further benefit from the workflow and decentralization advantages of the Idylla™ Platform.The APIS ESR1 Mutations Kit (RUO1) is an advanced real-time PCR assay for the sensitive and precise detection of mutations within the estrogen receptor gene. The kit detects eleven ESR1 mutations in circulating free DNA from plasma samples. Biocartis will distribute the manual kit via its commercial network with an initial focus on Europe and will explore  together with APIS  the opportunity of also developing a fully automated version of the APIS ESR1 Mutations Kit on the Idylla™ Platform.Roger Moody  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “With 1 in 8 women diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime  it is important to us to deliver continuous improvements in patient care during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. While we have seen marked improvements in outcomes for early detected breast cancer  metastatic breast cancer remains a significant challenge. I am very pleased that Biocartis can contribute to the further research of this important disease by launching three new biomarker assays at once. We are fortunate to collaborate with APIS to make these innovative products available to our customers.”Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women  accounting for 11.7% of all cancer cases globally. Annually  it is estimated that there are over 2.3 million new cases of breast cancer worldwide.3 Despite recent advances in treatment strategies leading to improved survival  metastatic breast cancer remains largely incurable and is responsible for over 600 000 deaths annually worldwide.4 5 The American Cancer Society reports a five-year survival rate of 99% for localized breast cancer and only 27% for breast cancers with distant metastases2.Invasive breast cancer is classified into distinct categories with differing tumor behavior and prognosis.6 Based on the expression of hormone receptors that are present in breast cancer cells (HER2  ER  PR)7 and a proliferation marker (Ki67)8   the main molecular subtypes of invasive breast cancer can be distinguished.9 10 The presence or absence of these markers can guide patient management. The detection of these markers is routinely performed with IHC. The APIS Breast Cancer Subtyping Kit aims to address a number of unmet needs in the current practice  including improving reproducibility and accuracy in the Ki67 proliferation measurement  assessing low HER2 expression status and offering faster subtyping as compared to IHC.The most common breast cancer subtype is Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer and endocrine therapy is the main therapeutic option for this group. While endocrine therapy is effective  as cancer progresses  many tumors  eventually become resistant.11 Mutations in the estrogen receptor (ESR1) gene are a common mechanism of endocrine resistance12 13 and are associated with a shorter progression-free survival.14 New therapeutic options are becoming available that have the potential to overcome ESR1 mutation-mediated resistance.15 ESR1 mutation monitoring has the potential for playing a key role in monitoring disease progression and appearance of resistance in breast cancer patients receiving endocrine therapy.16 17 Further research is  however  needed to better understand the potential value of ESR1 mutations monitoring and the APIS ESR1 Mutations Kit aims to be a valuable tool to support such research.The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is an important cell signaling pathway with an important role in cell growth  proliferation  survival  and metabolism.18 In breast cancer this pathway is deregulated in as much as 40% of hormone receptor-positive  HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients. A common mechanism of such deregulation are somatic mutations in the PIK3CA or AKT1 genes. New therapeutic options are becoming available that target mutated PIK3CA or AKT119 20 and require new tools to aid in the sensitive detection of relevant gene mutations. The Idylla™ PIK3CA-AKT1 Mutation Assay aims to offer a sensitive  rapid and easy-to-use tool to further study the role of PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations in metastatic breast cancer.--- END ---More information:Investor Relations Biocartise-mail ir@biocartis.comAbout BiocartisWith its revolutionary and proprietary Idylla™ Platform  Biocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) aspires to enable personalized medicine for patients around the world through universal access to molecular testing  by making molecular testing actionable  convenient  fast and suitable for any lab.

Its shares have tanked since then  with its market capitalisation now just €1.2m.HealthBeacon has developed a digital health platform aimed at improving patient support and ensuring they adhere to home injection regimes.It announced earlier this month that it only had about €500 000 of cash left on its books  and that the money was sufficient to let it continue trading until the middle or end of November. It was also engaged in funding talks.“Since the announcement on 5 October 2023  the company has explored various financing options to improve its short term working capital position as well as longer term funding requirements including discussions with key stakeholders and other providers of capital  and explored the potential sale of its business divisions ” a statement from the company said on Friday.But it warned that no alternative financing options have yet been secured and that it’s continuing to pursue possibilities.Last month  the company told investors that it had a gross funding requirement of about €11m over the next 18 to 24 months.“The board now believes the company only has sufficient cash to continue to trade until the last week of October 2023 ” it said on Friday. “The board now believes the company is in a highly constrained financial position and requires additional financing urgently in order to continue as a going concern.”,neutral,0.08,0.8,0.12,negative,0.01,0.26,0.73,True,English,"['Ex-HealthBeacon CEO', 'board', 'firm', 'survival', 'short term working capital position', 'longer term funding requirements', 'digital health platform', 'home injection regimes', 'gross funding requirement', 'next 18 to 24 months', 'various financing options', 'alternative financing options', 'Irish medtech firm', 'former chief executive', 'stock market-listed firm', 'financial position', 'funding talks', 'additional financing', 'executive director', 'Jim Joyce', 'financial difficulties', 'Mr Joyce', 'interim examiner', 'High Court', 'market capitalisation', 'patient support', 'key stakeholders', 'other providers', 'potential sale', 'business divisions', 'last week', 'going concern', 'cash reserves', 'sufficient cash', 'HealthBeacon', 'survival', 'Monday', 'founder', 'role', 'involvement', 'company', 'advisor', 'shares', 'Dublin', 'Euronext', 'confirmation', 'end', 'kind', 'rescue', 'appointment', 'KPMG', 'application', 'late', 'books', 'money', 'middle', 'November', 'announcement', '5 October', 'discussions', 'statement', 'Friday', 'possibilities', 'investors', 'board', 'order']",2023-10-16,2023-10-17,independent.ie

These options included keeping the businesses together or selling parts of the businesses.Taking into considerations the different business dynamics  growth and cash generation profiles1 and capital requirements of the Tech Foundations and Eviden perimeters  as well as potential dyssynergies  mitigants and estimated separation costs  the Board of Directors determined that the separation was the best way forward in the interest of all Atos stakeholders and would unlock the intrinsic value of Eviden since the business operates in market segments that command higher valuation multiples than the Tech Foundations business.Following the announcement of this separation plan  Atos was approached by several players interested in a potential acquisition of its Tech Foundations business  as indicated in the press release of October 24th  2022. The Group with its Board of Directors examined all received expressions of interest in light of the Atos’ corporate interest.When the Board has been presented with the last revised offer from EPEI  it benchmarked it against other available options  and determined that the contemplated transaction would offer the most achievable execution path to the separation of Tech Foundations and Eviden and would improve the risk profile of the Group post-transaction.Economic and capital market conditions also made it increasingly difficult to monetize part of Eviden on acceptable terms and access financing markets for Tech Foundations’ operations. Additionally  given Tech Foundations’ current focus on a turnaround which will still take time to be fully realized  a private ownership would facilitate the execution of the plan. Eviden would have the ability  once properly deleveraged  to accelerate its growth and capitalize on market opportunities.Atos consequently announced on August 1st  2023 that it had entered into an agreement providing for exclusive negotiations with EPEI  after discussions which remained uncertain until this date.Reminder of transaction overview as estimated on August 1st  20232Contemplated Tech Foundations sale to EPEI €0.1bn net cash proceeds to Evidennet cash proceeds to Eviden €1.9bn transfer of on balance-sheet liabilities 3transfer of on balance-sheet liabilities Transfer of €7.6bn of off-balance sheet liabilities 4of of Conveyance of €0.8bn 5 of working capital specifically attributable to Tech Foundations’ operationsDeconsolidation of Tech Foundations negative FCFUpside-sharing mechanism for EvidenEPEI group to capitalize a Special Purpose Vehicle with €0.8bn at closing to acquire TFCo Strengthen Eviden capital structure Capital increase of €900m: €180m reserved capital from EPEI at 20€ per share   in exchange of a 7.5% stake €720m of rights offering   standby underwritten by BNP Paribas and J.P. Morgan subject to usual conditions€400m divestment plan 6Target Eviden proforma net leverage of about 4x improving to 2x by end of 2025Status of the projectFollowing the announcement by Atos on August 1st  2023 that it had entered into exclusive negotiations for the contemplated sale of Tech Foundations to EPEI group  the Company can now confirm that preparatory stages of the project are underway.Atos has started social consultation with the Societas Europaea Council (SEC) and at local level  and submitted most regulatory pre-filings or filings across the various concerned jurisdictions.In this context  the parties are conducting the exclusive negotiations of the legal documentation  including the share purchase agreement for the sale of 100% of TFCo and the investment agreements regarding EPEI group’s minority stake in Eviden as a result of its subscription to the contemplated reserved capital increase and subsequent rights issue (representing up to 7.5% of Eviden’s share capital). Such negotiations could lead to the change of certain financial parameters of the contemplated transaction.At the same time  following the completion of the operational separation of Tech Foundations and Eviden  the final legal steps to place the Tech Foundations subsidiaries under TFCo (intended to be sold to the EPEI group) are on track.The Group is also in constant dialogue with its clients  suppliers and other commercial partners to ensure a smooth continuity of its operations. To the same end  the contemplated transaction agreements would include subcontracting and other transitional service arrangements between TFCo and Eviden.Indicative timingFinal binding agreements are targeted to be concluded at the end of the ongoing exclusive negotiations  if successful  by the end of 2023 at the latest  subject to completion of the employee consultation processes and obtaining the necessary bank loan waivers.Given the anticipated timing of regulatory approval procedures following pre filings  the Shareholders’ Meeting necessary to approve both the proposed sale of Tech Foundations and the capital increases of Atos SE totaling €900 million (consisting of a €180m reserved capital increase from EPEI and a €720m rights issue)  and consequently the completion of the overall transaction  would now be anticipated in early Q2 of 2024. Eviden will hold an Investor Day prior to the Shareholders’ Meeting.Financial impact of the transactionThe financials mentioned thereafter remain unaudited estimates as of August 1st  2023 or as of today (as applicable) that will be confirmed and further detailed if and when the transaction documentation is finalized and the carve-out and separation are effective. These estimated figures also depend on financial parameters which would be set out in the final documentation still under discussion with EPEI.The contemplated transaction would have a net positive cash impact of €0.1 billion for Eviden while transferring €1.9 billion of Tech Foundations-related on-balance sheet liabilities  €7.6 billion of off-balance sheet liabilities and would unwind ca. €1 billion of intra-year working capital needs. As part of such transaction  Atos SE (to be renamed Eviden SE) would benefit from an upside sharing mechanism.Net cash proceedsAs part of the contemplated transaction  all receivables and payables attributable to Tech Foundations will be conveyed at closing to TFCo.The share purchase agreement with EPEI allows the Group to monetize for cash €442 million in TFCo receivables through factoring7. Based on the targeted transaction parameters  Eviden will be entitled to €104 million from the proceeds of the €442 million in factoring. The remaining balance would stay with TFCo in the form of:€250 million of cash on the balance sheet; and€88 million in cash for compensation for the transfer of provisions for risks and charges8.EPEI will pay €1 for the shares of TFCo.On and off-balance sheet liabilitiesThe €1.9 billion of on-balance sheet liabilities which would be transferred as part of the transaction would be broken down as follows:(Unaudited estimates) Dec 31st 2022 Jun 30th 2023 Provisions for risks and charges9 €0.6 billion €0.6 billion Lease liabilities (IFRS 16)10 €0.8 billion €0.7 billion Pension provisions €0.4 billion €0.4 billion Other and contingencies11 €0.2 billion €0.2 billion Total12 €1.9 billion €1.8 billionBased on December 31st  2022 figures  €7.6 billion parent company guarantees which are off-balance sheet liabilities related to Tech Foundations and are targeted to be transferred to the buyer. Those include €4.8 billion of performance guarantees  €0.4 billion of leasing guarantees  €0.4 billion of financing guarantees and €2.0 billion of other parent company guarantees  representing ca. 75% of the Group’s parent company guarantees.Therefore  the transfer of such on and off-balance sheet liabilities would significantly reduce Eviden’s risk profile.Working capitalWorking capital is the amount of current assets less current liabilities linked to the operations of the business. Current assets include trade receivables  which are amounts due by clients to the Company  and current liabilities include trade payables  which are amounts due by the Company to its suppliers.As part of the Group’s liquidity management  Atos carries out specific actions to optimize its working capital  particularly at half-year and annual closings. Those actions include:reported non-recourse factoring 13 (sale) of receivables for cash;(sale) of receivables for cash; a reduction in the average payment period for trade receivables  which increases the amount of cash to the Group and reduces the amount of reported receivables on the balance sheet; andan extension of supplier payment terms which increases the amount of cash at the Group and increases the amount of trade payables on the balance sheet.The above actions result in significant intra-annual variations in working capital compared with the reported year-end and mid-year working capital  as indicated at the announcement of the separation plan on June 14th  202214.For the Group  it is estimated that the average working capital excluding these actions would have been on average about €1.8 billion higher than the reported figures  of which €0.7 billion stems from non-recourse factoring of receivables.As part of the contemplated transaction  the Company will deliver the working capital attributable to Tech Foundations including receivables and payables  based on TFCo’s balance sheet at closing. Based on estimated historical trends  Tech Foundations’ working capital level necessary to run the operations was estimated at €0.8 billion15 as of August 1st  2023. At closing  potential shortfall compared with this working capital target would under certain conditions be part of the purchase price adjustments.On the Tech Foundations perimeter  at the time of the August 1st  2023 announcement  the forecasted working capital at December 31st  202316 for the Tech Foundations perimeter was estimated at (€0.2) billion. This negative working capital reflected lower receivables and higher payables as a result of anticipated working capital actions described above. The reversal of those working capital actions in order to reach the normalized unaffected receivables and payables of €0.8 billion working capital target represents ca. €1 billion of financial impact on the estimated proforma reported December 31st  2023 financial net debt position of Eviden.Upside sharingAs part of the contemplated transaction  Atos SE (to be renamed Eviden SE) as seller of TFCo would be entitled to receive up to 10% of TFCo’s share capital in 2027 depending on the achievement of certain operational targets by TFCo. In case of total or partial monetization of TFCo by EPEI before December 31st  2026  Eviden would receive 40% of net proceeds of such transaction. From January 1st  2027 to December 31st  2028  that amount would be 20% of net proceeds of such transaction.Post-transaction capital structure and financing of EvidenAs part of the contemplated transaction  the Group announced on August 1st  2023  that it would intend to sustainably strengthen the capital structure of the Group post-transaction (Eviden) with planned capital increases for a total of €900m and from the proceeds of the €400m divestment plan that was announced on July 28th  2023. These transactions combined with the impact of the sale of Tech Foundations would lead to an estimated proforma initial leverage of ca. 4x as of December 2023  and with a target of ca. 3x by 2024 year-end  and ca. 2x by 2025 year-end17.Debt financing in the context of the contemplated transactionAs a reminder  in the context of the separation plan announced in June 2022  the Company has agreed with its financing banks an interim debt package of €2.7 billion consisting of a term loan A of €1.5 billion  a term loan B of €300 million and a revolving credit facility of €900 million  aimed at maintaining liquidity in the Group and cover financing needs during the transition period preceding the separation. The Company has already repaid ca. €270 million of its term loan B and expects the remaining balance of such term loan B to be repaid by year-end. The €1.5 billion term loan A has a maturity of January 2024 with two 6-month extensions until January 2025 available to the Company.Consequently  the Group is in active discussions with its financing banks to obtain loan waivers required for the contemplated sale of Tech Foundations and secure new financing for Eviden. The Company is negotiating a new term loan with a reduced principal amount  maturing in December 2026  to replace the €1.5 billion term loan A post-transaction. To date  the Company has received positive feedback on the waivers.The revolving credit facility maturing in November 2025 is expected to remain in place post-transaction. As part of the ongoing discussions with its financing banks  the Company aims to put in place an additional revolving credit facility at closing that will start in November 2025 and expire in November 2026.Equity financing in the context of the contemplated transactionAs indicated in the press release of August 1st  2023  the proposed capital increase of Atos SE (to be renamed Eviden SE) would amount to a total of €900m  consisting of a €180m reserved capital increase at an agreed price of €20 per share pursuant to which EPEI would hold 7.5% of the share capital and a €720m rights issue for all shareholders and to which EPEI is also committed to subscribe for €37.5m. As a result of the rights issue  the stake of the EPEI group in Eviden will in no event be higher than 7.5% and will be subject to a standstill.BNP Paribas and J.P. Morgan have provided a standby underwriting for the rights issue amount (less the amount of EPEI’s subscription commitment)  subject to usual conditions.Post-transaction deleveraging profileThe Group net debt on June 30th  2023 was €2.3 billion18. On August 1st  2023  the reported net debt at December 31st  2023 was expected to be approximately €2.1 billion19 after €250 to 300 million of proceeds of assets’ sales for which binding agreements have already been signed20. In order to estimate the impact of the contemplated transaction on this expected net debt  the following adjustments would need to be made:December 31st  2023 expected net debt pre-transaction (pre-IFRS 16) €2.1bn Net transaction proceeds €(0.1)bn Reversal of TF working capital actions21 €1.0bn Future disposal of assets22 €(0.4)bn Equity raise (€180 million reserved capital increase and €720 million rights issue) €(0.9)bn Others and contingencies €0.2bn December 31st  2023 expected proforma net debt post-transaction (pre-IFRS 16) €1.9bnThe net effect of these proforma adjustments is a net debt of ca. €1.9 billion for Eviden at 2023 year-end implying a ca. 4x reported net leverage. The fast-deleveraging profile of Eviden would lead to ca. 3x and ca. 2x reported net leverage respectively as of 2024 and 2025 year-ends.The equity increase sizing is consistent with the objective to target a corporate rating of Eviden in the BB range  which will facilitate Eviden’s access to debt capital markets. Subsequent to the August 1st  2023 announcement  S&P assigned an indicative credit rating of BB- to Eviden post-transaction.Key conditions and termination rightsUnder the agreement entered into between Atos SE and EPEI on August 1st  2023  Atos undertook to pay a break fee up to €3 million in case it did not sign the final agreements while the employee consultation process is completed and the bank loan waivers are obtained.In addition to antitrust and other regulatory conditions  the share purchase agreement would provide for financial conditions precedent to the closing of the contemplated transaction  which are generally pertaining to the transfer of the Tech Foundations perimeter (including certain contracts  pensions schemes and parent-company guarantees) and the viability of its operations (including through factoring arrangements and relevant expert opinions).The share purchase agreement would include potential adjustments and compensation mechanisms (unilateral or bilateral) which may benefit either party. Among such mechanisms  the amount of cash undertaken to be provided to TFCo at closing may be adjusted  including in certain cases of working capital shortfall against the target. Both parties would benefit from termination rights based on financial criteria designed to preserve the economics of the transaction in case of significant adjustments. Certain of the termination cases could trigger a break fee in the amount of €3 million.As last indicated on September 22nd  2023  the information on the final terms and conditions of the contemplated transaction will be supplemented if and when the final agreements are signed and prior to a Shareholders’ Meeting.Accounting mattersThe proforma financial statements of Tech Foundations and Eviden are currently being drawn up in the context of the contemplated transaction. The relevant information in this respect would be provided to the market when finalized and in any case before the contemplated Shareholders’ Meeting.The annual impairment test that the Group carries out at year-end could lead this year to a significant impairment charge arising  among other factors  from the current contemplated transaction regarding Tech Foundations  as well as Atos’ share price  should it remain at current levels.Liquidity situation of the GroupThe Group’s policy is to fully cover its estimated liquidity needs with long-term borrowings  cash and other appropriate financial instruments  in order to have sufficient flexibility to finance its operations and future developments.Should the contemplated transaction with EPEI be submitted to and approved by shareholders and carried out  Eviden is expected to have the liquidity necessary to run its business while maintaining access to the debt market  based on the latest business forecasts and assuming the capital increases and a secured new term loan from the bank syndicate.Should the contemplated transaction with EPEI not go forward  the Group would remain fully committed to progressing on the separation plan. As part of its ongoing monitoring the Group expects to meet its liquidity requirements for 2024  based on the latest business forecasts  assuming continued access to the factoring program and the completion of the €400 million asset divestment program that was announced on July 28th  2023. The Group would have to access the debt and equity capital markets  and/or consider the sale of additional assets  to refinance the €1.5 billion term loan A maturing in January 2025 (after the two 6-month extensions available to the Company) and the €750 million bonds maturing in May 2025.Next stepsThe Company will continue to pursue discussions with all relevant parties and stakeholders to progress on the exclusive negotiations for the sale of Tech Foundations  in parallel to the ongoing work on employee consultations  antitrust and other regulatory filings and other related matters.Pending the approval of the contemplated transaction by the shareholders  the Group continues to monitor market developments and is committed to a strong dialogue with its shareholders throughout the separation process.Analyst and investor conference callAtos’ Management invites you to an international conference call  on Monday  October 16  2023 at 08:00 am (CET – Paris).You can join the webcast of the conference:via the following link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/8ahwavbfby telephone with the dial-in  10 minutes prior the starting time.

The estimate as of June 30th  2023 is €1.8bn.4 Unaudited estimate as of December 31st  2022.5 Working capital is the amount of current assets less current liabilities linked to the operations of the business. Current assets include trade receivables  which are amounts due by clients to the Company  and current liabilities include trade payables  which are amounts due by the Company to its suppliers.Based on estimated historical trends  the working capital level attributable to Tech Foundations’ operations was estimated at €0.8 billion. This €0.8 billion of Tech Foundations’ working capital is not cash paid by Eviden to Tech Foundations but represents current assets including receivables and current liabilities including payables of Tech Foundations which are attributable to Tech Foundations balance sheet.At the time of the August 1st  2023 announcement  the forecasted working capital at December 31st  20235 was estimated at (€0.2) billion due to working capital specific actions described later. The reversal of those actions represents a €1 billion estimated impact as of December 31st  2023 arising from the difference between these two numbers.6 As announced on July 28th  2023 as part of H1 2023 results.7 Factoring is a financial arrangement where a bank or financial institution purchases a business's accounts receivable to provide immediate cash  allowing the business to access funds before their customers pay their invoices. Factoring is to be implemented as part of the SPA prior to closing with Atos SE (to be renamed Eviden SE) as seller subsequently retaining the resulting cash on its balance sheet. The corresponding liabilities to repay the receivables that were sold is the sole responsibility of the buyer.8 Related to underperforming and loss-making contracts.9 Mainly composed of provisions for project commitments  for litigations and contingencies and for restructuring costs.10 Lease liabilities mostly composed of real estate and IT leases.11 These potential liabilities may crystallize upon effective separation of TFCo and Eviden and are not reported on balance sheet of the group as of December 2022 and June 2023.12 Discrepancies between the break down figures and the totals result from rounding.13 Bank factoring is a financial arrangement where a bank or financial institution purchases a business's accounts receivable (unpaid invoices) to provide immediate cash flow  allowing the business to access funds before their customers pay their invoices.14 See Atos’ press release and Capital Market Day presentation of June 14th  2022.15 This €0.8 billion of Tech Foundations’ working capital is not cash paid by Eviden to Tech Foundations but represents current assets including receivables and current liabilities including payables of Tech Foundations which are attributable to Tech Foundations balance sheet.16 Pending finalization of Tech Foundations’ full carve-out  the working capital had been estimated as of December 31st  2023  as the transaction was expected to close between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.17 Estimates as of August 1st  2023.18 Net debt pre IFRS 16.19 Net debt pre IFRS 16.20 As part of the initial €700 million asset divestment program already executed.21 Estimates as of August 1st  2023; referred as “unwinding of intra-year working capital” in the August 1st  2023 press release.22 As announced on July 28th  2023.Attachment,neutral,0.11,0.88,0.01,mixed,0.16,0.24,0.6,True,English,"['Tech Foundations', 'EPEI group', 'Atos', 'update', 'sale', 'Eviden capital structure Capital increase', 'Societas Europaea Council', 'ongoing open dialogue', 'equity capital markets', 'EP Equity Investment', 'cash generation profiles1', 'higher valuation multiples', 'net cash proceeds', 'Special Purpose Vehicle', 'different business dynamics', 'balance sheet liabilities', 'capital market conditions', 'upcoming debt maturities', 'other available options', 'access financing markets', 'Tech Foundations’ operations', 'Ongoing exclusive negotiations', 'Tech Foundations business', 'Contemplated Tech Foundations', 'achievable execution path', 'Atos’ corporate interest', 'achievable path', 'capital increases', 'capital requirements', 'working capital', 'balance-sheet liabilities', 'market developments', 'market segments', 'market opportunities', 'Press Release', 'risk profile', 'Social consultation', 'local level', 'regulatory pre-filings', 'relevant jurisdictions', 'early Q2', 'expected timing', 'regulatory approvals', 'financial parameters', 'remaining perimeter', 'final terms', 'financing banks', 'loan waivers', 'new financing', 'additional assets', 'adequate liquidity', 'shareholder communication', 'various workstreams', 'financial impact', 'strategic options', 'potential dyssynergies', 'best way', 'intrinsic value', 'several players', 'potential acquisition', 'acceptable terms', 'current focus', 'private ownership', 'Upside-sharing mechanism', 'Contemplated transaction', 'Shareholders’ Meeting', 'The Group', 'active discussions', 'Atos’ subsidiary', 'separation costs', 'Atos stakeholders', 'Eviden perimeters', 'overall transaction', 'final transaction', 'transaction overview', 'shareholder approval', 'Process update', '€1.9bn transfer', 'Atos shareholders', 'separation plan', 'Atos Group', 'EPEI group', 'sale', 'improvement', 'SEC', 'most', 'completion', 'information', 'Paris', 'France', 'October', 'August', 'TFCo', 'part', 'commitment', 'questions', 'investors', 'background', 'Reminder', 'Board', 'Directors', 'number', 'future', 'announcement', 'June', 'businesses', 'considerations', 'growth', 'mitigants', 'expressions', 'light', 'last', 'offer', 'Economic', 'turnaround', 'time', 'ability', 'agreement', 'Conveyance', 'Deconsolidation', 'FCF']",2023-10-16,2023-10-17,globenewswire.com

The Karavasta solar plant is the largest in Albania and indeed the largest in the Western Balkans. It is now built and is expected to produce its first megawatt-hours in the coming weeks.With a capacity of 140 megawatts  the plant can provide electricity equivalent to the annual consumption of 220 000 residents  which is twice the energy needs of Albanian cities such as Vlora or Kamza.In addition to meeting these energy needs  the Karavasta solar plant will play a pivotal role in preserving the environment by preventing over 29 165 tonnes of CO2 per annum  which is roughly 7% of the emissions from the Albanian industrial sector. The plant will thus significantly contribute to the ambitious target set by the Albanian government to reach 54.4% of renewable energies in the country's gross energy consumption by 2030.This extensive project  carried out over about 200 hectares in less than 18 months  is supported by long-term sale contracts.Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia  who responded to questions from French President Emmanuel Macron and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama  stated: ""Voltalia thanks all stakeholders who have made the Karavasta project a reality  particularly the Albanian Council of Ministers  the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy  as well as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
