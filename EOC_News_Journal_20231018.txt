(""Enagás"" or the ""Guarantor""). The obligations of the Guarantor in that respect (the ""Guarantee"") are contained in the deed of guarantee dated 27 July 2023.This Base Prospectus has been approved by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the ""CSSF"")  as competent authority under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129  as amended (the ""Prospectus Regulation""). The CSSF only approves this Prospectus as meeting the standards of completeness  comprehensibility and consistency imposed by the Prospectus Regulation. Such approval should not be considered as an endorsement of either the Issuer  the Guarantor or the quality of the Notes that are the subject of this Base Prospectus and investors should make their own assessment as to the suitability of investing in the Notes. The CSSF assumes no responsibility as to the economic and financial soundness of the issue of any Notes or the quality or solvency of the Issuer in line with the provisions of article 6(4) of the Luxembourg Act dated 16 July 2019 relating to prospectuses for securities. Application has also been made to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for the Notes issued under the Programme to be listed on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the ""Official List"") and to be admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange's regulated market  which is a regulated market for the purposes of Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments  as amended (""MiFID II""). References in this Base Prospectus to Notes being ""listed"" (and all related references) shall mean that such Notes have been listed on the Official List and admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange's regulated market. Unlisted Notes may not be issued pursuant to the Programme. The relevant Final Terms in respect of the issue of any Notes will specify whether or not such Notes will be listed on the Official List and admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange's regulated market (or any other stock exchange).Each Series (as defined in ""General Description of the Programme - Method of Issue"") of Notes will be represented on issue by a temporary global note (each a ""temporary Global Note"") or a permanent global note (each a ""permanent Global Note"").

Consequently  no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended  the ""EU PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA will be prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation.MIFID II product governance / target market - The Final Terms in respect of any Notes may include a legend entitled ""MiFID II Product Governance"" which will outline the target market assessment in respect of the Notes and which channels for distribution of the Notes are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering  selling or recommending the Notes (a ""distributor"") should take into consideration the target market assessment; however  a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.A determination will be made in relation to each issue about whether  for the purpose of the MiFID II Product Governance rules under EU Delegated Directive 2017/593  as amended (the ""MiFID II Product Governance Rules"")  any Dealer subscribing for any Notes is a manufacturer in respect of such Notes  but otherwise neither the Arranger nor the Dealers nor any of their respective affiliates will be a manufacturer for the purpose of the MiFID II Product Governance Rules.PRIIPS / IMPORTANT - UK RETAIL INVESTORS - The Notes are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (""UK"").

Moreover  there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2023 or 2024  these sales being very much the bellwethers of the entire art market.Major auction houses and investors know very well that art is a safe haven and a good investment  as shown by the Artprice100© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of uncertainty in the stock market is also bringing new funds and investments into the art market.During past crises  Artprice has already observed that the art market was less impacted than financial markets and the economy. This was true during the Nasdaq crash in 2000  after the 9/11 attacks in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crisis in 2007  the negative interest rates that started in 2011  and the Covid crisis in 2019. The current period of major geopolitical unrest and the fear of a recession have clearly not got the better of the Art Market.MethodologyThis Report takes into account all public auctions of Fine Art works  i.e. paintings  drawings  sculptures  photographs  prints  videos  installations  tapestries  and NFTs  excluding antiques  anonymous cultural goods and furniture.

Moreover  there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2023 or 2024  these sales being very much the bellwethers of the entire art market.Major auction houses and investors know very well that art is a safe haven and a good investment  as shown by the Artprice100© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of uncertainty in the stock market is also bringing new funds and investments into the art market.During past crises  Artprice has already observed that the art market was less impacted than financial markets and the economy. This was true during the Nasdaq crash in 2000  after the 9/11 attacks in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crisis in 2007  the negative interest rates that started in 2011  and the Covid crisis in 2019. The current period of major geopolitical unrest and the fear of a recession have clearly not got the better of the Art Market.MethodologyThis Report takes into account all public auctions of Fine Art works  i.e. paintings  drawings  sculptures  photographs  prints  videos  installations  tapestries  and NFTs  excluding antiques  anonymous cultural goods and furniture.

Based on official calculations  the Russian central bank’s reserves declined by 8.4 percent in the last year.In July  a prominent EU clearing house  Euroclear  headquartered in Belgium  disclosed that it had earned €2.28 billion (approximately USD2.4 billion) in the first half of 2023. A significant portion of this income  over €1.7 billion  was reported to be derived from profit generated by managing frozen Russian assets.Euroclear is estimated to be custodian of approximately €196.6 billion (USD207 6 billion) worth of Russian assets  with the majority belonging to the Bank of Russia. It has been reported that the EU has frozen around €207 billion (USD218 6 billion) in Russian assets and reserves since February 2022.EU policymakers are expected to deliberate on the implementation of a windfall tax applied to the profits generated from these immobilized funds  which is anticipated to yield around €3 billion (approximately USD3.16 billion) in revenue.In a recent development  the Prime Minister of Belgium  Alexander De Croo  announced that his country would transfer the tax revenue  amounting to €1.7 billion (around USD1.79 billion)  generated from seized Russian assets to Ukraine.MENAFN18102023000045015839ID1107264308,neutral,0.03,0.62,0.35,negative,0.02,0.27,0.71,True,English,"['reciprocal actions', 'Western use', 'frozen assets', 'Russia', 'response', 'prominent EU clearing house', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'Alexander De Croo', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian central bank', 'Russian forex reserves', 'Prime Minister', 'EU policymakers', 'reciprocal actions', 'Western nations', 'recent proposal', 'several countries', 'unfriendly countries', 'military operation', 'official calculations', 'last year', 'first half', 'significant portion', 'windfall tax', 'recent development', 'immobilized funds', 'tax revenue', 'MENAFN', 'Moscow', 'proceeds', 'warning', 'response', 'profits', 'reconstruction', 'Ukraine', 'case', '8.4 percent', 'July', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'income', 'majority', 'February', 'implementation', 'country']",2023-10-18,2023-10-18,menafn.com

The Karavasta solar plant is the largest in Albania and indeed the largest in the Western Balkans. It is now built and is expected to produce its first megawatt-hours in the coming weeks.With a capacity of 140 megawatts  the plant can provide electricity equivalent to the annual consumption of 220 000 residents  which is twice the energy needs of Albanian cities such as Vlora or Kamza.In addition to meeting these energy needs  the Karavasta solar plant will play a pivotal role in preserving the environment by preventing over 29 165 tonnes of CO 2 per annum  which is roughly 7% of the emissions from the Albanian industrial sector. The plant will thus significantly contribute to the ambitious target set by the Albanian government to reach 54.4% of renewable energies in the country's gross energy consumption by 2030.This extensive project  carried out over about 200 hectares in less than 18 months  is supported by long-term sale contracts.Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia  who responded to questions from French President Emmanuel Macron and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama  stated: ""Voltalia thanks all stakeholders who have made the Karavasta project a reality  particularly the Albanian Council of Ministers  the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy  as well as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. I also warmly thank everyone on our team who contributed to this success. Karavasta is a shining example of how quickly decarbonised and competitive local electricity production can be implemented.""Next in the agenda : Q3 2023 turnover  on 25th October 2023 (after market close)About Voltalia (www.voltalia.com)Voltalia is an international player in the renewable energy sector.

The way we live  work  and interact has been reshaped in the last few years  and the ripple effects of these changes create opportunities in the meetings and events industry. In our ‘Meeting Expectations: The Future of Meetings & Events’ report  you will find a comprehensive exploration of the forces shaping this sector and the strategies essential for success in the coming years.The future of the meetings and events industry is a story of resilience  innovation  and transformation. The trends explored in this report are not merely forecasts; they are blueprints for success. As we navigate this ever-changing terrain  let us do so with the spirit of collaboration  connection  and a relentless commitment to excellence. Together  we will shape a future where every meeting and event is a catalyst for progress  a source of inspiration and a place for belonging. Sophie Hulgard  Chief Sales OfficerTo read and download the report  please click hereThe Future of Meetings & Events: 5 Key Trends1. Softer Productivity“Work hard  play hard” is making way for a growing focus on well-being  flexibility  nutrition  and time management to create a harmonious balance between life and productivity. In MICE  experiences are being curated around the nourishment and wellness of participants  including the downtime agenda.Nobody wants to be pushed to their limits anymore. There is a space for much softer productivity that still allows you to deliver  but to do it in your own time and in your own way. Meenaz Diamond  Senior Vice President  Meetings & Events2. Selling BelongingDespite the rise of digital  human connections are still essential for business. Digital is powerful  face-to-face is valuable. The coming years will see an increasing number of planners move beyond the idea that events are simply about getting people into a room together  instead considering how they can forge deeper connections between attendees  cementing relationships and encouraging repeat bookings. As well as quantifiable ROI (return on investment)  such as closing deals  companies also seek positive ROX (return on experience) to reinforce a sense of belonging and deliver a valuable experience.3. Designing ExperiencesThe very definition of an event is being rethought in terms of structure  content and venue. By creating experiences rather than simply providing meeting rooms  we can help embed ideas  memories and different ways of thinking – as with the vast C2 Immersive Floor at Pullman Paris Montparnasse  allowing us to create events that are transformative and creative.The MICE customer of tomorrow is looking for an experience-led but also purpose-driven brand  a brand that cares about the needs of the individual and the community. Kishan Chandnani  Global SVP Premium Brands4. Green GatheringsSustainability is now at the heart of meetings and events with a strong focus on reducing carbon emissions and waste. For example  our Event Carbon Reduction Charter for meetings and events covers a range of measures from recycling bins to food waste & temperature management. Beyond emissions  sustainability also increasingly involves sparking meaningful engagement with local communities and fostering environmentally friendly conversations – whether by recommending local transport or raising awareness of local culture and ecosystems.Authentic local discovery is a key part of building a sustainable event  engaging and supporting the local community and embracing sustainable discovery. Sophie Hulgard  Chief Sales Officer5. Disruptive TechnologyAs AI leaps forwards  it has the potential to transform the meetings and events sector through its capacity to instantly crunch data – for example  finding the best date by analyzing the availability of participants  identifying great speakers and even writing invites and content. How can we use data to offer amazing  immersive  interactive experiences? If used wisely  AI undeniably holds great value to offer all sorts of possibilities for next-gen meetings and events planners.Tomorrow’s Meetings and EventsAs the expectations of event organizers and participants continue to evolve at a dizzying pace  the Meetings & Events sector is undergoing profound transformations. The industry is reinventing itself to embrace wellbeing  sustainability and experience  as well as the tech that can accelerate these changes. At Accor  we’re excited to contribute to the future of meetings and events  together.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries in 5 500 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

Following the conclusive results of the opportunity study  the town brought together several partners for this project: EpaMarne (the public planning body for Marne-la-Vallée)  the Urban Community of Marne-et-Gondoire  the Department of Seine-et-Marne  SDESM (the energy authority for Seine-et-Marne) and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) for Seine-et-Marne.For Bussy-Saint-Georges  the aim of this project is threefold: to decarbonise local mobility  create jobs by attracting hydrogen industry players to the region  and foster training in hydrogen-related professions.To create this hydrogen ecosystem  the public partners launched a call for proposals in early 2023. The call was won by the consortium composed of Lhyfe and Thevenin & Ducrot (AVIA).Lhyfe will develop a green and renewable hydrogen production site with a production capacity of two tonnes a day (5 MW of installed capacity) whilst Thevenin & Ducrot (AVIA) will create a multi-energy filling station in the Bussy-Saint-Georges area. Both facilities are planned for deployment in 2026.The green and renewable hydrogen produced by Lhyfe will cater chiefly for the needs of mobility players in the Paris region or those using major transit routes such as the A4 motorway (e.g. trucks  commercial vehicles  buses and coaches  pusher boats on the Seine  etc.)  as well as a number of industrial companies.This ecosystem will support the energy transition of transport providers  which has become necessary due to the implementation of LEZs  and will help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality in the Greater Paris (Ile de France) region.As well as supplying an industrial site directly via pipeline  Lhyfe will be able to deliver hydrogen in bulk  in containers  throughout Greater Paris. In doing so  it will support the growth of the hydrogen fuel chain region-wide and help to meet the challenges of decarbonisation in Greater Paris.Lhyfe produces green and renewable hydrogen through the electrolysis of water  at production units powered by renewable energy. The company's first site has already been in operation since the latter half of 2021  and seven other sites are currently in construction throughout Europe (France  Germany and Sweden). In parallel  Lhyfe is working on offshore hydrogen production projects – its Sealhyfe plant achieved a world first  in June 2023  when it began producing hydrogen at sea  off Le Croisic  in Loire-Atlantique.Under the project  Lhyfe's production site will supply the Thevenin & Ducrot (AVIA) multi-energy fuel station.This multi-energy hub  which will be created on 8 500 sq. metres of land  is part of a comprehensive planning scheme being led by Bussy-Saint-Georges  and will offer all alternative fuels for mobility.Where hydrogen is concerned  the station will supply light and heavy vehicles  coaches and buses  at 350 bar and 700 bar. Ultimately  it could dispense over a tonne of green hydrogen a day. With this project  Thevenin & Ducrot (AVIA) is positioning itself as a major hydrogen player in France  strengthening its network of multi-energy stations and supporting its clients even more in their energy transition.High-power electric charging points (350kW) will also be available for light vehicles  as well as for heavy vehicles  which are gradually coming onto the market.Thevenin & Ducrot (AVIA) will also supply natural gas for NGVs at the same site  and is standing by to offer XTL-HVO – a second-generation biofuel – at the pump  as soon as regulations allow it.Under the project  Lhyfe and Thevenin & Ducrot (AVIA) submitted a joint application for subsidies to ADEME's Hydrogen Territorial Ecosystems programme in September 2023  bringing together a number of mobility stakeholders to support the project.Yann Dubosc  Mayor of Bussy-Saint-Georges  Chairman of the Board of Directors of EPA Marne  and representative for the group behind the call for proposals  said: “Bussy-Saint-Georges is an unusual and innovative town that is firmly in keeping with the 21st century  in setting an example in the fight against global warming. We want to take part in decarbonising mobility by becoming the hydrogen city of eastern Ile de France. We are delighted to start the concrete implementation of this project  which is helping to define the new face of energy in Seine-et-Marne. We are now going to support mobility players to develop all uses suitable for hydrogen conversion.”Laurent Girometti  Managing Director of EpaMarne-EpaFrance  commented: ""As a developer  we are proud to support the development of local areas by putting innovation at the service of sustainable cities. The decarbonisation of mobility  with the production of green and renewable hydrogen  makes a major contribution to achieving a low-carbon city.”Nicolas Ducrot  Managing Director of Thevenin Ducrot Distribution  said: “This multi-energy hub with a hydrogen refuelling station for mobility allows Thevenin Ducrot to support its clients with energy transition by offering the full range of existing solutions at one site. The Bussy ecosystem is ideally located for our private and commercial customers and our strategic partnership with Lhyfe along with the strong local support from the authorities make this project the perfect showcase for our alternative energy ambitions.”Ghislain Robert  Sales Director for France at Lhyfe  said: “We are delighted to announce this first project in the Ile de France region  which needs every resource possible to accelerate energy transition. We are contributing to this with green and renewable hydrogen  which is locally produced and used  to offer a better quality of life to the people of Greater Paris.""Strategic and technical advisers: SLM ConseilLegal advisers: Cabinet Lhéritier AvocatsAbout LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

Intervest is a leading Belgian logistics and office REIT and registered real estate company (RREC) under Belgian law. TPG has offered to acquire Intervest for €21.00 per share.The proposal offers Intervest's shareholders 100% cash consideration of €21.00 per Intervest share  providing certain and immediate value at a significant premium to the Company's recent trading levels and equity research analysts' consensus estimates. The Offer has support from two of the Company's key shareholders who have provided irrevocable undertakings to tender their shares which  together with TPG's existing ownership  represent 10.09% of the existing shares.The Offer price represents a 52.2% premium over the closing share price on October 5  2023  the last day prior to suspension of trading in the Intervest share by the FSMA on October 6  2023  as well as 47.8% over the last 1-month VWAP  +52.3% over the last 3-month VWAP  and +38.9% over the last 6-month VWAP.The acquisition by TPG will allow Intervest to operate with greater flexibility to execute its strategic plan and pursue growth across its platform. Despite Intervest's highly attractive logistics portfolio  its more modest scale relative to its peers  non-core offices  and higher debt ratio have put pressure on the stock market valuation.While these factors have restricted its ability to grow  the partnership with TPG will provide Intervest with access to long-term capital  expertise  and resources to unlock growth  supporting the Company's Management in expanding its logistics portfolio through development and acquisitions while continuing the patient  strategic sell-down of its office portfolio.Intervest's Supervisory Board and Management Board Unanimously Support the OfferThe Supervisory Board and Management Board unanimously support and recommend the Offer and believe it is in the best interest of all stakeholders of the Company.""We are pleased that TPG recognizes the value and quality of our portfolio  the dedication of our team  and the future growth opportunities for the Company. We believe this transaction represents the best path forward for our Company "" said Joël Gorsele  CEO of Intervest. ""TPG has significant experience growing and scaling leading European logistics platforms  bringing to Intervest a robust network in the pan-European logistics market and a complementary vision for how to support and grow our platform long-term. We are excited for the opportunity to partner with TPG to enable Intervest's next phase of growth.""""The board unanimously supports the Offer from TPG  which offers immediate liquidity to our shareholders at a significant premium and is in the best interest of all stakeholders in the current challenging market environment "" said Ann Smolders  Chairwoman of Intervest.""Intervest is a high-quality platform led by a best-in-class management team that invests in logistics properties strategically located across Belgium and the Netherlands "" said Michiel Celis  Business Unit Partner with TPG Real Estate. ""Working together  we see an opportunity to continue to grow Intervest's presence across its existing and new markets  strategically selling down its small  non-core office portfolio and further establishing its position as a leading operator of high-quality logistics real estate.""Additional DetailsFull details of the Offer will be included in a formal prospectus to be published once approved by the FSMA.The Offer is subject to customary conditions  including a minimum acceptance threshold of 50% plus one Intervest share (including the 1.01% shareholding TPG already owns and the 9.07% shareholding for which irrevocable undertakings have been secured to date)  Belgian Phase 1 merger control approval  and a customary material adverse change clause.TPG intends to launch the Offer shortly after approval of the prospectus and the response memorandum by the FSMA. The initial acceptance period will be communicated at such time.If  following the Offer  TPG owns at least 95% of the shares of Intervest and has acquired  by acceptance of the Offer  at least 90% of the shares that are the subject of the Offer  the Offer will be followed by a simplified squeeze-out bid subject to the same financial conditions as the Offer.TPG is being advised on the transaction by BNP Paribas  KBC Securities  CBRE  and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.TPG Media ContactNick Orbaennick.orbaen@citigatedewerogerson.comDaniel Olivertpg@greenbrookadvisory.comAbout TPGTPG is a leading global alternative asset management firm  founded in San Francisco in 1992  with $139 billion of assets under management and investment and operational teams around the world.

Shares Highlights from Virtual R&D Event with Key Opinion LeadersMultiple KOLs highlight varoglutamstat pathology  clinical development and clinical applicability of key endpoints in VIVIAD studyVIVIAD progressing as planned with final results expected Q1/2024Halle (Saale) / Munich  Germany  October 17  2023 – Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced key takeaways from its virtual R&D Event with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs)  focusing on the Company’s lead program  varoglutamstat  and VIVIAD  a state-of-the-art Phase 2b study being conducted in Europe and designed to evaluate its safety  tolerability  and efficacy in 259 (final number of randomized participants) subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD).The event  which was moderated by Philip Scheltens  M.D.  Ph.D.  EQT Life Sciences Dementia Fund  featured presentations from Stephan Schilling  Ph.D.  Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology  John Harrison  Ph.D.  Scottish Brain Sciences  Sietske Sikkes  Ph.D.  Alzheimer Center at Amsterdam UMC  Willem de Haan  M.D.  Ph.D.  Alzheimer Center at Amsterdam UMC  and Vivoryon Chief Executive Officer (CEO)  Frank Weber  M.D.“We are pleased to have hosted so many renowned KOLs as we discussed multiple important facets of varoglutamstat’s clinical development  its pathology and the clinical utility of primary and secondary endpoints of the VIVIAD study. We have taken a meticulous and well thought out approach to the VIVIAD trial design and believe that the primary endpoint  Cogstate NTB (neurological test battery)  represents the top standard in assessing cognition ” said Frank Weber  M.D.  CEO of Vivoryon. “While significant advancements have been made for AD patients  we believe that varoglutamstat has the potential to address vast unmet need by providing patients with an easy to administer  oral small molecule. We look forward to the final readout of VIVIAD in the first quarter of next year.“Highlights from Dr. Schilling’s presentation include:Pyroglutamate-modified Abeta (N3pE-Abeta) is a trigger of toxicity in AD and there is a strong rationale for targeting N3pE-Abeta to create a tailored AD therapy.Experimental data show that N3pE-Abeta has very different physio-chemical properties compared to other Abeta variants  including its potential to form highly toxic oligomers and fibrils together with non-modified Abeta variants.Strong pre-clinical evidence supports the hypothesis that reducing N3pE-Abeta formation by inhibiting the enzyme QPCT  has the potential to change the course of progression of AD.Highlights from Dr. Harrison’s presentation include:AD is a disorder of cognition  not just memory and MCI and early AD are characterized by a variety of cognitive deficits.The Cogstate NTB  which is used to assess the effect of varoglutamstat on cognition in the primary and secondary endpoints in the VIVIAD study  is a sensitive and well-established scale in the field of AD research. It has the advantage of investigating a broad range of cognitive domains acknowledged to be clinically meaningful measures of function.A preliminary blinded data analysis (cut-off May 2023) conducted for the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) showed that the trajectory of the Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB  which includes Identification  Detection  One Back  and One Card Learning of the NTB) in VIVIAD displayed a ~28% change from baseline (n= >250 patients) compared to the end of treatment (week 96 or early discontinuation of treatment; n=36 patients at data cut-off).Within this preliminary blinded analysis  the four individual test components of the CBB (Identification  Detection  One Back  One Card Learning) displayed declines that varied in trajectories  supporting the concept that patients with early AD have variable progression rates for individual memory functions. While these preliminary data support the selection of the Cogstate NTB as primary and key secondary endpoints in VIVIAD to assess the effect of varoglutamstat on cognition  it is important to note that no assessment of the efficacy of varoglutamstat can be derived from this preliminary and blinded dataset.Highlights from Dr. Sikkes’ presentation include:The Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q) is applied in the VIVIAD study as a key secondary endpoint to assess the effect of varoglutamstat on the instrumental activities of daily living.The scale has been specifically developed and validated for patients with AD and incorporates the input of caregivers and clinicians  supporting its clinical meaningfulness.The A-IADL-Q is validated across several cultures  including the U.S. as well as the Western European countries in which the VIVIAD study is conducted.The A-IADL-Q contains relevant activities that matter to patients  caregivers and health care professionals.The high psychometric quality  i.e. reliability and validity  support its use as an outcome measure in treatment evaluation studies and for use in clinical practice.Highlights from Dr. de Haan’s presentation include:EEG is a relatively direct  large-scale tool to capture neuronal and synaptic function. Normalization of EEG parameters (theta power  connectivity) is presumed to be beneficial for brain function in AD.The SAPHIR Phase 2a study of varoglutamstat has shown an improvement of theta power and connectivity.Based on the results in the SAPHIR study in early AD patients  theta power has been selected as a key secondary endpoint in the VIVIAD study. Other oscillatory  connectivity and network analysis will be conducted as exploratory analysis in the VIVIAD trial.Highlights from Dr. Weber’s presentation include:An overview of varoglutamstat’s clinical development was provided  including a thorough discussion of study design and expectations for the first quarter 2024 data readout.In 2022  the DSMB decided that the VIVIAD study should be continued with the 600mg twice daily dose based on an analysis of safety and tolerability of 90 patients randomized 1:1:1 between placebo  300mg and 600mg varoglutamstat twice daily and followed for at least 24 weeks post randomization.Vivoryon expects the final VIVIAD dataset to include an evaluation of patients following the 12-week titration period  which is the same for every patient randomized to the active arm. The 600mg twice daily dose is applied in approximately 75% of the treatment weeks of all patients and the 300mg twice daily dose is applied in approximately 25% of the treatment weeks.The study protocol defines a duration of treatment of 48 weeks minimum and 96 weeks maximum per patient dependent on when the patient was randomized into the study.A preliminary analysis of the blinded data shows that the expected average treatment duration in the VIVIAD study is more than 80 weeks with more than 60% of patients treated for 84 and 96 weeks  approximately 30% for 60 and 72 weeks  and less than 10% for 48 weeks.All data presented to-date are blinded and preliminary with the study still ongoing.A Webcast of the virtual R&D Event will be available via the ""Presentations & Webcasts"" page in the Investor Relations section on the Company's website at www.vivoryon.com.###About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines.

IK Partners is a leading European private equity (“PE”) firm specializing in European mid-market buy-outs. For Wendel  this transaction will constitute the foundation its new third-party asset management business  which is aimed at generating additional sources of recurring income and intrinsic value creation.Subject to consultation with the relevant works council and satisfaction and finalization of negotiations as well as the conditions for completion (including regulatory approvals)  the acquisition of a controlling stake in IK is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024.A European private equity leaderFounded in 1989  IK is one of Europe's most recognized PE firms  with teams across a number of Northern European countries focusing on the mid-market segment. The Company invests in the Business Services  Healthcare  Consumer and Industrials sectors in Benelux  DACH  France  Nordics and the UK.IK manages 11.81 billion euros of private assets on behalf of third-party investors and since inception  has invested in over 180 companies.IK supports high-potential companies  working closely with management teams to build strong  well-positioned businesses with outstanding long-term prospects. The Company’s Investment teams have an excellent track record  having collectively achieved an average gross IRR of around 26%2 with a tradition of generating consistently strong DPI to its investors.By 2024  IK Partners’ activities are expected to generate around 150 million euros in management fees and around 60 million euros in pre-tax Fee Related Earnings (FRE).A transaction aligning strategic interests of all stakeholders  over the long-termThe proposed transaction is a strategic partnership in which IK Partners’ teams — who remain committed for the long term — will continue to operate autonomously in the same markets and strategies  under the same brand. A key feature of the envisaged partnership will be the commitment of significant capital by Wendel to support IK’s present and future platform funds as well as the development of new strategies. The envisaged transaction would lead to the full acquisition of IK over time.The transaction would encompass (i) an initial transaction and (ii) subsequent transactions structured to ensure alignment of interests of all stakeholders:(i) Initial transactionAs part of the initial transaction (expected to be finalized in the first half of 2024)  Wendel would invest 383 million euros  or 12.5 times the estimated 2024 pre-tax Fee Related Earnings (“FRE”)  to acquire 51% of IK Partners’ shares and rights to 20% of the carried interest generated on all future funds raised by IK Partners.The 383 million euros would be paid by Wendel in two stages:255 million euros at the time of closing 128 million euros 3 years after closing  subject to certain conditions.(ii) Subsequent transactionsThe remaining 49% of IK Partners’ capital would be acquired by Wendel in subsequent transactions  which would take place between 2029 and 2032. These subsequent acquisitions of IK Partners shares by Wendel would be payable in cash or in Wendel shares  at Wendel's discretion. The price of these additional transactions would depend on the growth of FRE over the period.In addition  Wendel would participate in future fundraising activities up to a maximum of 10% of the capital raised  thus diversifying its investments in asset classes whose past performance has regularly exceeded 20% IRR  thereby further accelerating IK’s growth. IK Partners' team would remain autonomous in its day-to-day management and its Investment Committee would remain fully independent.Wendel's development objectivesWendel's ambition is to build a sizeable platform managing multiple private asset classes  alongside its historical permanent capital investment activity.

Moreover  there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2023 or 2024  these sales being very much the bellwethers of the entire art market.Major auction houses and investors know very well that art is a safe haven and a good investment  as shown by the Artprice100© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of uncertainty in the stock market is also bringing new funds and investments into the art market.During past crises  Artprice has already observed that the art market was less impacted than financial markets and the economy. This was true during the Nasdaq crash in 2000  after the 9/11 attacks in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crisis in 2007  the negative interest rates that started in 2011  and the Covid crisis in 2019. The current period of major geopolitical unrest and the fear of a recession have clearly not got the better of the Art Market.MethodologyThis Report takes into account all public auctions of Fine Art works  i.e. paintings  drawings  sculptures  photographs  prints  videos  installations  tapestries  and NFTs  excluding antiques  anonymous cultural goods and furniture.

The data presented as a late-breaking abstract at the ESMO Congress  shows that Ultimovacs’ cancer vaccine UV1  in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab  demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement of overall survival versus ipilimumab and nivolumab alone  a key secondary endpoint. No additional safety concerns were reported from the UV1 treatment. The late-breaking abstract is accessible at the ESMO website.Malignant mesothelioma is considered an aggressive  complex form of cancer with a high mortality rate and few therapeutic options. Patients affected have often been occupationally or environmentally exposed to asbestos. Several efforts have been made in the last decades to improve the survival outcomes of patients with mesothelioma. There is currently no established standard of care in second-line treatment.“For patients with malignant mesothelioma  few treatment options are available after first-line chemotherapy. The NIPU study showed that patients receiving UV1 vaccination as add-on to nivolumab and ipilimumab experienced an increased objective response rate and a clinically meaningful prolonged survival. These encouraging results provide a foundation for advancing further clinical development with UV1 vaccination in mesothelioma patients ” said Principal Investigator of the NIPU clinical trial  Professor Åslaug Helland  MD Ph.D. “We want to extend our gratitude to the patients and their families  as well as the dedicated investigators and all our supporters whose invaluable contributions made this study possible.”The results showed that UV1 plus ipilimumab and nivolumab improved overall survival (OS)  reducing the risk of death by 27% (HR=0.73 [80% CI  0.53-1.00]). The median OS was 15.4 months (95% CI  11.1-22.6) for UV1 plus ipilimumab and nivolumab (treatment arm) versus 11.1 months (95% CI  8.8-18.1) for ipilimumab and nivolumab alone (control arm)  with a median observation time of 17.3 months. This degree of improvement met protocol predefined threshold for statistical significance.The data further demonstrated a benefit in terms of objective response rate  as determined by a blinded independent central review. In the UV1 arm  31% of the patients experienced an objective response  as compared to 16% in the control arm (odds ratio 2.44 [80% CI  1.35-4.49]).The safety profile of the combination of UV1 plus ipilimumab and nivolumab observed in the trial was consistent with the safety profile of ipilimumab and nivolumab alone  confirming the good safety profile for UV1. The patients will continue to be monitored for efficacy and safety endpoints over the next years.The title of the late-breaking ESMO abstract is “LBA99 First survival data from the NIPU trial; A randomized  open-label  phase II study evaluating nivolumab and ipilimumab combined with UV1 vaccination as second line treatment in patients with malignant mesothelioma.”“We are thrilled to announce the highly advantageous results from the first randomized UV1 Phase II trial  marking a major milestone for Ultimovacs. Overall survival is the ‘gold standard’ in cancer treatment. We believe these data supports further development in mesothelioma  and we are looking forward to discussing the results with the regulatory authorities ” said Carlos de Sousa  CEO of Ultimovacs. “UV1  by demonstrating significant survival improvement in a hard-to-treat indication as malignant mesothelioma  shows that universal cancer vaccines are a treatment modality with the potential to improve the current treatment regime for cancer patients globally. The encouraging NIPU results heighten our optimism and raise our expectations for favorable results in the four additional ongoing UV1 Phase II trials. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed  especially Professor Åslaug Helland  who invited us to participate in the study  and Bristol-Meyers Squibb for their valuable contribution.”The NIPU study is sponsored by Oslo University Hospital with support from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ultimovacs. The randomized  open-label  multi-center trial with 118 patients conducted in Australia  Denmark  Norway  Spain  and Sweden  was designed to investigate if combining UV1 with checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab and nivolumab would provide a benefit compared to ipilimumab and nivolumab alone  in patients with malignant mesothelioma after first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The first patient in the NIPU trial was enrolled in June 2020  and the last patient was enrolled in January 2023.The NIPU study announced topline results in June 2023. Based on blinded independent central review (BICR)  the study did not meet the primary endpoint of PFS. Investigator assessment  a pre-defined supportive analysis of the primary endpoint performed by specialized radiologists at the study hospitals  showed a statistically significant positive PFS benefit for the patients in the UV1 arm. The HR per BICR was 1.01 (80% CI 0.75-1.36)  with a median PFS of 4.2 months (95% CI 2.9-9.8) for UV1 plus ipilimumab and nivolumab  and 4.7 months (95% CI 3.9-7.0) for ipilimumab and nivolumab alone. The HR per investigator assessment was 0.60 (80% CI 0.45-0.81)  with a median PFS of 4.3 months (95% CI 3.0-6.8) for UV1 plus ipilimumab and nivolumab and 2.9 months (95% CI 2.4-5.5) for ipilimumab and nivolumab alone.The data from June 2023 showed a positive trend of improvement in overall survival in the UV1 arm over the control arm  but the data needed to mature before a conclusion could be reached. As of August  with a median observation time of 17.3 months  the data presented at ESMO demonstrates survival benefit for patients receiving the UV1 vaccine in the NIPU study.In October 2023  Ultimovacs announced that FDA had granted Orphan Drug Designation for UV1 in the treatment of mesothelioma (based on the NIPU data from June 2023).UV1 is a therapeutic cancer vaccine used to generate an immune response against the enzyme human telomerase (hTERT). The enzyme is essential for the ability of cancer cells to proliferate. Telomerase is present in 85-90% of all cancers  across the stages of the disease. The vaccine is manufactured as an off-the-shelf product with a long shelf life. UV1 is easy to use and does not require sophisticated hospital infrastructure  enabling patient access to therapy also in community centers  and in rural and underserved communities.Ultimovacs is evaluating the universal cancer vaccine UV1 in a broad clinical development program across various cancer indications with different biologies and disease stages  in combination with different checkpoint inhibitors. The topline data from NIPU are the first results among the five randomized trials in the UV1 Phase II clinical program. In addition to malignant mesothelioma  Phase II studies are ongoing in patients with malignant melanoma  head and neck cancer  ovarian cancer  and non-small cell lung cancer. The topline data from the malignant melanoma and head and neck cancer trials are expected during the first and second half of 2024. UV1 is a patented  proprietary technology owned by Ultimovacs.==ENDS==About NIPUNIPU ( N ivolumab and I pilimumab P lus/minus U V1 vaccination) is a randomized  multi-center phase II trial in which Ultimovacs’ universal cancer vaccine  UV1  is evaluated in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s checkpoint inhibitors  nivolumab and ipilimumab  as second-line treatment of malignant mesothelioma. The trial sponsor is Oslo University Hospital  supported in the preparation and execution of the trial by Ultimovacs and Bristol-Myers Squibb.The 118 patients are randomized 1:1 into two treatment arms. All participants receive treatment with nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks) until disease progression  unacceptable toxicity or for a maximum of 2 years. Patients randomized to the experimental arm received 8 intradermal injections of UV1 vaccine during the first three months of treatment. The objective of the study is to achieve a clinically meaningful benefit in patients with malignant mesothelioma (MPM) after progression on first-line standard platinum doublet chemotherapy. Subsequent events emerging in patients in both arms of the NIPU study will continue to be monitored beyond read-out of the primary endpoint. The ipilimumab and nivolumab combination has recently been approved as first-line treatment for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma in Europe and the U.S.The trial was sized to detect a target PFS HR of 0.6  with 80% power and a 1-sided alpha of 0.1. Overall survival was calculated using the same method as for PFS.About MesotheliomaMalignant mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that occurs in the thin layer of tissue that surrounds the lungs and inside of the chest. Mesothelioma accounted for 30 870 new cancer cases and 26 278 cancer deaths worldwide in 2020  according to International Agency for Research on Cancer (Globocan 2020). Mesothelioma is a disease with a high unmet medical need  especially in industrialized countries. The median overall survival is approximately 1 year. Occupational asbestos exposure is the No. 1 cause of the disease  and several occupations like firefighters  military veterans  construction  and industry workers  are at risk. This cancer usually takes several decades to develop after a person’s first exposure to asbestos. Most patients are diagnosed after age 70 because of the long latency period. Even though the use of asbestos to a large extent is banned in new constructions in many countries today  new incidences of mesothelioma will continue to be a medical and public health challenge because of the long latency period typical of the illness. For patients with inoperable disease  few treatment options are available after first-line chemotherapy. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab has recently shown increased survival compared to standard chemotherapy  but most patients do not respond  and improvements are called for. Telomerase is expressed in mesothelioma cells and is therefore a relevant target for therapeutic vaccination.About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines with broad applicability. Ultimovacs’ lead cancer vaccine candidate UV1 is directed against human telomerase (hTERT)  an antigen present in 85-90% of cancers in all stages of tumor growth. A broad clinical program  with Phase II trials in five cancer indications enrolling more than 670 patients  aims to demonstrate UV1’s impact in combination with other immunotherapies in multiple cancer types expressing telomerase and where patients have unmet medical needs. UV1 is universal  off-the-shelf and easy to use  and is a patented technology owned by Ultimovacs.In addition  Ultimovacs’ adjuvant platform  based on the proprietary Tetanus-Epitope-Targeting (TET) technology  combines tumor-specific antigens and adjuvant in the same molecule and is in Phase I clinical development.The Company is listed on Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange (ULTI).About the UV1 Phase II programThe immunotherapeutic cancer vaccine UV1 is investigated in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in patients with various cancer indications with diverse tumor biology. The diversity of the UV1 Phase II program places Ultimovacs in a favorable position to capture the cancer vaccine’s potential broad applicability when combined with checkpoint inhibitors:INITIUM : Evaluating UV1 in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab as first-line treatment for patients with malignant melanoma.

The investigator-initiated study is led by Vestre Viken (Drammen Hospital) and supported by Ultimovacs.About UV1UV1 is a universal cancer vaccine designed to induce a specific T-cell response against telomerase. UV1 consists of long  synthetic peptides representing a sequence in the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase (hTERT)  shown to induce CD4+ T-cells. These CD4+ T-cells have the potential to provide inflammatory signals  and T-cell support is believed to be critical for triggering a strong anti-tumor immune response. Following intradermal injection  antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin are exposed to the vaccine peptides. These APCs will process the peptides and present vaccine epitopes on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules to naïve T-cells in the lymph nodes. Activated vaccine-specific T-cells will then enter the circulation and search for cells displaying their cognate antigen in the context of HLA molecules.The UV1 peptides contain several epitopes  shown to be non-restrictive in terms of (HLA) alleles for presentation. It is  therefore not required to perform HLA pre-screening of patients  which potentially enables broad population utilization of the vaccine. UV1 is administered over three months as eight intradermal injections together with the immune-modulator GM-CSF.A link to the webcast and the comprehensive results from the NIPU study may be accessed from the Company website www.ultimovacs.com .

Moreover  there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2023 or 2024  these sales being very much the bellwethers of the entire art market.Major auction houses and investors know very well that art is a safe haven and a good investment  as shown by the Artprice100© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of uncertainty in the stock market is also bringing new funds and investments into the art market.During past crises  Artprice has already observed that the art market was less impacted than financial markets and the economy. This was true during the Nasdaq crash in 2000  after the 9/11 attacks in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crisis in 2007  the negative interest rates that started in 2011  and the Covid crisis in 2019. The current period of major geopolitical unrest and the fear of a recession have clearly not got the better of the Art Market.MethodologyThis Report takes into account all public auctions of Fine Art works  i.e. paintings  drawings  sculptures  photographs  prints  videos  installations  tapestries  and NFTs  excluding antiques  anonymous cultural goods and furniture.

This new step strengthens our real estate's company commitment towards a responsible development that benefits all stakeholders (clients  shareholders  employees  territories where we operate…).Our ambition: to be a benchmark in terms of efficient  sustainable and PREMIUMlogistics real estate.ARGAN's ESG approach was initiated nearly 10 years ago and led to many actions  which were summarized in a first report published in 2022.Among ARGAN's achievements in the last few years:We strongly reduced our business environmental footprint : this was a result of the deployment of a Climate Plan  first initiated in 2018  which included the roll-out of photovoltaic power stations  the installation of LED lighting systems  and the launch in 2021 of the Autonom® concept; i.e.  the warehouse that generates and uses its own green energy. Renewable energy production thus represented 15 000 MWh in 2022  and half of our buildings have an environmental certification;: this was a result of the deployment of a Climate Plan  first initiated in 2018  which included the roll-out of photovoltaic power stations  the installation of LED lighting systems  and the launch in 2021 of the Autonom® concept; i.e.  the warehouse that generates and uses its own green energy. Renewable energy production thus represented 15 000 MWh in 2022  and half of our buildings have an environmental certification; We maintained practices that stand out in terms of governance: this includes clear differentiation between the roles of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board  independent chairmanship of the Audit Committee and the Appointments & Remuneration Committee  and very high attendance rates for the meetings of the Supervisory Board (more than 90%);this includes clear differentiation between the roles of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board  independent chairmanship of the Audit Committee and the Appointments & Remuneration Committee  and very high attendance rates for the meetings of the Supervisory Board (more than 90%); We paid strong attention to social and societal stakes: this was achieved by making our people a part of the overall success by sharing the generated value (attractive salary policy  profit sharing  commercial bonuses  and a free share plan for all)  while maintaining a very narrow equity ratio (1.9)  at a benchmark level amongst French listed companies.Today  we are writing a new chapter. This testifies to management's and all employees' strong intention to reaffirm even more clearly and firmly our commitments for tomorrow on the three ESG components and to align our approach with international standards  for example the SBTi when it comes to our low-carbon trajectory.This updated strategy is set for the long run (2030)  with regular milestones and  if necessary  adjustments and shifts.Built around some forty indicators  our strategy includes actions:For the Environment   by: Roling out a defined roadmap to reduce carbon emissions in line with a 1.5°C SBTi trajectory . By 2030   and compared with our 2022 carbon footprint  we are thus targeting a -70% decrease in Scope 1 emissions   a Net Zero level in our Scope 2 and -50% less emissions linked to the processes of our warehouses on our Scope 3; Deploying consistently our Autonom®-labelled warehouses for all new developments and by considerably improving the existing portfolio as we target  for 2030  65% of ARGAN's warehouse surfaces without gas   with an ambitious project to replace highlyCO 2 -emitting gas boilers with air / water heat pumps  and 100% of our sites equipped with Centralized Technical Management Systems   which monitor and manage energy in buildings; Accelerating the decrease of our business impacts on natural resources   by meeting a 20% ratio of new developments through the turnaround of former industrial brownfields and 100% of our new warehouses with strengthened management of water use .  by:For Governance   by: Strengthening ESG criteria in terms of Group business ethics   as we aim for 100% of suppliers endorsing our ESG charter by 2030  and such criteria being included in all legal documentation biding ARGAN to its stakeholders ; Increasing the number of frameworks and benchmarks part of ARGAN's standards : already in 2023  ARGAN has committed to the United Nations Global Compact  as well as to the French state's ""Companies Committed to nature"" (Entreprises Engagées pour la Nature)   our Group plans a sustained dialog with ESG rating agencies (Sustainalytics  GRESB…). Longer term  we target certifications by renowned and independent bodies regarding our low-carbon climate ambitions ; Expanding our involvement in a business development that meets as much as possible local needs   through co-construction processes with the territories where we start operating for 100% of our development projects .  by:For Societal topics   by: Maintaining an attractive policy for employees   by favouring loyalty and skills development   by keeping a 100% ratio of Group employees part of additional pay measures (free share plan  profit sharing and commercial bonuses for all) with a benchmark equity ratio . And by consistently training all staff as well as implementing individual coaching program for executives who demonstrate potential ; Raising awareness on topics related to health & safety at work   as part of a dedicated program that will be rolled out for all on-site employees ; Strengthening co-benefits for the territories where we operate   by targeting 25% of construction  maintenance and upkeep contracts that would include an integration clause by 2030 .  by:These targets  selected among the 35 commitments taken for 2025 and 2030  are part of ARGAN's 2023-2030 ESG roadmap and testify to the shared commitment of Group management and all staff members to amplify actions around the three sustainable priorities: the Environment Social & Societal topics and Governance.This ESG strategy is a reflection of who we are: ambitious and pragmatic as well as driven towards concrete actions to limit our impacts and help our customers meet their own goals.

When excluding the impact of the acquisition of WESTPOLE  which took place in March 2023  growth remains consistent at 4.9%.Prodware continues to further develop its economic model which focuses on developing consistent recurring revenue streams. The SaaS mode  including SaaS services  continues to be the leading component  contributing up to 51.8% of the total business with a growth rate of 18.2% during the first half of the year.From a geographical perspective  international sales have seen a significant uptick  primarily due to the integration of WESTPOLE  the new entity  and strong performance in Germany  the Netherlands  and Spain.

However  Prodware continued to invest in its human capital  with a growth in personnel expenses that aligns with its revenue growth. This investment aims to maintain operational excellence for clients and advance the development of future solutions.Prodware's upcoming AiApps offerings  harnessing generative AI to boost the competitiveness of its clients  are set to be launched in the very near future.The current operating income  which accounts for depreciation and provisions totaling EUR8.9 million (an increase of 11.8%)  has reached EUR16.7 million  marking a significant growth of 61.1%.Following the inclusion of a financial result of -EUR6.6 million and taxes amounting to -EUR1.5 million  the net result attributed to the Group stands at EUR8.9 million  which is more than twice the figure recorded during the same period in the previous fiscal year.Increase in EquityAs of June 30  2023  Prodware's equity amounts to EUR109.4 million  compared to EUR100.7 million as of December 31  2022.Outlook In light of the strong performance in the first half of 2023  and notwithstanding a less favorable macroeconomic backdrop for corporate investments  Prodware remains confident in its capacity to sustain business growth in the second half of the year both organically but also in data published by the contribution of its last two major acquisitions  WESTPOLE BELUX  specialized in the Public Sector and Banking/Insurance and PROTINUS in the Netherlands  specializing in service to organizations with more than 5 000 employees (local and central governments  healthcare  education and large companies).About Prodware With more than 30 years of experience and know-how in IT innovation  we strive to provide value and expertise to our customers around the world.

It is the only once-daily gMG target therapy for self-administration by adult patients with anti-AChR antibody-positive gMG.As a complement C5 inhibitor  ZILBRYSQ inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted mechanism of action.2 Benefits of self-administered treatment compared with intravenously administered treatments can include reduced travel time to and from hospitals  decreased interference with work obligations  and increased independence. Unlike monoclonal antibody C5 inhibitors  as a peptide  ZILBRYSQ can be used concomitantly with intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange  without the need for supplemental dosing.2The FDA approval of ZILBRYSQ1 is supported by safety and efficacy data from the RAISE study (NCT04115293)  published in The Lancet Neurology in May 2023.2 The RAISE study was a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy  safety profile  and tolerability of ZILBRYSQ in adult patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive gMG. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily subcutaneous injections of 0.3 mg/kg ZILBRYSQ or placebo for 12 weeks. The study demonstrated that ZILBRYSQ delivered rapid  consistent  and statistically significant benefits in different patient-and-clinician reported outcomes at Week 12 in a broad population of adult patients with mild-to-severe anti-AChR-antibody positive gMG. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) in patients with gMG were injection site reactions  upper respiratory tract infection  and diarrhea.""For people with gMG  the unpredictable nature of the severity and frequency of symptoms can be debilitating and can have a substantial impact on many aspects of their day-to-day lives. In addition to muscle weakness  people living with gMG experience fatigue  affecting their overall quality of life "" said James F. Howard  MD  Distinguished Professor of Neuromuscular Disease  Professor of Neurology  Medicine and Allied Health  The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and lead investigator in the RAISE trial. ""ZILBRYSQ demonstrated rapid improvements in gMG symptoms at Week 12  with differences seen as early as one week  and provides a new treatment option for a broad population of AChR antibody-positive gMG patients. ZILBRYSQ is designed for continued daily use.""gMG is a rare  chronic  heterogeneous  unpredictable autoimmune disease characterized by dysfunction and damage at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).4 5 6 Several factors are understood to be drivers of gMG disease pathology  including the complement cascade  immune cells and pathogenic Immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. 7In anti-AChR antibody-positive gMG  pathogenic AChR autoantibodies (IgG1 and IgG3) initiate the classical complement pathway  leading to the cleavage of C5 and the MAC (membrane attack complex) formation  damage to the NMJ  loss of AChRs and subsequent impaired synaptic transmission.6 8 9 Preventing MAC formation reduces damage to the post-synaptic membrane  reduces disruption of ionic channel conductance and helps to preserve neuromuscular transmission.8 MG has a global prevalence of 100–350 cases per every 1 million people.5""This is an important development for the community because  with more FDA-approved treatments for generalized myasthenia gravis  physicians have additional tools to treat this disease in individualized ways that are the right fit for each individual patient "" said Samantha Masterson  President and Chief Executive Officer of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America. ""We are so grateful to UCB for being part of the myasthenia gravis community and their continued commitment to finding solutions for people living with this chronic  autoimmune  neuromuscular disease.""With the approval of ZILBRYSQ  alongside the company's neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker RYSTIGGO® (rozanolixizumab-noli)  which was approved earlier this year by the FDA under Priority Review designation for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody-positive  UCB's portfolio provides healthcare professionals the option of addressing either complement activation or pathogenic auto-antibodies for appropriate patients.3 10""With the FDA approval for ZILBRYSQ  we are very proud and excited to expand our support to the gMG community. Following the FDA approval and strong momentum with our FcRn inhibitor rozanolixizumab-noli and with our tailored patient support services and commitment to widespread access  I am confident that UCB is the only company with a portfolio of two targeted therapies with different mechanisms of action and the experience to deliver truly individualized transformational patient value to people living with this often debilitating rare disease"" said Jean-Christophe Tellier  CEO  UCB. ""We would like to extend our thanks to the patients  care partners  and investigators who participated in the RAISE study  and to our employees and collaborators  whose dedication and commitment to the gMG community made this important milestone possible.""The primary endpoint for the RAISE study was change from baseline to Week 12 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. The MG-ADL is an eight-item patient-reported outcome measure assessing MG symptoms and functional activities related to activities of daily living.11 These include activities such as breathing  talking  swallowing  and being able to rise from a chair.12 Each of the items is scored  from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe)  providing a total MG-ADL score ranging from 0 to 24  where higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.2The efficacy of ZILBRYSQ was also measured  as a secondary endpoint  using the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) total score which is a 13-item categorical grading system that assesses muscle weakness. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents no weakness and a score of 3 represents severe weakness. A total possible score ranges from 0 to 39  where higher scores indicate more severe impairment.11At week 12  treatment with ZILBRYSQ demonstrated a statistically significant improvement from baseline compared to placebo for MG-ADL total score and QMG total score. Other secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with improvements of at least 3 and 5 points in the MG-ADL total score and QMG total score  respectively  at Week 12 without rescue therapy.2""Until now  people living with gMG have only had access to C5 therapy intravenously  which can be inconvenient and time consuming. Now  with the option of ZILBRYSQ  a self-administered once-daily  subcutaneous targeted complement C5 inhibitor  we hope a broad population of mild-to-severe adult patients with AChR-antibody-positive gMG will be able to have greater independence"" said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. ""Alongside our FcRn blocker RYSTIGGO  which was approved and launched in the U.S. earlier this summer  our unique portfolio will support patients and healthcare professionals to tailor choice of treatment according to their individual needs."" \About zilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily  SC  self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor). As the only once-daily gMG target therapy for self-administration by adult patients with anti-AChR antibody-positive gMG  zilucoplan inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted mechanism of action.2In September 2023  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion recommending granting marketing authorization for zilucoplan in the European Union (EU) as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti–acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive.13 A final decision on approval in the EU is expected before the end of the year  in line with the EMA's standard review timeline.Also in September 2023  the Japanese Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved zilucoplan for the treatment of gMG in adult patients who inadequately respond to steroids or other immunosuppressants.14Zilucoplan is currently under review by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and Health Canada for the treatment of adults with gMG. Responses from regulatory agencies to these submissions are expected between H2 2023 and H2 2024.Orphan designation was granted by the FDA in 2019 to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.14About generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)gMG is a rare autoimmune disease with a global prevalence of 100–350 cases per every 1 million people.5 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including severe muscular weakness that can result in double vision  drooping eyelids  difficulty with swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.4 16In MG  pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane.17 This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction. gMG can occur in any race  gender or age.4 16About the RAISE study2The primary endpoint for the RAISE study was change from baseline to Week 12 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score.Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score  the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15 revised (MG-QoL15r) score from baseline to Week 12. Other secondary efficacy outcomes   time to first receipt of rescue therapy over 12 weeks  the proportion of patients with minimal symptom expression (MSE) (defined as MG-ADL of 0 or 1 without rescue therapy)  the proportion of patients with a ≥3-point reduction in MG-ADL without rescue therapy and the proportion of patients with a ≥5-point reduction in QMG without rescue therapy  all measured at Week 12.Safety was assessed by the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).Patients who completed the RAISE trial had the possibility to enter the open-label extension study  RAISE-XT (NCT04225871).2For more information about the trial  visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT04115293.About rozanolixizumab-noliIn addition to zilucoplan  UCB's gMG portfolio includes the FDA-approved medicine RYSTIGGO® (rozanolixizumab-noli)  a subcutaneously infused monoclonal antibody targeting the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).9In June 2023  rozanolixizumab-noli was approved by the FDA  for the treatment of gMG in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody-positive  having been granted Priority Review for its Biologic License Application (BLA).3 10In September 2023  rozanolixizumab was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for the treatment of gMG in adult patients who inadequately respond to steroids or other immunosuppressants.14Rozanolixizumab is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and Health Canada for the treatment of adults with gMG. Responses from regulatory agencies to these submissions are expected during H2 2023 and H1 2024.INDICATIONWhat is ZILBRYSQ?ZILBRYSQ is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with a disease called generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.It is not known if ZILBRYSQ is safe and effective in children.Please see the full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide for ZILBRYSQ  including Boxed Warning regarding serious meningococcal infections.

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology and the world’s leading provider of proton therapy solutions for the treatment of cancer  today announces it ...,IBA SAComprehensive restoration of legacy machine offers the opportunity for sustainable solutionLouvain-La-Neuve  Belgium  October 18  2023 – IBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.  EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology and the world’s leading provider of proton therapy solutions for the treatment of cancer  today announces it has signed a total system restoration contract with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)  which was IBA’s first-ever proton therapy installation. The total value of the contract is between USD 80 and 100 million  and IBA has received the first payment.Mass General Cancer Center’s proton system was installed by IBA 25 years ago and treated its first patient in November 2001. This collaboration pioneered the use of IBA Proteus®PLUS1 systems and Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) in hospitals globally.This project is the first time a comprehensive restoration will be made on a legacy machine. It demonstrates IBA’s unique ability to bring equipment into compliance with modern standards. A significant benefit is that this process avoids the need to build a new center or decommission the entire proton therapy system  which is not only costly  but also has a high carbon footprint due to the specialty tools required to complete the decommissioning process safely.The restoration of the Mass General Cancer Center facility will include the installation of components such as robotic patient positioners  the latest pencil beam scanning nozzles  power supplies and cables  as well as the latest software releases. Some of the principal components of the existing facility  such as the cyclotron  gantry structures  and magnets  will be repaired and refurbished as needed. This project will best position Mass General Cancer Center to continue its unparalleled history of delivering advanced cancer treatments and allow access to future technological developments.Olivier Legrain  Chief Executive Officer of IBA  commented: “We are very pleased to continue our work with Massachusetts General Hospital after a rewarding 25 years of collaboration. This is also a key milestone for IBA and our proton therapy community as we demonstrate our commitment and ability to enable our historical customers’ systems to perform to the highest clinical standards while minimizing the ecological footprint and cost of commissioning a brand-new building and system.”Story continuesAnthony Zietman  MD  Chief of Radiation Oncology at MGH  said: “We are looking forward to starting a new collaboration with IBA to ensure the highest quality  performance  safety  and technology for our proton therapy practice for many decades to come. This restoration will enable us to continue to treat patients in the same historic Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center while ensuring we are ready for future innovation.”***ENDS***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.
