According to official estimates  the Russian central bank’s reserves decreased by 8.4% in 2022.In July  a major EU clearing house  Belgium-based Euroclear  revealed that of the €2.28 billion ($2.4 billion) it earned in the first half of 2023  it accrued more than €1.7 billion in profit from frozen Russian assets.It’s estimated that Euroclear holds €196.6 billion worth of Russian assets  the vast majority of which is owned by the Bank of Russia. The EU has reportedly frozen €207 billion in Russian assets and reserves since February 2022.EU policymakers are expected to discuss the imposition of a windfall tax on profits generated from the immobilized funds estimated to create some €3 billion in profits.Earlier this month  Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said that his nation would send the tax revenue worth €1.7 billion that has been generated from seized Russian assets to Ukraine.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,negative,0.03,0.36,0.6,negative,0.03,0.38,0.6,True,English,"['Western use', 'frozen assets', 'Russia', 'response', 'Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo', 'major EU clearing house', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian frozen assets', 'Russian central bank', 'Russian forex reserves', 'The EU', 'EU policymakers', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'similar measures', 'Western countries', 'Asharq TV', 'latest proposal', 'several countries', 'unfriendly countries', 'military operation', 'official estimates', 'first half', '€196.6 billion worth', 'vast majority', 'windfall tax', 'tax revenue', 'business section', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'Moscow', 'part', 'revenues', 'Tuesday', 'interview', 'profits', 'cost', 'reconstruction', 'funds', 'case', 'July', 'February', 'nation', 'stories', 'economy']",2023-10-18,2023-10-19,rt.com

In Asia  stock benchmarks were mixed; the dollar and Treasury yields steadied; while oil and gold futures rose.Equities:Stock futures edged lower early Wednesday as the market weighed better-than-expected Chinese data against Middle East tensions. Focus is also on EU and U.K. inflation data due later today.China's economic growth slowed by less than expected in the third quarter  a performance that suggests it is emerging from a patch of soft growth as stimulus measures start to kick in.""The Chinese economy seems to have navigated its way past a particularly rough patch thanks to various supportive measures by the government  but a strong rebound is not in the cards "" said Eswar Prasad  a Cornell University economist who once headed the IMF's China division. ""Still  it is a good omen both for the Chinese and world economies that a more significant downturn seems to have been averted.""Meanwhile  an explosion at a hospital in Gaza hours before U.S. President Biden was expected to visit Israel has further inflamed the region and prompted the cancellation of a summit with Arab leaders.Forex:Elevated Middle East tensions could spur safe-haven demand for the greenback. An explosion at a Gaza hospital has caused the leaders of Jordan  Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to cancel their planned meeting with Biden today  said RBC Capital Markets.This undoubtedly impedes the U.S.-led diplomatic push ahead of a potential Israeli ground offensive into Gaza  it added.Bonds:Treasury yields jumped overnight after a strong September retail-sales report had traders positioning for a ""no-landing scenario"" for the U.S. economy.""While consumers continue to face hurdles from higher borrowing costs  tighter credit conditions and elevated prices  a still-strong labor market  positive real disposable incomes and a gradual easing in price pressures are keeping spending and growth positive for now "" said Rubeela Farooqi  chief U.S. economist of High Frequency Economics.""For the Fed  an acceleration in household spending that supports growth and may be an upside risk to inflation will raise the odds of another rate hike by the Fed this year.""Energy:Oil climbed early Wednesday on rising tensions in the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Geopolitical risks are still the primary driver for gold traders  said Oanda.Also  some investors remain skeptical that diplomatic efforts will lead to a major de-escalation in the conflict  Oanda added.-Copper rose after China reported a slew of economic data  including solid industrial production and retail sales figures. The prints suggest stronger demand for the base metal  as Beijing steps up efforts to stimulate economic growth.Copper's gains may be capped by stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales numbers released overnight  which ANZ said raises the prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates.Also in focus is easing supply tightness  as Rio Tinto's Escondida mine recorded production growth of 5% on year in 3Q  ANZ noted.TODAY'S TOP HEADLINESChina's Economy Gets Boost From Stimulus  but Headwinds GrowSINGAPORE-China's economy slowed in the third quarter as the drag from a shrinking property sector weighed on growth  but strengthening retail sales suggest it is emerging from a soft patch as stimulus measures start to kick in.Still  China's economy is likely to struggle for a while yet  economists say  as consumers remain wary of spending and the global backdrop is darkened by war between Israel and Hamas. Real estate remains a major risk  with home sales crumbling and developers China Evergrande Group and Country Garden struggling with heavy debts.Wall Street's Latest Obsession Is an Unknowable NumberInvestors and Federal Reserve officials scrambling to make sense of surging U.S. Treasury yields have a new obsession: a number that exists only in theory.Known as the term premium  the number is typically defined as the component of Treasury yields that reflects everything other than investors' baseline expectations for short-term interest rates set by the Federal Reserve. That could include anything from an increase in the supply of bonds to harder-to-pin down variables such as uncertainty about the long-term inflation outlook.Fed's Barkin sees 'plausible story' that slowing economy is working to bring inflation back to 2% targetThe U.S. economy may be softer than the data suggest and this weakness may be helping to moderate inflation pressure  said Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said Tuesday.""There's a story - a plausible story - that weakening demand is already working to bring inflation down to 2% "" Barkin said in a speech to the Real Estate Roundtable in Washington DC.Biden's Trip to Israel Carries Risks for U.S. Policy-and His Own LegacyWASHINGTON-President Biden flew to Israel on Tuesday to show his support for the beleaguered country  hours after an explosion at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds  further inflaming the region and prompting cancellation of a summit with Arab leaders.Hamas blamed the explosion at the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital on an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli military said it was caused by a rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad  another militant group based in Gaza  which the group denied.Blast at Gaza Hospital Kills More Than 500  Palestinian Officials SayAn explosion rocked a hospital in Gaza on Tuesday  killing hundreds in one of the deadliest single incidents of violence in the strip-hours before President Biden was expected to visit Israel in a show of support.Hamas and Palestinian officials blamed Israel and said at least 500 people were killed. Israel's Prime Minister's Office said there were ""clear indications"" that the blast was a misfire by the militant Palestinian Islamic Jihad  which the group denied. The source of the explosion couldn't be immediately verified.X Is Testing $1 Annual Fee in New Zealand  Philippines to Fight SpamX will start charging some new users a minimum annual fee to interact with the platform  a move that owner Elon Musk said will combat fake and spam accounts.The platform formerly known as Twitter started testing the new subscription model  called Not A Bot  on Tuesday for users creating new accounts on the web in New Zealand and the Philippines  according to a blog post from the company.

The EU  particularly …,"LONDON  Oct 18 (Reuters) - The Madrid stock exchange is stepping up efforts to rival Deutsche Boerse in attracting euro derivatives clearing from London  ahead of a European Union law to cut reliance on post-Brexit Britain's financial market.The EU  particularly the European Central Bank  has long sought to end London Stock Exchange Group's (LSEG) dominance in clearing euro interest rate swaps (IRS) - derivatives contracts that are widely used by companies to insure themselves against adverse moves in borrowing costs.EU states and the European Parliament are approving a draft law requiring banks in the EU to maintain an ""active account"" with a clearer in the bloc to process a yet-to-be determined amount of their IRS business  meaning they would have to pull some activity from London.EU permission for UK clearers such as LSEG's LCH unit to serve customers in the bloc also expires in June 2025.Jose Manuel Ortiz-Repiso  head of clearing and repo operations at Switzerland's SIX Group  which owns the Madrid bourse  said he was not waiting for mandatory active accounts.A ""big sales effort"" was now underway with hundreds of buy side  sell side and liquidity provider clients contacted  he told Reuters.Madrid has long offered IRS clearing  but was little known and largely served local clients. It now seeks to leverage the international reach of its Swiss exchange owner.""What we are considering is that of the total volume that LCH has  more or less between 25% to 30%  will be affected by these active accounts "" Ortiz-Repiso saidThe figure refers to the approximate portion of LCH business between EU counterparties  and therefore within reach of the draft EU law.LSEG CEO David Schwimmer has said he was fairly confident there would be no sudden cut off in LCH clearing for EU customers in June 2025.LIQUIDITY PROVIDERSSome liquidity providers have made commitments to offer competitive spreads - the difference between buy and sell prices - to compete with LCH  Ortiz-Repiso said.A ""very efficient and competitive fee schedule"" would also mitigate a loss in savings for banks by not being able to net positions across several currencies  as they do at LCH  he added.The notional outstanding position in euro IRS at Madrid's BME Clear unit is 600 million euros ($634 million)  while LCH cleared 3.6 trillion euros in euro IRS on Tuesday alone  when its notional outstanding was 135.7 trillion euros.Deutsche Boerse's Eurex in Frankfurt has long been the main continental alternative to LCH  but has taken time to make progress despite offering sweeteners to banks.Eurex cleared an average of 14 billion euros in euro IRS daily in September  with a notional outstanding of 13.7 trillion euros  up 9% on the same month in 2022  though still giving LCH a global IRS clearing market share of roughly 90%.The European Central Bank said in a discussion paper over the summer that most banks already had an EU clearer account for euro IRS but with no or limited activity  and that ""forced measures"" were needed to make them active.Mandating EU based clearing house members to ""initially"" clear 30% to 40% of their euro IRS in the bloc would not ""directly interfere"" with their international business which passes through London  the paper said.Big banks in the EU warn they would be at a competitive disadvantage to international peers if they were cut off from the huge  multi-currency pools of liquidity at LCH in London.($1 = 0.9450 euros) (Reporting by Huw Jones Editing by Mark Potter)",neutral,0.31,0.64,0.05,negative,0.02,0.19,0.79,True,English,"['euro derivatives', 'Madrid', 'bid', 'London', 'EU based clearing house members', 'global IRS clearing market share', 'euro interest rate swaps', 'The European Central Bank', 'The Madrid stock exchange', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'Swiss exchange owner', 'sudden cut off', 'main continental alternative', 'huge, multi-currency pools', 'European Union law', 'big sales effort', 'BME Clear unit', 'competitive fee schedule', 'mandatory active accounts', 'Jose Manuel Ortiz-Repiso', 'liquidity provider clients', 'draft EU law', 'notional outstanding position', 'EU clearer account', 'financial market', 'draft law', 'European Parliament', 'SIX Group', 'euro IRS', 'local clients', 'IRS business', 'competitive spreads', 'competitive disadvantage', 'EU states', 'EU permission', 'EU counterparties', 'LCH clearing', 'euro derivatives', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'post-Brexit Britain', 'derivatives contracts', 'adverse moves', 'borrowing costs', 'UK clearers', 'repo operations', 'Madrid bourse', 'sell side', 'total volume', 'approximate portion', 'David Schwimmer', 'LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS', 'several currencies', 'same month', 'forced measures', 'international business', 'international peers', 'Huw Jones', 'Mark Potter', 'Big banks', 'LCH unit', 'EU customers', '3.6 trillion euros', '135.7 trillion euros', '14 billion euros', '13.7 trillion euros', 'buy side', 'international reach', 'LSEG CEO', 'discussion paper', 'limited activity', 'most banks', 'LCH business', '0.9450 euros', 'Reuters', 'efforts', 'reliance', 'dominance', 'companies', 'bloc', 'amount', 'June', 'head', 'Switzerland', 'hundreds', 'figure', 'commitments', 'difference', 'prices', 'efficient', 'loss', 'savings', 'positions', '600 million', 'Tuesday', 'Eurex', 'Frankfurt', 'time', 'progress', 'sweeteners', 'average', 'September', 'summer']",2023-10-18,2023-10-19,marketscreener.com

There were significant regional differences. Demand in APAC remained weak  driven by lower than expected investment levels in China. In Americas  orders grew  with important gains in the Cinema and Large Videowalls segments  partially offset by lower orders in Healthcare. In EMEA the order level declined  driven mainly by Entertainment. The orderbook further grew to 523.4 million euro  growing 3% compared to 505.8 million euro at the end of June 2023. The book-to- bill ratio for the third quarter was above 1. Sales for the third quarter amounted to 229.6 million euro  12% lower than the same quarter last year. The Entertainment division continued to perform solidly driven by significant sales growth in the Cinema segment  compared to a strong third quarter of 2022 when the business was rebounding from the supply chain constraints of 1H22. Healthcare sales were 27% lower than last year due to the slower than expected recovery in China and lower sales in the Americas  where sales was impacted by the phase out of a large modality platform  and a delay in supply for an updated Diagnostic Imaging display platform. Meanwhile  Healthcare sales grew in EMEA. In the Enterprise division  the sales declined 13% driven mainly by Large Videowalls  where we executed on the strategic review  but also saw further project delays at major implementation partners. Meeting Experience saw market share gains in a softer market  resulting in a mid-single digit decline in sales versus the same quarter last year. During the third quarter Barco continued to invest in its growth initiatives aimed at propelling growth in 2024 and beyond. These include new product introductions for next year in all divisions: new additions to the ClickShare portfolio  further expansion of the Barco CTRL software platform for control rooms  the launch of a new flagship product for mammography and a new generation of image processing controllers and mid-end projectors for the Immersive Experience market. In Cinema  we are planning to introduce a new media server and the next generation of laser cinema projectors  equipped with HDR Lightsteering technology. Regarding manufacturing  we continued to roll out our focused factories strategy  while the construction of the new factory for projection in Wuxi is on track.

The expected recovery in China from the pandemic has not materialized which is having an impact on the results and growth outlook for this year. In our key markets  we see a mixed picture: Healthcare and Enterprise are facing softer demand related to the weakening macro-economic conditions. On the other hand  the Entertainment market continues to build on its strong momentum that started last year. While navigating these tougher market conditions throughout 2023  the fundamentals of our key markets remain intact  and our focus is on winning market share  cost containment and further margin improvements. In addition  our management teams remain committed to executing on our strategic initiatives  notably our roadmap of new product introductions and the operational efficiencies through focused factories."" Outlook 2023 and beyond The following statements are forward looking on a like-for-like basis and actual results may differ materially. Given the difficult market conditions  management expects sales for FY23 to be in line with last year. At this topline level  management expects an EBITDA margin around 14% for the full year 2023. The 2024 topline growth will depend on the evolution of general market conditions. However  management reconfirms its long-term guidance to return to high single digit sales growth. Management reconfirms its guidance for an EBITDA margin between 14% and 18% for 2024 and subsequent years. Update on co-CEO Charles Beauduin Co-CEO Charles Beauduin has been away from the office on medical leave over the past few months. In recent weeks Mr. Beauduin has resumed his role as co-CEO  working remotely for the most part  but also gradually returning to the office to attend key meetings.

Sales and orders in APAC declined  driven by the slower than expected recovery from the pandemic in China. New anti-bribery policies in the Chinese Healthcare market are also slowing down the decision-making processes in the short term but may be a tailwind for Barco in the mid to long term. In the Americas  Healthcare orders and sales declined  while they grew in EMEA. For Diagnostic Imaging  the market in North America has settled but remains healthy  after a strong performance in 2H22 with higher government budgets and a rebound after prior supply chain challenges. In EMEA sales showed signs of softness  with lower investments in radiology. The Diagnostic Imaging market in China remains soft and continues to see high inventory levels at channel partners. Sales for Diagnostic Imaging in 3Q23 were also impacted by fulfilment challenges linked to a technology refresh of one the display platforms  which pushes order and sales out to the next quarter. Surgical and Modality sales grew in EMEA but declined significantly in the Americas due to high inventory levels at customers and the continued impact of a timing difference between the phase out of a large modality project end 2022 and the phase in of several new confirmed projects towards the beginning of next year. APAC remains slow  due to China.

This represents a key step in the project to create two industry leaders: Syensqo  a leader in specialty chemicals focused on above-market growth  innovation and sustainability  and Solvay  a leader in essential chemicals focused on cash generation  operational excellence and sustainability.Nicolas Boël  Chairman of Solvay’s Board of Directors  said “The Board was pleased to express its unanimous support for this transaction  which has been well-prepared by management with compelling strategic  industrial and financial logic. We look forward to obtaining the support of shareholders on the 8th of December.”According to Ilham Kadri  Solvay’s Chief Executive Officer  “Today’s Board decision is an important expression of confidence that puts us on the path towards the realization of a transaction we have been preparing for more than a year  and that will unlock and accelerate considerable value creation for Solvay  its shareholders  and other stakeholders in the coming decade. I am grateful to our teams for their hard work in reaching this significant milestone and to our business teams for maintaining our performance momentum  preparing both businesses for a greater future. The best is yet to come.”Solvay also announced that it has received rulings from tax authorities in Belgium and the United States confirming that  subject to certain conditions  the transaction will qualify for favorable tax treatment for Solvay and its Belgian and U.S. shareholders.

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology and the world’s leading provider of proton therapy solutions for the treatment of cancer  today announces it has signed a total system restoration contract with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)  which was IBA’s first-ever proton therapy installation. The total value of the contract is between USD 80 and 100 million  and IBA has received the first payment.Mass General Cancer Center’s proton system was installed by IBA 25 years ago and treated its first patient in November 2001. This collaboration pioneered the use of IBA Proteus®PLUS1 systems and Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) in hospitals globally.This project is the first time a comprehensive restoration will be made on a legacy machine. It demonstrates IBA’s unique ability to bring equipment into compliance with modern standards. A significant benefit is that this process avoids the need to build a new center or decommission the entire proton therapy system  which is not only costly  but also has a high carbon footprint due to the specialty tools required to complete the decommissioning process safely.The restoration of the Mass General Cancer Center facility will include the installation of components such as robotic patient positioners  the latest pencil beam scanning nozzles  power supplies and cables  as well as the latest software releases. Some of the principal components of the existing facility  such as the cyclotron  gantry structures  and magnets  will be repaired and refurbished as needed. This project will best position Mass General Cancer Center to continue its unparalleled history of delivering advanced cancer treatments and allow access to future technological developments.Olivier Legrain  Chief Executive Officer of IBA  commented: “We are very pleased to continue our work with Massachusetts General Hospital after a rewarding 25 years of collaboration. This is also a key milestone for IBA and our proton therapy community as we demonstrate our commitment and ability to enable our historical customers’ systems to perform to the highest clinical standards while minimizing the ecological footprint and cost of commissioning a brand-new building and system.”Anthony Zietman  MD  Chief of Radiation Oncology at MGH  said: “We are looking forward to starting a new collaboration with IBA to ensure the highest quality  performance  safety  and technology for our proton therapy practice for many decades to come. This restoration will enable us to continue to treat patients in the same historic Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center while ensuring we are ready for future innovation.”***ENDS***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.

This new step strengthens our real estate’s company commitment towards a responsible development that benefits all stakeholders (clients  shareholders  employees  territories where we operate…).Our ambition: to be a benchmark in terms of efficient  sustainable and PREMIUMlogistics real estate.ARGAN’s ESG approach was initiated nearly 10 years ago and led to many actions  which were summarized in a first report published in 2022.Among ARGAN’s achievements in the last few years:We strongly reduced our business environmental footprint : this was a result of the deployment of a Climate Plan  first initiated in 2018  which included the roll-out of photovoltaic power stations  the installation of LED lighting systems  and the launch in 2021 of the Autonom® concept; i.e.  the warehouse that generates and uses its own green energy. Renewable energy production thus represented 15 000 MWh in 2022  and half of our buildings have an environmental certification;: this was a result of the deployment of a Climate Plan  first initiated in 2018  which included the roll-out of photovoltaic power stations  the installation of LED lighting systems  and the launch in 2021 of the Autonom® concept; i.e.  the warehouse that generates and uses its own green energy. Renewable energy production thus represented 15 000 MWh in 2022  and half of our buildings have an environmental certification; We maintained practices that stand out in terms of governance: this includes clear differentiation between the roles of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board  independent chairmanship of the Audit Committee and the Appointments & Remuneration Committee  and very high attendance rates for the meetings of the Supervisory Board (more than 90%);this includes clear differentiation between the roles of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board  independent chairmanship of the Audit Committee and the Appointments & Remuneration Committee  and very high attendance rates for the meetings of the Supervisory Board (more than 90%); We paid strong attention to social and societal stakes: this was achieved by making our people a part of the overall success by sharing the generated value (attractive salary policy  profit sharing  commercial bonuses  and a free share plan for all)  while maintaining a very narrow equity ratio (1.9)  at a benchmark level amongst French listed companies.Today  we are writing a new chapter. This testifies to management’s and all employees’ strong intention to reaffirm even more clearly and firmly our commitments for tomorrow on the three ESG components and to align our approach with international standards  for example the SBTi when it comes to our low-carbon trajectory.This updated strategy is set for the long run (2030)  with regular milestones and  if necessary  adjustments and shifts.Built around some forty indicators  our strategy includes actions:For the Environment   by: Roling out a defined roadmap to reduce carbon emissions in line with a 1.5°C SBTi trajectory . By 2030   and compared with our 2022 carbon footprint  we are thus targeting a -70% decrease in Scope 1 emissions   a Net Zero level in our Scope 2 and -50% less emissions linked to the processes of our warehouses on our Scope 3; Deploying consistently our Autonom®-labelled warehouses for all new developments and by considerably improving the existing portfolio as we target  for 2030  65% of ARGAN’s warehouse surfaces without gas   with an ambitious project to replace highlyCO 2 -emitting gas boilers with air / water heat pumps  and 100% of our sites equipped with Centralized Technical Management Systems   which monitor and manage energy in buildings; Accelerating the decrease of our business impacts on natural resources   by meeting a 20% ratio of new developments through the turnaround of former industrial brownfields and 100% of our new warehouses with strengthened management of water use .  by:For Governance   by: Strengthening ESG criteria in terms of Group business ethics   as we aim for 100% of suppliers endorsing our ESG charter by 2030  and such criteria being included in all legal documentation biding ARGAN to its stakeholders ; Increasing the number of frameworks and benchmarks part of ARGAN’s standards : already in 2023  ARGAN has committed to the United Nations Global Compact  as well as to the French state’s “Companies Committed to nature” (Entreprises Engagées pour la Nature)   our Group plans a sustained dialog with ESG rating agencies (Sustainalytics  GRESB…). Longer term  we target certifications by renowned and independent bodies regarding our low-carbon climate ambitions ; Expanding our involvement in a business development that meets as much as possible local needs   through co-construction processes with the territories where we start operating for 100% of our development projects .  by:For Societal topics   by: Maintaining an attractive policy for employees   by favouring loyalty and skills development   by keeping a 100% ratio of Group employees part of additional pay measures (free share plan  profit sharing and commercial bonuses for all) with a benchmark equity ratio . And by consistently training all staff as well as implementing individual coaching program for executives who demonstrate potential ; Raising awareness on topics related to health & safety at work   as part of a dedicated program that will be rolled out for all on-site employees ; Strengthening co-benefits for the territories where we operate   by targeting 25% of construction  maintenance and upkeep contracts that would include an integration clause by 2030 .  by:These targets  selected among the 35 commitments taken for 2025 and 2030  are part of ARGAN’s 2023-2030 ESG roadmap and testify to the shared commitment of Group management and all staff members to amplify actions around the three sustainable priorities: the Environment Social & Societal topics and Governance.This ESG strategy is a reflection of who we are: ambitious and pragmatic as well as driven towards concrete actions to limit our impacts and help our customers meet their own goals. In sum: ESG for Efficiency  Strongly frugal energy choices  Gains that are win / win!The 2023 ESG report published today is available on our argan.fr website under“ESG commitments” (in English and French).Financial calendar 2024 (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: 2023 Annual SalesJanuary 18: 2023 Annual Results and 2024 targetsMarch 21: Annual General MeetingAbout ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

Consolidated revenue for the first nine months of the year amounted to €398.7 million  up 5.1% in purely organic terms.In France  third-quarter revenue amounted to €64.2 million  up 3.6% in purely organic terms. Customer demand continued to return to normal  in line with the trend observed in the second quarter.

The Group's situation varied from country to country. Italy is still in the process of stabilizing its business despite a less favorable macroeconomic context. Meanwhile  Belgium and Luxembourg  benefited from good momentum in the public sector  but faced a slowdown in the private sector. Spain and Portugal showed encouraging signs of improvement in September  with an increase in customer demand and a positive trend in recruitment.Sales prices continued to rise everywhere except in Italy  in line with wage increases  enabling the Group to maintain margins.Against this backdrop  the Group has become increasingly selective in its recruitment.The Group had 7 738 employees at the end of the quarter. Staff turnover decreased slightly to 26%  but still provided us with substantial flexibility in managing the workforce during this return to normal phase.Productivity showed encouraging signs of improvement in September  returning well above 93%.Outlook for 2023The market offers opportunities  but the uncertain macroeconomic context is slowing down the new project commitment rate.Given the trends observed in recent weeks  Aubay is cautiously adjusting its full-year revenue target to between €530 million and €540 million.

The pipeline will transfer CO 2 from a compressor station to the P18-A platform in the North Sea. The existing gas platform P18-A will be repurposed for CO 2 storage. The platform will be outfitted with the necessary equipment for transporting the collected CO 2 to the injection wells. The pipes will be manufactured at Corinth Pipeworks' facilities in Greece  and offshore installation work will commence according to schedule within 2026.Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a low-cost method of preventing huge volumes of CO 2 from entering the atmosphere with permanent storage in geological reservoirs. CCS is a crucial strategy to help accomplish climate targets  particularly if the industry has few options for making major short-term CO 2 emission reductions. Once operational  the Porthos project intends to permanently store CO 2 from industry in the Port of Rotterdam in empty gas fields deep beneath the North Seabed.CCS technologies have the potential to play a significant and diverse role in achieving global energy and climate goals. The European Union has recognized Porthos as an important project in meeting climate targets  designated it a Project of Common Interest and made €102 million in funding available for it.For the past 15 years  Corinth Pipeworks has manufactured pipelines transporting CO 2 totaling over 1 150km in length. The company's North American onshore and now European offshore CO 2 pipeline experience demonstrates its readiness to contribute to the development of many planned CCS projects around the world.About PorthosPorthos is a partnership between the Port of Rotterdam Authority  Gasunie and EBN.

(Prosus) (AEX and JSE: PRX): To continue its value accretive open-ended share repurchase programme  this week Prosus will convert 96 million Tencent shares it owns from certificate form to digital form  through a process of dematerialisation. This represents approximately 1% of the issued share capital of Tencent. This is in line with the action taken in April 2023.On 27 June 2022  Prosus and Naspers announced the launch of an open-ended share repurchase programme of Prosus and Naspers shares. The programme  funded by the regular and orderly selling of small numbers of Tencent shares  is designed to efficiently unlock value for shareholders and increase NAV per share over time. The programme is ongoing and will remain active as long as the discount to NAV is at elevated levels. We envision no change in the parameters of the programme.To facilitate the programme  Prosus must take the administrative step of depositing 96 million Tencent shares that it holds in certificated form into the Hong Kong Central Clearing and Settlement System (CCAS). The dematerialisation does not reflect any change in strategy for Prosus and Naspers and is solely to allow the market trading of these shares in an orderly way  in accordance with the open-ended share repurchase programme.Since its launch  the programme has created significant value for Prosus and Naspers shareholders. From launch to the end of September 2023  the holding-company discount reduced by 16 percentage points  unlocking US$25 billion of value. Over this time  the Prosus free float has reduced by 17%  leading to an improvement in NAV per share of almost 7%.About Prosus:Prosus is a global consumer internet group and one of the largest technology investors in the world.

S.p.A. (registered office in Turin  via Treviso 36) and S.T.I. s.r.l. (registered office in Bolzano  via Buozzi 14/16).These companies are active in the same market as STAR7 but specialise in important complementary segments  specifically in the engineering sector. The leases are preparatory to the possible future acquisition of the two business divisions.The above companies are strategic and complementary to the development of the engineering and defence business  with offices located both in Italy (Turin and Bolzano) and abroad (Brazil and Serbia). Given that the two companies were in a critical financial situation  a business leasing contract was envisaged at an early stage in order to minimise legal  financial and operational risks. As a modification to the business division lease agreements  in accordance with Law no. 103 introduced on 10 August 2023  C.A.A.R. S.p.A. and STI S.r.l. will be required to provide a blank agreement  giving our company the first option to purchase both business units.Continuous market research for other companies that could potentially complement and benefit STAR7's business are always in progress. The prevailing atmosphere of market volatility and uncertainty may offer further acquisition opportunities.To be prepared to capitalise on any opportunities  the Group maintains a focus on its available liquidity. This ensures it can swiftly embark on any significant transactions that may emerge.The financial trend indicates a reduction in total debt  in spite of the efforts in the period to integrate the two companies C.A.A.R S.p.A and STI S.r.l.Despite inflation  integration costs generated by the absorption of the CAAR Group business division and consequent inefficiencies  the STAR7 Group's EBITDA in the first half of 2023 amounted to €6.9 million. Meanwhile  Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for the integration costs) reached €7.5 million. The EBITDA Margin therefore reached 13.6% and the Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 14.7%.The Group is in a stable position  with bank debt structured over the medium to long term. It maintains sufficient liquidity to continue its growth trajectory and consistently meets the covenants stipulated by the bonds issued to facilitate the acquisition of LocalEyes.On 21/7/2023  the Board of Directors gave their approval for the proposed merger of the subsidiary company  Vertere S.r.l.  into STAR7 S.p.A. This transaction is expected to yield significant economic and organisational benefits. These include the reduction of unnecessary administrative expenses such as corporate vehicle management costs  tax expenses  legal obligations  and so on. Additionally  it will eliminate the duplication of roles that arise from managing the complexities associated with the technical and administrative handling of inter-company services.The recent performance of the share on the EuroNext Growth Milan market suggests a stable trend  with its value hovering around the initial placement price.Research and development remains centred on Virtual  Immersive  and Augmented Reality. This is achieved by developing products and solutions that cater to the growing need for virtualisation in our customers' businesses.Today  the STAR7 Group is able to deliver increasingly cutting-edgesolutions in the areas of Virtual Training  Virtual Showrooms and Product Experience  by making the most of its technical information management skills acquired over time through engineering and technical authoring.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.3,0.23,0.47,True,English,"['Star7 S', 'Financial Statements', '30 June', 'October', '05', 'C.A.A.R.

Sales totalled €261.2 million  up 96% compared with €133.2 million during the period to 30 June 2022  as a result of the low level of departures during this period in 2022 (effect of Covid in the first quarter of 2022)  the integration of acquisitions made in June 2022 and very brisk demand for travel in 2023.On an historical basis (excluding acquisitions made in 2022)  sales were 16% higher than in 2019  which remains the benchmark year. Tailor-made travel saw growth of 20% in the first half of 2023  while adventure travel was up 10%.The new cycling holidays business enjoyed strong growth  accounting for 17% of the Group’s total sales in the first half of 2023 and around 37% of customers. A large proportion of travellers are now using alternative means of transport to air travel. The Group has rolled out a major awareness campaign with the aim of cutting CO2 emissions  suggesting train travel  direct flights or use of the latest planes whenever possible.RESULTSFor the first time  the Group generated a profit during the first half of 2023–a period when it usually makes a loss due to the majority of departures falling in the second half of the year. EBITDA came out positive at €8.4 million  compared with a loss of €1.3 million in the first half of 2019 and breakeven in the first half of 2022. Net income attributable to owners of the parent totalled €5.9 million  compared with a loss of €2.7 million in the first half of 2019 as well as in the first half of 2022.These results attest to tight control of costs and the Group’s ability to maintain its operating margin. During this period of inflation  this was thanks to the high level of added value and the many services offered to customers of all the Group’s companies  with its well-known brands benefiting from a solid reputation and excellent image.OUTLOOKAs at 1 October 2023 and on the basis of its reported scope  the turnover of the 2023 departures was 45% higher than the one for 2019 departures as at 1 October 2019  and 40% higher than as at 1 October 2022. Thanks to strong growth across all operations  and excluding any exceptional events  the Group is on course to generate full-year sales of around €690 million in 2023  an increase of around 42% relative to 2019 and 39% relative to 2022 (reported figures).On this basis  EBITDA could exceed €62 million  up 86% relative to €33.6 million in 2019  the only benchmark year not including the effects of the health crisis or government aid.The Board of Directors approved the interim financial statements at 4:00 p.m. on 17 October 2023.Reminder:The Group is market leader in France in tailor-made travel (59% of 2022 sales)  with the Voyageurs du Monde  Comptoir des Voyages  Bynativ and Original Travel brands  and in adventure travel (29% of 2022 sales)  with the Terres d’Aventure  Allibert Trekking  Nomade Aventure and KE Adventure Travel brands  as well as in cycling holidays (12% of 2022 sales) with the main brands EuroFun Touristik  Loire Valley Travel  Radweg Raisen  SE Tours and Ruckenwind Reisen.The shares (ALVDM FR0004045847) are admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth market and eligible for PEA PME savings plans.Contacts:Voyageurs du Monde Lionel Habasque  Deputy CEO  T: 01 53 73 77 09Email: lhabasque@terdav.comAlain Capestan  Deputy CEO  T: 01 42 86 16 57Email: acapestan@voyageursdumonde.fr,positive,0.74,0.25,0.01,mixed,0.34,0.28,0.38,True,English,"['Excellent first half results', 'Voyageurs du Monde', 'solid outlook', 'October', '2023', 'PEA PME savings plans', 'new cycling holidays business', 'KE Adventure Travel brands', 'Voyageurs du Monde Group', 'Excellent first half results', 'major awareness campaign', 'interim financial statements', 'Loire Valley Travel', 'Original Travel brands', 'Euronext Growth market', 'excellent growth', 'excellent image', 'BUSINESS ACTIVITY', 'market leader', 'main brands', 'Tailor-made travel', 'air travel', 'train travel', 'second half', 'first quarter', 'first time', 'Press release', 'Operating expenses', 'Net income', 'sharp upturn', 'low level', 'brisk demand', 'strong growth', 'large proportion', 'alternative means', 'CO2 emissions', 'direct flights', 'latest planes', 'tight control', 'operating margin', 'high level', 'added value', 'many services', 'solid reputation', 'exceptional events', 'health crisis', 'government aid', 'The Board', 'Comptoir des', 'Allibert Trekking', 'EuroFun Touristik', 'Radweg Raisen', 'SE Tours', 'Ruckenwind Reisen', 'Lionel Habasque', 'Deputy CEO', 'Alain Capestan', 'The Group', 'solid outlook', 'Consolidated figures', 'benchmark year', 'Nomade Aventure', 'historical basis', 'total sales', 'full-year sales', '2022 sales', 'Paris', 'Change', 'EBITDA', 'owners', 'parent', 'earnings', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'backdrop', 'period', '30 June', 'departures', 'effect', 'Covid', 'integration', 'acquisitions', 'customers', 'travellers', 'transport', 'aim', 'use', 'profit', 'loss', 'majority', 'costs', 'ability', 'inflation', 'companies', '1 October', 'scope', 'turnover', 'operations', 'course', 'increase', 'Directors', '17 October', 'Reminder', 'France', 'Voyages', 'Bynativ', 'Terres', 'shares', 'Contacts', 'Email', 'voyageursdumonde', '2023', '2019', '4:00']",2023-10-18,2023-10-19,marketscreener.com

Detailed biomarker analysis of the preceeding RED DESERT and SAHARA trial patients indicates DSR mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome.Dr. Jeffrey Testani  Associate Professor at Yale University and Heart Failure Scientific Advisor to Sequana Medical  commented: “Cardiorenal syndrome is an area of key unmet clinical need in heart failure with complex  vicious cycle of negative interactions between the heart and the kidney. Based on extensive biochemical analysis  DSR appears to have the potential to interupt this vicious cycle of disease through effectively managing congestion while avoiding the widely appreciated negative effects on CRS from loop diuretics  resulting in improved cardiorenal status. This is highly encouraging and together with the positive initial data from MOJAVE  indicates the potential for DSR therapy as a promising treatment for diuretic-resistance and cardiorenal syndrome in heart failure.”Dr. Oliver Gödje  Chief Medical Officer of Sequana Medical  commented: “We are pleased that the first two patients ever treated with DSR in the US were enrolled smoothly and continue to show similar beneficial effects of DSR therapy as seen in RED DESERT and SAHARA. We are confident that after the third patient is treated and based on these favorable results  the multi-centric roll-out in Q1 2024 will start as planned and expect that DSR will demonstrate its full benefits compared to the loop diuretic control group. We are excited about the potential for DSR in cardiorenal syndrome where there is a clear need for improved therapeutic options.”Positive interim data from non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE studyThe first two patients treated in the non-randomized cohort of the MOJAVE study had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and severe diuretic resistance at baseline (mean furosemide equivalent dose of respectively 1 280 and 800 mg per day). At the start of the study treatment period  loop diuretics were withheld  and patients were treated with DSR 2.0 up to daily for four weeks.After the four-week DSR treatment period  both patients maintained euvolemia without the need of loop diuretics and showed improved cardiorenal status. Their diuretic responseii nearly normalized with a mean increase of 454% in their six-hour urinary sodium excretion versus baseline. These interim data also show a broad improvement in their kidney function with an improvement in eGFRiii  as well as blood urea nitrogeniv post-treatment vs baseline. Since both patients had HFpEF  their NT-proBNPv levels were within normal ranges at baseline and were maintained post-treatment  indicating that their stable cardiovascular status was preserved.Difference 4-week post treatment vs baseline Patient 1 Patient 2 Increase in 6-hour mmol sodium excretion +195% +712% Decrease in blood urea nitrogen -65% -52% Increase in eGFR +64% +49%To date  no clinically relevant changes in serum sodium levels or progressive hyponatremia were observed and no serious adverse events occurred  indicating that DSR 2.0 was safe and well tolerated in these first two US patients.Both patients are currently in the follow-up period without any loop diuretics (since commencing DSR therapy  the first patient is 9.5 weeks off loop diuretics and the second patient is 4 weeks off loop diuretics). The third patient in the non-randomized cohort has been enrolled and will have completed DSR treatment and initial follow-up before year end. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) meeting to review the data from the three patients in the non-randomized cohort is planned in early Q1 2024 to approve the start of the randomized cohort  planned for Q1 2024.Breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome (CRS)Cardiorenal syndrome is a key clinical challenge in heart failure and results from the combined vicious cycle of dysfunction of the heart and kidney with hypothesised complex and interconnected mechanisms such as aberrations in hemodynamic  neurohormonal  inflammatory  and sodium handling pathways. Despite the complex multidimensional pathophysiology  the resultant clinical profile is thought to manifest as a self-reinforcing negative feedback cycle characterized by decreased glomerular filtration  increased renal sodium avidity  and congestion  despite escalating diuretic doses.No current therapies have been shown to improve patient outcomes in this complex and poorly understood indication. Reducing congestion is a key element of therapy but loop diuretics exacerbate many of the core mechanisms thought to underly CRS  thus even worsening diuretic resistance and CRS. Through effective control of the volume status for an extended period of time and thereby avoiding the negative consequences of loop diuretics  DSR has the potential to break the negative feedback cycle of this important indication with clear unmet clinical needs.Extensive analysis of validated biomarkers from patients in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies shows the benefit from DSR therapy on i) volume status  ii) normalized diuretic response and dramatically reduced loop diuretic dosing  iii) improvement in kidney function  iv) neurohormonal status and signalling  as well as v) cardiovascular parameters. As previously disclosed  in these patients there were no congestion-related re-hospitalizations  a one class improvement in their NYHAvi status and a reduction of 75% in their predicated one-year mortality (based on the Seattle Heart Failure model).Data from the RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies have been submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The Company will update the market as soon as it is published.Details Conference Call and Webcast by Sequana MedicalSequana Medical management will host a conference call with a live webcast presentation tomorrow 19 October 2023 at 03:00 pm CEST / 09:00 am EST.Registration webcast: please click hereRegistration conference call (only if you wish to participate in the Q&A): please click here.

The objective is to validate the positive results from the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies in US patients using DSR 2.0.The study has started with a non-randomized cohort of three patients treated with DSR 2.0 on top of optimized usual care for congestive heart failure for up to four weeks  followed by a three-month safety follow-up period (with an initial review after 30 days). Following review and approval of the non-randomized cohort data by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) planned for early Q1 2024  up to a further 30 patients will be enrolled in the multi-center randomized cohort. The intention is for up to 20 patients to be treated with DSR 2.0 on top of optimized usual care for congestive heart failure for up to four weeks  and for up to ten patients treated with intravenous loop diuretics alone as part of maximized usual care for congestive heart failure.Primary and secondary safety and efficacy endpoints include the rate of adverse and serious adverse events and the improvement in diuretic response (measured as a six-hour urine sodium output) from baseline through the end of the treatment period. Exploratory endpoints measured from baseline through the end of the treatment period include change in weight (volume status)  creatinine (a marker of renal function)  natriuretic peptides (a marker of heart failure) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class; and the number of heart failure related rehospitalizations.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company has reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and is on track to file a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA in Q4 2023.The Company has commenced MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0 seeking to confirm the strong efficacy seen in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies.

The superior analgesic effect of Maxigesic® IV was also supported by a range of secondary endpoints  including reduced opioid usage rates.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: “I’m exceptionally proud of what the team at Hyloris achieved  together with our development partner AFT Pharmaceuticals.”“Bringing innovation by reformulating existing medicines highlights how Hyloris can improve patient outcomes  specifically by addressing the devastating opioid crisis in the biggest health care market in the world.”“Maxigesic® IV demonstrates the potential of our strategy of bringing product candidates to market within our strict criteria: a development of 7 years or less  and R&D costs averaging less than EUR 7 million.1”An exclusive license and distribution agreement for the U.S.  was already signed between Hyloris’ partner AFT Pharmaceuticals (“AFT”) and Hikma Pharmaceuticals (“Hikma”). Under the terms of the development collaboration agreement between Hyloris and AFT  Hyloris is eligible to receive a share on any product-related revenues  such as license fees  royalties and milestone payments  received by AFT.Distribution of Maxigesic® IV in U.S. hospitals should start in early 2024. Following first U.S. sales  Hyloris will be entitled to a milestone payment of USD 2 1 million. In addition  the payment of USD 1 5 million (approximately EUR 1 4 million) relating to existing trade receivables is expected.About the opioid pandemic in the U.S.The development of chronic opioid use after surgery is one of the most common post-operative complications2 with particularly devastating consequences. In the U.S.  prevalence of new chronic opioid use after surgical procedures was estimated close to 6%3.In the past 2 decades  prescription opioid usage in the U.S. contributed to over 600 000 deaths related to opioid overdoses  with the annual death toll rising tenfold between 1999 and 2021 (80 000 deaths in 2021). Nearly 17 000 deaths involved prescription opioids in 20214.Patients requiring medical attention related to opioid abuse account for around $11 billion of added costs to the U.S. healthcare system annually  or 1% of all hospital costs5.About post-operative painPost-operative pain is a normal response to surgical intervention and is a cause of delayed recovery and discharge after surgery.The global post-operative pain therapeutics market reached a value of USD 12.6 billion in 20236 and is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 4.7% to reach a value of USD 19 billion by 2032  with the U.S. as the largest market.Approximately 50 million surgeries are performed in the U.S.7 annually. Pain relief after surgery continues to be a major medical challenge with more than 80% of patients reporting acute post-operative pain8. Medical professionals are increasingly aware of the societal impact of opioid abuse  as evidenced by the decrease in opioid prescriptions over the last decade in the U.S.9  adding to the need for potent non-opioid alternatives.About Maxigesic® IVMaxigesic® IV is a unique combination of 1000mg paracetamol with 300mg ibuprofen solution for infusion for use post-operatively. Results from a randomised  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial in 276 patients following bunion surgery demonstrated that Maxigesic® IV was well-tolerated and had a faster onset of action and offered higher pain relief compared to Ibuprofen IV or Paracetamol IV alone in the same doses.Moreover  the superior analgesic effect of Maxigesic® IV was supported by a range of secondary endpoints  including reduced opioid consumption compared to the Paracetamol IV and Ibuprofen IV treatment groups (p-value < 0.005)10. Hyloris holds several patents for the U.S. market  with the latest expiring in 2038.Maxigesic® IV is  to date  licensed in over 100 countries  approved in over 40 countries and marketed in over 20 countries.About HylorisHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

The Company has launched an operational efficiency plan and strengthened its financial structure and governance  while continuing to pursue sustained sales momentum and the performance of ongoing contracts.The financial structure was strengthened in July by a capital increase with preferential subscription rights of approximately €4.6 million. This successful fundraising  oversubscribed 1.7 times  was accompanied by the arrival of two strategic investors  Éric Blanc-Garin and Yazid Sabeg  who now hold 11.93% of the capital and 8.58% of the voting rights (via their joint holding company Duna & Cie). Éric Blanc-Garin and Yazid Sabeg are seasoned entrepreneurs  having gained their experience at the head of the CS Group. They have agreed to put their expertise at ENOGIA’s service by joining the Company’s Board of Directors.This strengthening of its financial position  shareholder base and governance provides ENOGIA with the resources it needs to accelerate its growth and move towards profitability. On the operational efficiency front  ENOGIA rolled out a plan built on three main pillars in the first half of 2023. The first pillar was a reorganisation and tightening of teams  with the introduction of a leaner organisation  the creation of a dedicated “ORC Standard” business unit  and the refocusing of the turbomachinery business on the provision of services. The second pillar was a reduction in the breakeven point by reducing fixed expenses: after €1 million in savings (on an annual basis) already achieved in the first half of 2023 by adjusting headcount  reducing overheads and optimising marketing costs  around €0.5 million in additional savings are planned for the second half of the current year. Lastly  the third pillar of this operational efficiency plan was based on a significant improvement in the gross margin on ORC projects  notably thanks to production in longer series  product re-engineering and supplier negotiations. The full impact of this improvement in gross margin is expected in 2024  from projects signed in the second half of 2023.Strong sales momentum and new ORC contract in GermanyBuilding robust profitability over the long term will require increased operational efficiency combined with sustained sales activity. The good momentum that began in the second half of 2022 has been confirmed since the start of the year.The first half saw the signing of an initial order for ORC modules as part of the new Green Shield offer (economy of use). This ten-year electricity sales (PPA model) and maintenance services contract with an agricultural grouping in Normandy  covering the recovery of waste heat from an anaerobic digestion plant  is the result of a joint investment with partner Eiffel Gaz Vert.In the vast market for the decarbonisation of the maritime sector  which is a key environmental challenge  ENOGIA was selected in the spring as part of a consortium led by South Korea’s STX Engine; the Company is responsible for supplying a turbomachine that will be integrated into a system for sequestering ship exhaust gases. This sector  which is subject to new regulations  also presents major opportunities for the sale of ORC modules.On current contracts  the rollout in Germany of the largest anaerobic digestion plant has gathered pace  with the commissioning of 10 ORC modules in August 2023. Delivery of the next 30 machines is scheduled for the second half of 2023  with completion in early 2024. Moreover  this referencing has already led to the sale of four other ORC modules for agricultural biogas in Germany.2023 half-year resultsIn € thousands H1 2022 H1 2023 Change Revenue 1 041 2 353 +1 311 Operating income 2 251 3 329 +1 078 EBITDA[1] (1 534) (1 497) +37 Operating profit/(loss) (2 171) (2 216) -45 Net financial income/(expense) (40) (76) -36 Net exceptional income/(expenses) 255 389 +134 Tax credits 189 96 -93 Net profit/(loss) (1 767) (1 807) -40In the first half of 2023  the Company recorded revenue of €2.4 million  96% of which from exports (compared with 83% for the same period in 2022). It achieved growth of 126%  benefiting in part from a favourable comparison base after a first half marked by the freezing of the Chinese contract in 2022  as well as from progress on the German contract.The ORC Modules business more than doubled to €2.2 million (+137%) in the first half of 2023. The turbomachinery division recorded revenue of €0.13 million  an increase of 26%.Over the first six months  operating income increased by 47.9%. This is the result of strong business growth  while capitalised production fell by 21.5% to €0.84 million  due to the adjustment of R&D investment in Hydrogen.Purchases and external expenses were up 16.5% at €2.6 million  reflecting the performance of the German contract. Personnel expenses were down 3.5% at €1.3 million  reflecting the initial impact of the operational efficiency plan launched in the first half of 2023. First-half EBITDA was €(1.5) million and the operating loss was €2.2 million. After taking into account the research tax credit of €0.1 million  the net profit was €1.8 million  the same level as in the first half of 2022.Three-year business targets confirmedEBITDA breakeven targeted for the second half of 2023More than ever  ENOGIA is operating in an environment rich in opportunities  characterised by unprecedented needs for energy efficiency linked to high energy prices and ecological challenges. At 30 June 2023  the company had a sales pipeline[2] of over €140 million and an order book[3] of more than €5 million (€3.7 million excluding the ORC contract in China)  giving it good visibility over the second half.Over the period  business will be driven by the performance of the German contract  the acceleration of sales of ORC modules and the Green Shield offer  and the ramp-up of turbomachinery development services. ENOGIA remains confident of achieving its target of revenue growth in excess of 50% for the full year in 2023.In the second half  the path to profitability will be driven by a number of levers: economies of scale linked to the acceleration of activity and series production  improved operating efficiency following the reorganisation  the continued lowering of the breakeven point  and the increase in gross margins – particularly on the German contract. ENOGIA aims to achieve EBITDA breakeven in the second half.The Company is reiterating all of its medium-term financial targets. Revenue growth is expected to average more than 50% per year in both 2024 and 2025. This growth  combined with the operational efficiency plan that will come fully into play in 2024  should enable us to achieve positive free cash flow from 2025.Next releases:Annual revenue on 26 February 2024 after tradingAnnual results  27 March 2024 after tradingAbout ENOGIA ENOGIA responds to the major challenges of the ecological and energy transition with its unique and patented technology of compact  light and durable micro-turbomachinery.

The EUR 600 000 will be drawn in two successive tranches of EUR 300 000 – the first this week  and the second as soon as a new prospectus of BioSenic will be finalized and approved by FMSA. This will put an end to the convertible bonds program with GTO15.In light of the above  BioSenic anticipates having sufficient cash to carry out its business objectives until the end of January 2024.BioSenic is now focusing its efforts in organizing a fundraising event to allow the initiation of its phase 3 clinical trial with arsenic trioxide (ATO) to treat chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). The initiation is currently scheduled for Q2 2024.Under the terms of the present agreement  GTO15 agrees to voluntarily withdraw its latest conversion notice for EUR 1 400 000  that would have led to an issuance of 58 million of shares. In exchange for this withdrawal  GTO15 will receive from BioSenic a compensation of EUR 125 000 in convertible bonds under terms comparable to the existing ones. These convertible bonds will be issued by Company within the framework of the authorized capital.BioSenic also obtained a commitment from GTO15 not to trade more than the higher of 25% of the daily trading volume of BioSenic's shares  or alternatively 5 000 EUR per day  until the end of the program. This should efficiently limit the impact of the termination of the program on BioSenic stock.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and CEO  BioSenic said: ""BioSenic is now establishing new major financial arrangements with strong commercial partners for the execution of its long-term clinical programs. These programs will start with BioSenic’s lead clinical trial in cGvHD with oral arsenic trioxide as a drug for this disease with high unmet medical need. BioSenic's pipeline should benefit from its previous successes in Phase 2 trials in both systemic lupus erythematosus and chronic graft-versus-host disease. We are on track for 505 b2 (FDA) and Hybrid (EMA) programs  which will allow us to accelerate access to marketing approvals for related indications in the autoimmune field. BioSenic needed to secure bridge financing in the short term and is pleased to have reached a balanced  time-limited  agreement with GTO15. This make it possible for BioSenic to secure the long-term future of its ambitious projects.”About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in orthopedics.Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined a strategic positionings and strengths to use  separately and combined  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The ATO platform  which has been successfully developed  has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T and other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). cGvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. BioSenic has been successful in a Phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international Phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early Phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment.

ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. ALLOB has recently been evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2b study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late-delayed union. However  in June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in this exploratory Phase 2b clinical trial  interpreted as a failure of a too early cell injection  just after fracture. BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (choice between early or late treatment).Note: Biosenic has reevaluated a previous important and years-long clinical development program. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase 3 JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient subpopulation. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. This leads to a next generation of JTA  off-the-shelf enhanced viscosupplement to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives are intended to provide effective lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic (OA) pain and inflammation.The company  will nevertheless focus its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

The EUR 600 000 will be drawn in two successive tranches of EUR 300 000 – the first this week  and the second as soon as a new prospectus of BioSenic will be finalized and approved by FMSA. This will put an end to the convertible bonds program with GTO15.In light of the above  BioSenic anticipates having sufficient cash to carry out its business objectives until the end of January 2024.BioSenic is now focusing its efforts in organizing a fundraising event to allow the initiation of its phase 3 clinical trial with arsenic trioxide (ATO) to treat chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). The initiation is currently scheduled for Q2 2024.Under the terms of the present agreement  GTO15 agrees to voluntarily withdraw its latest conversion notice for EUR 1 400 000  that would have led to an issuance of 58 million of shares. In exchange for this withdrawal  GTO15 will receive from BioSenic a compensation of EUR 125 000 in convertible bonds under terms comparable to the existing ones. These convertible bonds will be issued by Company within the framework of the authorized capital.BioSenic also obtained a commitment from GTO15 not to trade more than the higher of 25% of the daily trading volume of BioSenic's shares  or alternatively 5 000 EUR per day  until the end of the program. This should efficiently limit the impact of the termination of the program on BioSenic stock.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and CEO  BioSenic said: ""BioSenic is now establishing new major financial arrangements with strong commercial partners for the execution of its long-term clinical programs. These programs will start with BioSenic’s lead clinical trial in cGvHD with oral arsenic trioxide as a drug for this disease with high unmet medical need. BioSenic's pipeline should benefit from its previous successes in Phase 2 trials in both systemic lupus erythematosus and chronic graft-versus-host disease. We are on track for 505 b2 (FDA) and Hybrid (EMA) programs  which will allow us to accelerate access to marketing approvals for related indications in the autoimmune field. BioSenic needed to secure bridge financing in the short term and is pleased to have reached a balanced  time-limited  agreement with GTO15. This make it possible for BioSenic to secure the long-term future of its ambitious projects.”About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in orthopedics.Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined a strategic positionings and strengths to use  separately and combined  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com .About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:The ATO platform  which has been successfully developed  has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T and other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). cGvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. BioSenic has been successful in a Phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international Phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early Phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a Phase 2 clinical protocol.

New data from TZIELD’s (teplizumab-mzwv) PROTECT Phase 3 trial were presented today at the 49th Annual ISPAD Conference  in Rotterdam  The Netherlands. PROTECT studied the efficacy and safety of TZIELD  compared to placebo  to slow the loss of beta cells and preserve beta cell function as measured by C-peptide  in children and adolescents aged 8-17 years diagnosed in the preceding 6 weeks with Stage 3 autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D). The full data set has been simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.TZIELD met the study’s primary endpoint  demonstrating superior beta cell preservation assessed by significantly slowing the decrease in mean C-peptide levels (area under the curve [AUC] after a 4-hour mixed meal tolerance test) at trial completion  compared to placebo. C-peptide is a biomarker for beta cell function. This significant difference indicates the potential of TZIELD to slow the progression of Stage 3 type 1 diabetes in this population. While the study’s key secondary endpoints did not meet statistical significance  numerical trends favoring TZIELD were seen in relevant clinical parameters. On average  people on TZIELD required numerically fewer insulin units and had numerically higher time in range  compared to those on placebo. HbA1c reductions and the overall rates of clinically important low blood sugar (hypoglycemic) events were similar among both study groups.Kevan Herold  MDC.N.H. Long Professor of Immunobiology and of Medicine (Endocrinology)  Yale School of Medicine and Primary Investigator of PROTECT.“Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease  driven by the destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells  and as such  beta cell preservation remains a meaningful unmet need for all patients with diabetes. These new results build on the findings from multiple studies across different stages of the disease process  further supporting TZIELD’s potential to modulate the progression of T1D.”Jose Eduardo Neves  M.D.Senior Vice President  Global Head of Medical Affairs  General Medicines  Sanofi“The PROTECT results are encouraging  as we believe they showcase the potential for TZIELD to slow down the progression of Stage 3 T1D in this population  as well as pointing towards favorable trends in relevant aspects for clinicians and people living with type 1 diabetes. We look forward to discussing this new data with the scientific community and regulatory authorities around the world.”The availability of the PROTECT data represents a key early milestone for Sanofi on TZIELD  following the acquisition of Provention Bio (a Sanofi Company) in April 2023. TZIELD is a strategic fit for Sanofi at the intersection of our growth in immune-mediated diseases and disease modifying therapies  and our company’s expertise in diabetes.Key ResultsThe PROTECT clinical trial was a randomized  double blind  placebo-controlled  multi-national trial. From baseline and through the trial’s completion at 78 weeks  the following was observed for TZIELD vs placebo:Primary endpointSignificantly less decrease in mean C-peptide levels (area under the concentration curve [AUC]  following a 4-hour mixed-meal tolerance test [MMTT]): difference in least-squares means (LSM) of 0.13 pmol/mL; (95% CI: 0.09  0.17; P<0.001). 94.9% of participants in the TZIELD group maintained peak C-peptide levels ≥0.2 pmol/mL  compared with 79.2% of those who received the placebo (P<0.001).difference in least-squares means (LSM) of 0.13 pmol/mL; (95% CI: 0.09  0.17; P<0.001).Secondary endpointsNumerically lower mean insulin dose in favor of TZIELD at Week 78 : the least-square mean (LSM) for insulin dose at week 78 was 0.46 U/Kg/day (TZIELD) and 0.59 U/kg/day (placebo)  difference -0.13 U/kg/day (95% CI: -0.28  0.02).: the least-square mean (LSM) for insulin dose at week 78 was 0.46 U/Kg/day (TZIELD) and 0.59 U/kg/day (placebo)  difference -0.13 U/kg/day (95% CI: -0.28  0.02). Comparable change in mean HbA1c: LSM change of -1.98% (TZIELD) vs -1.89% (placebo)  difference -0.09 (95% CI: -0.42  0.24)LSM change of -1.98% (TZIELD) vs -1.89% (placebo)  difference -0.09 (95% CI: -0.42  0.24) Numerically higher mean time in range at week 78 in favor of TZIELD (>70 but ≤180 mg/dL) : 68.7±19.6% (TZIELD) vs 64.6±22.4% (placebo). Difference of 4.71% (95% CI: -1.72  11.15).: 68.7±19.6% (TZIELD) vs 64.6±22.4% (placebo). Difference of 4.71% (95% CI: -1.72  11.15). Similar mean rates of overall clinically important hypoglycemic events: estimated rates of 4.68 (TZIELD) (95% CI: 3.70  5.91) vs 4.24 (placebo) (95% CI: 3.06  5.89) events/patient-year  with an estimated rate ratio of 1.10 (95% CI: 0.74  1.64).The safety results of the trial were consistent with previous data from TZIELD’s currently approved FDA indication to delay the onset of Stage 3 type 1 diabetes in adults and children 8 years and older diagnosed with Stage 2 T1D  as well as other prior clinical studies with TZIELD. No new safety signals were identified.Adverse events of special interest (AESI) were prespecified and occurred in 29% of those on TZIELD vs 21.6% on placebo  the most frequent one being hypoglycemia (TZIELD: 13.4%; placebo: 16.2%). Other common adverse events (AEs) were headache  nausea  rash  lymphopenia and vomiting. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by 5.5% of participant who received TZIELD vs 5.4% on placebo; the most common SAEs were cytokine release syndrome (TZIELD: 1.4%; placebo 0%) and infections (TZIELD: 0%; placebo: 2.7%).The use of TZIELD in the PROTECT population is investigational  and its safety and efficacy in this population has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About PROTECTPROTECT (NCT03875729) is a Phase 3  randomized  double blind  placebo-controlled  multi-national clinical trial. It enrolled 328 children and adolescents (TZIELD n=217  placebo n=111) aged 8-17 years diagnosed with clinical  Stage 3 T1D in the preceding 6 weeks; randomization ratio of TZIELD:placebo was 2:1. Participants received a first course of 12 daily infusions (of either TZIELD or placebo) at randomization  followed by a second course of 12 daily infusions after 26 weeks (approx. 6 months). All participants received standard-of-care as required.The primary objective of PROTECT was to determine whether TZIELD can slow down beta cell loss and preserve beta cell function measured by C-peptide  compared to placebo. This was assessed via the trial’s primary endpoint  which measured the difference in mean change of C-peptide level (area under the time-concentration curve [AUC] measured after a 4-hour mixed meal tolerance test) from baseline to Week 78 between both groups.Key secondary endpoints included HbA1c  time in range (TiR) as measured with a CGM  clinically important low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) events and exogenous insulin use. Time in range was defined as: >70 but ≤180 mg/d. Clinically relevant hypoglycemic events were defined: level 2 hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dL / 3.0 mmol/L) and level 3 hypoglycemia as episodes of severe cognitive impairment requiring external assistance for recovery  even in the absence of a blood glucose reading.Other secondary endpoints were adverse events and overall safety aspects  as well as pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of TZIELD. An observational extension study following participants for a further 42 months is ongoing.About TZIELDTZIELD (teplizumab-mzwv) is a CD3-directed monoclonal antibody. TZIELD is the first and only disease modifying therapy in autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D); it was approved by the U.S. FDA in November 2022 to delay the onset of Stage 3 type 1 diabetes in adults and children 8 years and older diagnosed with Stage 2 T1D.About autoimmune  type 1 diabetes (T1D)T1D is a chronic autoimmune condition where the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar levels is impacted due to the gradual destruction of insulin producing beta cells by one’s own immune system.There are 3 stages to the progression of T1D:In Stage 1  the autoimmune attack to the beta cells has started  and this can be detected by the presence of 2 or more T1D-related autoantibodies in the blood. During Stage 1  blood sugar levels are in a normal range. At this stage  T1D is asymptomatic.In Stage 2 (also asymptomatic)  in addition to the presence of 2 or more T1D-related autoantibodies  blood sugar levels are now abnormal (dysglycemia) due to the progressive loss of beta cells / beta cell function. People diagnosed with Stage 2 T1D have a near 100% lifetime chance of progression to Stage 3 T1D  with 75% of them progressing to it within five years.Stage 3 (also known as clinical stage) comes once a significant portion of the beta cells have been destroyed. At this point  rising blood sugar levels reach the point of clinical hyperglycemia (which defines diabetes)  and many people will experience the classic symptoms that come with the onset of Stage 3 T1D: increased thirst  frequent urination  unexplained weight loss  blurred vision and generalized fatigue. Management of Stage 3 T1D requires daily and burdensome insulin replacement therapy.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Bimekizumab is the first and only approved psoriasis treatment designed to selectively inhibit two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes - interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F).1 The approval of bimekizumab is supported by data from three Phase 3  multicenter  randomized  placebo and/or active comparator-controlled trials (BE READY  BE VIVID and BE SURE)  which evaluated the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in 1 480 adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.2 3 4""Today's FDA approval for BIMZELX is an exciting milestone that reflects our commitment to continuously improving the standard of care in plaque psoriasis and to raising expectations of what treatment can deliver. We know that completely clear skin is valued by people with psoriasis and  in our Phase 3 trials  at week 16  85-91% of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved clear or almost clear skin  with 59-68% achieving the goal of complete clearance "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB. ""With bimekizumab now approved for psoriasis  we will move forward rapidly to submit applications for additional indications in the U.S.""""We have been eagerly awaiting bimekizumab  the first IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor  to be approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In Phase 3/3b trials  bimekizumab achieved superior levels of skin clearance at week 16 compared to placebo and three existing biologics for psoriasis  with responses being rapid and lasting up to a year. Long-term data have also shown that the majority of patients maintained high levels of clinical response through three years "" said Mark Lebwohl  MD  bimekizumab investigator  Dean for Clinical Therapeutics  Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  and Chairman Emeritus  Kimberly and Eric J. Waldman Department of Dermatology.Psoriasis affects more than 7.5 million adults in the U.S. and impacts much more than the skin itself.5 In addition to the recognized skin symptoms such as itching and flaking  psoriasis can place strains on patients and their families  impacting work  relationships and home lives.6 7 A U.S. observational study (n=846) reported that only one in four patients achieved self-assessed complete skin clearance after six months of treatment with biologics highlighting the burden of plaque psoriasis and the need for additional new treatment options.8The FDA recommended dosage of bimekizumab for psoriasis patients is 320 mg (given as two subcutaneous injections of 160 mg each) at Weeks 0  4  8  12 and 16  then every 8 weeks thereafter.1 For patients weighing ≥120 kg  a dose of 320 mg every 4 weeks after week 16 may be considered.1 Bimekizumab may be administered by a healthcare professional  or a patient may self-inject after proper training.1 Bimekizumab is available as an autoinjector and a pre-filled syringe.1 Bimekizumab will be available in the U.S. in approximately one month.""The approval of bimekizumab will provide an important new treatment option for adults living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis "" said Leah McCormick Howard  J.D.  President and CEO for the National Psoriasis Foundation. ""Our hope is that new treatments translate into improved outcomes for many and help alleviate the physical and emotional burden of psoriasis.""Jean-Christophe Tellier  CEO  UCB added  ""We are pleased to deliver new options for people living with severe diseases as part of an unprecedented series of product launches from UCB around the world. Delivering these solutions draws on our scientific expertise and understanding of disease biology and our legacy of deep understanding of patients to provide differentiated treatments. Our continued work embodies what UCB stands for - that we are inspired by patients  driven by science.""UCB expects global peak sales for BIMZELX of at least €4bn.Key Findings from the Phase 3 Clinical Development ProgramThe efficacy and safety of bimekizumab were evaluated in three Phase 3 studies  versus placebo and ustekinumab (BE VIVID)  versus placebo (BE READY) and versus adalimumab (BE SURE).2 3 4 All studies met their co-primary endpoints and all ranked secondary endpoints.2 3 4Patients treated with bimekizumab achieved superior levels of skin clearance at week 16  compared to those who received ustekinumab (ranked secondary endpoint  BE VIVID; p<0.0001)  placebo (co-primary endpoint  BE READY and BE VIVID; p<0.0001) and adalimumab (co-primary endpoint  BE SURE; p<0.001)  as measured by at least a 90 percent improvement in the Psoriasis Area & Severity Index (PASI 90) and an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) response of clear or almost clear skin (IGA 0/1).2 3 4 Ranked secondary endpoints included PASI 75 at week 4 and PASI 100 (complete skin clearance) at week 16.2 3 4 Key findings across all studies include:Clear or Almost Clear Skin : More than eight out of 10 patients receiving bimekizumab (320 mg every four weeks [Q4W]) achieved PASI 90 and IGA 0/1 at week 16. 2 3 4Complete Skin Clearance : Approximately six out of 10 patients receiving bimekizumab (320 mg Q4W) achieved PASI 100 at week 16. 2 3 4Speed of Response : Clinical responses achieved with bimekizumab were rapid  with more than seven out of 10 patients achieving PASI 75 at week 4 following one dose (320 mg). 2 3 4Maintenance of Response: Clinical responses achieved with bimekizumab at week 16 (PASI 90 and PASI 100) were maintained for up to one year.2 3 4 Long-term data showed that clinical responses were maintained in the vast majority of patients through to three years of bimekizumab treatment.9The most common adverse reactions (≥ 1%) are upper respiratory infections  oral candidiasis  headache  injection site reactions  tinea infections  gastroenteritis  Herpes Simplex Infections  acne  folliculitis  other Candida infections  and fatigue.1Notes to Editors:Dr. Lebwohl is an investigator for UCB. He has not accepted any consulting payments from UCB.About BIMZELX (bimekizumab-bkzx)Bimekizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to IL-17A  IL-17F and IL-17AF cytokines  blocking their interaction with the IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor complex.1 Elevated levels of IL-17A and IL-17F are found in lesional psoriatic skin.1Please see Important Safety Information below and full U.S. prescribing information at www.UCB-USA.com/Innovation/Products/BIMZELX and www.BIMZELX.com.BIMZELX U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONSuicidal Ideation and BehaviorBIMZELX® (bimekizumab-bkzx) may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior (SI/B). A causal association between treatment with BIMZELX and increased risk of SI/B has not been established. Prescribers should weigh the potential risks and benefits before using BIMZELX in patients with a history of severe depression or SI/B. Advise monitoring for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal ideation  or other mood changes. If such changes occur  advise to promptly seek medical attention  refer to a mental health professional as appropriate  and re-evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment.InfectionsBIMZELX may increase the risk of infections. Do not initiate treatment with BIMZELX in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection  consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing BIMZELX. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of clinically important infection occur. If a patient develops such an infection or is not responding to standard therapy  monitor the patient closely and do not administer BIMZELX until the infection resolves.TuberculosisEvaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with BIMZELX. Avoid the use of BIMZELX in patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering BIMZELX. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of BIMZELX in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.Liver Biochemical AbnormalitiesElevated serum transaminases were reported in clinical trials with BIMZELX. Test liver enzymes  alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin at baseline  periodically during treatment with BIMZELX and according to routine patient management. If treatment-related increases in liver enzymes occur and drug-induced liver injury is suspected  interrupt BIMZELX until a diagnosis of liver injury is excluded. Permanently discontinue use of BIMZELX in patients with causally associated combined elevations of transaminases and bilirubin. Avoid use of BIMZELX in patients with acute liver disease or cirrhosis.Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseCases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been reported in patients treated with IL-17 inhibitors  including BIMZELX. Avoid use of BIMZELX in patients with active IBD. During BIMZELX treatment  monitor patients for signs and symptoms of IBD and discontinue treatment if new onset or worsening of signs and symptoms occurs.ImmunizationsPrior to initiating therapy with BIMZELX  complete all age-appropriate vaccinations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid the use of live vaccines in patients treated with BIMZELX.Most Common Adverse ReactionsMost common adverse reactions (≥ 1%) are upper respiratory infections  oral candidiasis  headache  injection site reactions  tinea infections  gastroenteritis  Herpes Simplex Infections  acne  folliculitis  other Candida infections  and fatigue.BIMZELX®▼(bimekizumab) EU/EEA* Important Safety InformationThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with bimekizumab were upper respiratory tract infections (14.5%  14.6%  16.3% in plaque psoriasis (PSO)  psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)  respectively) and oral candidiasis (7.3%  2.3%  3.7% in PSO  PsA and axSpA  respectively). Common adverse reactions (≥1/100 to <1/10) were oral candidiasis  tinea infections  ear infections  herpes simplex infections  oropharyngeal candidiasis  gastroenteritis  folliculitis  headache  rash  dermatitis and eczema  acne  injection site reactions  fatigue. Elderly may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions such as oral candidiasis  dermatitis and eczema when using bimekizumab.Bimekizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients and in patients with clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis).Bimekizumab may increase the risk of infections. Treatment with bimekizumab must not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection. Patients treated with bimekizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient develops an infection the patient should be carefully monitored. If the infection becomes serious or is not responding to standard therapy  treatment should be discontinued until the infection resolves. Prior to initiating treatment with bimekizumab  patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Bimekizumab should not be given in patients with active TB. Patients receiving bimekizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB.Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with bimekizumab. Bimekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease  bimekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical management should be initiated.Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been observed with IL-17 inhibitors. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs  administration of bimekizumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.Live vaccines should not be given in patients treated with bimekizumab.Please consult the summary of product characteristics in relation to other side effects  full safety and prescribing information.European SmPC date of revision: June 2023.https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/bimzelx-epar-product-information_en.pdf*EU/EEA means European Union/European Economic AreaLast accessed: October 2023.▼This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring.

Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

In Paris' Central Business District it came to Including Neuilly-Levallois and Boulogne-Issy  it represents +4.7%  linked mainly to the combined impact of the indexation of rents and the positive reversion captured at the end of leases. On the La Défense market (8% of the Group's office portfolio)  Gecina's rental income is up by nearly +13% like-for-like.o More than half of this performance is linked to a significant increase in the occupancy rate for the Group's buildings  resulting from the major rental transactions secured in2021 and 2022 on buildings that were previously vacant (Carré Michelet  Adamas) and that gradually ramped up the Group's rental income in this sector during 2022.o The rest is linked mainly to indexation . Reversion had only a marginally positive impact on this sector  since Gecina's portfolio in this area is fully let and therefore not subject to tenant rotations. Rental income growth on a current basiscame to nearly +8% for offices  reflecting the impact of the pipeline's positive net contribution  which has been particularly significant this year (+€16.4m net of tenant departures from buildings to be redeveloped)  taking into account the delivery of the l1ve and Boétie buildings in Paris' CBD and 157 CdG in Neuilly. These deliveries have largely offset the buildings that were vacated mid-2022 and are currently being redeveloped  with their delivery scheduled for 2025 (Icône-Marbeuf and Flandre-27 Canal in Paris).

In Paris' Central Business District it came to Including Neuilly-Levallois and Boulogne-Issy  it represents +4.7%  linked mainly to the combined impact of the indexation of rents and the positive reversion captured at the end of leases. On the La Défense market (8% of the Group's office portfolio)  Gecina's rental income is up by nearly +13% like-for-like.o More than half of this performance is linked to a significant increase in the occupancy rate for the Group's buildings  resulting from the major rental transactions secured in2021 and 2022 on buildings that were previously vacant (Carré Michelet  Adamas) and that gradually ramped up the Group's rental income in this sector during 2022.o The rest is linked mainly to indexation . Reversion had only a marginally positive impact on this sector  since Gecina's portfolio in this area is fully let and therefore not subject to tenant rotations. Rental income growth on a current basiscame to nearly +8% for offices  reflecting the impact of the pipeline's positive net contribution  which has been particularly significant this year (+€16.4m net of tenant departures from buildings to be redeveloped)  taking into account the delivery of the l1ve and Boétie buildings in Paris' CBD and 157 CdG in Neuilly. These deliveries have largely offset the buildings that were vacated mid-2022 and are currently being redeveloped  with their delivery scheduled for 2025 (Icône-Marbeuf and Flandre-27 Canal in Paris).

Revenue growth on a like-for-like basis of 7.0%.Group EBITDA decreased by 5.6% to €621.4m  impacted by lower subsidies  high salary and procurement inflation and staff shortage challenges.Group share of net result after tax of €49.4m or 1.1% of revenue more than halved compared to the prior year of €118.4m from lower operating result and increased cost of debt.Cost control measures reinforced to address current economic headwinds impacting the sector  to pursue our “Yes We Care 2025” strategy implementing global patient pathways  and to maintain our leadership as a European integrated care provider.Slight reduction of the net debt to €3 670m including IFRS16 liabilities  from working capital improvement linked to collection of past subsidies.The company became a mission-driven company at the AGM on 8 December 2022  and appointments of the members of its mission committee were approved by the Board on 20 June 2023.Ramsay Santé has maintained its actions to participate in the support of the French and Nordic countries healthcare systems and to complement public hospital capacity to cope with demand pressures.Continued commitment to enhancing care accessibility through out-of-hospital services (primary care  imaging  specialised care consultations  home care) supported a return to activity growth overall with a 4.4% increase in patient admissions in our hospital facilities and 1.6 million additional patient consultations in our Nordic primary care centres over the previous year.Activity levels in France and the Nordics have been solid. Annual revenue amounted to €4 701.5m  up 9.3% on a reported basis  and +7.0% on a like-for-like basis. France revenue has grown by 6.8% supported by a 4.0% increase in admissions volumes  higher tariffs applicable since 1 st March 2023 and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue. This is despite 3 fewer business days this financial year compared to the previous one.

Nordic countries revenue grew by 15.2% (+7.8% on a like-for-like basis) supported by an additional €202m contribution from recent acquisitions including GHP and was mainly realised in the proximity care and specialist care activities in both Sweden and Denmark. The group consolidated EBITDA decreased by 5.6% or €37m to €621.4m (last year €658.4m) with a margin of 13.2% (last year 15.3%)  mainly due to the €89m decrease of Covid-related government subsidies and of the French revenue guarantee  partly offset by further cost control actions.Cost of net financial debt increased by €23.6m or 19.1% reflecting higher funding costs and including a €3.0m increase in IFRS16 lease debt interest expense.Net profit for the Group share dropped to €49.4m or 1.1% of revenue (last year €118.4m or 2.8% of revenue)  impacted by lower operational margins and reflecting increased funding costs. It includes a non-recurring €31.0m (€24.2m net of tax) capital gain for the sale of land adjacent to one of our facilities in Norway as part of transactions restructuring the real estate of this site.Ramsay Santé has continued to invest in initiatives enabling its “Yes We Care 2025” strategy in addition to recurring investment on maintenance  optimisation and facilities portfolio improvement  resulting in total capital expenditure for the year of €165.1m net of proceeds from disposals  slightly below last year.Net cash flow from operating activities of €598.9m versus €262.5m last year reflects the effort on working capital management and the collection during the period of Covid-related subsidies recognised in the prior year.Net financial debt as at 30 June 2023 amounted to €3 670.0m  including €2 141.5m of IFRS16 lease liabilities. During the first semester of this fiscal year  Ramsay Santé successfully issued a new Fiducie tranche for €150m.Ramsay Santé has become a mission-driven company  making access to care for all patients a central part of its business model. This decision reflects its firm resolve to place the public interest at the heart of all its day-to-day actions.The Group aims to make this mission a lever for action in the face of the accelerating pace of all the challenges currently affecting healthcare. Alongside its purpose added to the Group's by-laws (""Improve health through constant innovation"")  four social and environmental objectives will guide the implementation of its policies and innovation  objectives whose implementation will be followed by the Mission Committee that has been set up.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:“As a mission-driven company since December 2022  Ramsay Santé demonstrates and reaffirms the core identity of the organisation to cater for the healthcare needs of the general population as a whole. This mission seals the company’s commitment to orchestrate safer and simpler care pathways  from prevention to follow-up. The group has continued its development in accordance with this goal by caring for nearly 12 million patients in 2022-23 in our various countries and activities. We are now more than ever caring for all patients with any pathology  offering physical and digital solutions  and operating in full complementarity with all the other care professionals. The transfer of best practices and innovation in healthcare between countries enables the continuous implementation of our differentiating strategy as a global healthcare operator and healthcare pathways coordinator  which is positive for our patients  our payors  and the organisation.With respect to financial results  revenue growth of 9.3% was primarily driven organically  the operating margin - EBITDA - was down to 13.2% vs 15.3% last year  in a context of high inflation  lower subsidies  and despite the initiation of cost control measures.”The Board of Directors approved the consolidated accounts as of the end of June 2023 at its meeting held on 18th October 2023. The audit procedures on the consolidated accounts have been carried out.

The structure of the arrangements up until 31 December 2022 were similar to prior periods  however the decree covering the calendar year 2022 excluded mental health services now reimbursed under a bundled payment structure. The French Government prolonged its support to the industry through a modified revenue guarantee scheme for the calendar year up to 31 December 2023. This new guarantee amounts to 70% of the 2022 guarantee (tariff adjusted) plus 30% of the period billings.The amount of the revenue guarantee recognised by the Group for the year ending 30 June 2023 amounts to €89 million (€99 million for the previous year) and was reported as “Other operating income”.Furthermore  compensation grants for additional costs related to COVID were recognised for €24.6 million (€89.8 million for the previous financial year) as “Other operating income”. Given the time lag between when costs are incurred by facilities and the notification by the Regional Health Authorities of the corresponding subsidies  all of those compensation subsidies reported during the period (€27.5 million in the previous year) correspond to financing for additional costs incurred during the previous financial year  a situation similar to that of last year.In addition to those Covid-related subsidies  specific grants totalling of €45m were extended to the French facilities to fund inflation that had not been sized in the applicable 2022 tariffs  as well as national healthcare staff salary increases applicable from 1st July 2022.The group continued its expansion in its core strategic development areas:On 1st March 2023  the Ange Gardien mental health clinic re-opened its doors following an extensive redevelopment of the facility and merger with the neighbouring Perreuse clinic into a single expanded modern site. The 232 beds and 15 day places will significantly enhance the mental health services proposed to the greater eastern Ile-de-France region.Two primary care centres opened their doors in late 2022 in France and the Haussmann medical centre in central Paris joined the Ramsay Santé network in January 2023.Nordics countriesThe positive development trend in adding listed patients into our Proximity care business has continued in both Sweden and Denmark through a dedicated work to improve both availability and attractivity in our facilities  whereas Norway is concentrating on the integration of the bolt-on acquisitions completed during the prior year. Patient demand in our Specialist care facilities in all countries has been increasing. The integration the GHP business acquired in May 2022 is progressing according to plan and synergies have been realised as expected to date. Finally  Capio has started operating two new geriatrics care contracts in Stockholm on 1st May 2023 representing an annual turnover of approximately €50m  and St Göran has opened its new maternity ward in Stockholm on 1st April 2023.Scope of consolidationRamsay Santé completed 2 small bolt-on acquisitions in Scandinavia during the year  complementing and expanding the scope of the Group's services. Together with the Haussmann medical centre which joined the primary care network in France  these acquisitions represented a total net investment of €7 million.Comments on the annual accountsActivity and revenue:Activity and revenue in France and the Nordic countries have grown across the board reflecting sustained patient demand and the capacity of the group’s facilities to provide more care services despite staffing challenges from competition for nursing staff in Europe. Ramsay Santé Group reported a consolidated revenue of €4 701.5m for the financial year ended 30 June 2023  up 9.3% on a reported basis. Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  revenue for the year ended 30 June 2023 was up with a solid 7.0% organic sales growth.France revenue has grown by 6.8% supported by an increase in volumes and in revenue medical purchases rechargeable revenue  despite 3 fewer business days this year compared to FY22 and the continuing shift towards a greater ambulatory care mix.France total admissions in our hospitals rose by 4.0% with volumes growth on all business lines  extending and confirming the post-Covid positive dynamics from late FY22  after a slow start in FY23:+3.0% in MSO (medicine  surgery and obstetrics)+11.4% in FCR (follow-up care and rehabilitation)+5.3% in mental healthOur French facilities managed approximately 720 000 emergency presentations this year  confirming their important role in delivering on public service missions.Nordic countries revenue grew by 15.2% supported by acquisitions made in FY22 which contributed €202m of additional revenue  including GHP. Organic revenue growth in the Nordic countries for the year ending 30 June 2023 was +7.8% on a like-for-like basis from continued positive revenue growth in the proximity care and specialist care activities in both Sweden and Denmark  together with the contribution of new contracts. Foreign exchange fluctuation has negatively impacted revenue by €106.7m.Patient admissions in our Nordic countries hospital facilities increased by 9.7% and the organic growth of patients listed in our proximity care centres was 3.5%.Results:EBITDA reached €621.4m for the financial year ending 30 June 2023  down €37m or 5.6% on prior year on a reported basis.The Group's EBITDA as at 30 June 2023 includes €88.9m (last year €99.1m) related to the revenue guarantee described in the paragraph “Significant events of the financial year” above  as well as cost compensations for Covid surcharges in France and Sweden of €33.2m (last year €111.7m). Those Covid-related grants tapered off from levels received in prior years as the Covid pandemic intensity greatly abated over the course of the financial year.EBITDA and margins were also driven down by inflationary pressures sustained from the impact of the effort made on the compensations and benefits made to our medical staff as well as overall operating expenditure price increases  in particular on energy and outsourced services. Ramsay Santé received funding from the French government which only partially covered procurement and wages inflation through €45m dedicated grants then followed by tariff increases from 1 March 2023. A similar pattern occurred in the Nordic countries where cost inflation outstripped the price revisions obtained from the different payors.EBITDA has a benefited from organic growth contribution on margins and from more stability in volumes growth over the year allowing for a greater focus on operational efficiency.Cost control measures were initiated to adapt activities to the current inflation environment and resources allocation are also revisited as a consequence.Underlying current operating profit amounted to €218.2m for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 (or 4.6% of revenue)  down 22.4% on the previous year.Other non-current income and expenses represent a net income of €22.2m for the year ending 30 June 2023 (last year €10.2m)  consisting mainly of a €31.0m profit on the sale of a property adjacent to a hospital in Norway that is to be redeveloped.The cost of net financial debt amounted to €147.1m for the year ending 30 June 2023  compared with €123.5 million the previous year  driven by higher funding costs. The impact of financial instruments recorded in P&L was a €5.5m income (€22.5m income last year)  contributing to a further €17.0m increase in the net interest expense on the prior year. In accordance with IFRS 16  the Group recorded a financial interest expense of €75.3m related to lease debt (€72.3m the previous year).The Group’s share of net income for the year ended 30 June 2023 amounted to €49.4m  or 1.1% of revenue  compared with €118.4m last year.Impact from IFRS16 Lease :Reported EBITDA of €621.4m in accordance with IFRS16 excludes contracted lease expenses for €239.8m which are instead recorded as amortisation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease debt as outlined in the table below. The increase in the lease accounting impact on the prior year primarily came from the full-year contribution of FY22 acquisitions  as well as the effect of contractual price revisions.EUR millions30 June 202330 June 2022Δ IFRS16 Impact Pre-IFRS16 IFRS16 Impact Pre-IFRS16 Impact EBITDA621.4 239.8 381.6658.4 219.1 439.320.7 Depreciation & amortisation (403.2) (192.3) (210.9) (377.3) (175.4) (201.9) (16.9) EBIT before non-current items 218.2 47.5 170.7 281.1 43.7 237.4 3.8 Net interest expense (152.7) (72.7) (80.0) (106.1) (69.4) (36.7) (3.3) Net profit after tax 63.9 (18.9) 82.8 127.8 (19.1) 146.9 0.2Cash-flow and financing :Net financial debt on 30 June 2023 was €3 670.0m compared with €3 709.9m on 30 June 2022. Net debt includes €1 893.8m in non-current borrowings and €58.8m in current borrowings  offset by €352.2m in cash and cash equivalents.The application of IFRS 16 to leases contributed €2 141.5m to net financial debt at 30 June 2023  of which €1 928.0m was non-current lease debt and €213.5m was current lease debt.Net cash increased by €219.7m over the period with a €186m contribution from increased borrowings. The cash flow from operating activities benefited from a favourable working capital variation encompassing the collection of subsidies recognised in the prior year.Total capital expenditure for the year of €165.1m was slightly below last year’s €175.4m and included maintenance and optimisation  as well as improvement on our portfolio of clinics. This covers the maternity expansion of St Göran as well as significant effort to roll out our strategy to increase Ramsay Santé’s imaging assets portfolio  to invest on digital tools  amongst which the new version of the Ramsay Services portal  and to acquire new equipment such as surgical robots for our French clinics.During the first half of this fiscal year  Ramsay Santé carried out a new tranche of Fiducie debt for a total financing amount of €150m  diversifying its funding sources and maturity profiles  as well as aligning it with the sustainable development strategy of the group through an indexation to ESG criteria.About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.

Revenue growth on a like-for-like basis of 7.0%.Group EBITDA decreased by 5.6% to €621.4m  impacted by lower subsidies  high salary and procurement inflation and staff shortage challenges.Group share of net result after tax of €49.4m or 1.1% of revenue more than halved compared to the prior year of €118.4m from lower operating result and increased cost of debt.Cost control measures reinforced to address current economic headwinds impacting the sector  to pursue our “Yes We Care 2025” strategy implementing global patient pathways  and to maintain our leadership as a European integrated care provider.Slight reduction of the net debt to €3 670m including IFRS16 liabilities  from working capital improvement linked to collection of past subsidies.The company became a mission-driven company at the AGM on 8 December 2022  and appointments of the members of its mission committee were approved by the Board on 20 June 2023.Ramsay Santé has maintained its actions to participate in the support of the French and Nordic countries healthcare systems and to complement public hospital capacity to cope with demand pressures.Continued commitment to enhancing care accessibility through out-of-hospital services (primary care  imaging  specialised care consultations  home care) supported a return to activity growth overall with a 4.4% increase in patient admissions in our hospital facilities and 1.6 million additional patient consultations in our Nordic primary care centres over the previous year.Activity levels in France and the Nordics have been solid. Annual revenue amounted to €4 701.5m  up 9.3% on a reported basis  and +7.0% on a like-for-like basis. France revenue has grown by 6.8% supported by a 4.0% increase in admissions volumes  higher tariffs applicable since 1 st March 2023 and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue. This is despite 3 fewer business days this financial year compared to the previous one. Nordic countries revenue grew by 15.2% (+7.8% on a like-for-like basis) supported by an additional €202m contribution from recent acquisitions including GHP and was mainly realised in the proximity care and specialist care activities in both Sweden and Denmark.March 2023 and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue. This is despite 3 fewer business days this financial year compared to the previous one. Nordic countries revenue grew by 15.2% (+7.8% on a like-for-like basis) supported by an additional €202m contribution from recent acquisitions including GHP and was mainly realised in the proximity care and specialist care activities in both Sweden and Denmark. The group consolidated EBITDA decreased by 5.6% or €37m to €621.4m (last year €658.4m) with a margin of 13.2% (last year 15.3%)  mainly due to the €89m decrease of Covid-related government subsidies and of the French revenue guarantee  partly offset by further cost control actions.Cost of net financial debt increased by €23.6m or 19.1% reflecting higher funding costs and including a €3.0m increase in IFRS16 lease debt interest expense.Net profit for the Group share dropped to €49.4m or 1.1% of revenue (last year €118.4m or 2.8% of revenue)  impacted by lower operational margins and reflecting increased funding costs. It includes a non-recurring €31.0m (€24.2m net of tax) capital gain for the sale of land adjacent to one of our facilities in Norway as part of transactions restructuring the real estate of this site.Ramsay Santé has continued to invest in initiatives enabling its “Yes We Care 2025” strategy in addition to recurring investment on maintenance  optimisation and facilities portfolio improvement  resulting in total capital expenditure for the year of €165.1m net of proceeds from disposals  slightly below last year.Net cash flow from operating activities of €598.9m versus €262.5m last year reflects the effort on working capital management and the collection during the period of Covid-related subsidies recognised in the prior year.Net financial debt as at 30 June 2023 amounted to €3 670.0m  including €2 141.5m of IFRS16 lease liabilities. During the first semester of this fiscal year  Ramsay Santé successfully issued a new Fiducie tranche for €150m.Ramsay Santé has become a mission-driven company  making access to care for all patients a central part of its business model. This decision reflects its firm resolve to place the public interest at the heart of all its day-to-day actions.The Group aims to make this mission a lever for action in the face of the accelerating pace of all the challenges currently affecting healthcare. Alongside its purpose added to the Group's by-laws (""Improve health through constant innovation"")  four social and environmental objectives will guide the implementation of its policies and innovation  objectives whose implementation will be followed by the Mission Committee that has been set up.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:“As a mission-driven company since December 2022  Ramsay Santé demonstrates and reaffirms the core identity of the organisation to cater for the healthcare needs of the general population as a whole. This mission seals the company’s commitment to orchestrate safer and simpler care pathways  from prevention to follow-up. The group has continued its development in accordance with this goal by caring for nearly 12 million patients in 2022-23 in our various countries and activities. We are now more than ever caring for all patients with any pathology  offering physical and digital solutions  and operating in full complementarity with all the other care professionals. The transfer of best practices and innovation in healthcare between countries enables the continuous implementation of our differentiating strategy as a global healthcare operator and healthcare pathways coordinator  which is positive for our patients  our payors  and the organisation.With respect to financial results  revenue growth of 9.3% was primarily driven organically  the operating margin - EBITDA - was down to 13.2% vs 15.3% last year  in a context of high inflation  lower subsidies  and despite the initiation of cost control measures.”The Board of Directors approved the consolidated accounts as of the end of June 2023 at its meeting held on 18th October 2023. The audit procedures on the consolidated accounts have been carried out. The auditors’ certification report will be issued after finalization of the verification of the management report and the procedures required for the purposes of filing the universal registration document. In line with its position in recent years  the Board of Directors meeting on October 18  2023 unanimously decided not to propose a dividend payment for the year ending June 30  2023 to the next Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.The consolidated financial statements and reports will be available to the public when the company's universal registration document is published at the end of October 2023.Summary of resultsP&L – in € millions From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 Variation Revenue 4 701.5 4 301.0 +9.3% EBITDA 621.4 658.4 -5.6% As a % of revenue +13.2% +15.3% -2.1 pts Current Operating Result 218.2 281.1 -22.4% As a % of revenue +4.6% +6.5% -1.9 pts Operating Profit 240.4 291.3 -17.5% As a % of revenue +5.1% +6.8% -1.7 pts Net income  Group Share 49.4 118.4 -58.3% Earnings per share (in €) 0.45 1.07 -57.9%Net Financial Debt – in € millions From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 Non-current financial liabilities 1 893.8 1 763.6 Non-current lease liability 1 928.0 1 922.3 Current lease liability 213.5 196.0 Current financial liabilities 58.8 35.4 (Cash and cash equivalents) (352.2) (132.5) Other financial (assets) & liabilities (71.9) (74.9) Net financial debt 3 670.0 3 709.9Cash Flow Statement – in € millions From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 EBITDA 621.4 658.4 Change in working capital requirements 53.5 (337.9) Net cash flow from operating activities 598.9 262.5 Net cash flow from/(used in) investing activities (175.4) (471.1) Net cash flow from/(used in) financing activities (197.1) (264.2) Change in net cash position 226.4 (472.8) Closing cash and cash equivalents 352.2 132.5Breakdown of revenue by operating segmentIn € million From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 Variation Île-de-France 1 127.7 1 057.9 +6.6% Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes 633.1 579.6 +9.2% Hauts de France 413.2 393.4 +5.0% Occitanie 287.3 271.6 +5.8% Other regions 746.2 701.0 +6.4% Nordic countries 1 494.0 1 297.4 +15.2% Reported Revenue 4 701.5 4 301.0 +9.3%Note : The table above details the contributions of the various operating segments to the Group's consolidated revenue.Changes in reported revenue from the financial year ended 30 June 2022 to the financial yearended 30 June 2023.Reported revenue30 June 2022 Changes in FX rates Acquisitions and disposals Organic growth Reported revenue30 June 2023 Variation In € millions 4.301.0 (106.7) 205.8 301.4 4.701.5 400.5 (2.5)% 4.8% 7.0% +9.3%Significant events of the financial year:FranceRamsay Santé's hospitals in France continued to operate under the French Government's revenue guarantee arrangements  which supported the business for the use of its facilities and services during the Covid pandemic and helped compensate its negative effects on activity. The structure of the arrangements up until 31 December 2022 were similar to prior periods  however the decree covering the calendar year 2022 excluded mental health services now reimbursed under a bundled payment structure. The French Government prolonged its support to the industry through a modified revenue guarantee scheme for the calendar year up to 31 December 2023. This new guarantee amounts to 70% of the 2022 guarantee (tariff adjusted) plus 30% of the period billings.The amount of the revenue guarantee recognised by the Group for the year ending 30 June 2023 amounts to €89 million (€99 million for the previous year) and was reported as “Other operating income”.Furthermore  compensation grants for additional costs related to COVID were recognised for €24.6 million (€89.8 million for the previous financial year) as “Other operating income”. Given the time lag between when costs are incurred by facilities and the notification by the Regional Health Authorities of the corresponding subsidies  all of those compensation subsidies reported during the period (€27.5 million in the previous year) correspond to financing for additional costs incurred during the previous financial year  a situation similar to that of last year.In addition to those Covid-related subsidies  specific grants totalling of €45m were extended to the French facilities to fund inflation that had not been sized in the applicable 2022 tariffs  as well as national healthcare staff salary increases applicable from 1st July 2022.The group continued its expansion in its core strategic development areas:On 1st March 2023  the Ange Gardien mental health clinic re-opened its doors following an extensive redevelopment of the facility and merger with the neighbouring Perreuse clinic into a single expanded modern site. The 232 beds and 15 day places will significantly enhance the mental health services proposed to the greater eastern Ile-de-France region.Two primary care centres opened their doors in late 2022 in France and the Haussmann medical centre in central Paris joined the Ramsay Santé network in January 2023.Nordics countriesThe positive development trend in adding listed patients into our Proximity care business has continued in both Sweden and Denmark through a dedicated work to improve both availability and attractivity in our facilities  whereas Norway is concentrating on the integration of the bolt-on acquisitions completed during the prior year. Patient demand in our Specialist care facilities in all countries has been increasing. The integration the GHP business acquired in May 2022 is progressing according to plan and synergies have been realised as expected to date. Finally  Capio has started operating two new geriatrics care contracts in Stockholm on 1st May 2023 representing an annual turnover of approximately €50m  and St Göran has opened its new maternity ward in Stockholm on 1st April 2023.Scope of consolidationRamsay Santé completed 2 small bolt-on acquisitions in Scandinavia during the year  complementing and expanding the scope of the Group's services. Together with the Haussmann medical centre which joined the primary care network in France  these acquisitions represented a total net investment of €7 million.Comments on the annual accountsActivity and revenue:Activity and revenue in France and the Nordic countries have grown across the board reflecting sustained patient demand and the capacity of the group’s facilities to provide more care services despite staffing challenges from competition for nursing staff in Europe. Ramsay Santé Group reported a consolidated revenue of €4 701.5m for the financial year ended 30 June 2023  up 9.3% on a reported basis. Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  revenue for the year ended 30 June 2023 was up with a solid 7.0% organic sales growth.France revenue has grown by 6.8% supported by an increase in volumes and in revenue medical purchases rechargeable revenue  despite 3 fewer business days this year compared to FY22 and the continuing shift towards a greater ambulatory care mix.France total admissions in our hospitals rose by 4.0% with volumes growth on all business lines  extending and confirming the post-Covid positive dynamics from late FY22  after a slow start in FY23:+3.0% in MSO (medicine  surgery and obstetrics)+11.4% in FCR (follow-up care and rehabilitation)+5.3% in mental healthOur French facilities managed approximately 720 000 emergency presentations this year  confirming their important role in delivering on public service missions.Nordic countries revenue grew by 15.2% supported by acquisitions made in FY22 which contributed €202m of additional revenue  including GHP. Organic revenue growth in the Nordic countries for the year ending 30 June 2023 was +7.8% on a like-for-like basis from continued positive revenue growth in the proximity care and specialist care activities in both Sweden and Denmark  together with the contribution of new contracts. Foreign exchange fluctuation has negatively impacted revenue by €106.7m.Patient admissions in our Nordic countries hospital facilities increased by 9.7% and the organic growth of patients listed in our proximity care centres was 3.5%.Results:EBITDA reached €621.4m for the financial year ending 30 June 2023  down €37m or 5.6% on prior year on a reported basis.The Group's EBITDA as at 30 June 2023 includes €88.9m (last year €99.1m) related to the revenue guarantee described in the paragraph “Significant events of the financial year” above  as well as cost compensations for Covid surcharges in France and Sweden of €33.2m (last year €111.7m). Those Covid-related grants tapered off from levels received in prior years as the Covid pandemic intensity greatly abated over the course of the financial year.EBITDA and margins were also driven down by inflationary pressures sustained from the impact of the effort made on the compensations and benefits made to our medical staff as well as overall operating expenditure price increases  in particular on energy and outsourced services. Ramsay Santé received funding from the French government which only partially covered procurement and wages inflation through €45m dedicated grants then followed by tariff increases from 1 March 2023. A similar pattern occurred in the Nordic countries where cost inflation outstripped the price revisions obtained from the different payors.EBITDA has a benefited from organic growth contribution on margins and from more stability in volumes growth over the year allowing for a greater focus on operational efficiency.Cost control measures were initiated to adapt activities to the current inflation environment and resources allocation are also revisited as a consequence.Underlying current operating profit amounted to €218.2m for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 (or 4.6% of revenue)  down 22.4% on the previous year.Other non-current income and expenses represent a net income of €22.2m for the year ending 30 June 2023 (last year €10.2m)  consisting mainly of a €31.0m profit on the sale of a property adjacent to a hospital in Norway that is to be redeveloped.The cost of net financial debt amounted to €147.1m for the year ending 30 June 2023  compared with €123.5 million the previous year  driven by higher funding costs. The impact of financial instruments recorded in P&L was a €5.5m income (€22.5m income last year)  contributing to a further €17.0m increase in the net interest expense on the prior year. In accordance with IFRS 16  the Group recorded a financial interest expense of €75.3m related to lease debt (€72.3m the previous year).The Group’s share of net income for the year ended 30 June 2023 amounted to €49.4m  or 1.1% of revenue  compared with €118.4m last year.Impact from IFRS16 Lease :Reported EBITDA of €621.4m in accordance with IFRS16 excludes contracted lease expenses for €239.8m which are instead recorded as amortisation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease debt as outlined in the table below. The increase in the lease accounting impact on the prior year primarily came from the full-year contribution of FY22 acquisitions  as well as the effect of contractual price revisions.EUR millions30 June 202330 June 2022Δ IFRS16 Impact Pre-IFRS16 IFRS16 Impact Pre-IFRS16 Impact EBITDA621.4 239.8 381.6658.4 219.1 439.320.7 Depreciation & amortisation (403.2) (192.3) (210.9) (377.3) (175.4) (201.9) (16.9) EBIT before non-current items 218.2 47.5 170.7 281.1 43.7 237.4 3.8 Net interest expense (152.7) (72.7) (80.0) (106.1) (69.4) (36.7) (3.3) Net profit after tax 63.9 (18.9) 82.8 127.8 (19.1) 146.9 0.2Cash-flow and financing :Net financial debt on 30 June 2023 was €3 670.0m compared with €3 709.9m on 30 June 2022. Net debt includes €1 893.8m in non-current borrowings and €58.8m in current borrowings  offset by €352.2m in cash and cash equivalents.The application of IFRS 16 to leases contributed €2 141.5m to net financial debt at 30 June 2023  of which €1 928.0m was non-current lease debt and €213.5m was current lease debt.Net cash increased by €219.7m over the period with a €186m contribution from increased borrowings. The cash flow from operating activities benefited from a favourable working capital variation encompassing the collection of subsidies recognised in the prior year.Total capital expenditure for the year of €165.1m was slightly below last year’s €175.4m and included maintenance and optimisation  as well as improvement on our portfolio of clinics. This covers the maternity expansion of St Göran as well as significant effort to roll out our strategy to increase Ramsay Santé’s imaging assets portfolio  to invest on digital tools  amongst which the new version of the Ramsay Services portal  and to acquire new equipment such as surgical robots for our French clinics.During the first half of this fiscal year  Ramsay Santé carried out a new tranche of Fiducie debt for a total financing amount of €150m  diversifying its funding sources and maturity profiles  as well as aligning it with the sustainable development strategy of the group through an indexation to ESG criteria.About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.
