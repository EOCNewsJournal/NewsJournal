He has always kept one foot in his native country and the other in the Middle East  where he has gone every year since his birth. Like many second-generation immigrants  the artist was exposed to the imperatives of conformism and integration in the country adopted by his parents but was constantly reminded of his roots by the predominantly white society in which he evolved. He moved from Sweden to Paris 14 years ago.”Through diverse and transversal practices such as sculpture  writing  performance  drawing  sound and video works  the thirty-year-old addresses the theses of uprooting  belonging  memory but also those of transformation and regeneration in his personal journey as well as in the history of the contemporary world.“I am a second-generation immigrant and my work is largely inspired by notions of displacement and uprooting.” Tarik KiswansonObtaining the Marcel Duchamp Prize is the high point of a year 2023 marked by three solo exhibitions around the world: one at the Museo Tamayo in Mexico  one at the Bonniers Konsthall in Stockholm and another at the Salzburger Kunstverein in Salzburg. In 2022  Tarik Kiswanson's works were shown at the Lyon Biennale  at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Antwerp (Belgium) and at the Hallands Konstmuseum (Sweden). In 2021 he had an exhibition at the Carré d'Art - Museum of Contemporary Art in Nîmes in 2021  and in 2019 he participated in New York's Performa 19 Biennale.Tarik Kiswanson graduated from Central Saint Martins  London (2010) and the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-arts in Paris (2014). The most recent winners of the Marcel Duchamp Prize were Mimosa Echard (2022)  Lili Reynaud Dewar (2021) and Kapwani Kiwanga (2020).The ADIAF and the Marcel Duchamp PrizeFounded by Gilles Fuchs and chaired since 2021 by Claude Bonnin  the ADIAF (Association for the International Diffusion of French Art) brings together 300 collectors of Contemporary French art.

CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed voting service providers  should refer to their CREST sponsors or voting service providers  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & International Limited's (EUI) specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The 5message must be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's agent Neville Registrars  (ID 7RA11) by no later than 48 hours (excluding non-working days) prior to the meeting. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed byCREST. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions.

Corporate representatives A corporation which is a shareholder can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise  on its behalf  all its powers as a shareholder provided that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers over the same share. Nominated persons Any persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who have been nominated to receive communications from the Company in accordance with section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 (Nominated Persons) may have a right under an agreement with the registered shareholder who holds shares on their behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively  if Nominated Persons do not have such a right  or do not wish to exercise it  they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the registered holder of the shares as to the exercise of voting rights. The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies set out above does not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights described in these Notes can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company. Voting by way of a poll 17. Voting on each resolution will be conducted by way of a poll. The Company believes that a poll is more representative of the shareholders' voting intentions because shareholder votes are counted according to the number of votes held and all votes tendered are taken into account. The results of the poll will be announced to the London Stock Exchange and will be made available on the Company's website at www.rockpoolacquisitions.plc.uk as soon as practicable following the conclusion of the meeting. Issued shares and total voting rights 18. As at 6:00pm on 17 October 2023  which is the latest practicable date before publication of this notice  the Company's issued share capital comprised 12 725 003 ordinary shares of £0.05 each. Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and  therefore  the total number of voting rights in the Company as at 6:00pm on 17 October 2023  is 12 725 003. 7Shareholder requisition rights and rights to require publication of certain statements 19. Under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006  members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: the audit of the Company's accounts (including the auditor's report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the meeting; or any circumstances connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company may not require the shareholder requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006  it must forward the statement to the Company's auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website. 20. Under sections 338 and 338A of the Companies Act 2006  a member or members meeting the qualification criteria in those sections have the right to require the Company: To give to members of the Company entitled to receive notice of the meeting  notice of a resolution which may properly be moved and is intended to be moved at the meeting; and/or To include in the business to be dealt with at the meeting any matter (other than a proposed resolution) which may be properly included in the business. A resolution may properly be moved or a matter may properly be included in the business unless:a. (in the case of a resolution only) it would  if passed  be ineffective (whether by reason of inconsistency with any enactment of the Company's constitution or otherwise); or it is defamatory of any person; or c. it is frivolous or vexatious. The Company will give notice of such a resolution or of such other business if sufficient requests have been received in accordance with section 338(3) and 338A(3) of the Companies Act 2006.

Cabka N.V. (together with its subsidiaries “Cabka”  or the “Company”)  a company specialized in transforming hard to recycle plastic waste into innovative Reusable Transport Packaging (RTP)  listed at Euronext Amsterdam  published its trading update for the third quarter of 2023  today.Total sales over the first three quarters of 2023 came at € 144 million  6% behind last year (22Q3: € 152 million)  driven by a € 8 million decline in non-strategic segments sales. Sales figures reflect challenging economic circumstances with clients continue to destock  driven by increased interest rates and inflation  and postpone larger orders over the quarter  resulting in quarterly sales of € 40 million.Strategic business segments showed comparable sales as last year. Based on decreasing raw material and energy price trends  we implemented a partial reversal of certain indexed prices  supporting margins.Cabka consolidated its strong European position in RTP Portfolio  up 2%. Customized Solutions grew with 22% with especially strong results in the US. The ECO business performed well with an 11% sales growth. These positive developments were offset by soft sales in Contract Manufacturing (-15%) and a 24% decline in RTP US reflecting a very slow sales pickup post-flooding.For the fourth quarter Cabka expects a strong recovery of sales based on the announced major co-development launches  such as CHEP  Continental and BMW  coming up to speed.A new two-year framework agreement with Tesla was recently signed  coming into effect in 2024.Based on its strong fundamentals Cabka confirms it mid-term guidance1 as well as full year 2023 outlook2  be it towards the lower end of the indicated spectrum for 2023.Financial Reporting Calendar 2024March 20: Preliminary Results 2023April 18: Publication Annual Report 2023 and Trading Update 2024Q1May 30: Annual General Meeting of ShareholdersAugust 13: Half-Year Results and Half-Year Report 2024October 21: Trading Update 2024Q3For more information  please contact:David Brilleslijper  Investor & Press contactIR@cabka.com   or D.Brilleslijper@cabka.com  +316 109 42514www.investors.cabka.comCommercial contact:info@cabka.comwww.cabka.comAbout CabkaCabka is in the business of recycling plastics from post-consumer and post-industrial waste into innovative reusable transport packaging (RTP)  like pallets- and large container solutions enhancing logistics chain sustainability.

Read More,Investors with an appetite for bowel disease biotech have a new European deal to digest.French biotech firm Abivax S.A. is commencing a transatlantic uplisting from Euronext Paris to the Nasdaq.On Monday  October 15  the firm kicked off its roadshow for its planned debut. It will float under the ticker “ABVX ” while staging a concurrent private offering elsewhere in Europe.On Wednesday  October 18  the company  which develops therapeutics for chronic inflammatory bowel diseases  topped up its offering to 20.33 million American Depositary Share (ADS) shares with an F-1/A filing. The offering's estimated proceeds remain at $250.06 million. The proposed price range will be $11.60 to $13.00 per share.Abivax's lead drug candidate  obefazimod  treats severe cases of ulcerative colitis (“UC”). Obefazimod is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials. The firm is planning a Phase 2a clinical trial to test how obefazimod may be used to treat patients with Crohn's disease (“CD”)  too.The company says last year  almost 3 million patients across the United States  EU4 (France  Germany  Italy  and Spain  the United Kingdom  and Japan suffered from the kinds of bowel diseases it treats.Feeling for a PulseNew offerings have recovered somewhat this year after 2022's historic collapse. Yet  if the broader IPO market is still a bit under the weather  biotech deals have been chronically ill.In the first half of 2023  only nine biotech companies have gone public  making it the slowest IPO year for the industry in at least six years  per BioPharma Dive data. In a sign of the cautious times  David Diamond of business consulting firm CBIZ MHM recently told industry publication BioSpace that investors are now looking for data from Phase II or later-stage studies to ensure they invest only in firms with effective assets.Sick Man of Europe?More broadly  European IPOs this year have been at their lowest since 2008.The Planisware  which was billed to be France's largest IPO in two years  at €300 million  was abruptly canceled on fears “extremely cautious” investors would let the float flop. Germany's military hardware maker Renk Group has also postponed a €350 million deal. Meanwhile  German toll payments provider DKV Mobility is also reported to be delaying its launch.Financial Times columnist Craig Cohen likens Europe's IPO market to a sad  stiff cadaver that requires ever-greater shocks of electro-stimulation: “A lifeless IPO market is periodically revived  only for the unsettling realization that — except for world-class companies with scale and profile — it's still largely kaput.”With bourses across the continent starved of new sizable deals  it's no wonder Abivex is heading ‘across the pond' to dive into the deep capital pools only found in the U.S.A.,neutral,0.03,0.79,0.18,negative,0.03,0.25,0.72,True,English,"['Bowel Disease Drugmaker Abivax', 'Gut Feeling', 'Paris', 'Nasdaq', 'German toll payments provider', 'Phase 2a clinical trial', 'chronic inflammatory bowel diseases', '20.33 million American Depositary Share', 'Phase 3 clinical trials', 'lead drug candidate', 'military hardware maker', 'sad, stiff cadaver', 'deep capital pools', 'U.S.A.', 'Financial Times columnist', 'nine biotech companies', 'new sizable deals', 'broader IPO market', 'lifeless IPO market', 'Abivax S.A.', 'BioPharma Dive data', 'business consulting firm', 'industry publication BioSpace', 'bowel disease biotech', 'French biotech firm', 'concurrent private offering', 'new European deal', 'biotech deals', '€350 million deal', 'Phase II', 'New offerings', 'cautious times', 'European IPOs', 'world-class companies', 'IPO year', 'largest IPO', '3 million patients', 'transatlantic uplisting', 'Euronext Paris', 'ADS) shares', 'F-1/A filing', 'price range', 'severe cases', 'ulcerative colitis', 'United States', 'United Kingdom', 'historic collapse', 'first half', 'six years', 'David Diamond', 'CBIZ MHM', 'later-stage studies', 'effective assets', 'Sick Man', 'The Planisware', 'two years', 'Renk Group', 'DKV Mobility', 'Craig Cohen', 'greater shocks', 'unsettling realization', 'cautious” investors', 'appetite', 'Nasdaq', 'Monday', 'October', 'roadshow', 'debut', 'ticker', 'ABVX', 'Wednesday', 'company', 'therapeutics', 'proceeds', 'obefazimod', 'UC', 'Crohn', 'CD', 'France', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'Japan', 'kinds', 'Pulse', 'weather', 'sign', 'firms', 'fears', 'float', 'launch', 'electro-stimulation', 'scale', 'profile', 'bourses', 'continent', 'Abivex', 'pond']",2023-10-19,2023-10-20,wealthofgeeks.com

The new contract aims to deliver a high-quality media space and to modernise Spain’s capital metro with up to 2 000 sq m of screens. It includes innovative and high-impact displays such as large-format screens and columns with an anamorphic effect  twin curved screens as well as “cinema formats”  a new type of large-format screen created exclusively for platforms  142 of which will be installed in 39 key stations.

Compared to 2022  revenues from Team & Car Manufacturers strongly increased (+24.3%)  due to important partnership agreements signed by the Group.Roberto Ferroggiaro  Chief Financial Officer of Racing Force Group  commented:""During the third quarter  the Group further consolidated the growth in the motorsport industry  proving once again its strength and resilience in an unfavorable macro-economic environment  characterized by uncertainty and weakening of global demand.

While there was an initial concern regarding digitally-driven services - such as AI or chatbots - replacing humans  it proved to be unfounded. We are  instead  witnessing a growing movement of brands exploring a variety of alternatives to deliver personalized services in a truly seamless manner: we balance our human touch with digital to ensure a consistent experience across all client touchpoints throughout their journey.At Accor  we made the decision to actually use technology and digital to enhance the experience and  in fact  to bring even more human touch  because it can ease operation and free up time for our team members to spend quality time with our guests. Alix Boulnois  Chief Digital Officer  AccorAt Adobe  we are proud to power the digitalization of our clients and help them become experience makers and benefit from what we call ‘experience-led growth ’ which is the ability to merge content and data in a meaningful way so you can amplify the work you do through human and physical channels. Luc Dammann  President EMEA  AdobeDigital Today: Clients are Ready to Share Data if They Can Trust YouIn today’s marketplace  clients expect brands to deliver a highly personalized digital experience. It demonstrates that you value their business and will work hard to engage them both in ways they prefer as well as through opportunities they may have never expected. And the reward for these interactions will be ongoing loyalty. Yet in order for brands to be able to personalize a digital experience for guests  they need access to data  and this remains a point of contention regarding how much a client is willing to share. A recent study by Adobe shows nearly half of consumers (48%) place equal importance on digital and in-person experiences when it comes to earning their trust.Consumers are ready to share data  but they do expect in return they can trust you with the data. And when we look at studies  we see that 40% of consumers are putting trust as a number one criteria before engaging with a brand. Luc Dammann  President EMEA  AdobeReally knowing your guests  getting the right data to bring them the best experience is not easy. This is especially true when it comes to data because today clients don’t give data for no reason. It’s rather the opposite. So they need to see an interest in sharing this data. Alix Boulnois  Chief Digital Officer  AccorLeading The Future Of Personalization: Leveraging Data to Enrich Client RelationshipsToday  we have the ability to collect and amass enormous amounts of data on our guests and clients. Data is an integral component of a digital strategy and a driver of how to deliver content and value to our audience. How can we use data to build strength in our brands? How can data facilitate our connection with clients and enhance the client experience overall? There can be a point when the data collected is overwhelming  so how do we choose what to use and deliver a personalized experience for individual guests instead of overwhelming them with too much information just because we have it?Micro-personalization in both the digital and in-hotel experience — really knowing your guests and getting the right data to really bring them the best experience and information at the right time is super important. At Accor  we’re using AI to generate more content  and content at scale  but we’re also using AI to be smarter about what we show to clients. Alix Boulnois  Chief Digital Officer  AccorBeing relevant is key. So is understanding that real-time is key as well. You need to be able to capture the moments in life to be relevant at each step of the customer journey. AI and generative AI open new frontiers in terms of creativity  productivity  and the ability to produce that and scale. Luc Dammann  President EMEA  AdobeDriving Change: How To Embark Everyone on the JourneyThe digital transformation many of us are already embracing - and which lies ahead - relies largely on a human component that needs to be taken into account in order to get everyone on board and embark on the journey.In any transformation there is indeed always a big human component and the transformation we are leading now is pushing us to work differently. How do we build teams that constantly embrace the change and actually see this change as a constant opportunity they proactively go after? We also need to ally people around the same goal wherever they sit in the organization.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Irish Stock Exchange  which trades as Euronext Dublin  has paid almost €65 million in dividends to its parent Euronext since its takeover in 2018.The sum equates to almost two-fifths of the €167 million that Euronext paid five Irish finance houses — Davy  Goodbody Stockbrokers  Cantor Fitzgerald  Investec and the now defunct Campbell O’Connor — to acquire the Irish exchange from them five years ago.The company behind the Irish bourse said in recently filed results for 2022 that it was proposing a €19.2 million distribution to its parent  based on its financial performance for last year. A spokeswoman said that this has since been paid. Some €20.6 million of dividends were paid up in each of the two previous years  the report said.Previous filings show that the Irish company paid €4.39 million of dividends in 2020  the first distribution following the takeover.READ MOREThe exchange operator  which is known to make most of its money from international debt and fund listings rather than its cash equities business  saw its revenues dip 4.7 per cent to €39.7 million last year as the rate of new debt listings declined amid a slump in bond sales globally as borrowing costs soared. Operating profit declined 8.2 per cent to €22.5 million.Euronext Dublin is the world’s main market for bond listings  with a total of 3 000 issuers across 90 countries including sovereigns  corporates and financial institutions.The wider Euronext group saw its number of new bond listings fall last year by 42 per cent to 8 540. Euronext Dublin is the group’s main hub for debt listings  accounting for more than 80 per cent of the total  according to the report.Will co-hosting Euro 2028 be of any real benefit to Irish football? Listen | 48:25Some 100 new funds were listed in Euronext Dublin in 2022  down from 115 for the previous year “reflecting the strong appetite for sustainable funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs)”  it said. However  there were a number of investment fund delistings during the period as a result of heightened regulation and increased cost pressures on asset managers.The average daily value of trading in Irish equities on Euronext Dublin rose marginally last year to €269 million from €263 million in 2021.

The Group uses alternative performance indicators (not defined under IFRS)  described in detail in the Appendix of this document: Revenue in millions of Q3 2023 Q3 2022 Change Of which euros organic growth EMEA 209.4 220.4 -5.0% -3.8% North America 228.4 251.4 -9.2% -2.6% CIS  APAC & Latin America 165.6 191.1 -13.3% +10.8% Sports 380.8 342.5 +11.2% +15.8% Group Total 984.3 1 005.4 -2.1% +6.0% 11. Revenue for the third quarter of 2023 Net revenue of the Group amounted to 984 million euros  down -2.1% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Organic growth was +6.0% (or +5.7% including sales price variations in the CIS region(1) ). The total effect of the selling price increases implemented across all segments is +3.1% on average compared to the third quarter of 2022. Sales prices were generally stable compared to Q2 2023. The EMEA segment achieved a net revenue of 209 million euros  down -5.0% compared to the third quarter of 2022  including an unfavourable currency effect of -1.2% and negative organic growth of -3.8%. The economic context of high inflation and interest rates is penalising renovation and new construction projects throughout the area. Activity in the Residential segment was significantly lower than in 2022 due to an unfavourable product mix  with vinyl rolls performing better than more expensive categories such as parquet. Activity in the Commercial segments fell only slightly compared to 2022 thanks to the good performance of volumes in the two main categories  vinyl products for the health and education sector and carpets for offices. The North American segment generated net revenue of 228 million euros  down -9.2% compared to the third quarter of 2022  with a negative currency effect linked to the depreciation of the dollar against the euro (-6.6%) and negative organic growth of -2.6%. Commercial segment volumes (offices  healthcare  education) are up slightly compared to 2022 in a market that is currently better positioned than in Europe. On the other hand  business volumes in the Residential and Hospitality segments are down in a market where demand is still suffering from inflation and the level of interest rates. Net revenue in the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment amounted to 166 million euros  down -13.3% compared to the third quarter of 2022  with a very unfavourable currency effect mainly resulting from the depreciation of the rouble (-31% compared to Q3 2022). Activity is well positioned with organic growth of +10.8% (excluding sales price effects in CIS countries). It benefited from the improvement in volumes in Russia and Ukraine compared to Q3 2022  which was marked by a significant decline compared with 2021. These countries respectively represent 8% and 0.8% of the Group's net sales over the quarter. In a complex market  selective price reduction contributed to the good performance of vinyl roll and LVT sales for the residential market. In Asia  activity was down  mainly due to a marked drop in sales in China. To optimise its cost base  the Group closed the commercial carpet production site located in Suzhou (China). Latin America remains slightly down compared to 2022 but volumes improved over the quarter in a more favourable economic environment. Sports net revenue continued to grow at a sustained pace  amounting to 381 million euros  up +11.2%  of which +15.8% organic growth compared to the third quarter of 2022. The market continues to be very dynamic  particularly for artificial turf and athletics tracks in North America. The segment also benefited from price increases which fully offset inflation in raw material costs. Selling price adjustments in the CIS countries are historically intended to offset currency fluctuations and are therefore excluded from the ""organic growth"" indicator (see Appendix 1) 22. Outlook for the end of 2023 and short-termobjectives Over the first nine months of the financial year  the Group's organic growth was positive (+4.7%). In an uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic environment  Tarkett expects a further slowdown in demand in EMEA and a possible shift in business segment activity in North America. Nevertheless  the favourable business outlook in Sports should allow to compensate for this slowdown and to achieve a significantly higher Adjusted EBITDA  in value and in margin  compared to 2022. The Group expects a start to 2024 marked by low business volumes in EMEA  where market indicators continue to decline. In North America  the Commercial segments have so far been well oriented. However  market indicators reflect sluggish activity  which could lag behind in the context of maintaining high interest rates. Similarly  the residential market shows no signs of recovery. Conversely  activities in the Sports segment are still benefiting from a buoyant market which should allow the Group to continue to grow in this segment in 2024  albeit at a more moderate pace. Tarkett will continue to closely monitor energy price developments and possible impacts on the price of its raw materials. In a context of slowing volumes in the flooring business activity  the Group continues to adapt its production and cost structure. Furthermore  thanks to the rigorous control of working capital requirements  it anticipates an improvement in cash generation and a reduction in its debt.

The total income for the third quarter of 2023 was EUR 4.2 million  marginally lower than in the third quarter of 2022 (EUR 4.3 million). The total income for the first nine months of 2023 was EUR 12.9 million  an increase of 10% compared to the same period in 2022 (EUR 11.7 million). The good start in the first quarter of this year and the stable development in the second and third quarters are the base for this increase.The order book increased compared to the beginning of the quarter and continues to be filled with long-term contracts and engagements as well as short-term orders. The long-term contracts and engagements are mainly in the SCM and Test Operations units and the short-term orders in the Failure Analysis & Qualification unit.“It is encouraging to see that the total income for the first nine months is higher than for the same period last year even though the market situation with high inflation and rising interest rates is getting worse. We continue to support our customers with high quality services and they highly appreciate it.”  says Martin Sallenhag  CEO of RoodMicrotec. “The steady increase in the order book value is building a good foundation for our future business.”OutlookRoodMicrotec expects the total income for 2023 to be in the range of EUR 17.0 million to EUR 17.5 million  with a profit before tax ratio from 5 to 10% of total income  excluding the advisory expenses incurred for the public offering process. This projection is in line with the financial targets communicated to the financial market previously. The geopolitical situation in the world and the trends with higher inflation  rising prices  and increasing interest rates throughout Europe could have an impact on the Company’s business. The Management is keeping a close eye on the situation and is doing everything possible to mitigate any potentially negative impact.AuditThe financial data in this press release have not been audited.Today’s Extraordinary Meeting of ShareholdersRoodMicrotec will hold an Extraordinary Meeting of Shareholders at Amsterdam Stock Exchange (Euronext)  Beursplein 5  1012 JW in Amsterdam  the Netherlands  this afternoon starting at 14:00 CEST in relation to the recommended public offer by Microtest S.p.A. for all the issued and outstanding ordinary shares in the capital of RoodMicrotec N.V.About RoodMicrotecRoodMicrotec is a leading independent company for semiconductor supply and quality services.

The comparison of POSEIDON patients to a matched cohort of subjects in the NACSELD registry is reassuring as it reaffirms alfapump’s safety profile.”Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer at Sequana Medical  added: “We are delighted with these additional insights into alfapump’s long term benefit as well as the encouraging results from our patient preference study which indicates a strong preference amongst US patients for the alfapump. We are greatly encouraged by our recent pre-PMA meeting with the FDA  where we discussed the reported clinical data from our alfapump studies and benefit-risk analysis for the submission package. We look forward to submitting our PMA application by year end and continuing our preparations for launching the alfapump in the US and Canada.""One-year follow-up data from POSEIDON studyAs seen in months 0-6 post implant  patients maintained the 100% median reduction in therapeutic paracentesis in the 7-12 month post-implant period vs the three month pre-implant period (n = 19). These data show that the alfapump has a sustained effect on controlling ascites  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis.During the 7-12 month post-implant period  two patients had the alfapump explanted  one due to a urinary tract infection and one due to wound dehiscence and the number of Major Adverse Events (MAEsiv) and serious infections were in line with expectations. Importantly  creatine and eGFRv levels of alfapump-treated patients over 12-month follow-up indicated a stable renal function. Overall  these safety data indicate that the alfapump has a robust safety profile over long-term follow-up.Quality of life  assessed through the physical component score of SF36 (a general health quality of life measure) and the Ascites Q score (a quality of life measure specific for patients with ascites)  maintained a clinically meaningful improvement at 12 months post-implant vs three months pre-implant  despite disease progression.The overall trend in survivalvi in patients implanted with the alfapump remained positive over a longer term  with a Kaplan-Meier estimate indicating over 70% survival probability at 12 and 18 months post-implant. This compares favourably with the published literature reporting a predicted survival probability for refractory ascites patients with a similar MELDvii score and receiving paracentesis of approximately 17% at 12 months and 5% at 18 monthsviii.Data from the POSEIDON study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The Company will update the market as soon as it is published.Outcome Patient Preference studyThe patient preference study was conducted by RTI Health Solutions  thought leaders in the field. The rigorous study design was pre-discussed with the FDA and utilizes a discrete-choice experiment (DCEix) methodology to elicit preferences of US patients with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis for attributes of an implantable pump as a novel interventional treatment for ascites. Patients were surveyed for the risk of treatment-related adverse events they would be willing to accept (risk tolerance) to achieve specific improvements in treatment efficacy (desired benefits). In total  125 US patients with a comparable patient profile as the Pivotal Cohort in the POSEIDON study  completed the survey.Top-line results presented in the table below indicate that  on average  patients are willing to accept levels of risks greater than those observed in the POSEIDON study in exchange for improvements in treatment efficacy less than or equal to those observed in the POSEIDON study.Risk tolerance (over 6 months) Patient preference studyMaximum acceptable risk POSEIDON pivotal cohortObserved rate Major surgery or death >10% 0% Minor procedure >35% 20% Serious infection or AKI resulting in hospitalization >30% 20%Desired benefits Patient preference study POSEIDON pivotal cohort Reduction in frequency of paracentesis 100% 100% (median) Additional ascites good health days each month 10 >10 (mean)Reduction in paracentesis frequency and additional ascites good health days are important attributes for a novel interventional treatment for ascites. On average  patients responded with a 65% likelihood of selecting a treatment profile like the alfapump vs regular paracentesis procedures and no implanted pump.These data support the premise that alfapump is a desirable treatment option for the majority of patients.Matched interim analysis of NACSELD registry and POSEIDON pivotal cohortThe North American Consortium for the Study of End Stage Liver Disease (NACSELD) is a consortium of tertiary-care hepatology centers in North America formed to study patients with cirrhosis. NASCELD-III is an IRBx approved registry of outpatients with cirrhosis which was initiated in 2019 at ten centers in North America.A matched cohort analysis was conducted by an independent group comparing outcomes of decompensated cirrhosis patients from the NACSELD-III registry to those from the POSEIDON study. Forty decompensated ascites patients from NACSELD-III were matched to the forty patients from the Pivotal Cohort in the POSEIDON study  using baseline Ascites-Q score (reflecting burden of disease before alfapump implantation) and sex. Patients were also comparable for age and baseline MELD score after matching.Results for all cause hospitalization and death within six months were similar between the NACSELD-III registry matched patients and the POSEIDON pivotal cohort.Six month dataxi NACSELD-III Registry Matched Patients POSEIDON Pivotal Cohortxii Any Death or Hospitalization 55.0% (22/40) 55.0% (22/40) Death 12.5% (5/40) 12.5% (5/40) Hospitalization 42.5% (17/40) 42.5% (17/40) Median # of hospitalizations (min  max) 1 (0  5) 1 (0  4) Liver Transplant 7.5% (3/40) 5.0% (2/40)This analysis indicates that the safety profile of the alfapump is in line with expectations and comparable to standard paracentesis procedures.Data from the matched cohort analysis together with the positive data from the POSEIDON study indicate that patients implanted with the alfapump benefit from significantly reduced number of paracentesis procedures and an improved quality of life without an increased risk of death or hospitalization compared to standard of care.Details Conference Call and Webcast by Sequana MedicalSequana Medical management will host a conference call with a live webcast presentation today at 03:00 pm CEST / 09:00 am EST.Registration webcast: please click hereRegistration conference call (only if you wish to participate in the Q&A): please click here.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company has reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and is on track to file a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA by year end.The Company has commenced MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0 seeking to confirm the strong efficacy seen in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies. The first two patients have been successfully treated with DSR 2.0  and top-line data from all of the first three patients is expected by year end. Sequana Medical recently reported that detailed biomarker analysis of RED DESERT and SAHARA patients indicates DSR’s mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The comparison of POSEIDON patients to a matched cohort of subjects in the NACSELD registry is reassuring as it reaffirmsalfapump's safety profile.""Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer at Sequana Medical  added:""We are delighted with these additional insights intoalfapump's long term benefit as well as the encouraging results from our patient preference study which indicates a strong preference amongst US patients for thealfapump. We are greatly encouraged by our recent pre-PMA meeting with the FDA  where we discussed the reported clinical data from ouralfapump studies and benefit-risk analysis for the submission package. We look forward to submitting our PMA application by year end and continuing our preparations for launching thealfapump in the US and Canada.""One-year follow-up data from POSEIDON studyAs seen in months 0-6 post implant  patients maintained the 100% median reduction in therapeutic paracentesis in the 7-12 month post-implant period vs the three month pre-implant period (n = 19). These data show that thealfapump has a sustained effect on controlling ascites  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis.During the 7-12 month post-implant period  two patients had thealfapump explanted  one due to a urinary tract infection and one due to wound dehiscence and the number of Major Adverse Events (MAEs [iv] ) and serious infections were in line with expectations. Importantly  creatine and eGFR [v] levels ofalfapump-treated patients over 12-month follow-up indicated a stable renal function. Overall  these safety data indicate that thealfapump has a robust safety profile over long-term follow-up.Quality of life  assessed through the physical component score of SF36 (a general health quality of life measure) and the Ascites Q score (a quality of life measure specific for patients with ascites)  maintained a clinically meaningful improvement at 12 months post-implant vs three months pre-implant  despite disease progression.The overall trend in survival [vi] in patients implanted with thealfapump remained positive over a longer term  with a Kaplan-Meier estimate indicating over 70% survival probability at 12 and 18 months post-implant. This compares favourably with the published literature reporting a predicted survival probability for refractory ascites patients with a similar MELD [vii] score and receiving paracentesis of approximately 17% at 12 months and 5% at 18 months [viii] .Data from the POSEIDON study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The Company will update the market as soon as it is published.Outcome Patient Preference studyThe patient preference study was conducted by RTI Health Solutions  thought leaders in the field. The rigorous study design was pre-discussed with the FDA and utilizes a discrete-choice experiment (DCE [ix] ) methodology to elicit preferences of US patients with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis for attributes of an implantable pump as a novel interventional treatment for ascites. Patients were surveyed for the risk of treatment-related adverse events they would be willing to accept (risk tolerance) to achieve specific improvements in treatment efficacy (desired benefits). In total  125 US patients with a comparable patient profile as the Pivotal Cohort in the POSEIDON study  completed the survey.Top-line results presented in the table below indicate that  on average  patients are willing to accept levels of risks greater than those observed in the POSEIDON study in exchange for improvements in treatment efficacy less than or equal to those observed in the POSEIDON study.Risk tolerance (over 6 months) Patient preference studyMaximum acceptable risk POSEIDON pivotal cohortObserved rate Major surgery or death >10% 0% Minor procedure >35% 20% Serious infection or AKI resulting in hospitalization >30% 20%Desired benefits Patient preference study POSEIDON pivotal cohort Reduction in frequency of paracentesis 100% 100% (median) Additional ascites good health days each month 10 >10 (mean)Reduction in paracentesis frequency and additional ascites good health days are important attributes for a novel interventional treatment for ascites. On average  patients responded with a 65% likelihood of selecting a treatment profile like thealfapump vs regular paracentesis procedures and no implanted pump.These data support the premise thatalfapump is a desirable treatment option for the majority of patients.Matched interim analysis of NACSELD registry and POSEIDON pivotal cohortThe North American Consortium for the Study of End Stage Liver Disease (NACSELD) is a consortium of tertiary-care hepatology centers in North America formed to study patients with cirrhosis. NASCELD-III is an IRB [x] approved registry of outpatients with cirrhosis which was initiated in 2019 at ten centers in North America.A matched cohort analysis was conducted by an independent group comparing outcomes of decompensated cirrhosis patients from the NACSELD-III registry to those from the POSEIDON study. Forty decompensated ascites patients from NACSELD-III were matched to the forty patients from the Pivotal Cohort in the POSEIDON study  using baseline Ascites-Q score (reflecting burden of disease beforealfapump implantation) and sex. Patients were also comparable for age and baseline MELD score after matching.Results for all cause hospitalization and death within six months were similar between the NACSELD-III registry matched patients and the POSEIDON pivotal cohort.Six month data [xi] NACSELD-III Registry Matched Patients POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort [xii] Any Death or Hospitalization 55.0% (22/40) 55.0% (22/40) Death 12.5% (5/40) 12.5% (5/40) Hospitalization 42.5% (17/40) 42.5% (17/40) Median # of hospitalizations (min  max) 1 (0  5) 1 (0  4) Liver Transplant 7.5% (3/40) 5.0% (2/40)This analysis indicates that the safety profile of thealfapump is in line with expectations and comparable to standard paracentesis procedures.Data from the matched cohort analysis together with the positive data from the POSEIDON study indicate that patients implanted with thealfapump benefit from significantly reduced number of paracentesis procedures and an improved quality of life without an increased risk of death or hospitalization compared to standard of care.Details Conference Call and Webcast by Sequana MedicalSequana Medical management will host a conference call with a live webcast presentationtodayat 03:00 pm CEST / 09:00 am EST.Registration webcast: please click hereRegistration conference call (only if you wish to participate in the Q&A): please click here .

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company has reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of thealfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and is on track to file a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA by year end.The Company has commenced MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0 seeking to confirm the strong efficacy seen in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies. The first two patients have been successfully treated with DSR 2.0  and top-line data from all of the first three patients is expected by year end. Sequana Medical recently reported that detailed biomarker analysis of RED DESERT and SAHARA patients indicates DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Organic growth was +6.0% (or +5.7% including sales price variations in the CIS region(1) ). The total effect of the selling price increases implemented across all segments is +3.1% on average compared to the third quarter of 2022. Sales prices were generally stable compared to Q2 2023.The EMEA segment achieved a net revenue of 209 million euros  down -5.0% compared to the third quarter of 2022  including an unfavourable currency effect of -1.2% and negative organic growth of -3.8%. The economic context of high inflation and interest rates is penalising renovation and new construction projects throughout the area. Activity in the Residential segment was significantly lower than in 2022 due to an unfavourable product mix  with vinyl rolls performing better than more expensive categories such as parquet. Activity in the Commercial segments fell only slightly compared to 2022 thanks to the good performance of volumes in the two main categories  vinyl products for the health and education sector and carpets for offices.The North American segment generated net revenue of 228 million euros  down -9.2% compared to the third quarter of 2022  with a negative currency effect linked to the depreciation of the dollar against the euro (-6.6%) and negative organic growth of -2.6%. Commercial segment volumes (offices  healthcare  education) are up slightly compared to 2022 in a market that is currently better positioned than in Europe. On the other hand  business volumes in the Residential and Hospitality segments are down in a market where demand is still suffering from inflation and the level of interest rates.Net revenue in the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment amounted to 166 million euros  down -13.3% compared to the third quarter of 2022  with a very unfavourable currency effect mainly resulting from the depreciation of the rouble (-31% compared to Q3 2022). Activity is well positioned with organic growth of +10.8% (excluding sales price effects in CIS countries). It benefited from the improvement in volumes in Russia and Ukraine compared to Q3 2022  which was marked by a significant decline compared with 2021. These countries respectively represent 8% and 0.8% of the Group’s net sales over the quarter. In a complex market  selective price reduction contributed to the good performance of vinyl roll and LVT sales for the residential market. In Asia  activity was down  mainly due to a marked drop in sales in China. To optimise its cost base  the Group closed the commercial carpet production site located in Suzhou (China). Latin America remains slightly down compared to 2022 but volumes improved over the quarter in a more favourable economic environment.Sports net revenue continued to grow at a sustained pace  amounting to 381 million euros  up +11.2%  of which +15.8% organic growth compared to the third quarter of 2022. The market continues to be very dynamic  particularly for artificial turf and athletics tracks in North America. The segment also benefited from price increases which fully offset inflation in raw material costs.1) Selling price adjustments in the CIS countries are historically intended to offset currency fluctuations and are therefore excluded from the “organic growth” indicator (see Appendix 1)Outlook for the end of 2023 and short-term objectivesOver the first nine months of the financial year  the Group’s organic growth was positive (+4.7%).In an uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic environment  Tarkett expects a further slowdown in demand in EMEA and a possible shift in business segment activity in North America.Nevertheless  the favourable business outlook in Sports should allow to compensate for this slowdown and to achieve a significantly higher Adjusted EBITDA  in value and in margin  compared to 2022.The Group expects a start to 2024 marked by low business volumes in EMEA  where market indicators continue to decline.In North America  the Commercial segments have so far been well oriented. However  market indicators reflect sluggish activity  which could lag behind in the context of maintaining high interest rates. Similarly  the residential market shows no signs of recovery.Conversely  activities in the Sports segment are still benefiting from a buoyant market which should allow the Group to continue to grow in this segment in 2024  albeit at a more moderate pace.Tarkett will continue to closely monitor energy price developments and possible impacts on the price of its raw materials.In a context of slowing volumes in the flooring business activity  the Group continues to adapt its production and cost structure. Furthermore  thanks to the rigorous control of working capital requirements  it anticipates an improvement in cash generation and a reduction in its debt.This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

Organic growth was +6.0% (or +5.7% including sales price variations in the CIS region(1) ). The total effect of the selling price increases implemented across all segments is +3.1% on average compared to the third quarter of 2022. Sales prices were generally stable compared to Q2 2023.The EMEA segment achieved a net revenue of 209 million euros  down -5.0% compared to the third quarter of 2022  including an unfavourable currency effect of -1.2% and negative organic growth of -3.8%. The economic context of high inflation and interest rates is penalising renovation and new construction projects throughout the area. Activity in the Residential segment was significantly lower than in 2022 due to an unfavourable product mix  with vinyl rolls performing better than more expensive categories such as parquet. Activity in the Commercial segments fell only slightly compared to 2022 thanks to the good performance of volumes in the two main categories  vinyl products for the health and education sector and carpets for offices.The North American segment generated net revenue of 228 million euros  down -9.2% compared to the third quarter of 2022  with a negative currency effect linked to the depreciation of the dollar against the euro (-6.6%) and negative organic growth of -2.6%. Commercial segment volumes (offices  healthcare  education) are up slightly compared to 2022 in a market that is currently better positioned than in Europe. On the other hand  business volumes in the Residential and Hospitality segments are down in a market where demand is still suffering from inflation and the level of interest rates.Net revenue in the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment amounted to 166 million euros  down -13.3% compared to the third quarter of 2022  with a very unfavourable currency effect mainly resulting from the depreciation of the rouble (-31% compared to Q3 2022). Activity is well positioned with organic growth of +10.8% (excluding sales price effects in CIS countries). It benefited from the improvement in volumes in Russia and Ukraine compared to Q3 2022  which was marked by a significant decline compared with 2021. These countries respectively represent 8% and 0.8% of the Group’s net sales over the quarter. In a complex market  selective price reduction contributed to the good performance of vinyl roll and LVT sales for the residential market. In Asia  activity was down  mainly due to a marked drop in sales in China. To optimise its cost base  the Group closed the commercial carpet production site located in Suzhou (China). Latin America remains slightly down compared to 2022 but volumes improved over the quarter in a more favourable economic environment.Sports net revenue continued to grow at a sustained pace  amounting to 381 million euros  up +11.2%  of which +15.8% organic growth compared to the third quarter of 2022. The market continues to be very dynamic  particularly for artificial turf and athletics tracks in North America. The segment also benefited from price increases which fully offset inflation in raw material costs.1) Selling price adjustments in the CIS countries are historically intended to offset currency fluctuations and are therefore excluded from the “organic growth” indicator (see Appendix 1)Outlook for the end of 2023 and short-term objectivesOver the first nine months of the financial year  the Group’s organic growth was positive (+4.7%).In an uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic environment  Tarkett expects a further slowdown in demand in EMEA and a possible shift in business segment activity in North America.Nevertheless  the favourable business outlook in Sports should allow to compensate for this slowdown and to achieve a significantly higher Adjusted EBITDA  in value and in margin  compared to 2022.The Group expects a start to 2024 marked by low business volumes in EMEA  where market indicators continue to decline.In North America  the Commercial segments have so far been well oriented. However  market indicators reflect sluggish activity  which could lag behind in the context of maintaining high interest rates. Similarly  the residential market shows no signs of recovery.Conversely  activities in the Sports segment are still benefiting from a buoyant market which should allow the Group to continue to grow in this segment in 2024  albeit at a more moderate pace.Tarkett will continue to closely monitor energy price developments and possible impacts on the price of its raw materials.In a context of slowing volumes in the flooring business activity  the Group continues to adapt its production and cost structure. Furthermore  thanks to the rigorous control of working capital requirements  it anticipates an improvement in cash generation and a reduction in its debt.This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

Sanofi has delivered the first medicines......,"Sanofi delivers first medicines from Global Health Unit’s Impact brand portfolioParis  October 19  2023. Sanofi has delivered the first medicines from its Global Health Unit’s not-for-profit Impact brand portfolio to the Republic of Djibouti. Enoxaparin Sodium Impact is an anticoagulant medicine indicated for the treatment of venous thromboembolism including deep vein thrombosis  a potentially lethal disease often underdiagnosed on the African continent. With this first shipment to Djibouti  Sanofi delivers on its commitment to improve and accelerate affordable and sustainable access to quality medicines  vaccines and healthcare for underserved populations.Sanofi's social model to broaden access is channeled through its Global Health Unit (GHU). The first global initiative of its kind  Sanofi’s GHU aims to provide access to a broad portfolio of medicines in 40 countries with the highest unmet medical needs. To that point  the GHU created Impact  a unique not-for-profit brand with 30 standard-of-care medicines produced by Sanofi  some of which are considered ""essential"" by the World Health Organization (WHO). The Impact medicines cover a wide range of therapeutic areas  including diabetes  cardiovascular disease  tuberculosis  malaria and cancer.Jon FairestHead  Global Health Unit  Sanofi“I'm delighted to see the very first Impact brand medicine  Enoxaparin Sodium Impact  arrive on Djibouti soil. This is an important milestone in Sanofi’s long-term objective to reach 2 million people with noncommunicable diseases in underserved populations by 2030. But providing access to quality medicines and sustainable healthcare to people in the 40 most underserved countries is not a simple task. It requires cross-sector partnerships on a global  regional  and importantly  on a local scale – work Sanofi does on the ground with the GHU teams. After Djibouti  we are now heading to Tanzania  scheduled to be the second country to receive an Impact brand medicine: Insulin Glargine Impact.”The delivery of Enoxaparin Sodium Impact comes months after the signature of a partnership with the Republic of Djibouti’s Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale (CNSS)  the national social security fund. The partnership aims at improving diagnosis and management of cardiometabolic diseases and diabetes in Djibouti and to help local communities gain sustainable access to quality medicines at accessible pricing  medical training and capacity building.Deka Ahmed RoblehManaging Director  Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale  Djibouti“In partnership with Sanofi’s Global Health Unit  we are working to remove barriers that limit access to quality treatment and care for noncommunicable disease patients in Djibouti. The availability of Enoxaparin Sodium Impact at accessible pricing addresses an unmet need in the management of venous thromboembolic disease  a condition often underdiagnosed. Moreover  working with Sanofi within the local community to help train healthcare professionals  drive awareness around the management of cardiometabolic diseases and diabetes  and build capacity is critical to improving patient outcomes throughout the country.”Ahead of the delivery of the first not-for-profit Impact brand medicines  Sanofi’s Global Health Unit has been working closely with local communities  authorities and non-governmental organizations to support the set up and development of sustainable healthcare systems for those who suffer from chronic diseases and require complex care  and to develop disease awareness programs. To date  over 1 800 healthcare professionals have been trained in GHU-sponsored programs globally.Tanzania is scheduled to be the second country to receive an Impact brand medicine : Insulin Glargine ImpactThe WHO estimates over 4.5 billion people  or half the world's population  lacks coverage for essential health services1. According to the WHO  noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are responsible for 41 million people dying each year  with low- and middle-income countries accounting for 77% of all NCDs deaths2.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Sanofi has delivered the first medicines from its Global Health Unit’s not-for-profit Impact brand portfolio to the Republic of Djibouti. Enoxaparin Sodium Impact is an anticoagulant medicine indicated for the treatment of venous thromboembolism including deep vein thrombosis  a potentially lethal disease often underdiagnosed on the African continent. With this first shipment to Djibouti  Sanofi delivers on its commitment to improve and accelerate affordable and sustainable access to quality medicines  vaccines and healthcare for underserved populations.Sanofi's social model to broaden access is channeled through its Global Health Unit (GHU). The first global initiative of its kind  Sanofi’s GHU aims to provide access to a broad portfolio of medicines in 40 countries with the highest unmet medical needs. To that point  the GHU created Impact  a unique not-for-profit brand with 30 standard-of-care medicines produced by Sanofi  some of which are considered ""essential"" by the World Health Organization (WHO). The Impact medicines cover a wide range of therapeutic areas  including diabetes  cardiovascular disease  tuberculosis  malaria and cancer.Jon FairestHead  Global Health Unit  Sanofi“I'm delighted to see the very first Impact brand medicine  Enoxaparin Sodium Impact  arrive on Djibouti soil. This is an important milestone in Sanofi’s long-term objective to reach 2 million people with noncommunicable diseases in underserved populations by 2030. But providing access to quality medicines and sustainable healthcare to people in the 40 most underserved countries is not a simple task. It requires cross-sector partnerships on a global  regional  and importantly  on a local scale – work Sanofi does on the ground with the GHU teams. After Djibouti  we are now heading to Tanzania  scheduled to be the second country to receive an Impact brand medicine: Insulin Glargine Impact.”The delivery of Enoxaparin Sodium Impact comes months after the signature of a partnership with the Republic of Djibouti’s Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale (CNSS)  the national social security fund. The partnership aims at improving diagnosis and management of cardiometabolic diseases and diabetes in Djibouti and to help local communities gain sustainable access to quality medicines at accessible pricing  medical training and capacity building.Deka Ahmed RoblehManaging Director  Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale  Djibouti“In partnership with Sanofi’s Global Health Unit  we are working to remove barriers that limit access to quality treatment and care for noncommunicable disease patients in Djibouti. The availability of Enoxaparin Sodium Impact at accessible pricing addresses an unmet need in the management of venous thromboembolic disease  a condition often underdiagnosed. Moreover  working with Sanofi within the local community to help train healthcare professionals  drive awareness around the management of cardiometabolic diseases and diabetes  and build capacity is critical to improving patient outcomes throughout the country.”Ahead of the delivery of the first not-for-profit Impact brand medicines  Sanofi’s Global Health Unit has been working closely with local communities  authorities and non-governmental organizations to support the set up and development of sustainable healthcare systems for those who suffer from chronic diseases and require complex care  and to develop disease awareness programs. To date  over 1 800 healthcare professionals have been trained in GHU-sponsored programs globally.Tanzania is scheduled to be the second country to receive an Impact brand medicine : Insulin Glargine ImpactThe WHO estimates over 4.5 billion people  or half the world's population  lacks coverage for essential health services1. According to the WHO  noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are responsible for 41 million people dying each year  with low- and middle-income countries accounting for 77% of all NCDs deaths2.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives. Our team  across some 100 countries  is dedicated to transforming the practice of medicine by working to turn the impossible into the possible.

In the third quarter  revenue for the region came to €79.9 million  with moderate growth (+0.6% at CER) linked to a particularly high comparison base.In the Americas  sales for the period to end-September 2023 fell by 11.8% at current exchange rates and by 11.5% at CER. As expected  the decline in revenue slowed significantly in the third quarter to -5.2% at CER.

Note that the X-ray division now includes the revenue of Intrasense  consolidated since 1 January 2023.In MRI   sales for the 9-month period were down 1.6% at CER due to a contraction in activity in the third quarter of 2023. This reflects: A negative price effect linked to the price pressure exerted by the generic product for Dotarem ® on the US market.

In the fourth quarter of 2023  Guerbet expects double-digit sales growth driven by a very strong rebound in activity in the United States  linked in particular to the ramp-up of EluciremTM sales once the current approval processes are completed  and to continued favourable trends in Interventional Imaging.For the full year  Guerbet confirms that it is targeting revenue growth of more than 5% like-for-like and at CER. It still expects a restated EBITDA2 to revenue ratio of around 11% in 2023  before returning in 2024 to a higher level than in 2021 (14.4%).As a reminder  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued a favourable opinion on the granting of marketing authorisation for Elucirem™ in the European Union for use in adults and children aged two and older for contrast-enhanced MRI.

Over the first nine months of the year  Group sales came to €573.9 million  up 0.8% on the same period in 2022. Business activity reflected a negative forex effect of €10.4 million. At CER1  revenue for the first nine months grew by 2.7%.Sales in the third quarter of 2023 came to €195.2 million  up 2.3% at CER  after rising by 2.8% during the first half of the financial year. Taking into account the expected ramp-up in EluciremTM sales in the fourth quarter  this scenario supports Guerbet’s financial targets for the full year and for next year.Geographical breakdown of consolidated Group revenue (IFRS)In millions of euros at 30 September 2023 9 months 20229 months 2023At current exchange rates% change9 months 2023At CER1% changeSales in EMEA 245.2 258.5 +5.4% 258.6 +5.5% Sales in the Americas 182.5 160.9 -11.8% 161.5 -11.5% Sales in Asia 141.4 154.4 +9.2% 164.2 +16.1% Total 569.2 573.9 +0.8% 584.3 +2.7%1Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous financial year.In the EMEA region  the Group saw an increase in 9-month sales of 5.4% at current exchange rates and 5.5% at CER  driven by the increase in volumes and positive price effects. In the third quarter  revenue for the region came to €79.9 million  with moderate growth (+0.6% at CER) linked to a particularly high comparison base.In the Americas  sales for the period to end-September 2023 fell by 11.8% at current exchange rates and by 11.5% at CER. As expected  the decline in revenue slowed significantly in the third quarter to -5.2% at CER. After the complete normalisation of production rates during the first half of 2023  the Raleigh (North Carolina) site was again able to increase its production capacity with a view to increasing its sales - of EluciremTM in particular - in the fourth quarter.In Asia  sales growth over the 9-month period was +9.2%  incorporating a particularly substantial negative forex effect of -€9.8m (depreciation of Chinese  Japanese and Korean currencies) during the period; at CER  growth was +16.1%  a remarkable performance driven mainly by China (+39%)  which continued to benefit from the introduction of direct distribution in 2022. In the third quarter alone  sales in Asia were up 15.2% at CER.Breakdown of consolidated Group revenue (IFRS) by activityIn millions of euros at 30 September 2023 9 months 20229 months 2023At current exchange rates% change9 months 2023At CER1% changeDiagnostic Imaging 502.2 506.4 +0.8% 515.3 +2.6% MRI 192.4 187.3 -2.7% 189.4 -1.6% X-ray 309.8 319.0 +3.0% 325.8 +5.2% Interventional Imaging 67.0 67.5 +0.7% 69.0 +3.0% Total 569.2 573.9 +0.8% 584.3 +2.7%1Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous financial year.Revenue from Diagnostic Imaging at CER was up 2.6% at 30 September 2023 (+0.8% at current exchange rates) and up 1.2% in the third quarter. Note that the X-ray division now includes the revenue of Intrasense  consolidated since 1 January 2023.In MRI   sales for the 9-month period were down 1.6% at CER due to a contraction in activity in the third quarter of 2023. This reflects: A negative price effect linked to the price pressure exerted by the generic product for Dotarem ® on the US market. Sales of Elucirem TM which slowed in the third quarter due to longer-than-expected approval times (formulary process) in US hospitals  with a strong catch-up effect expected from the fourth quarter of 2023.  sales for the 9-month period were down 1.6% at CER due to a contraction in activity in the third quarter of 2023. This reflects: In the X-ray division  revenue rose by 5.2% over the first nine months at CER  marked by a sharp acceleration in growth in the third quarter (+8.7%)  again due to a sharp increase in sales of Xenetix®.In Interventional Imaging  sales at CER were up 3.0% compared with the first nine months of 2022. After a negative comparison base effect in the Asia-Pacific region in the first half of 2023  revenue for the third quarter rose by a sharp 10.3%  driven by strong sales of Lipiodol®.Financial targets for 2023 and 2024 confirmedActivity continues to be underpinned by robust volumes and broadly positive price effects (with the exception of Dotarem®)  reflecting the Group’s ability to pass on cost increases to its customers (iodine in particular). In the fourth quarter of 2023  Guerbet expects double-digit sales growth driven by a very strong rebound in activity in the United States  linked in particular to the ramp-up of EluciremTM sales once the current approval processes are completed  and to continued favourable trends in Interventional Imaging.For the full year  Guerbet confirms that it is targeting revenue growth of more than 5% like-for-like and at CER. It still expects a restated EBITDA2 to revenue ratio of around 11% in 2023  before returning in 2024 to a higher level than in 2021 (14.4%).As a reminder  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued a favourable opinion on the granting of marketing authorisation for Elucirem™ in the European Union for use in adults and children aged two and older for contrast-enhanced MRI.

He has always kept one foot in his native country and the other in the Middle East  where he has gone every year since his birth. Like many second-generation immigrants  the artist was exposed to the imperatives of conformism and integration in the country adopted by his parents but was constantly reminded of his roots by the predominantly white society in which he evolved. He moved from Sweden to Paris 14 years ago.”Through diverse and transversal practices such as sculpture  writing  performance  drawing  sound and video works  the thirty-year-old addresses the theses of uprooting  belonging  memory but also those of transformation and regeneration in his personal journey as well as in the history of the contemporary world.“I am a second-generation immigrant and my work is largely inspired by notions of displacement and uprooting.” Tarik KiswansonObtaining the Marcel Duchamp Prize is the high point of a year 2023 marked by three solo exhibitions around the world: one at the Museo Tamayo in Mexico  one at the Bonniers Konsthall in Stockholm and another at the Salzburger Kunstverein in Salzburg. In 2022  Tarik Kiswanson's works were shown at the Lyon Biennale  at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Antwerp (Belgium) and at the Hallands Konstmuseum (Sweden). In 2021 he had an exhibition at the Carré d'Art - Museum of Contemporary Art in Nîmes in 2021  and in 2019 he participated in New York's Performa 19 Biennale.Tarik Kiswanson graduated from Central Saint Martins  London (2010) and the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-arts in Paris (2014). The most recent winners of the Marcel Duchamp Prize were Mimosa Echard (2022)  Lili Reynaud Dewar (2021) and Kapwani Kiwanga (2020).The ADIAF and the Marcel Duchamp PrizeFounded by Gilles Fuchs and chaired since 2021 by Claude Bonnin  the ADIAF (Association for the International Diffusion of French Art) brings together 300 collectors of Contemporary French art.

Continued high inflation weighed on online sales  particularly in apparel (-8% in H1 2023[1]). Its increase at the end of the period accelerated the trend  as materialized by total spending on clothing-textiles down -2.3% in August according to Insee. Against this backdrop  Showroomprivé capitalized on its well-positioned offering  low-price DNA  revenue diversification and internationalization to reinforce its position on each of its markets. The successful integration of The Bradery has also extended the Group's growth potential  and the fashion site  targeting millenials  recorded strong revenue growth over the first nine months of the year  at 84% year-on-year.David Dayan  Chairman and CEO of Showroomprivé  comments: ""As the first nine months of 2023 ended  Showroomprivé has reaffirmed the strong resilience of its business model in an environment where consumption remains impacted by multiple exogenous shocks.

As a result  the Group will continue to develop market-leading offerings and leverage its capacity for innovation to multiply the sources of value creation  guided by the objective of sustainable  profitable growth despite the ups and downs of the economic climate"".Key performance indicators9 months 2022 9 months 2023 % change Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV)[2] 649.0 705.8 8.7% Cumulative buyers* (millions)[3] 11.7 12.4 6.1% Buyers** (millions ) 3[4] 2.37 2.35 (0.9)% of which loyal buyers *** 1.93 1.88 (2.4)% As % of total number of buyers 81% 80% (65) pts Number of orders (millions ) 34 7.86 7.50 (4.7)% Revenue by buyer (IFRS)34 172.0 172.4 0.3% Average number of orders per buyer 3.3 3.2 (3.8)% Average basket 51.8 54.0 4.2%* All buyers who have made at least one purchase on the Group's platform since its launch** Member who has placed at least one order during the year*** Member who has placed at least one order during the year and at least one order in previous yearsGMV reached €705.8m  up +8.7% in the first nine months of 2022.

Given the weight of this business  Group revenue was also down  from €144.7m to €139.6m. Showroomprivé has  however  managed to mitigate the impact of this downturn  thanks to the contribution of growth levers that are bringing additional growth and margins. These efforts were complemented by the expansion of the offering to include new references  notably in the sport lifestyle segment  with well-known brands that have been very well received by members.The Travel & Leisure segment continued its rebound since the end of the confinements  posting growth of almost 23% in Q3  benefiting  in addition to its intrinsic good momentum  from tour operators' decision to run aggressive promotions with last-minute prices during the summer period.The Marketplace continues to gain momentum  recording GMV growth of 112%.In a very demanding environment  SRP Media posted growth of 28%  driven by retail media  which continues to attract advertisers  and whose offering has recently been strengthened by the Unlimitail solution launched in partnership with Carrefour.International revenues once again made a positive contribution  continuing their steady rise in the business mix  with particularly strong momentum in strategic regions.LAUNCH OF THE NEW AD CAMPAIGNAs announced  and in line with the ACE roadmap  Showroomprivé has launched a major targeted advertising campaign to raise its awareness in France and resonate with its brand throughout the country  and particularly in major cities. The campaign  conducted with a holistic ROI approach  also aims at supporting the re-engagement of the member base.OUTLOOKIn the coming quarters  Showroomprivé anticipates a steadily adverse market environment in the final months of the 2023 financial year. Against this backdrop  the Group intends to pursue the implementation of its ACE roadmap  which will result in increased vigilance over inventory levels and a determination to capitalize on its low-price DNA and growth levers to ensure profitable growth. The Group will continue its efforts to control its cost structure and optimize its logistics network  while reallocating its resources to accelerate the development of its high-potential activities and the management of its offering  particularly during the year-end period. Showroomprivé is therefore concentrating its efforts on effectively implementing these strategic measures  in order to maximize their impact from the fourth quarter of this year.FURTHER INFORMATIONResults for fiscal year 2023: March 14  2024FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release contains summary information only and is not intended to be comprehensive.This press release may contain forward-looking information and statements about the Group and its subsidiaries.

The company recorded a decline in sales revenue and profitability after pandemic-related extraordinary business and additional inventory buildup by customers had triggered strong above average growth in previous years. Based on updated business expectations until year-end  management adapted its guidance for fiscal 2023 on October 12.“The timeline for market normalization has continuously expanded in the first nine months of the year: Customers are reducing inventories at a slower pace than initially assumed  while their investment activity and partially production levels remain muted. Signs of recovery in demand have become visible  and while they are progressing slower than anticipated  we expect the situation to continue to improve in the final quarter. Considering the strong fundamental growth drivers of our markets  we expect profitable growth in 2024 and beyond ” said René Fáber  CEO of Sartorius Stedim Biotech.Business development1The longer-than-expected normalization of demand continued in all regions  with a recovery trend toward the end of the third quarter. After exceptionally strong growth in prior years due to the pandemic  Sartorius Stedim Biotech recorded consolidated sales revenue of 2 069 million euros in the first nine months of 2023  which corresponds to a decline of 19.0 percent in constant currencies (organic: -20.6 percent; reported: - 20.5 percent). This includes a growth contribution from acquisitions of around 2 percentage points. Excluding the Covid-19-related business  the decline was slightly below 13 percent in constant currencies. Main drivers were ongoing inventory reductions after the end of the pandemic  relatively low production levels at some customers  the largely discontinued business in Russia  and an overall muted investment activity of customers  primarily in China and the USA.The temporarily weaker market environment was also reflected in order intake  which decreased by 31.0 percent in constant currencies (reported: -32.4 percent) to 1 760 million euros in the first nine months. In line with progress made by customers in reducing their inventories  there were signs of a slight recovery in order intake at the end of the third quarter.Underlying EBITDA decreased by 34.9 percent to 594 million euros due to lower volume development and product mix effects. The resulting margin was 28.7 percent (prior-year period: 35.0 percent). Price effects on the procurement and customer sides largely offset each other.Relevant net profit totaled 320 million euros  compared with 607 million euros in the prior-year period. Underlying earnings per share were 3.47 euros (prior-year period: 6.58 euros). The number of employees worldwide stood at 10 849 on September 30  2023  compared with 11 934 at the end of 2022.Key financial indicatorsEquity was 2 629 million euros as of September 30  2023. Following the financing of the Polyplus acquisition  the equity ratio1 stood in line with expectations at 33.0 percent (December 31  2022: 2 514 million euros and 49.6 percent  respectively)  and gross debt was 3 794 million euros (December 31  2022: 1 136 million euros). Net debt stood at 3 695 million euros  resulting in a ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA1 of 4.0 (December 31  2022: 1 029 million euros and 0.9  respectively). Cash flow from investing activities  excluding acquisitions  stood at -377 million euros  compared with -289 million euros in the prior-year period. The ratio of capital expenditures (capex) to sales revenue was 17.9 percent (prior-year period: 11.1 percent).Outlook for fiscal 2023 adapted on October 12Based on preliminary nine-month results  company management lowered its guidance for the fiscal year 2023 on October 12. Against the backdrop of a slower-than-anticipated industry recovery  Sartorius Stedim Biotech now forecasts a sales revenue decline of around 19 percent; excluding Covid-19-related business a decline of around 14 percent. Acquisitions are expected to contribute around 2 percentage points to the sales revenue development.Due to lower volume expectations and product mix effects  the underlying EBITDA margin is expected to be slightly above 28 percent.The capex ratio is projected at around 18 percent for 2023  with a ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA at around 4.5.The company confirms its fundamentally positive medium- and long-term market outlook and continues to see itself in a strong competitive position. For 2024  management expects profitable growth and will issue quantitative guidance with the release of the 2023 full-year figures next January. Its mid-term ambition is currently under review  and an update will also be provided in January 2024.All forecast figures are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. Management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the industry have increased significantly in recent years. In addition  uncertainties due to the changed geopolitical situation  such as the emerging decoupling tendencies of various countries  are playing a greater role. This results in higher uncertainty when forecasting business figures.1 Sartorius Stedim Biotech publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards.

The Group was able to continue generating cash without compromising its ability to invest for its development. With uncertainty around price and cost inflation expected to continue in 2023-2024  TERACT is targeting growth in its business volume primarily through the development of the growing bakery-snacks market and an acceleration of the franchise model and its own-brands in the Garden Centre segment.

The consolidated annual revenue for the 2022-2023 financial year of the Garden Centre/Pet Retail business  which includes the Jardiland  Gamm Vert (and Frais d'ICI range)  Delbard  Jardineries du Terroir and Noa brands  came to €808.6 million. This represents an increase of +1.7% in reported data and a decrease of -1.8%like-for-like  of which -1.1% in the second half of the year  marked by ongoing macroeconomic pressures. In this highly inflationary environment that also put pressure on purchasing power  TERACT decided to forge ahead and step up the development of its exclusive brands. The penetration rate of its own-brands has thus improved by five points compared with 30 June 2022 (20.6% of the revenue of integrated stores at 30 June 2023). The e-commerce websites (Gammvert.fr and Jardiland.com) saw further growth during the second half of the year  benefiting from the ongoing rollout of the digital plan. The consolidated annual revenue of the Food Retail business  which includes the Bio&Co (consolidated over 12 months)  Boulangerie Louise (consolidated over 7 months) and Grand Marché La Marnière (consolidated over 7 months) banners  reached €93.5 million. The period was impacted by the integration of Boulangerie Louise and Grand Marché la Marnière and their teams  and by the ongoing overhaul of Boulangerie Louise's offering with a particular focus on snack products. Adjusted EBITDA came to €67.5 million in 2022-2023. It was impacted in particular by an increase in inflation across all cost items which did not slow down at the end of the fiscal year. The increase in energy costs was partly offset by the energy savings plan initiated by the Group in September 2022. This notably included the launch of a new platform for the management of electricity consumption  which helped to reduce the latter by 30% versus the previous year. Costs relating to the successful integration of the newly acquired companies and their teams  a priority goal for the Group  and the significant rise in purchasing costs  which were not passed on to selling prices immediately and then only in a limited manner to help preserve purchasing power  also impacted EBITDA. The latter was also impacted by closing effects linked in particular to IFRS consolidation  which explains the difference in relation to the EBITDA estimate of €75-85 million communicated at the end of July9. Consequently  the adjusted EBITDA margin rate is 7.5%. Current operating income came to €2.1 million at 30 June 2023. There was an operating loss of €90.6 million after factoring in non-current expenses of €92.7 million  mainly attributable to the recognition in 2022-2023 of a non-cash listing service charge of €91.4 million in the context of the combination of InVivo Retail with the 2MX Organic SPAC. 9 https://www.teract.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TERACT_CP_CA-S2-et-FY-2022-23_20230727_EN.pdf 3 / 14PRESS RELEASE TERACT made a Group net loss of €106.6 million at 30 June 2023  primarily incorporating the aforementioned impact of the listing expense as part of the combination of InVivo Retail with the 2MX Organic SPAC of €91.4 million (a non-cash listing service charge)  a net financial loss of €17.6 million and a tax expense of €2.3 million. The net income from discontinued operations of €3.2 million corresponds to a rotation policy applicable to non-strategic assets.

TERACT chose to focus its financial priorities on recurring cash generation. On the one hand  it maintained sound cost management and  on the other  introduced efficient management of existing inventories. At €33.4 million  investment in operating activities was preserved as part of a rigorous selection process. The difference with the free cash flow estimate of €60-65 million communicated at the end of July11 is due to the aforementioned lag in relation to EBITDA.

The change is mainly attributable to the development of the Food Retail activity and in particular the acquisition over the year of two companies (Boulangerie Louise and Grand Marché La Marnière) and their impact in terms of rental payments. Restated for the outflow of non-recurring expenses related to the combination transaction in the amount of €11 million. https://www.teract.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TERACT_CP_CA-S2-et-FY-2022-23_20230727_EN.pdf 4 / 14PRESS RELEASE Outlook Commitments and outlook concerning CSR In line with its commitments  in 2023  TERACT will submit a proposal to its Shareholders' Meeting for a change of status to ""société à mission""  with its purpose being ""To help make the benefits of nature accessible to all"". This will entail the Group building and providing access to an offering of products and services that are healthy and responsible  applying operating practices that promote well-being and the environment and mobilising its employees and stakeholders in the regions in order to achieve the Group's societal ambition and meet new consumption expectations. To this end  it will implement and commit to a series of operational objectives that it will also track. The Group's main CSR objectives over the coming years are as follows12: Between now and 2025: 50% of managers to be hired through internal promotion (14.7% in 2022-2023)2022-2023) 50% less workplace accidents compared with 202090% of exclusive own-brandplant-based products of French origin (excluding greenhouse) (83% in 2022-2023) and 50% of plant products from sector commitments (43% in 2022-2023)own-brandplant-based products of French origin (excluding greenhouse) (83% in 2022-2023) and 50% of plant products from sector commitments (43% in 2022-2023) 80% of exclusive own-brands with a positive impact (54.4% in 2022-2023) By 2030:own-brands with a positive impact (54.4% in 2022-2023) By 2030: 10% less water consumption compared with 2022-20232022-2023 100% of stores accredited an animal welfare label (35% in 2022-2023)2022-2023) 70% of waste sorted and recycled (59% in 2022-2023)2022-2023) -46% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions versus 2019-2020 (scopes 1 and 2) (47.6% reduction in 2022-2023). The target has therefore already been achieved for the Garden Centre/Pet Retail scope thanks to the effectiveness of TERACT's multi-annual energy savings and efficiency plan. Operating and financial outlook Amid persistent macroeconomic pressures in the second half of 2023 (first half of TERACT's 2023-2024 financial year) and uncertainty as to how the situation will evolve in the first half of 2024 (second half of TERACT's 2023-2024 financial year)  the Group is maintaining a prudent approach in order to limit the effects of inflation and reduced purchasing power while also improving the seasonal aspect of its business model in order to generate growth. New store openings  particularly in the bakery/snacks line (around ten to be opened between now and June 2024)  will enable to bolster revenue in a sector that continues to offer high margins and a strong growth outlook and in which the potential for greater regional coverage is strong. TERACT will also continue to roll out its own Garden Centre brands  for which it targets an increase in the penetration rate of 2 to 3 percentage points to 24% of the revenue of integrated stores in 2023-2024. The company will also continue to ensure effective management and optimisation of its store network while pursuing the development of its franchise model. This will be underpinned by an attractive omnichannel model that is a leader in the sector in France  as part of an overhaul of the e-commerce websites and a focus on stores put back at the core of the digital strategy  through the repayment of the revenue 12 The scope of indicators for 2022-2023 does not include the entities integrated since 1 December 2022  i.e. Boulangerie Louise and Grand Marché La Marnière. It will be expanded for the 2023-2024 financial year. 5 / 14PRESS RELEASE concerned. The strict cost management policy  particularly in relation to energy  will be maintained while the integration of companies acquired during the year is being completed. Taking into account these elements  and barring any further deterioration in the environment  TERACT estimates it will generate revenue in 2023-2024 of €900-950 million. The ongoing work to control costs and inventories should continue to have a positive impact on free cash flow generation while maintaining a capex level enabling to effectively pursue the company's development. In line with the projects undertaken over the past year  TERACT remains open to alliances that make good business sense and which would generate growth  improve the margin and integrate effectively with the upstream/downstream activities of InVivo. *** 6 / 14PRESS RELEASE Appendix 1.

LifeSci Capital is acting as lead manager for the proposed U.S. Offering. Bryan  Garnier & Co is acting as European lead manager for the proposed European Private Placement (collectively  the “Underwriters”). Namsen Capital is acting as Abivax’s capital markets advisor. Pricing of the Global Offering and Discount The offering price was set at $11.60 per ADS. The offering price per ADS corresponds to the offering price of €10.9864 per ordinary share based on the October 19  2023 exchange rate of €1.00 = $1.0559. The public offering price per ordinary share in euros (€10.9864) is equal to the volume weighted-average price of the Company’s ordinary shares on Euronext Paris over the last three (3) trading days preceding the start of the offering (i.e.  16th  17th and 18th of October 2023)  less a discount of 9.4%  and is determined by the Company in compliance with the 15th resolution of the Company’s combined general shareholders’ meeting held on June 5  2023. Type of Offering The New Shares will be issued through a capital increase without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights by way of a public offering excluding offerings referred to in Article L. 411-2 1° of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) and under the provisions of Article L.225-136 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and pursuant to the fifteenth and nineteenth resolutions of the Company’s combined general shareholders’ meeting held on June 5  2023. Option to Purchase Additional Shares The Company has granted the Underwriters an option to purchase (the “Option”)  for a 30-day period (until November 20  2023)  up to 3 048 825 additional ADSs and/or ordinary shares  which represents 15% of the aggregate amount of New Shares to be issued in the Global Offering  at the same offering price. Stabilization In connection with the Global Offering  the Underwriters may over-allot the securities or effect transactions with a view to supporting  stabilizing  or maintaining the market price of the securities at a level higher than which might otherwise prevail in the open market. However  there is no assurance that the stabilizing manager will take any stabilization action and  if begun  may be ended at any time without prior notice. Any stabilization action or over-allotment shall be carried out in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and may be undertaken on the Nasdaq Global Market and/or Euronext Paris. Dilution Based on the issuance of 20 325 500 New Shares in the Global Offering (including ordinary shares in the form of ADSs)  the number of ordinary shares held by the existing shareholders after the Global Offering would be 67.7% of the total number of ordinary shares (including ordinary shares in the form of ADSs) outstanding after the Global Offering. If the Underwriters exercise their option to purchase 3 048 825 additional ADSs and/or ordinary shares in full  the number of ordinary shares held by the existing shareholders after the Global Offering would be 64.5% of the total number of ordinary shares (including ordinary shares in the form of ADSs) outstanding after the Global Offering. Estimated Proceeds from the Global Offering - Reasons of the offering - Use of proceeds The gross proceeds of the sale of 20 325 500 New Shares  including ordinary shares in the form of ADSs  in the Global Offering is expected to be approximately $235.8 million (€223.3 million)  assuming no exercise of the Underwriters’ Option. The Company estimates that the net proceeds of the Global Offering will be approximately $212.2 million (€201.1 million)  after deducting approximately $16.5 million (€15.6 million) in underwriting commissions and approximately $7.0 million (€6.6 million) in estimated offering expenses. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the Global Offering as follows (assuming an exchange rate of €1.00 = $1.0559  the exchange rate on October 19  2023): approximately €160.0 million ($168.9 million) to fund the development of obefazimod for UC;approximately €14.0 million ($14.8 million) to fund the development of obefazimod for CD; andthe remainder for working capital and for other general corporate purposes  including in the continued research to identify new compounds and the payment of maturities of existing debt agreements as they become due (mostly allocated to payments under the Kreos / Claret Financing (as defined below)  and assuming that the Company will repay the Heights Financing (as defined below) through the issuance of new shares instead of making cash payments). The Company believes that the anticipated net proceeds from the Global Offering  together with its current cash and cash equivalents  will allow it to finance its operations through (i) the announcement of its top-line data from its Phase 3 ABTECT-1 and ABTECT-2 induction trials for UC and (ii) the announcement of its top-line data from its Phase 2a induction trial for CD. The Company believes that based on its current clinical plan and its anticipated net proceeds from the Global Offering  together with (a) its existing cash and cash equivalents of €114.4 million as of June 30  2023  (b) the net proceeds of the August 2023 drawdown of the first tranches of the financing agreements entered into with entities affiliated with Kreos Capital (“KC”) and Claret European Growth Capital (the “Kreos / Claret Financing”) and entities affiliated with Heights Capital Management (the “Heights Financing”)  collectively amounting to €27.2 million (net of repayments of all outstanding amounts that remained due under the prior two financing agreements entered into with KC and the OCEANE bonds)  (c) the anticipated net proceeds from the drawdown of the second tranche of the Kreos / Claret Financing  amounting to €25 million (which is a portion of the total available drawdown of €65 million from the Kreos / Claret Financing and the Heights Financing) and (d) the expected Research Tax Credit (CIR) reimbursements would enable the Company to fund its operations through the fourth quarter of 2025. Under these assumptions and based on its current clinical plan  the Company would have sufficient funds to finance its operations through (i) the announcement of its top-line data from the Phase 3 ABTECT-1 and ABTECT-2 induction trials for UC and (ii) the announcement of its top-line data from the Phase 2a induction trial for CD. If the Company further draws down on the third tranche of the Kreos / Claret Financing  amounting to €25 million and the second tranche of the Heights Financing amounting to €40 million  the Company expects to have sufficient funds to finance its operations through the first quarter of 2026. Under these assumptions and based on its current clinical plan  it would have sufficient funds to finance its operations through the announcement of its top-line data from the Phase 3 ABTECT maintenance trial for UC.

Open interest peaked at over 2 000 in March earlier this year. This has led to the derivatives exchange making another appearance in this award category following last year’s nomination. In November last year  CEDX revealed plans to expand its product suite to include single stock options on leading European companies. The first phase of these new products have been confirmed to be available for trading from 6 November 2023  including options on over 130 companies from 12 European companies  and will be cleared by Cboe Clear Europe N.V.

The new futures are traded in EUR and USD  providing trusted access to cryptocurrencies in a regulated market through Eurex. The derivatives venue was also chosen by State Street and BNY Mellon to centrally clear European transactions in May and September  respectively. In the same month  Goldman Sachs became the latest sell-side institution to join Eurex’s listed FX futures business as a trading and clearing member which Eurex described as a “major milestone” in its ambition to become a listed FX liquidity hub in Europe.EuronextRounding up our prestigious list of outstanding derivatives exchanges is Euronext.
