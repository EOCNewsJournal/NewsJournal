31647,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://euobserver.com/world/157585,Diamonds to star in new EU sanctions on Russia,"""If we linked one [the Ukraine war] with the other [the Gaza war] then the next sanctions to befall Russia would be drastically more powerful "" an EU diplomat said.","Diamonds are set to star in the EU's 12th round of Russia sanctions  amid concern the Gaza war should not eclipse ongoing aggression against Ukraine.The Group of Seven (G7) Western allies are poised to announce a Russia-diamond ban ""in the very coming days""  a European diplomat told press in Brussels on Friday (20 October).Student or retired? Then this plan is for you.Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán (l) with Russian president Vladimir Putin in China this week (Photo: kremlin.ru)""The system has been ready for a few weeks and now what we're waiting for is the final G7 declaration to put it into words and confirm the will of the G7 to work with this system""  he added.The G7-ban and its traceability protocols were crafted together with Belgium  which hosts the world's biggest diamond-trading centre in Antwerp  and the European Commission.Canada  France  Germany  Italy  Japan  the UK  and US (the G7) account for 70 percent of world diamond end-user demand.And Belgium is fully on board to extend the G7 ban to the EU-27 as part of the next round of Russia sanctions  the European diplomat said  lifting the main obstacle to the move — which other EU states and Ukraine have wanted for over a year.The EU commission is to start behind-closed-doors talks  called ""confessionals""  with individual EU capitals this weekend or early next week on the 12th package of measures.Lithuania and Poland have submitted detailed proposals. Estonia has also fleshed out ideas  in a process that could still take weeks to finalise.The EU should ban new deals with Russian nuclear firm Rosatom  stop buying Russian uranium  liquid gas  and steel  Lithuania's proposal said.It should also block IT services for Russian firms and halt exports of laser technology  on top of any diamonds move  Vilnius said.Rosatom  IT services  liquid gas  and diamonds headlined the Polish proposal  while Estonia is seeking a full trade embargo on Russia to stop sanctions circumvention.Customs officials in Russia-bordering ""transit"" EU states can no longer cope with the burden of controlling exports of banned and non-banned items  Tallinn has argued.EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Monday will also discuss EU funds for Ukraine and using frozen Russian money to pay for war damage  as well as the Gaza war.""We have to be aware there's a strong Russian interest that this [Ukraine] crisis would fall in the shadow "" a second EU diplomat said in Brussels on Friday.Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán has vetoed EU financial aid to Ukraine  because Kyiv blacklisted his top bank over its business ties to Russia.But  as with diamonds  diplomats expected an imminent breakthrough on Orbán after Kyiv agreed to delist his lender.""Hungary is saying some people linked to the sanctions are still on the [Ukraine] list and saying it wants guarantees this won't happen again … there's a lot going on behind the scenes "" the EU diplomat said.Meanwhile  EU Council ""working groups"" have accelerated work on use of frozen Russian assets  diplomats added.Belgium is also at the heart of EU efforts on this front  after it froze €125bn of Russian money managed by the Brussels-based Euroclear firm.And it has proposed an EU approach based on Belgian law  which allows Belgian tax income arising from interest on frozen Russian money to be paid to Kyiv — a tax sum worth over €2.3bn in 2023 and 2024 in Belgium alone.For his part  Orbán also embarrassed the EU by shaking hands with Russian president Vladimir Putin in China on Tuesday.And he has vetoed EU sanctions on Russian nuclear and energy industries and VIPs in the past.Sign up for EUobserver’s daily newsletter All the stories we publish  sent at 7.30 AM. By signing up  you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.""On the Orbán handshake there is no such point on the [EU foreign ministers'] agenda — what they [Orbán and Putin] discussed in the corridors is another matter "" the EU diplomat said.In any case  the rapidly unfolding Gaza war will ""take up most of the time"" in Luxembourg on Monday  as EU countries also seek to send a united message on the Middle East  the diplomat predicted.But for others  EU ministers should be talking about the Ukraine war and the Gaza war as two parts of one greater conflict instead of two parallel crises.""It's obvious that Russia and Iran have enflamed the Middle East together  and it's just the beginning "" a third EU diplomat said  referring to Russia and Iran's financial and political support for Hamas  the Palestinian group that attacked Israel on 7 October.""If we linked one with the other then the next sanctions to befall Russia would be drastically more powerful  but the EU prefers to believe in fairy stories — that its existing sanctions regime is crippling Russia "" he said.Russia kinksDiamond exports are worth €4bn a year to the Kremlin and have symbolic value as a luxury icon.The EU has also banned Russian oil and pipeline gas  banks  other trade worth over €130bn year  and blacklisted some 1 800 VIPs and entities in the previous 11 rounds of sanctions.But even if the Russia diamond-ban is a shoe-in for the 12th round  the Lithuanian sanctions proposal  seen by EUobserver  exposed other kinks in the regime.""There are still 77 critical components [used by the Russian military] that are available for Russia to access freely as these goods and technologies are not subject to EU sanctions "" it said.""Latest expert reports suggest that both Iranian and Russian UAVs (namely Mohajer-6  Shahed-136 and Orlan) are manufactured from a broad array of components made in Western countries "" it added.Russia has ""unlimited access to cloud computing technologies  provided by companies located in EU and its allies' jurisdictions "" it said.And this meant ""European own computing infrastructure is being used by Russia to attack thousands of cloud storages with life-saving information about aid  shelter  and evacuation procedures [in Ukraine] "" via 'DDOS' cyber-assaults.Overlong Russian steel-import exemptions also ""significantly distort the steel market in the EU in favour of Belgian and Italian companies "" Lithuania said.Vilnius' recommendations for ""degrading of Russian industrial capacities"" stretched to dozens of pages of minutiae.The EU  in previous rounds  banned exports of toilets to Russia  prompting mockery of living standards under Putin  where many people don't have ordinary mod cons.The 12th round should also include a ban on EU exports of ""radiators for central heating  non-electrically heated  and parts thereof "" (worth €49m last year) Lithuania said.And it should ban even sales of ""nails  tacks  drawing pins"" and ""sewing needles  knitting needles""  Vilnius said.",neutral,0.18,0.54,0.28,negative,0.03,0.28,0.69,True,English,"['new EU sanctions', 'Diamonds', 'Russia', 'Hungarian prime

The fund targets investors capitalizing on the shift from fossil fuels to sustainable energy alternatives. It is linked to the S&P Global Essential Metals Producers Index  which selects constituents from companies with market capitalizations above $300 million and average daily trading volumes greater than $3m.The ETF includes firms dealing with key metals like   lithium  nickel  cobalt  platinum  palladium  and rare earth metals. These are in high demand due to the transition towards renewable energy technologies. Manuela Sperandeo underscored the rising demand for these minerals due to strategic priorities  supply chain issues  and low-carbon investment opportunities.The index uses 'Exposure Scores' derived from firms' revenue generation from metal discovery  extraction  and processing of 'core' or 'non-core' metals like aluminum  bauxite  molybdenum  silver  zinc. The demand for these metals isn't significantly influenced by the sectoral transition. Companies with high revenue from non-core metals see a relative decrease in their Exposure Scores.The index aims for a roster of at least 50 constituents meeting or exceeding a specific Exposure Score threshold. Constituents are weighted using a hybrid formula considering float-adjusted market capitalization and Exposure Scores. Capping rules limit individual stock weightings with high-scoring firms capped at 8% portfolio weighting and lower-scoring ones capped at 4%.The fund accumulates income within its portfolio for long-term capital growth and has an expense ratio of 0.55%.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services today published the following open letter from its Group CEO Kaan Terzioglu to its investors. The open letter can be found on the company website: www.veon.comAmsterdam  20 October 2023Dear VEON Investors I am writing to you today to share a number of key developments in VEON’s re-engagement with the capital markets. Following our exit from Russia  VEON has a renewed focus on leveraging our Digital Operator 1440 strategy in the six fast-growing markets where we operate. I am pleased to note that we enter this new phase supported by a solid financial foundation; and that the investment community is already taking a fresh look at our company and its potential to generate value and growth.Group financial positionFollowing the early redemption of the VEON Holdings December 2023 and June 2024 notes in September  and considering VEON’s exit from Russia and the payment of October 2023 VEON Holdings bond in October  our pro-forma Group debt and cash position as of 30 September 2023  is as follows:Group debt is USD 3.5bn (USD 4.4bn including leases)  of which USD 2.8bn at HQGroup cash is USD 1.7bn  of which USD 1.3bn at HQ 1Group net debt including leases is USD 2.6bn  of which USD 1.6bn at HQ.This is a major reduction from the Group net debt including leases of USD 8.2bn as per 30 September 2022.Our pro-forma Group weighted average cost of debt  excluding leases  is approximately 8% with a Group weighted average maturity of approximately 2.4 years.Our pro-forma externally outstanding VEON Holdings notes  their maturities and outstanding amounts are shared at the end of this letter* for the clarity of our investors.Reinstatement of independent analyst coverage of VEON shares and return to unrestricted tradingWe are pleased to report that independent analyst coverage of VEON shares has resumed. New Street Research reinstated its coverage of VEON shares on 11 October 2023; on 18 October 2023  Inam (via Tellimer) also initiated coverage of VEON.We can now also confirm stronger volumes in the trading of our shares. We understand some of the world’s largest banks are now accepting “buy” orders from our investors; and welcome the fact that our investors are now able to work with these institutions in purchasing VEON’s debt and equity instruments. We would like to thank our investors for their patience and trust in our business; and reiterate that we remain at their disposal should they need our further support.Reiterating our commitment to the future of UkraineAs we have communicated last week  we are also actively engaging with our stakeholders to address the concerns relating to some media reports in Ukraine. A VEON delegation including members of our Board and management will be in Kyiv in the coming days to visit Kyivstar and hold discussions with key stakeholders  reiterating our commitment to the recovery and reconstruction of Ukraine – for which we have committed USD 600 million over the course of the next three years.I trust that these recent developments  combined with the high potential of our business  will enable our existing and potential investors to participate in the growth opportunity that our business presents. We are confident in the value we can generate in Pakistan  Ukraine  Bangladesh  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan  which will support not only VEON’s value proposition for its investors  but also the sustainable growth of these markets that are home to 510 million people  or 7% of the world’s population.We look forward to working with VEON investors and analysts in the months ahead  providing further clarity into our investment case following our exit from Russia and answering any further questions.

With only enough cash to keep going for days  the board  which Joyce left last Friday after stepping down as a non-executive director  is desperately trying to secure fresh investment or a sale of the business as its advisers also work on a backup – or parallel – option of filing for examinership.Investors who pumped almost €50 million into the company in the past decade  including €25 million raised in a peak-of-the-market initial public offering (IPO) in December 2021  face the prospect of losing all that they have committed.They include clients of Cantor Fitzgerald Ireland  who own 11.4 per cent  Belfast-born tech entrepreneur Bill McCabe’s Oyster Capital  an early backer of the company which continues to own about 10.8 per cent  and Elkstone Partners vehicles  which own a combined 7.3 per cent.[ HealthBeacon co-founder quits board amid funding crisis ]Tommy Kelly  founder of ecommerce business EWS  in which he sold his remaining 49.9 per cent stake in 2021 in a deal that valued the business at more than €1 billion  had also cropped up on HealthBeacon’s shareholder register last year. His Eidervale vehicle owns a little over 4 per cent. Food flavourings entrepreneur Kieran Fox’s Quorndon Capital holds a 4 per cent stake.“In my opinion  it is a serious concern that such a high-profile company would not have identified the reduction of cash reserves as a serious problem earlier and  in a timely manner  considered the various options with professional advisers ” said Mark Woodcock  a partner and head of corporate restructuring at law firm Fieldfisher’s Irish practice. “In fairness  one can only presume that they have been considering the options but not effected them properly for whatever reason.”For many followers of the company  HealthBeacon’s main problem was listing on the stock market too early. At that point its flagship product  which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018  was still in the early commercialisation stage in Europe and the US.The product  a little bigger than a standard toaster  is connected to a patient’s smartphone and used for the disposal of injector pens and syringes as well as being a device to track adherence to medication regimes and to prompt people to stay on track if necessary.The problem with people not sticking to treatment plans is massive. According to the World Health Organisation  about half of patients fail to stay the course when long-term medication is prescribed.HealthBeacon's device is a little bigger than a toaster.The International Longevity Centre-UK  a think tank on the impact of longevity on society  estimated in a report last year that as much as $290 billion (€275 billion) of US healthcare expenditure is wasted every year as patients end up requiring additional treatment or hospitalisation for failing to stick to doctors’ orders on medication. It put the annual cost in Europe at $125 billion.HealthBeacon research  peer reviewed and published in the International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy last year  points to a 26 per cent improvement in therapy adherence by patients who administer injectable medications for a range of chronic autoimmune conditions at home using the company’s device.The story of HealthBeacon to date has been one of overpromising and underdelivering — Dublin-based angel investor in the companyThe company estimates that the market of about 30 million people self-injecting with medicines across the US  Canada and Europe is worth about $10 billion per year  according to its website.Its main distribution channel is through deals with pharmaceutical companies  which cover the cost of the devices. It also expanded in 2021 into selling units directly to consumers in the US through home appliances distributor Hamilton Beach Brands  and also has a sales channel where costs are reimbursed by health insurance programmes.“The brainwave to try to turn sharps bins into modern-age devices to help with adherence led to a device being successfully created. And Jim was certainly able to convince people of the value of the proposition  with his natural American confidence ” said a Dublin-based angel investor familiar with HealthBeacon from when it was a private company. “But the story of HealthBeacon to date has been one of overpromising and underdelivering.”In late 2020  when HealthBeacon raised €5.7 million in a funding round  the company forecast revenues would hit €10 million by 2022 and that it would be breaking even at operating profit level  according to sources. In the event  it delivered less than a quarter of the estimated sales and an operating loss of €13.2 million.The key goal outlined to investors at the time of the IPO almost two years ago was that it would have 100 000 devices in the market by the end of 2023.HealthBeacon co-founder Jim Joyce  pictured last year. Photograph: Nick BradshawHowever  the company issued a warning in July of last year  saying device sales targets were running behind schedule and that the 100 000 objective would not be met until March 2024 – as delays in securing computer chips temporarily held up production. The timeline was subsequently pushed out again by a further three months.“If a company is going to float on the market  it really needs to have clear visibility to deliver on its stated objectives over the following 12 months at least ” said the angel investor  who declined to be identified.The shock sales warning last month saw HealthBeacon pull its previous targets that annual recurring revenues (ARR) would be around the “mid-teens” million-euro level by the end of this year and rise to €25 million by the middle of 2024. Instead  it said the ARR run-rate would only be €3.2 million by the end of this year and €17 million by the end of next year.While the company has been successful in striking major distribution deals with US speciality pharma groups  it has been caught out by the red tape involved in rolling them out. Its current timelines are running up to nine months behind previous estimates.“The irony in all of this is that the company had actually managed the crack the US market. It had delivered on its commercial promise ” said a source close to the company.HealthBeacon launched its system with US speciality pharmacy partner Accredo for a “major global blockbuster” injectable medication in July and is currently receiving over 1 700 patient referrals a month.It said last month that it is also in final launch planning with its next large speciality pharmacy and in contracting and negotiations with three others.The sell-off was compounded by the business saying on October 5th that it was down to its last €500 000 of net cash  enough to continue trading until the mid- to late NovemberWhile the source close to the company said its “meticulous” project management and modelling ability helped it win over major speciality pharma groups  the estimated roll-out time frames proved to be overly optimistic.HealthBeacon’s market value slump by 95 per cent to €1.18 million over 14 trading sessions between the revenue alert and the company moving last Friday to have its shares suspended.The sell-off was compounded by the business – which had been burning through €1 million of cash month in the first half of the year – saying on October 5th that it was down to its last €500 000 of net cash  enough to continue trading until the mid- to late November. It followed up last Friday to warn that its “short-term working capital” had subsequently deteriorated and that it only had enough funds to keep its doors open “until the last week of October”.It is understood that supply-chain partners tightened up on trade credit as a result of the company’s worsening financial position and the CEO exit. Former HealthBeacon non-executive director Rebecca Shanahan  whose Florida-based Shanahan Capital Ventures focuses on developing and restructuring healthcare businesses  has been acting as interim CEO since Joyce was forced out of the role by the board.The woes of HealthBeacon also mark a setback for the Irish Stock Exchange operator  Euronext Dublin  as it seeks to entice market entrants at a time when some of its larger companies are departing. HealthBeacon is alone among scores of companies that have gone through the exchange’s IPO Ready programme since 2015 to take the plunge into the public market.CRH  formerly the largest Iseq company  quit the Irish market last month as it moved its main listing from London to New York. Another Iseq behemoth  Smurfit Kappa  has said it also plans to delist in Dublin as it merges with a US rival. Flutter Entertainment  the parent of bookmakers Paddy Power  is also widely expected to drop its Irish listing in the near term.HealthBeacon’s own IPO came in the same month that global equities – measured by the MSCI All-Country World Equity Index – soared to a peak  before central banks started to hike interest rates to rein in inflation.“The IPO was priced as a tech offering ” said a market source. “There was a lot of hope value in it.”The Irish Times reported on Tuesday that HealthBeacon has attracted parties interested in making an investment in the company or an outright purchase  at a time when Grant Thornton  which is also HealthBeacon’s auditor  is advising on restructuring options  including the possibility of seeking examinership protection from its creditors.Sources have subsequently said that Joyce is among those to signal to the company an interest in committing fresh funds  alongside some existing and new investors. It is not clear what other investors are involved or whether this pitch would see HealthBeacon being taken private again or continue as a public company.A spokesman for HealthBeacon declined to comment and efforts to secure comment from Joyce were unsuccessful.“Whatever the directors do  they must do it quickly ” said Fieldfisher’s Woodcock.,neutral,0.05,0.86,0.09,mixed,0.09,0.21,0.7,True,English,"['HealthBeacon', 'lights', 'medtech', 'cash', 'Belfast-born tech entrepreneur Bill McCabe', 'market initial public offering', 'The International Longevity Centre', 'remaining 49.9 per cent stake', 'The Boston native', 'Cantor Fitzgerald Ireland', 'Elkstone Partners vehicles', 'World Health Organisation', 'chronic autoimmune conditions', 'Dublin-based angel investor', '4 per cent stake', 'professional social network', 'early commercialisation stage', 'main distribution channel', '26 per cent improvement', 'sharps disposal bins', 'ecommerce business EWS', 'home appliances distributor', 'US healthcare expenditure', '11.4 per cent', '10.8 per cent', '7.3 per cent', 'International Journal', 'stock market', 'early backer', 'main problem', 'bike riding', 'chief executive', 'Dublin-listed medtech', 'injection schedules', 'many successes', 'many achievements', 'straight line', '325-word account', 'countless awards', 'growing revenues', 'sales warning', 'CEO spot', 'past decade', 'enough cash', 'executive director', 'fresh investment', 'parallel – option', 'Oyster Capital', 'funding crisis', 'Tommy Kelly', 'shareholder register', 'Eidervale vehicle', 'Food flavourings', 'Kieran Fox', 'Quorndon Capital', 'serious concern', 'cash reserves', 'professional advisers', 'Mark Woodcock', 'corporate restructuring', 'law firm', 'Irish practice', 'many followers', 'Drug Administration', 'injector pens', 'treatment plans', 'think tank', 'additional treatment', 'doctors’ orders', 'Clinical Pharmacy', 'injectable medications', 'pharmaceutical companies', 'Hamilton Beach', 'serious problem', 'medication regimes', 'long-term medication', 'US Food', 'various options', 'flagship product', 'standard toaster', 'annual cost', 'therapy adherence', 'Jim Joyce', '30 million people', 'smart device', 'high-profile company', 'HealthBeacon research', 'founder', 'computer', 'September', 'LinkedIn', 'idea', 'needles', 'syringes', 'patients', 'mission', '53-year', 'experience', '800,000 injections', 'devices', 'future', 'READ', 'mention', 'post', 'Investors', 'peak', 'IPO', 'December', 'prospect', 'survival', 'days', 'board', 'backup', 'examinership', 'clients', 'deal', 'opinion', 'reduction', 'manner', 'head', 'Fieldfisher', 'fairness', 'reason', 'listing', 'point', 'FDA', 'Europe', 'smartphone', 'track', 'half', 'course', 'UK', 'impact', 'society', 'report', 'hospitalisation', 'range', 'story', 'date', 'medicines', 'Canada', 'website', 'units', 'consumers']",2023-10-20,2023-10-21,irishtimes.com

The growing membership numbers in combination with the further increasing yield per member resulted in a revenue growth of 36% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period last year. The average revenue per member will continue to increase the coming years. For this year we continue to expect an average yield per member of at least €23.50. For 2024 we expect the yield to show a further gradual increase to more than €24.50. The yield increase should more than compensate for cost inflation and contribute to the further improvement of underlying club EBITDA margins. The majority of the 73 net club openings in the quarter took place in September. This is in line with our adjusted strategy to open new clubs predominantly during the seasonally busier periods. I am proud to mention an outstanding performance of our teams by successfully opening a record 55 new clubs within one single week in September.

We opened 183 clubs and closed 7 clubs. Most clubs were opened in France  where we operated 763 clubs (YTD +116) at the end of the period. Our Spanish network recorded a growth of 45 clubs to 135. Compared to a year ago  our Spanish network increased by 61 clubs (+81%). Our Benelux operations continued the more moderate growth pace with club growth of seven in the Netherlands to 238 and three in Belgium to 222 in the period. Our club count in Luxembourg remained ten. In our newest country Germany we now operate eight clubs  all being opened in the past twelve months. Following the seasonal slower July and August months  we recorded a sound start of the back-to- school period in September. We ended the period with 3.71 million memberships  an increase of more than 560 thousand or 18% compared to a year ago. The uptake of the premium membership remained above 55%. At the end of the quarter  44% of our total membership base had a Premium membership. The year-to-date yield increased to €23.28. The increase was driven by the higher percentage of Premium memberships and the price increase at the start of the year. The yield increase is slightly impaired by the higher membership growth in countries with a higher VAT rate and our successful founding member opening campaigns. For 2024  we expect the yield to show a further gradual increase to more than €24.50. The yield increase should more than compensate cost inflation and contribute to the further improvement of underlying club EBITDA margins. REVENUE DEVELOPMENT Basic-Fit reported a 36% increase in revenue to €765 million over the first nine months of 2023 (9M 2022: €563 million). The increase is the result of a strong club openings programme and the growth in memberships  combined with the higher yield.

These results reinforce the importance of performing EGFR testing in early-stage NSCLC to predict the most appropriate treatment options.The fourth abstract5 describes a research project that aims to identify the feasibility of the Idylla™ GeneFusion Assay in detecting RET fusions in Papillary Thyroid Cancer (PTC).Roger Moody  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “I am proud that independent researchers confirm the excellent performance of our products  especially the studies on the Idylla™ GeneFusion Assay  which demonstrates that this assay can be valuable for various cancer indications. The confirmation of the low invalid rates of our products in combination with their fast time to result  are a confirmation of the benefits of our Idylla™ Platform compared to other technologies such as NGS.”The four study abstracts on Idylla™ which have been selected for ESMO  can be downloaded here: https://cslide.ctimeetingtech.com/esmo2023/attendee/confcal_2/presentation/list?--- END ---More information:Investor Relations Biocartise-mail ir@biocartis.comAbout BiocartisWith its revolutionary and proprietary Idylla™ Platform  Biocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) aspires to enable personalized medicine for patients around the world through universal access to molecular testing  by making molecular testing actionable  convenient  fast and suitable for any lab.

The growing membership numbers in combination with the further increasing yield per member resulted in a revenue growth of 36% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period last year. The average revenue per member will continue to increase the coming years. For this year we continue to expect an average yield per member of at least €23.50. For 2024 we expect the yield to show a further gradual increase to more than €24.50. The yield increase should more than compensate for cost inflation and contribute to the further improvement of underlying club EBITDA margins. The majority of the 73 net club openings in the quarter took place in September. This is in line with our adjusted strategy to open new clubs predominantly during the seasonally busier periods. I am proud to mention an outstanding performance of our teams by successfully opening a record 55 new clubs within one single week in September. We look forward to presenting an update on our strategy and growth plans at our forthcoming Capital Markets Day on 9 November.""

We opened 183 clubs and closed 7 clubs. Most clubs were opened in France  where we operated 763 clubs (YTD +116) at the end of the period. Our Spanish network recorded a growth of 45 clubs to 135. Compared to a year ago  our Spanish network increased by 61 clubs (+81%). Our Benelux operations continued the more moderate growth pace with club growth of seven in the Netherlands to 238 and three in Belgium to 222 in the period. Our club count in Luxembourg remained ten. In our newest country Germany we now operate eight clubs  all being opened in the past twelve months. Following the seasonal slower July and August months  we recorded a sound start of the back-to- school period in September. We ended the period with 3.71 million memberships  an increase of more than 560 thousand or 18% compared to a year ago. The uptake of the premium membership remained above 55%. At the end of the quarter  44% of our total membership base had a Premium membership. The year-to-date yield increased to €23.28. The increase was driven by the higher percentage of Premium memberships and the price increase at the start of the year. The yield increase is slightly impaired by the higher membership growth in countries with a higher VAT rate and our successful founding member opening campaigns. For 2024  we expect the yield to show a further gradual increase to more than €24.50. The yield increase should more than compensate cost inflation and contribute to the further improvement of underlying club EBITDA margins. REVENUE DEVELOPMENT Basic-Fit reported a 36% increase in revenue to €765 million over the first nine months of 2023 (9M 2022: €563 million). The increase is the result of a strong club openings programme and the growth in memberships  combined with the higher yield.

Cables accounted for approximately 19% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group’s sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group’s total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® (dupilumab) in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). CSU is an inflammatory skin condition  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and swelling on the skin. The CRL states that additional efficacy data are required to support an approval; it did not identify any issues with safety or manufacturing. An ongoing clinical trial (Study C) continues to enroll patients  with results expected in late 2024 that are anticipated to provide the additional efficacy data.Regeneron and Sanofi remain committed to working with the FDA to advance the study of Dupixent for patients living with CSU who are inadequately controlled by antihistamines.The potential use of Dupixent in CSU is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the CSU Clinical Trial ProgramThe clinical trial program  known as LIBERTY-CUPID  includes Studies A  B and C  three Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU.Study A evaluated Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care H1 antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 138 patients with CSU aged 6 years and older who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab. Efficacy and safety data from Study A were the basis of the sBLA. Study B evaluated Dupixent in 108 patients with CSU aged 12 to 80 years who remained symptomatic despite standard-of-care treatment and were intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab  with results providing additional supporting data for the sBLA. Study C is an ongoing trial investigating Dupixent in the same population as Study A.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 750 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

We would like to specify that this report provides all the information prescribed and required by Article 2428 of the Italian Civil Code  as amended by Legislative Decree no. 32 of 2007  as well as that required by the Italian Accounting Profession (Consiglio Nazionale dei Dottori Commercialisti e degli Esperti Contabili). The information provided is considered to be useful for giving a true  fair and comprehensive view of the Group's performance concerning the results of operations as a whole  as well as a description of the main risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed. The Group's structure and business Medica S.p.A. (""Company"") and its subsidiaries (collectively  the ""Group"" or the ""Medica Group"") are an international player that is active in the manufacturing of medical products and hospital equipment  in particular in the rubber plastic and metalworking business sectors. Since 2010 we have added a water filtration division (Medica Water Division) to our traditional areas of operation  where we are able to use our membrane and filter technology to place on the water filtration market certain products with significantly higher performance for microbiological purification. This division has taken on a key role in the evolution of the Medica group because important opportunities have been established for civil and industrial use  in addition to the initial successful experience in water filtration at hospitals; the proof of this is that in 2020 Medica was assigned the role as the leading company in an important European project  Graphil  which involves 6 other European entities (Universities and enterprises from various member states). The project is 100% funded by the EU and is key to the development of technology aimed at eliminating dangerous pollutants that are beginning to be observed in drinking water. The idea is to use graphene  which is a monolayer material of carbon molecules  to enhance the mechanical properties of polysulfone membranes that Medica has been producing for decades. On 1 November 2021  we received from Borsa Italiana S.p.A. the admission to listing of Medica's ordinary shares on the Euronext Growth Milan market  a multilateral trading system organised and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A.. Following the placement  Medica's share capital increased from 3 538 100 shares to 4 223 250 ordinary shares with no par value  of which 20.07% consists of free float. Since 2021  the Group has expanded its boundaries both through acquisitions and through the incorporation of new companies  as described in the following paragraphs. At present the Group operates through the following companies: Medica SpA (Medolla - Italy)  which is the Parent Company responsible for management  research and development  quality and manufacturing of medical products and is controlled by the holding company Pelmo87 Srl ( Ultimate Parent Company )  which was established in March 2022; Tecnoideal Srl  a sole-quotaholder company - hereinafter also referred to as Tecnoideal Srl (Mirandola - Italy) -  which is directly wholly owned by Medica SpA and operates in the electromechanical sector  developing and manufacturing assembly machines used in biomedical 5companies  as well as hospital equipment for the parent company Medica. Furthermore  the company acquired 100% of Slom Srl  a company specialising in precision machining  at the beginning of September 2022  which was then merged by incorporation at the end of December 2022; Sar-med Srl (Iglesias - Italy)  which is directly wholly owned by Medica SpA and produces membranes  catheters  filters and disposable products  both for blood and water filtration; Medica Méditerranée (Bizerte-Tunisia)  which is wholly owned directly by Medica SpA for 92.11% and indirectly through the sole-quotaholder subsidiary Tecnoideal Srl for the remaining investment of 7.89%  and produces printed parts  extruded tubes for blood lines and catheters; Tecnoideal America (Maryland - USA)  which is wholly owned (40% of which was acquired at the end of 2022) through the sole-quotaholder subsidiary Tecnoideal Srl that in turns holds an interest of 98.42% in Nefrodom (dialysis centres in Santo Domingo - Dominican Republic); Tecnoideal ASIA (Shanghai - China)  a commercial company that is wholly owned through the sole-quotaholder subsidiary Tecnoideal Srl and that started its operations in the 2020 financial year at the same time as the outbreak of the Covid - 19 pandemic; THF Srl (Marzolara - Italy)  100% of whose quotas were acquired through the sole - quotaholder subsidiary Tecnoideal Srl at the end of April 2021. The company operates in the design and manufacture of special machines for radiofrequency or thermal pulse welding of plastic films  applied to various products  including medical goods (typically blood bags or bags for liquids to be sterilised). By means of the acquisition we hope to expand Tecnoideal's technological offer by adding the sector of welding machines for medical films and consequently approach new industrial markets; Spindial SpA (Collecchio - Italy)  51% of whose shares was acquired at the end of July 2022  which is specialising in the sale and technical support concerning medical devices for hospital and home dialysis and the operation of dialysis centres; Dialpoint Srl (Traversetolo - Italy)  which is 60% owned by Spindial SpA and is specialising in the management of services in the field of outpatient hemodialysis; Medica USA Inc.  established in October 2022 and 70% owned by Medica SpA  which will be responsible for the production of blood filters and water filters following the execution of the contract with Evoqua  which was finalised on 1 April 2023 and the distribution of medical products  including those manufactured by Medica SpA; Medica Advanced Technologies Ltd  a commercial company that was established in October 2022 and is 85% owned by Medica SpA  operating in the field of medical products  mainly in the apheresis division  in the United Kingdom; Medica GmbH  a commercial company that was established at the end of February 2023 and is wholly owned by Medica SpA  operating in the field of medical products in Germany. Medica also holds 17.09% of Tecnopolo MISTE-R  a microtechnology laboratory located at the Italian National Research Council (CNR) in Bologna: the investment is considered to be key to participating in one of the Technology hub projects of the Emilia-Romagna Region  which boasts the best performance  both in terms of results of operations and as a research and development partner for members and third parties. The sole-quotaholder subsidiary Tecnoideal Srl holds an interest of 11.25% of Medica Middle East (Cairo - Egypt)  which was written down in full during the 2014 and 2015 financial years given that the company had not provided any information on its financial and economic performance such that the Directors could maintain the subscription value of the investment in the share capital. General economic performance and Management Analysis Preamble It should be noted that although they do not show significant seasonal or cyclical variations in overall annual sales  the Group's business activities are affected by differences in the distribution of revenue and cost flows during the various months of the year. 6General economic performance The global market is experiencing turbulence with a high level of uncertainty  mainly arising from the consequences of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict  which began when the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic were still in place. Furthermore  significant growth in energy prices and a substantial decline in the supply of materials and components are putting a strain on both businesses and households  and are making it difficult to support new investments for businesses. With regard to the business sector in which the Group operates  the pandemic had already led to a decline in global sales for the first time in decades in the field of extracorporeal blood treatment  and firstly hemodialysis  with mortality in critically ill patients  such as those who are already undergoing dialysis  reaching double-digit percentages in many of the world's major markets. The experience of fighting the pandemic has also accelerated the push towards technology capable of connecting patients with physicians remotely  both to avoid the risk of crowding at hospitals and to enable far faster and more effective patient monitoring and care. Telemedicine and portable equipment are certainly the main focus of development in the device industry in which Medica is active in the development of a portable device that will allow the removal of excess fluid from the patient's body and that will have potential applications in many renal  pulmonary and heart diseases. Work will continue  in the short to medium term  on the development of specific devices against the pandemic  with a predominance of respiratory support devices; however  the experience gained in the meantime has made it increasingly clear that respiratory intervention is the ""last resort""  which should be avoided by using technology of extracorporeal purification of the patients' blood (removal of cytokines) before the pulmonary compromise occurs. The Group's economic and financial performance The result for the first half of 2023 was characterised by very diversified situations in the large product portfolio of the Group. Sustained growth continued in sales of our apheresis products (lines and filters)  which was also supported by substantial growth in sales of electromedical equipment in previous years  as also confirmed during the first half of 2023  with considerable increases in niche products with high profit margins such as plasma filters  hemoconcentrators and bioregenerative medicine. Significant growth was reported in the OEM and Menfis divisions  while the Water division continued to record performance below expectations but for which we are confident of a recovery in the second half-year in view of the turnover volumes reported in July and August 2023. The Automation division has developed important advances in the performance of the ongoing contracts: however  since revenues in this division are strongly affected by the time required to complete job orders  all the work done was not reflected in the income statement at 30 June 2023; we are confident of a recovery in the second half of the year  as also confirmed by the deliveries already made in the months following 30 June 2023. In addition  work continued on gaining orders under major contracts as a further confirmation of the division's continued growth in market positioning. In general  an overall slowdown continues in the dialysis market  since the pandemic has affected  in particular  hemodialysis patients. Medica  too  has been affected by the decline in sales volumes of dialysis filters and lines. From a financial point of view  non-recurring costs at the newly-acquired companies and the increase in stock inventory in the Group are the main reasons for the cash outflows that took place during the half-year; to this must be added the now nearing completion of the investment on the new building at Medica Mediterranée  and the investments in the start-up phase of the newly-established companies 7for which we are already beginning to see positive signs  which make us confident for the future recovery of the cash the Group has invested. The Group's results of operations in the half-year ended 30 June 2023 The table below shows the reclassified consolidated income statement for the half-years ended 30 June 2023 and 2022.

This figure was mainly attributable to the contribution given by the newly-acquired and newly-established companies  which achieved total consolidated sales of Euro 10 599 thousand  and to significant growth in group turnover on a like-for-like basis (+12%  equal to Euro 2 361 thousand)  mainly concentrated in the medical business segment. The above total turnover includes adjustments amounting to Euro 236 thousand due to the best estimate of the payback impact on the first half of 2023. Specifically  a strong growth trend continued to be reported in the Acute & Aferesis business line  from Euro 5 966 thousand in the first half of 2022 to Euro 9 461 thousand in the first half of 2023 (+59%)  including sales of Euro 1 613 thousand resulting from the change in the perimeter  accompanied by significant growth in the OEM business line  from Euro 4 361 thousand to Euro 5 661 thousand (+30%)  and in the Chronic business line  from Euro 2 298 thousand to Euro 10 382 thousand (+352%)  which includes sales of Euro 8 469 thousand resulting from the change in the perimeter. With regard to other lines of business  Tecnoideal Automation achieved a turnover substantially in line with the first half of 2022 (-4%)  which was still marked by the effects of delays in procurement and consequently in the completion of some major job orders; on the other hand  the Water division achieved a turnover slightly higher than in the first half of 2022 (+8%)  with the contribution of Euro 517 thousand deriving from the change in the perimeter; however  we are confident of a significant recovery in both business segments during the second half of 2023. 8Gross Profit  equal to Euro 20 678 thousand in the first half of 2023  showing a significant increase compared to the value posted in the first half of 2022 (+39%)  reported a decline as a percentage of sales by 11% compared to the percentage achieved in the first half of 2022  mainly attributable to the contribution given by newly-acquired companies in the second half of 2022  which achieved a gross profit equal to 50% of revenues  and by the newly-established companies which achieved a gross profit equal to 22% of revenues since they were in the start-up phase. EBITDA  equal to Euro 3 716 thousand at 30 June 2023  substantially in line with the result achieved as at 30 June 2022 (-1%)  reported a decline as a percentage of sales by 7% compared to 30 June 2022  attributable for about 2% to the contribution given by the newly-established and newly-acquired companies  as well as for about 3% to an increase in costs for services on a like-for-like basis  and for about 2% to a decrease in gross profit on a like-for-like basis  mainly attributable to the companies in the Automation division. Operating Profit amounted to Euro 206 thousand  showing a decrease of Euro 1 490 thousand compared to the value posted at 30 June 2022  which was mainly attributable to the operating losses contributed by the newly-acquired and newly-established companies in the amount of Euro 1 078 thousand. On a like-for-like basis  the reduction in EBITDA described in the previous paragraph was partly offset by a reduction in amortisation and depreciation for Euro 379 thousand  mainly attributable to the completion of amortisation of certain development projects and the sale of an automation line that had been used for in-house purposes until that time  which took place at the end of 2022.
