I don't know  they could arrange all those buttons  nails and needles on their freeway to make up a phrase to spite Russia ” Zakharova wrote on her Telegram channel on Saturday.The EU has been crafting its next set of Ukraine-related sanctions for weeks. While the package is expected to concentrate on further hindering Russia’s capacity to circumvent previously imposed restrictions  a number of new large-scale measures are also on the table.For instance  several member states have reportedly called for a ban on new deals with Russian nuclear giant Rosatom  as well as halting purchases of Russian uranium  liquified natural gas (LNG) and steel. Estonia has reportedly demanded a full trade embargo on Russia to stop sanctions evasion. Other proposals include blocking IT services for Russian firms and stopping exports of laser technology.The Russian diamond industry is also in the crosshairs. The G7 has been working with Belgium  which hosts the world’s biggest diamond-trading hub in Antwerp  on traceability protocols which would be able to identify gems of Russian origin on retail markets. EUobserver cites an unnamed EU diplomat as saying the system is nearly ready and that Western states are set to impose a ban on Russian diamonds “in the very coming days.”In addition  the EU Council has reportedly stepped up work on the potential use of frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine. Belgium earlier this month announced it would send tax revenue generated from Russian money kept it its Euroclear clearing house to Kiev  and proposed that other EU countries follow its lead.According to EUObserver  the European Commission will start behind-closed-doors discussions on new sanctions with individual EU members this weekend or early next week. However  analysts note the process could take weeks to finalize  given the number of proposals and the fact that all member-states must agree on the measures to be included. Hungary  for instance  has adamantly opposed sanctioning the Russian nuclear industry due to its contracts with Rosatom for the construction of two new reactors at its Paks-2 nuclear power plant.Since the start of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine in February 2022  the EU has implemented 11 sets of sanctions on Russia  targeting various sectors of the economy  the country’s financial institutions and trade  and blacklisting several hundred Russian individuals and businesses. The Kremlin has repeatedly labeled the sanctions illegal and warned they pose a threat to the world’s economic and trade relations.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.05,0.72,0.23,negative,0.03,0.29,0.68,True,English,"['RT Business News', 'EU state', 'Russians', 'needles', 'media', 'Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'Paks-2 nuclear power plant', 'several hundred Russian individuals', 'Russian nuclear giant Rosatom', 'Russian nuclear industry', 'several member states', 'liquified natural gas', 'biggest diamond-trading hub', 'Euroclear clearing house', 'Russian industrial capacities', 'Russian diamond industry', 'frozen Russian assets', 'two new reactors', 'unnamed EU diplomat', 'individual EU members', 'full trade embargo', 'other EU countries', 'new large-scale measures', 'Russian uranium', 'Russian firms', 'Russian origin', 'Russian diamonds', 'Russian money', 'new deals', 'Western states', 'other things', 'The EU', 'EU Council', '12th round', 'electric radiators', 'central heating', 'spare parts', 'Chinese manufacturers', 'US-made elevators', 'Telegram channel', 'next set', 'IT services', 'laser technology', 'The G7', 'traceability protocols', 'retail markets', 'coming days', 'potential use', 'tax revenue', 'European Commission', 'doors discussions', 'military operation', 'various sectors', 'financial institutions', 'The Kremlin', 'trade relations', 'business section', 'new sanctions', 'Other proposals', '12th package', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'sanctions evasion', 'items', 'bloc', 'Lithuania', 'exports', 'buttons', 'nails', 'appliances', 'EUobserver', 'Friday', 'list', 'Moscow', 'needles', 'like', 'decision', 'freeway', 'phrase', 'Saturday', 'weeks', 'capacity', 'restrictions', 'number', 'table', 'instance', 'ban', 'purchases', 'LNG', 'steel', 'Estonia', 'crosshairs', 'Belgium', 'world', 'Antwerp', 'gems', 'system', 'addition', 'work', 'Kiev', 'lead', 'closed', 'analysts', 'process', 'member-states', 'Hungary', 'contracts', 'construction', 'start', 'February', '11 sets', 'economy', 'country', 'businesses', 'threat', 'economic', 'stories', 'finance']",2023-10-21,2023-10-22,rt.com
