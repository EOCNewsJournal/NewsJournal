October 22  2023. Positive results from a Phase 3 trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent® (dupilumab) for up to one year (52 weeks) in children aged 1 to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) was consistent. These results represent the first analysis of longer-term data in this age group and will be featured in a late-breaking session on October 25 at the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2023 Annual Scientific Meeting.Mirna Chehade  M.D.  MPHMount Sinai Center for Eosinophilic Disorders  Icahn School of Medicine  Mount Sinai“Eosinophilic esophagitis  or EoE  is a chronic and debilitating condition that can impact children in their most vulnerable years of life  causing persistent difficulties with eating  abdominal pain  and/or failure to thrive. Dupilumab is the first and only therapeutic approved for adults and adolescents 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg with EoE. Some children with EoE may have sub-optimal response to currently unapproved standard of care therapies  underscoring the need for treatments targeting key pathways driving inflammation in EoE. Data from this Phase 3 trial support the potential of dupilumab to treat EoE in children  with sustained efficacy and safety  which is particularly critical for these children.”The late-breaking data to be presented at ACG feature results from children enrolled in the extended active treatment period (Part B) of a Phase 3 trial  following 16 weeks of Dupixent treatment or placebo in Part A of the trial. All children in Part B were treated with higher or lower dose Dupixent for an additional 36 weeks  providing up to 52 weeks of data.In Part B  there were 37 patients who continued on higher dose Dupixent and 18 who switched from placebo to higher dose Dupixent. At one year  outcomes of secondary endpoints (as evaluated with descriptive statistics based on all observed data) among children who continued on higher dose Dupixent and for those switching from placebo to higher dose Dupixent was  respectively  as follows:63% and 53% achieved histological disease remission0.97 and 0.89 reduction from baseline in disease severity and 0.89 and 0.86 reduction from baseline in extent  respectively  as measured at the microscopic level in biopsy specimens4.8 and 3.6-point reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline0.30 and 0.47-point numerical improvement in caregiver reported pediatric signs and symptoms  as measured by PESQ-C5.96 and 5.48 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baselineSafety results in Part B of the trial were generally consistent with Part A and the known safety profile of Dupixent in its FDA-approved EoE indication for adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. AEs reported in ≥20% of patients who remained on higher dose Dupixent in Part B and those who switched from placebo to higher dose Dupixent in Part B  respectively  included: COVID-19 (n=11/37  n=5/18; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study treatment discontinuation)  injection site reaction (n=5/37  n=5/18)  cough (n=3/37  n=4/18) and headache (n=3/37  n=4/18).In September  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application for higher dose Dupixent to treat children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  with a target action date of January 31  2024. This potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority in this setting.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic  progressive disease driven in part by type 2 inflammation that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. In children  common symptoms of EoE include heartburn  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  food refusal and failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth and development and can cause food-related fear and anxiety  which can persist through adulthood. Dietary adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of food groups  are the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease  such as proton pump inhibitors and swallowed topical corticosteroids. Continuous treatment of EoE may be needed to reduce the risk of complications and disease recurrence.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological  endoscopic and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Part A  a 16-week  double-blind treatment period  enrolled 102 patients and evaluated Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on weight (ranging from ≥5 kg to <60 kg). The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight. The primary endpoint was histological disease remission  which was defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils (eos)/high power field (hpf).Part B was a 36-week extended active treatment period in which eligible children from Part A in the Dupixent group maintained their dose level; those in the placebo group were randomized to either a higher or lower dose. In Part B  secondary endpoints included:Histological disease remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils [eos]/high power field [hpf])Histopathologic measures of the severity and extent of tissue scarring in the esophagus (EoE-HSS grade and stage scores  which measure changes in eight cellular and tissue features on 0-3 scales  respectively)Abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)Changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g.  stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C])Change from baseline in body weight for age percentileThe trial is ongoing with a 108-week open-label extension period (Part C) to evaluate longer-term outcomes.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 750 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops  and commercializes life- transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

Oct. 22  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that positive results from a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) showed consistent efficacy and safety for up to one year (52 weeks) in children aged 1 to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). These results represent the first analysis of longer-term data in this age group and will be featured in a late-breaking session on October 25 at the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2023 Annual Scientific Meeting.“Eosinophilic esophagitis  or EoE  is a chronic and debilitating condition that can impact children in their most vulnerable years of life  causing persistent difficulties with eating  abdominal pain  and/or failure to thrive ” said Mirna Chehade  M.D.  MPH  Mount Sinai Center for Eosinophilic Disorders  Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  New York and principal investigator of the trial. “Dupilumab is the first and only therapeutic approved for adults and certain adolescents with EoE.

Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 750 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz™ (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid.

I would like to deeply thank Voltalia's teams who developed  built and financed this project” declares Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.The Canudos 1-2 project  initially announced as a 90-megawatt wind farm  and expanded at 99.4 megawatts  began to produce its first megawatt hours. The wind farm is backed by a 20-year power sale agreement with CEMIG  a leading Brazilian utility.The project is composed of 28 wind turbines  a collector substation  a sectioning substation  and a 500Kv transmission line. The entire project has been developed by  and is owned by Voltalia. Several key factors have contributed to the success of this project  including a robust wind regime  ownership of grid connections  and scalability.Moreover  in alignment with Voltalia's commitment to local communities  the project established essential local connection facilities  allowed hiring local teams and contractors  and produces competitively priced energy. Since 2021  Voltalia has collaborated with experts to implement an ambitious program for the conservation of the Lear's Macaw  an endemic specie  and the restoration of its primary local food source  the licuri palm.Despite the Canudos 1-2 commissioning slowdown at the grid operator request  Voltalia has been committed to launch operations as quickly as possible. The beginning of Canudos 1-2's operations phase demonstrates the grid capacity to absorb the wind plant output  shortly after the SSM 3-6 solar plant  which also demonstrated the same capacity1.Next on the agenda: Q3 2023 Turnover  on October 25th 2023 (after market close),neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,positive,0.67,0.32,0.01,True,English,"['The Canudos Wind Farm', 'Start', 'Production', 'Brazil', '99-megawatt Canudos 1-2 wind farm', 'SSM 3-6 solar plant', 'essential local connection facilities', 'primary local food source', 'Canudos 1-2 commissioning slowdown', '20-year power sale agreement', 'The Canudos 1-2 project', 'wind plant output', '90-megawatt wind farm', 'robust wind regime', 'Sébastien Clerc', 'first megawatt hours', '500Kv transmission line', 'Several key factors', 'leading Brazilian utility', 'competitively priced energy', 'grid operator request', '28 wind turbines', 'full commissioning', 'local communities', 'renewable energy', 'local teams', 'Brazilian project', 'Euronext Paris', 'ISIN code', 'international player', 'collector substation', 'sectioning substation', 'grid connections', 'ambitious program', 'endemic specie', 'licuri palm', 'grid capacity', 'same capacity', 'Q3 2023 Turnover', 'entire project', 'operations phase', 'Voltalia', 'State', 'Bahia', '60 megawatts', '99 megawatts', 'CEO', '99.4 megawatts', 'CEMIG', 'success', 'ownership', 'scalability', 'alignment', 'commitment', 'contractors', 'experts', 'conservation', 'Lear', 'Macaw', 'restoration', 'beginning', 'agenda', 'October', 'market']",2023-10-23,2023-10-23,menafn.com

31687,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.cityam.com/stock-exchanges-need-robust-defences-from-repeated-tech-errors/,Stock exchanges need robust defences from repeated tech errors,Did anyone else get a sense of déjà vu when the sudden outage at the London Stock Exchange (LSE) last week left the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 unavailable for trading? From Euronext in 2021 and Nasdaq’s Nordic markets in 2022 ,Stock exchanges need robust defences from repeated tech errorsThe London Stock Exchange faced questions last week after technical errors meant the FTSE100 and FTSE250 were unable to tradeDid anyone else get a sense of déjà vu at the sudden outage on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) last week? From Euronext in 2021 and Nasdaq’s Nordic markets in 2022  to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) cancelling trades after “technical glitches” with its opening auction triggered wild price swings earlier this year  all kinds of “outages” have occurred in recent times. In every single case  investors have only been able to respond based on what the exchanges have been willing to communicate.Last week’s incident was no different. While the incident is still under investigation  it is clear as night follows day that glitches are now a recurring nightmare – creating challenges for regulators  members and  ultimately  trust in the market. Whenever it happens  there is the inevitable knee-jerk reaction from global regulators to better monitor future situations to the extent that it affects trade reporting obligations and issues of wider market integrity.This is often followed by the subsequent “reviewing existing processes” period to understand what went wrong  before then enforcing measures to reduce the risk of it happening in the future. But there are already rules in place  which the exchange community is willing to abide by  so it is hard to see what the subsequent “review” processes will achieve. No matter how many reviews take place  they are not preventing technical glitches from occurring.After all these glitches should  in theory  be taking place far less frequently as a result of industry wide technological advancements. Not to mention the copious amounts of capital invested every year on to minimise the impact of outages.The answer may be that humans cannot keep up with the rate at which technology is advancing. Human error is a common factor in technology failures. Mistakes made by staff during routine maintenance  updates  or configuration changes can inadvertently cause outages. Stock exchanges also operate highly complex technology systems that handle massive volumes of trades. While many exchanges have redundancy and failover systems in place  these mechanisms can themselves fail or not function as expected  leading to outages. As we saw in the case of the NYSE at the start of this year  it is not as easy as someone just flipping a switch to get things up and operational again.Our best hope may be that computers eventually will become smart enough to maintain themselves. With the current ageing infrastructure that exchanges rely on  this is hard to envisage. In some cases  venues are underpinned by decades old technology infrastructure which is far more susceptible to failures – particularly as more and more trading firms seek to execute a larger number of equity transactions in milliseconds in order to make a profit.Upgrading and maintaining legacy infrastructure is a costly process. But on top of the already high annual commitment to technology spend  this has to be the answer to being better prepared. Technology will break from time to time but there is no excuse for not upgrading existing infrastructure in. Backups  automated alerts  and other functionalities are prevalent across other sectors to keep system administrators apprised.It beggars’ belief that this is not the case for an industry where  due to frequent spikes in trading volumes often triggered by unexpected events  the risk of an exchange outage is far higher. When these events do happen  they don’t just have consequences for capital markets  the broader economy is often affected as many of the shares that are unable to be traded are sitting in someone’s pension pot.All of this underscores the need for continuous improvement in the underlying exchange infrastructure and risk management. After all  the major exchanges have an equity market capitalisation upwards of $20tn  so it is high time they flex their financial muscle to ensure their technology infrastructure is fit for the 2020s  as opposed to the 1990s.,negative,0.13,0.33,0.54,mixed,0.05,0.26,0.69,True,English,"['repeated tech errors', 'Stock exchanges', 'robust defences', 'industry wide technological advancements', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'The London Stock Exchange', 'decades old technology infrastructure', 'déjà vu', 'wild price swings', 'inevitable knee-jerk reaction', 'trade reporting obligations', 'subsequent “review” processes', 'current ageing infrastructure', 'underlying exchange infrastructure', 'existing processes” period', 'high annual commitment', 'wider market integrity', 'equity market capitalisation', 'complex technology systems', 'existing infrastructure', 'exchange community', 'exchange outage', 'Stock exchanges', 'legacy infrastructure', 'failover systems', 'equity transactions', 'robust defences', 'sudden outage', 'Nordic markets', 'opening auction', 'recent times', 'recurring nightmare', 'many reviews', 'copious amounts', 'Human error', 'common factor', 'routine maintenance', 'configuration changes', 'massive volumes', 'best hope', 'trading firms', 'larger number', 'costly process', 'automated alerts', 'other functionalities', 'other sectors', 'system administrators', 'frequent spikes', 'trading volumes', 'broader economy', 'pension pot', 'continuous improvement', 'financial muscle', 'high time', 'many exchanges', 'major exchanges', 'technical errors', 'technical glitches', 'global regulators', 'future situations', 'technology failures', 'unexpected events', 'capital markets', 'single case', 'risk management', 'repeated', 'questions', 'FTSE100', 'FTSE250', 'sense', 'LSE', 'Euronext', 'Nasdaq', 'NYSE', 'trades', 'kinds', 'outages', 'investors', 'incident', 'investigation', 'day', 'challenges', 'members', 'trust', 'extent', 'issues', 'measures', 'rules', 'place', 'theory', 'result', 'impact', 'answer', 'humans', 'rate', 'Mistakes', 'staff', 'updates', 'redundancy', 'mechanisms', 'start', 'year', 'someone', 'switch', 'things', 'computers', 'cases', 'venues', 'milliseconds', 'order', 'profit', 'top', 'excuse', 'Backups', 'consequences', 'shares', 'need', '2020s', '1990s']",2023-10-23,2023-10-23,cityam.com
