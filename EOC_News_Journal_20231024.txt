Notably  LINK has surged about 31% in the past two or so days  stunning investors and igniting optimism for a potential uptrend. On Sunday  the price managed to push all the way to $9.71 after breaking out from a descending channel the previous day.That said  on-chain analytics firm Santiment offered clues behind this growth  highlighting a surge in whale transactions  unique interacting addresses  and trading volume  pushing Chainlink to a three-month high.“Chainlink is on a tear this weekend  with the network seeing 3-month highs in whale transactions  unique interacting addresses  and trading volume. Altcoins have been benefiting from $BTC redistribution  but $LINK has been a particular standout.” Santiment tweeted on Sunday.AdvertisementAccording to the firm’s data  on Saturday  Chainlink witnessed more than 226 large transactions  each exceeding $100 000  leading to a significant spike in the cryptocurrency’s trading volume  approaching nearly $1 billion.The cryptocurrency’s remarkable surge coincides with notable wallet activity  especially those holding 100K-1M LINK. On Monday  Santiment reported that these large wallets have aggressively accumulated $38.5 million worth of LINK  indicating institutional investors’ significance in this rally.Chainlink’s fundamentals have also strengthened significantly  with nine new integrations of five Chainlink services on multiple blockchain networks  including Optimism  BNB Chain  Polygon  Avalanche  Arbitrum  Base  and Ethereum. These integrations span across DeFi and Web3 platforms  illustrating Chainlink’s growing adoption.That said  it is worth noting that despite discussions of real-world asset tokenization  Chainlink itself doesn’t tokenize real-world assets but provides decentralized data and price oracles. The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) positions the platform to connect various private and public blockchains within the emerging asset class.Moreover  Chainlink offers services like Proof of Reserve and data feeds that supply essential data to enrich tokenized assets as they traverse different blockchains. The collaborations with SWIFT  Euroclear  DTCC  and Australian bank ANZ on cross-chain capabilities involving real-world assets underscores Chainlink’s increasing role in bridging traditional and decentralized financial ecosystems.That said  Chainlink’s recent surge and expanding adoption and utility in the cryptocurrency space are clear indicators of its potential to reshape the future of decentralized finance.At press time  LINK was trading at $10.08  reflecting an impressive 13% surge over the past 24 hours.,neutral,0.03,0.87,0.1,mixed,0.35,0.31,0.34,True,English,"['Skyrocketing Whale Transactions', 'Chainlink', 'The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol', 'unique interacting addresses', 'notable wallet activity', 'multiple blockchain networks', 'emerging asset class', 'Australian bank ANZ', 'real-world asset tokenization', 'decentralized financial ecosystems', 'institutional investors’ significance', 'nine new integrations', 'chain analytics firm', 'five Chainlink services', 'cross-chain capabilities', 'BNB Chain', 'real-world assets', 'decentralized finance', 'decentralized data', 'remarkable uptick', 'past week', 'positive developments', 'Other cryptocurrencies', 'significant gains', 'favourable outcome', 'SEC battle', 'substantial attention', 'past two', 'descending channel', 'whale transactions', 'trading volume', '3-month highs', '$BTC redistribution', 'particular standout', '226 large transactions', 'significant spike', 'large wallets', '$38.5 million worth', 'Web3 platforms', 'growing adoption', 'various private', 'public blockchains', 'tokenized assets', 'different blockchains', 'increasing role', 'expanding adoption', 'clear indicators', 'press time', 'past 24 hours', 'remarkable surge', 'data feeds', 'essential data', 'recent surge', 'impressive 13% surge', 'cryptocurrency market', 'potential uptrend', 'price oracles', 'cryptocurrency space', '100K-1M LINK', '$LINK', 'Advertisement', 'Bitcoin', 'Friday', 'slew', 'XRP', 'days', 'optimism', 'Sunday', 'way', 'Santiment', 'clues', 'growth', 'tear', 'Altcoins', 'Saturday', 'Monday', 'rally', 'fundamentals', 'Polygon', 'Avalanche', 'Arbitrum', 'Base', 'Ethereum', 'DeFi', 'discussions', 'CCIP', 'Proof', 'Reserve', 'collaborations', 'SWIFT', 'Euroclear', 'DTCC', 'traditional', 'utility', 'future']",2023-10-23,2023-10-24,zycrypto.com

This is despite a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in July 2023. Orphan designation has a strong influence on the reimbursement mechanisms and access for patients to medicines in some countries in the E.U. In order to maintain Bylvay’s orphan designation in the approved treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC)  Ipsen is planning to resubmit to the EMA under a new brand name for the treatment of ALGS by the end of 2023.“We stand by our commitment to bring as soon as possible a much-needed treatment option to patients with Alagille syndrome and their families in the E.U.  as we believe in the potential benefit this medicine could provide to the Alagille community ” said Christelle Huguet  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. “We are disappointed with the opinion of the COMP as the Orphan Medicinal Product Regulation aims to stimulate research and development for rare diseases. The current approach to assessing “significant benefit” threatens to undermine the aims of this Regulation.”The CHMP and COMP reviewed data from the Bylvay clinical-trial program  including ASSERT  a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled Phase III  multi-center efficacy and safety trial conducted in ALGS. Positive data from ASSERT  presented at the 2023 European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition congress  demonstrated that Bylvay provided highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in pruritus  starting as early as one week after initiation of treatment and were sustained over the 24 weeks of the trial. More than 90% of patients were pruritus responders (≥ one point change at any time during 24 weeks). The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar to placebo. No patients discontinued the trial  and 96% of patients rolled over into the open-label extension trial.Bylvay received regulatory approval in 2021 in the U.S. as the first medicine-treatment option for patients aged three months or older living with cholestatic pruritus due to PFIC  and for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older in the E.U. In June 2023  Bylvay also received regulatory approval in the U.S. for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients aged 12 months or older with ALGS.Bylvay received orphan exclusivity for the treatment of PFIC in the U.S. and the E.U. Bylvay also received orphan designation for the treatment of ALGS in the U.S. and the E.U. In a potential future third indication under development  the rare pediatric cholestatic liver disease biliary atresia  Bylvay received orphan designation in the U.S. and the E.U. and is in late-stage development with the Phase III BOLD trial.ENDSASSERT Phase III clinical trial dataASSERT was a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 120 µg /kg/day Bylvay for 24 weeks in relieving pruritus in patients with ALGS with 32 sites across North America  Europe  the Middle East  and Asia Pacific. The trial enrolled patients aged 0 to 17 years with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of ALGS. In the primary analysis  the trial met the primary endpoint showing highly statistically significant improvement in pruritus as measured by the PRUCISION Observer-Reported Outcome scratching score (0-4 point scale)  from baseline at month 6 (weeks 21 to 24)  compared to the placebo arm (p=0.002). More than 90% of patients were pruritus responders (≥ 1 point change at any time during the 24 weeks). The trial also met the key secondary endpoint  showing a highly statistically significant reduction in serum bile acid concentration from baseline to the average of weeks 20 and 24 (compared to the placebo arm p=0.001). Statistically significant improvements in multiple sleep parameters were observed as early as week 1-4 compared to patients on placebo with continued improvement through week 24. In the trial  there were no patient discontinuations and 96% of patients rolled over into the open-label extension trial. Bylvay had an overall adverse event incidence similar to placebo and a low incidence of drug-related diarrhea (11.4% vs. 5.9% placebo).About Bylvay® (odevixibat)Bylvay is a potent  once-daily  non-systemic ileal bile acid transport inhibitor that acts locally in the small intestine and has minimal systemic exposure. It is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age or older with PFIC  where it has orphan exclusivity. Bylvay was first launched as a treatment option for patients with PFIC in the U.S. in 2021  where it is supported by a program designed to assist with access to treatment and patient support. Bylvay also received regulatory approval in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older. It has launched in over nine countries and has secured public reimbursement across several major markets including Germany  Italy  the U.K.  France and Belgium. In June 2023  Bylvay was also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients from 12 months of age with Alagille syndrome.View full U.S. prescribing information here: ipsen.comView full E.U. prescribing information here: Bylvay  INN-odevixibat (europa.eu)Important Safety InformationPFIC: The most common adverse reactions are diarrhea  liver test abnormalities  vomiting  abdominal pain  and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency.ALGS: The most common adverse reactions are diarrhea  abdominal pain  hematoma  and weight decrease.Liver Test Abnormalities: Patients should obtain baseline liver tests and monitor during treatment. Dose reduction or treatment interruption may be required if abnormalities occur. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities  consider treatment discontinuation.Diarrhea: Treat dehydration. Treatment interruption or discontinuation may be required for persistent diarrhea.Fat-Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency: Patient should obtain baseline vitamin levels and monitor during treatment. Supplement if deficiency is observed. If FSV deficiency persists or worsens despite FSV supplementation  discontinue treatment.About Alagille syndrome (ALGS)ALGS is an inherited rare  genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems in the body including the liver  heart  skeleton  eyes and kidneys. Liver damage may result from having fewer than normal  narrowed or malformed bile ducts  which leads to toxic bile acid build-up  which in turn can cause scarring and progressive liver disease. Approximately 95% of patients with the condition present with chronic cholestasis  usually within the first few months of life and as many as 88% also present with severe  intractable pruritus. The estimated global incidence of ALGS is 3 in 100 000 live births. Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 1 300 patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment.About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

At real exchange rates  our activity grew by +3.3% compared to the same period of 2022. All geographies contributed to this momentum: Europe's revenue increased by +6.4% at constant rates  driven by the Benelux countries (+14.9% at constant rates) and France (+4.6% at constant rates) where our petfood range recorded double digits growth  as well as the countries of Southern Europe  particularly Spain (+23.9% at constant rates) where ruminant vaccines sales grew strongly. In Asia Pacific  the evolution at constant rates of +9.2% is mainly explained by the success of our farm animal ranges  both in Australia and India (respectively +19.6% and +10.8% at constant rates). Latin America (+11.2% at constant rates) benefits from the contribution of Mexico (+11.4% at constant rates) and the remarkable performance of Colombia (+39.5% at constant rates) while Chile returned to growth (+13.1% at constant rates) mainly thanks to the sales of a single parasiticide product for which demand has recently been growing considerably. Finally  the North America zone grew by +3.8% at constant rates  notably thanks to the companion animals segment and the dermatology range.Cumulative consolidated revenue at the end of SeptemberAt the end of September  our turnover amounted to €925.3 million compared to €921.2 million  an overall increase at real rates of +0.4% compared to the same period of 2022 and +2.8% at constant exchange rates. In a context of market growth normalization observed for several quarters now and despite two adverse intrinsic one-off effects - temporary limitation of our production capacities for companion animal vaccines and cyber attack which occurred on June 19 - excluding unfavorable exchange rates impact  our growth of +2.8% demonstrates the resilience of our business model driven by the relentless engagement of our teams. Europe (+3.9% at constant rates) and Asia Pacific (+4.5% at constant rates) remain the main geographies driving this organic growth dynamic. In Europe  the main contributors to this performance are firstly France (+7.4% at constant rates)  then the countries of the Northern Europe zone (+2.5% at constant rates) led by Germany  as well as the countries of the Southern Europe zone where more than half of the growth is achieved in Spain. In Asia Pacific  the good momentum of our farm animal range continues to fuel our growth in Australia (+11.7% at constant rates) and India (+4.2% at constant rates). Marked by a base effect coupled with distributors’ destocking and sustained sales of our products towards veterinary clinics  our activity in the United States (-0.4% at constant rates) is relatively stable. Notwithstanding the very good growth dynamics observed in Mexico  Colombia and Brazil  the Latin America zone (-1.1% at constant rates) was penalized by the sharp decline of the aquaculture segment observed in Chile during the first half of the year.In terms of species  the companion animal segment grew overall by +1.1% at constant rates (-0.2% at actual rates)  strongly impacted by a drop in companion animal vaccine sales offset by good momentum of petfood and specialty ranges. The farm animal segment posted a +5.0% growth at constant exchange rates (+1.0% at actual rates)  driven by both the ruminant (+8.5% at constant rates) and pigs sectors (+7.0% at constant rates) which are performing well.OutlookGiven the significant rebound in sales observed in the third quarter  a margin on production costs higher than expected as well as the confirmed delay in certain expenses  particularly R&D  revenue growth at constant rates and scope is now expected in a range between 2% and 4% while the ratio of “current operating income before amortization of assets resulting from acquisitions” to “revenue” should now consolidate in a range between 13.5 % and 14.5% at constant exchange rates. Finally  at constant exchange rates  our net cash position at the end of December 2023 should improve by €30m compared to the same position at the end of December 2022  excluding acquisitions and impact of the share buyback plan.CONSOLIDATED FIGURESNon-audited figuresin millions of euros 2023 2022 Growth Growthat constant exchange rates 1 Growthat constant exchange rates and scope 1 First quarter revenue 314.8 318.1 -1.0% -1.3% -1.3% Second-quarter revenue 295.7 298.3 -0.9% +2.1% +2.1% Third-quarter revenue 314.8 304.9 +3.3% +7.8% +7.8% Revenue at the end of September 925.3 921.2 +0.4% +2.8% +2.8%A lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

The H1 2023 financial statements were subject to a limited review by the statutory auditor. The half-yearly report will be made available on the company’s website.Following the application since H2 2022 of a new accounting policy for recognizing revenue based on progress  the breakdown of revenue for 2022 has been modified and that for H1 2022 adjusted to €2.1m. FY 2022 annual revenue remains unchanged.The comparison is thus as follows:(in thousands of euros) H1 2023 H1 2022 Revenue 1 517 2 144 Other operating income 1 402 29 Total business activity 3 322 2 173 Operating income (1 054) (181) Net income (Group share) (853) NDUnaudited dataCharwood Energy posted revenue of €1.5m in H1 2023  compared with €2.1m in H1 2022.Revenue was achieved entirely on behalf of third parties  through the design  construction and installation of bespoke energy solutions using biomass for external customers including farms  manufacturers and local authorities.Other income recorded by Charwood Energy in H1 2023 consisted of:Stored production of €1.2m  including €1.1m for a pyro-gasification unit intended for future sale  pending the signing of the contract;Capitalized production of €581k  of which €354k for a 70KW pyro-gasification unit that will be used to generate energy on an own-account basis and €208k for development costs incurred over the six-month period.H1 2023 revenue does not reflect Charwood Energy’s extremely strong sales momentum or the substantial volume of business activity over the period.Sustained sales momentumIn third-party business  further operational progress was achieved in H1 2023:Launch of the construction of a hygienization unit  coupled with a biomass boiler unit for a site producing biomass via anaerobic digestion operated by a group formed by a municipality and 15 farms in Normandy [1] ;[1] Construction of a biomass boiler unit coupled with a heat network for a large poultry farm in the Sarthe department 1 ;Construction  following the signing of the order in April 1   of a biomass boiler unit for a large poultry farmer in the Mayenne department;Other structuring projects are in advanced discussions and should be announced soon.In own-account business  the Group moved ahead with its initial business plan  with five power plants under development at June 30  2023.Once commissioned and fully operational  these plants will generate ARR[2] of nearly €7.7m from the sale of energy.H1 2023 results include continued structural investments to support future growthExpenses in H1 2023 were higher than in H1 2022. This reflects the ongoing structuring of the teams to support the Group’s future growth  as well as the ramp-up of projects to be delivered in the second half of the year and beyond.At June 30  2023  the average workforce totaled 28  compared with 18 at June 30  2022.Owing to the increase in investments  Charwood Energy posted an operating loss of €1.1m in H1 2023.After financial income and tax expense  Charwood Energy recorded a net loss of -€0.9m.A solid financial structureAt June 30  2023  Charwood Energy’s financial structure consisted of €9.3m in equity  €2.2m in gross financial debt  and €4.3m in cash flow.Acquisition of a stake in LG Concept  a major regional player in the supply of renewable biomassIn a press release dated October 4  2023  Charwood Energy announced that it had acquired a 40% stake in LG Concept  a major regional player in renewable biomass supply for boiler rooms in Brittany and the neighboring regions. LG Concept’s business activity will be consolidated according to the proportional integration method in Charwood Energy’s accounts for five months in 2023.The investment is consistent with Charwood Energy’s objective to control its renewable biomass supply with a regional player boasting strong roots in the sector and responding to customers' energy challenges.OutlookRegarding third-party business  the Group has a secure order book[3] totaling €3.7m  deliverable and billable in 2023 and 2024.

Oct. 23  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the “Company”)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced updated data from two presentations at the 2023 Annual Congress of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO).POSTER #1631P: Phase 1 Study of Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)-guided NBTXR3 delivery activated by Radiotherapy (RT) for Locally Advanced or Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC or BRPC)The 5-year overall survival rate for patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) remains less than 5%. Normally  these patients receive the combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation if no metastatic progression has occurred. Innovative new treatments that might extend survival and avoid additional harmful side effects are an urgent unmet need for this patient population.With safety  feasibility  and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) previously determined and reported  this presentation from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) explored additional preliminary signals of efficacy from the ongoing Phase 1 study evaluating RT-activated NBTXR3 after cytotoxic chemotherapy for patients with LAPC to potentially inform next steps in clinical trial development.An MD Anderson historical review of 243 patients treated with LAPC at the same center showed:Normalization of the biomarker CA19-9  a surrogate indicator for longer survival  in approximately 17% of patients treated with the standard of care who had elevated CA19-9 levels at diagnosis (n=183)Median Overall Survival (mOS) of 19.2 months in 144 patients who received cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by RT with or without concurrent or maintenance chemotherapy (80% received RT with concurrent chemotherapy)Comparatively  preliminary data from 17 patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by RT-activated NBTXR3 in the Phase 1 LAPC study show:Normalization of CA19-9 in 42% of patients who had elevated levels at diagnosis (n=12)An mOS of 23 months from diagnosisThe investigator concluded that these results suggest promising anti-tumor efficacy for NBTXR3 in LAPC.“As we continue to execute our global development program for NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations in parallel with our collaborators  we view the consistently favorable safety profile for our localized therapeutic innovation as critical to the product candidate’s potential ” said Louis Kayitalire  MD  chief medical officer at Nanobiotix. “Patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer are faced with poor survival and quality of life outcomes  and these preliminary efficacy and favorable safety data are an exciting indicator that NBTXR3 may present a promising new option.”ABSTRACT #5222: Antitumor Activity of the Radioenhancer NBTXR3 on Injected Lesions to Estimate Overall Survival: Exploratory Analyses from a Phase 1 in Cisplatin-Ineligible Locally Advanced HNSCC PatientsThe previously reported final efficacy analysis of Study 102—a Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion study evaluating RT-activated NBTXR3 for elderly  frail patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer found that therapy was feasible  well tolerated with a favorable safety profile  and showed both prolonged Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and OS in a population characterized by negative prognostic factors.This new exploratory analysis showed an mOS of 42.8 months in the 36 evaluable patients who had complete or partial response to NBTXR3 in the injected lesion (81.8%)  compared to an mOS of 18.1 months observed in All Patients Treated (n=56)  and 23.1 months in the total evaluable population (n=44)  respectively. In addition  a positive correlation between Objective Response to RT-activated NBTXR3 in the injected lesion  Local Progression-Free Survival  and the extension of Overall Survival was observed.These data suggest that the high rate of Objective Response to RT-activated NBTXR3 could potentially extend PFS and OS for elderly  frail patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.“With the Phase 1 study now complete  our focus is to ensure that we learn everything we can to anticipate the potential results of NANORAY-312. Of particular note were the data we observed regarding the positive correlation between Objective Response to NBTXR3 in the injected lesion  Local Progression Free Survival  Duration of Response in the injected lesion  and extension of Overall Survival ” said Professor Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  principal investigator for Study 102 and co-principal investigator for NANORAY-312. “Given the directional signals we observed in the exploratory analysis  the additional option to inject involved lymph nodes included in the design of the Phase 3  and the expected resemblance of the Phase 3 population to the evaluable population in the Phase 1  we see a strong opportunity to improve treatment outcomes for elderly patients with head and neck cancer in our ongoing registrational study.”About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2021  the Company announced an agreement with LianBio to expand development of NBTXR3 into Greater China and other Asian Markets  and in July 2023 Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

At real exchange rates  our activity grew by +3.3% compared to the same period of 2022. All geographies contributed to this momentum: Europe's revenue increased by +6.4% at constant rates  driven by the Benelux countries (+14.9% at constant rates) and France (+4.6% at constant rates) where our petfood range recorded double digits growth  as well as the countries of Southern Europe  particularly Spain (+23.9% at constant rates) where ruminant vaccines sales grew strongly. In Asia Pacific  the evolution at constant rates of +9.2% is mainly explained by the success of our farm animal ranges  both in Australia and India (respectively +19.6% and +10.8% at constant rates). Latin America (+11.2% at constant rates) benefits from the contribution of Mexico (+11.4% at constant rates) and the remarkable performance of Colombia (+39.5% at constant rates) while Chile returned to growth (+13.1% at constant rates) mainly thanks to the sales of a single parasiticide product for which demand has recently been growing considerably. Finally  the North America zone grew by +3.8% at constant rates  notably thanks to the companion animals segment and the dermatology range.Cumulative consolidated revenue at the end of SeptemberAt the end of September  our turnover amounted to €925.3 million compared to €921.2 million  an overall increase at real rates of +0.4% compared to the same period of 2022 and +2.8% at constant exchange rates. In a context of market growth normalization observed for several quarters now and despite two adverse intrinsic one-off effects - temporary limitation of our production capacities for companion animal vaccines and cyber attack which occurred on June 19 - excluding unfavorable exchange rates impact  our growth of +2.8% demonstrates the resilience of our business model driven by the relentless engagement of our teams. Europe (+3.9% at constant rates) and Asia Pacific (+4.5% at constant rates) remain the main geographies driving this organic growth dynamic. In Europe  the main contributors to this performance are firstly France (+7.4% at constant rates)  then the countries of the Northern Europe zone (+2.5% at constant rates) led by Germany  as well as the countries of the Southern Europe zone where more than half of the growth is achieved in Spain. In Asia Pacific  the good momentum of our farm animal range continues to fuel our growth in Australia (+11.7% at constant rates) and India (+4.2% at constant rates). Marked by a base effect coupled with distributors’ destocking and sustained sales of our products towards veterinary clinics  our activity in the United States (-0.4% at constant rates) is relatively stable. Notwithstanding the very good growth dynamics observed in Mexico  Colombia and Brazil  the Latin America zone (-1.1% at constant rates) was penalized by the sharp decline of the aquaculture segment observed in Chile during the first half of the year.In terms of species  the companion animal segment grew overall by +1.1% at constant rates (-0.2% at actual rates)  strongly impacted by a drop in companion animal vaccine sales offset by good momentum of petfood and specialty ranges. The farm animal segment posted a +5.0% growth at constant exchange rates (+1.0% at actual rates)  driven by both the ruminant (+8.5% at constant rates) and pigs sectors (+7.0% at constant rates) which are performing well.OutlookGiven the significant rebound in sales observed in the third quarter  a margin on production costs higher than expected as well as the confirmed delay in certain expenses  particularly R&D  revenue growth at constant rates and scope is now expected in a range between 2% and 4% while the ratio of “current operating income before amortization of assets resulting from acquisitions” to “revenue” should now consolidate in a range between 13.5 % and 14.5% at constant exchange rates. Finally  at constant exchange rates  our net cash position at the end of December 2023 should improve by €30m compared to the same position at the end of December 2022  excluding acquisitions and impact of the share buyback plan.CONSOLIDATED FIGURESNon-audited figuresin millions of euros 2023 2022 Growth Growthat constant exchange rates 1 Growthat constant exchange rates and scope 1 First quarter revenue 314.8 318.1 -1.0% -1.3% -1.3% Second-quarter revenue 295.7 298.3 -0.9% +2.1% +2.1% Third-quarter revenue 314.8 304.9 +3.3% +7.8% +7.8% Revenue at the end of September 925.3 921.2 +0.4% +2.8% +2.8%A lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

Reports Positive Outcome from Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board with Unanimous Decision for VIVA-MIND U.S. Study of Varoglutamstat in Alzheimer’s Disease to Proceed at Highest Investigated DoseInterim analysis completed  with 600mg twice daily dosing unanimously selected by independent DSMB as final dose for remainder of Phases 2a and 2b of VIVA-MIND study in U.S.Decision follows 2022 DSMB determination for VIVIAD Phase 2 EU study to proceed at 600mg twice daily based on safety and tolerability of 90 patients followed for at least 24 weeks post randomizationHalle (Saale) / Munich  Germany  October 23  2023 – Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced that the study’s independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) unanimously recommend that the VIVA-MIND study of varoglutamstat should proceed with a dose of 600mg twice daily (BID) through the remainder of Phases 2a and 2b.VIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) is an ongoing Phase 2 study for varoglutamstat conducted in the U.S.  complementary to Vivoryon’s VIVIAD Phase 2b study being conducted in Europe. VIVA-MIND seeks to enroll 180 patients with early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) into the Phase 2a adaptive dose finding portion and enroll a further 234 patients in the Phase 2b portion of the study. In July 2023  the Company announced that the first cohort of the study was fully randomized as planned and is now recruiting participants into the second cohort with 21 sites open across the U.S. The primary endpoint of the study is evaluating Clinical Dementia Rating scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) over a 72-week treatment period.“We are thrilled to report this new important and validating element of our rigorously and meticulously designed program for varoglutamstat. While all prior DSMB decisions have been favorable  we believe that this marks a critical next step on our path towards consciously determining the optimal dosing regimen for varoglutamstat. From the initial stages of determining the maximum tolerated dose in our completed SAPHIR Phase 2a study  through the extremely encouraging interim analyses of tolerability in our European VIVIAD Phase 2b study  we keep making key steps towards optimizing safety. At the same time  we are striving to ensure we can maintain high levels of target occupancy to maximize our probability of success in improving not only memory  but many other important elements of cognition in those suffering from mild cognitive impairment and early AD ” said Frank Weber  M.D.  CEO of Vivoryon. “We have designed two complimentary studies intended to support the efficient advancement of varoglutamstat towards regulatory approval. At our recent R&D Event  multiple perspectives from renowned Key Opinion Leaders further elucidated the solid base of understanding for the potential of varoglutamstat to treat early AD patients  in particular the endpoints in VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  which we are confident will provide a deep understanding of varoglutamstat’s effect on relevant cognitive outcome parameters and patient function in separate sensitive and validated scales. Taken together  we believe that our unique approach has the potential to dramatically improve the lives of millions of people whose daily lives are impacted by AD.““I am very pleased to have received the unanimous recommendation of the independent DSMB of the VIVA-MIND trial to continue the highest investigated dose arm of 600mg BID for the remainder of the study. Importantly  the trial has now passed the milestone of an interim evaluation of a predetermined safety boundary of specified adverse events ” commented Dr. Howard Feldman  Professor of Neurosciences  Co-Director of The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine  and the VIVA-MIND Principal Investigator. “As varoglutamstat progresses further through its Phase 2a/b design  we will continue to gather further safety and tolerability data  of this oral treatment and its profile which may differentiate from anti-amyloid-antibodies which are delivered by infusion.“The DSMB’s dose decision recommending that the highest dose of varoglutamstat of 600mg BID be selected for the remainder of the trial follows its September 18  2023 quarterly safety review of adverse events  and labs  and its October 19  2023 analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest (AESI) pertaining to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and hepatobiliary disorders  as well as target occupancy and plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) data.In July 2023  Vivoryon announced that it commenced preparations for an open-label extension (OLE) study to provide a long-term treatment option to patients after completion of treatment under the VIVIAD or VIVA-MIND protocol. The launch of the OLE study is contingent on the outcome of VIVIAD. Vivoryon remains on track to report the final data readout from the VIVIAD study in the first quarter of 2024.###About VIVA-MINDVIVA-MIND is a complementary Phase 2 study being conducted in the U.S.  coordinated by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA)  part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with a $15 million grant (NIA award number R01AG061146). The study seeks to enroll 180 patients into the Phase 2a adaptive dose-finding portion with the Phase 2b portion  enrolling an additional 234 patients treated at the selected dose for at least 72 weeks  with a total of 414 patients being treated on stable doses of varoglutamstat for 18 months. The VIVA-MIND design was adapted in 2022 to enable all 180 patients in the Phase 2a portion to be treated for at least 72 weeks  allowing for the opportunity to progress seamlessly to a potential Phase 3 study. The flexible study design is aimed at increasing the probability of success by broadening option space for adjustments in clinical development based on learnings from VIVIAD and other developments in the field. The primary endpoint for this study is clinical dementia rating scale - sum of boxes (CDR-SB)  an established approvable endpoint measuring a combination of cognitive abilities and activities of daily living. Secondary efficacy endpoints include quantitative EEG theta power  ADAS-Cog 13 and others. Exploratory endpoints include mini-mental state examination (MMSE)  Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA)  quantitative EEG alpha power  relative QPCT activity in CSF and others.About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines.

The slide presentation is attached to this announcement. The webcast can be accessed live or as a replay ( link ) . Company presentation  incl. NIPU data is available on the Ultimovacs website.Oslo  October 23  2023: Ultimovacs ASA (“Ultimovacs”) (OSE ULTI)  a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines  today announced the full dataset from the NIPU clinical trial ( NCT04300244 ) presented at the ESMO Congress 2023 in Madrid. NIPU is an investigator-initiated  randomized  multi-center  open-label Phase II clinical trial for second-line treatment in patients with malignant mesothelioma (MPM).The data from the study was published initially in a late-breaking abstract at ESMO. Further details have now been provided in an oral presentation by the Principal Investigator at the ESMO Congress. The results showed that Ultimovacs’ cancer vaccine UV1  in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab  demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival versus ipilimumab and nivolumab alone  a key secondary endpoint. No additional safety concerns were reported from the UV1 treatment.UV1 plus ipilimumab and nivolumab improved overall survival (OS)  reducing the risk of death by 27% (hazard ratio (HR)=0.73 [80% CI  0.53-1.00]  1-sided p value = 0.0985  2-sided p value = 0.197). The median OS was 15.4 months (95% CI  11.1-22.6) for UV1 plus ipilimumab and nivolumab (treatment arm) versus 11.1 months (95% CI  8.8-18.1) for ipilimumab and nivolumab alone (control arm)  with a median observation time of 17.3 months. This degree of improvement met the protocol's predefined threshold for statistical significance.The data further demonstrated a benefit in terms of objective response rate (tumor reduction by at least 30%)  as determined by blinded independent central review (BICR). In the UV1 arm  31% of the patients experienced an objective response  compared to 16% in the control arm (odds ratio 2.44 [80% CI  1.35-4.49]  1-sided p value = 0.028).The baseline patient characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment arms. The epithelioid subtype of MPM comprised 77.1% of the study population  in line with the frequency of this subtype among the general MPM population. Notably  the trial enrolled a relatively high fraction of patients with PD-L1 negative tumor biopsies (53.4%)  a characteristic for patients typically less responsive to checkpoint inhibitors alone.The safety profile of the combination of UV1 plus ipilimumab and nivolumab observed in the trial was consistent with the safety profile of ipilimumab and nivolumab alone  confirming the good safety profile for UV1. The patients will continue to be monitored for efficacy and safety endpoints over the next years.“The results from the first randomized UV1 Phase II trial  NIPU presented by the Principal Investigator Professor Åslaug Helland at ESMO 2023  is a proof of concept for UV1. These data reaffirm our unwavering commitment to developing UV1 as an effective add-on treatment to checkpoint inhibitors for a range of cancers. We eagerly anticipate the forthcoming results from our other ongoing Phase II trials and how these data will move us forward in our mission to improve outcomes for cancer patients worldwide ” said Carlos de Sousa  CEO of Ultimovacs.The NIPU study is sponsored by Oslo University Hospital with support from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ultimovacs. The randomized  open-label  multi-center trial with 118 patients was conducted in Australia  Denmark  Norway  Spain  and Sweden. The trial enrolled patients with malignant mesothelioma after first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The first patient in the NIPU trial was enrolled in June 2020  and the last patient was enrolled in January 2023.The NIPU trial was designed to detect a clinically meaningful difference between the two treatment groups and includes a statistical analysis plan typical for randomized phase 2 trials where the aim is to assess efficacy without recruiting a large number of patients. Both the study protocol and the statistical plan were approved by the regulatory authorities. It was set up with 80% statistical power and a 1-sided alpha of 0.1. This means we can be 80% confident that we've accurately measured the effects of UV1. According to the trial protocol and the number of patients included  the trial results are presented with 80% confidence intervals and are considered statistically significant if the one-sided p-value is below 0.1.Ultimovacs announced topline NIPU study results in June 2023. Based on BICR  the study did not meet the primary endpoint of PFS. Investigator assessment  a pre-defined supportive analysis of the primary endpoint performed by specialized radiologists at the study hospitals  showed a statistically significant positive PFS benefit for the patients in the UV1 arm. The HR per BICR was 1.01 (80% CI 0.75-1.36  1-sided p value = 0.4895  2-sided p value = 0.979)  with a median PFS of 4.2 months (95% CI 2.9-9.8) for UV1 plus ipilimumab and nivolumab  and 4.7 months (95% CI 3.9-7.0) for ipilimumab and nivolumab alone. The HR per investigator assessment was 0.60 (80% CI 0.45-0.81  1-sided p value = 0.0125  2-sided p value = 0.025)  with a median PFS of 4.3 months (95% CI 3.0-6.8) for UV1 plus ipilimumab and nivolumab and 2.9 months (95% CI 2.4-5.5) for ipilimumab and nivolumab alone.In October 2023  Ultimovacs announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had granted Orphan Drug Designation for UV1 in the treatment of mesothelioma (based on the NIPU data from June 2023).UV1 is a therapeutic cancer vaccine that generates an immune response against the human telomerase (hTERT) enzyme. The enzyme is essential for the ability of cancer cells to proliferate. Telomerase is present in 85-90% of all cancers  across the stages of the disease. The vaccine is manufactured as an off-the-shelf product with a long shelf life. UV1 is easy to use and does not require sophisticated hospital infrastructure  enabling patient access to therapy also in community centers  and in rural and underserved communities.Ultimovacs is evaluating the universal cancer vaccine UV1 in a broad clinical development program across various cancer indications with different biology and disease stages  in combination with different checkpoint inhibitors. The topline data from NIPU are the first results among the five randomized trials in the UV1 Phase II clinical program. In addition to malignant mesothelioma  Phase II studies are ongoing in patients with malignant melanoma  head and neck cancer  ovarian cancer  and non-small cell lung cancer. The topline data from the malignant melanoma and head and neck cancer trials are expected during the first and second half of 2024. UV1 is a patented  proprietary technology owned by Ultimovacs.==ENDS==About NIPUNIPU ( N ivolumab and I pilimumab P lus/minus U V1 vaccination) is a randomized  multi-center phase II trial in which Ultimovacs’ universal cancer vaccine  UV1  is evaluated in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s checkpoint inhibitors  nivolumab and ipilimumab  as second-line treatment of malignant mesothelioma. The trial sponsor is Oslo University Hospital  supported in the preparation and execution of the trial by Ultimovacs and Bristol-Myers Squibb.The 118 patients were randomized 1:1 into two treatment arms. All participants receive treatment with nivolumab (240 mg every two weeks) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every six weeks) until disease progression  unacceptable toxicity  or for a maximum of 2 years. Patients randomized to the experimental arm received eight intradermal injections of UV1 vaccine during the first three months of treatment. The objective of the study is to achieve a clinically meaningful benefit in patients with malignant mesothelioma (MPM) after progression on first-line standard platinum doublet chemotherapy. Subsequent events emerging in patients in both arms of the NIPU study will continue to be monitored beyond the read-out of the primary endpoint. The ipilimumab and nivolumab combination has recently been approved as first-line treatment for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma in Europe and the U.S.The trial was sized to detect a target PFS HR of 0.6  with 80% power and a 1-sided alpha of 0.1. Overall survival was calculated using the same method as for PFS.About MesotheliomaMalignant mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that occurs in the thin layer of tissue surrounding the lungs and inside of the chest. Mesothelioma accounted for 30 870 new cancer cases and 26 278 cancer deaths worldwide in 2020  according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (Globocan 2020). Mesothelioma is a disease with a high unmet medical need  especially in industrialized countries. The median overall survival is approximately one year. Occupational asbestos exposure is the No. 1 cause of the disease  and several occupations like firefighters  military veterans  construction  and industry workers  are at risk. This cancer usually takes several decades to develop after a person’s first exposure to asbestos. Most patients are diagnosed after age 70 because of the long latency period. Even though the use of asbestos to a large extent is banned in new constructions in many countries today  new incidences of mesothelioma will continue to be a medical and public health challenge because of the long latency period typical of the illness. Few treatment options are available after first-line chemotherapy for patients with inoperable disease. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab has recently shown increased survival compared to standard chemotherapy  but most patients do not respond  and improvements are called for. Telomerase is expressed in mesothelioma cells and is therefore a relevant target for therapeutic vaccination.About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines with broad applicability. Ultimovacs’ lead cancer vaccine candidate UV1 is directed against human telomerase (hTERT)  an antigen present in 85-90% of cancers in all stages of tumor growth. A broad clinical program  with Phase II trials in five cancer indications enrolling more than 670 patients  aims to demonstrate UV1’s impact in combination with other immunotherapies in multiple cancer types expressing telomerase and where patients have unmet medical needs. UV1 is universal  off-the-shelf  and easy to use  and is a patented technology owned by Ultimovacs.In addition  Ultimovacs’ adjuvant platform  based on the proprietary Tetanus-Epitope-Targeting (TET) technology  combines tumor-specific antigens and adjuvant in the same molecule and is in Phase I clinical development.The Company is listed on Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange (ULTI.OL).About the UV1 Phase II programThe immunotherapeutic cancer vaccine UV1 is investigated in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in patients with various cancer indications with diverse tumor biology. The diversity of the UV1 Phase II program places Ultimovacs in a favorable position to capture the cancer vaccine’s potential broad applicability when combined with checkpoint inhibitors:INITIUM : Evaluating UV1 in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab as first-line treatment for patients with malignant melanoma.

The investigator-initiated study is led by Vestre Viken (Drammen Hospital) and supported by Ultimovacs.About UV1UV1 is a universal cancer vaccine designed to induce a specific T-cell response against telomerase. UV1 consists of long  synthetic peptides representing a sequence in the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase (hTERT)  shown to induce CD4+ T-cells. These CD4+ T-cells have the potential to provide inflammatory signals  and T-cell support is believed to be critical for triggering a strong anti-tumor immune response. Following intradermal injection  antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin are exposed to the vaccine peptides. These APCs will process the peptides and present vaccine epitopes on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules to naïve T-cells in the lymph nodes. Activated vaccine-specific T-cells will then enter the circulation and search for cells displaying their cognate antigen in the context of HLA molecules.The UV1 peptides contain several epitopes  shown to be non-restrictive in terms of (HLA) alleles for presentation. It is  therefore not required to perform HLA pre-screening of patients  which potentially enables broad population utilization of the vaccine. UV1 is administered over three months with eight intradermal injections and the immune-modulator GM-CSF.A link to the webcast and the comprehensive results from the NIPU study may be accessed from the Company website www.ultimovacs.com .

Among the most coveted awards categories is the Editors’ Choice Awards and today we bring you the 2023 nominees for Outstanding Post-Trade Services Provider.The post-trade landscape is constantly evolving  bolstered by technological advancements and regulatory change – particularly in light of Basel 4 and the ongoing Brexit deliberations in the UK and Europe.With its complete view of the market  The TRADE has named Cboe Clear Europe  Eurex  Euronext Clearing and LSEG’s LCH as the most impressive players in this space thanks to their recent achievements and developments.Cboe Clear EuropeCboe rebranded its clearing house EuroCCP to Cboe Clear Europe late last year  having acquired it two years prior. Since then  the post-trade offering has seen various developments as it continues to enhance its services  focused on growing its European markets  embracing innovation and supporting its clients’ strategies. The pan-European central counterparty (CCP) has approval to clear cash equities  depositary receipts  ETFs  and equity derivatives (index futures and options). Claiming to be one of the most-connected CCPs in Europe  it offers its services to 48 trading venues  with plans to continue to grow this further. Its overall market share for cash equities clearing was 34% in the first half of 2023  an year-on-year increase from 2022.In January  Amsterdam-based Cboe Clear Europe became the first non-UK CCP to receive permanent recognition from the Bank of England (BoE). Subsequently  Swiss authorities also authorised Cboe Clear Europe as a recognised CCP in March. Following this  in June  Cboe Clear Europe unveiled an initiative to introduce clearing  settlement and post-trade lifecycle management for SFT transactions in European cash equities and ETFs by Q3 2024. Subject to regulatory approvals  the service will come through its Amsterdam-based clearing house and introduce matching  CCP clearing  settlement and post-trade lifecycle management for SFT transactions in European cash equities and ETFs  and settlement will take place in 19 European Central Securities Depositories (CSDs). The move secured the support of a broad range of key market participants  including banks  clearing firms  asset managers and custodians  including the likes of BNY Mellon  Citi and Goldman Sachs.Cboe Clear Europe is an independent subsidiary of the Cboe group  operating with its own governance structure and management team – bolstered through the appointment of Vikesh Patel as President in December 2022. He replaced Cécile Nagel  who stepped down from the role in September.EurexEurex  part of Deutsche Börse Group  has made many high-profile developments over the last year  working to grow its post-trade offering through partnerships and launches. In November last year  it launched a new incentive program aimed at encouraging more euro clearing volumes to the European Union post-Brexit. Through offering an incentive reward of up to 50 000 euros  could qualify when starting the clearing of OTC interest rate swaps (IRS)  overnight index swaps (OIS)  basis swaps and/or zero-coupon inflation swaps (ZCIS) at Eurex Clearing. Clients running active accounts in the EU could apply from March of this year with the clearinghouse confirming that the move was aimed at reducing reliance on CCPs outside of the EU in line with regulatory objectives. The same month  it expanded its interest rate segment with the launch of three-month Euro STR futures referencing €STR  allowing allow Eurex to offer a listed  centrally cleared and cash-settled solution for trading or hedging the new risk-free rate.Eurex’s offering allows clients to trade repos with more than 160 registered participants and allows participants to raise or place cash against over 13 000 securities  both domestic and international. The business reached record volumes in its cleared repo markets – doubling across all markets year on year as of September this year. Eurex onboarded State Street in May of this year  becoming the first clearing house outside of the US to trade and centrally clear repo transactions with the move allowing State Street clients to benefit from multilateral netting providing risk management and collateral optimisation. Following this  BNY Mellon selected Eurex as the first clearing house to centrally clear repo trades in Europe. The same month  Goldman Sachs joined exchange Eurex’s listed FX futures business as a trading and clearing member – a “major milestone” in its ambition to become a listed FX liquidity hub in Europe.In April  Eurex Clearing announced the planned launch its new ESG Clearing Compass  aiming to support the sustainable transformation journey of clearing members and their clients by increasing transparency and awareness regarding cleared portfolios and counterparties. More recently  in June  Eurex incorporated STIR derivatives into its partnership programme  with the aim of establishing an EU-based viable alternative liquidity pool for trading and clearing EURIBOR Futures and Options. Eurex at the time stated that its goal is to “enhance its cross-product efficiencies while also supporting the European systemic stability and strategic autonomy agenda”.Euronext ClearingMulti-asset clearing house  Euronext Clearing – formerly CC&G as part of Borsa Italiana – offers risk management on 14 markets and seven countries  covering equities  ETFs  closed-end funds  financial and commodity derivatives  bonds and repos. The year to date represented a key stage of the business’ growth strategy  working to deliver one CCP for all of Euronext’s cash equity  financial and commodity derivatives markets across Europe. The clearing migrations for equities and derivatives clearing are scheduled respectively for end of 2023 and Q3 2024  set to provide harmonised trading  clearing and settlement infrastructure for its members. In January of this year  the exchange negotiated the early termination of its derivatives clearing agreement with LSEG clearing house LCH SA.In June 2022  Euronext and LCH RepoClear concurrently launched Value at Risk (VaR) methodologies across the respective debt markets they clear  across fixed income  equity and equity derivatives. Euronext’s VaR-based margin methodology focuses on Italian  Portuguese  Spanish  and Irish government bonds. The move comes as part of the ongoing evolution of Euronext Clearing Risk Management systems and will replace the MVP SPAN-like margin methodology which is currently applied to all bond instruments. The new VaR framework on equity and derivatives  expected this quarter  is part of the European expansion of Euronext Clearing and the firm’s “Growth for Impact 2024” strategic plan. Upon the completion of the migration programme  Euronext Clearing claims to be be Europe’s third-largest CCP.Over the last three years  Euronext has made continued investment in its clearing business  with 50 new hires as it worked towards its target of 65% headcount growth of Euronext Clearing between 2021 and 2023. The hires have been made across its risk  technology  sales and product development functions. In May  Euronext appointed Roberto Pecora as chief executive officer and general manager of Euronext Clearing  effective from July.LCHLCH – an LSEG post-trade business – has seen a swathe of new developments over recent months as it continues to enhance its business on a global scale. It offers its clearing service and risk management offering across a range of asset classes  including: OTC and listed interest rates  fixed income  FX  CDS  equities and commodities. In the last year  LCH has seen significant growth across its services  including LCH CDSClear which saw a 31% increase versus H1 2022  LCH SwapClear – up 13%; LCH RepoClear with an increase of 12% year on year  and LCH CommodityClear which saw a 9% increase.The business has been enhanced through various acquisitions and partnerships. In April  LCH entered into a strategic partnership with digital assets trading venue  GFO-X  to launch the UK’s first centrally cleared trading venue for derivatives in this space – scheduled to launch in Q4. Additionally  last year’s acquisition of portfolio optimisation services provider Quantile added important multi-lateral netting capabilities to LSEG’s post-trade division  working to maximise efficiency and better manage risk  capital and funding requirements through Quantile’s multilateral optimisation services. Following this  the completion of the Acadia acquisition in March 2023 further enhanced the offering across multiple asset classes  with Acadia providing risk management  margining and collateral services for the uncleared derivatives markets. Another key milestone came in July  as LCH merged its RepoClear Euro debt service  which includes specials and general collateral  with its tri-party basket repo clearing service €GCPlus  unlocking additional netting opportunities for members.Most recently  in October   UOB (United Overseas Bank) joined both LCH SwapClear and LCH ForexClear as a direct clearing member  the first Southeast Asian bank to join ForexClear  the last Singapore local banking group to join ForexClear  and the first member globally to join both simultaneously. Earlier in the year Barclays  Barclays Ireland and Goldman became clearing brokers at LCH’s CDSClear  demonstrating the continuing growth of the business  while Standard Chartered and IndusInd Bank partnered to clear its first NDF non-deliverable forward (NDF) client transaction at LCH ForexClear. In August  Corentine Poilvet-Clédière was appointed chief executive of Paris-based European central counterparty LCH SA  assuming the role on 1 October  replacing Christophe Hémon.,positive,0.95,0.05,0.0,mixed,0.26,0.47,0.27,True,English,"['Outstanding Post-Trade Services Provider', 'Leaders', 'Trading', 'nominees', 'EU-based viable alternative liquidity pool', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'OTC interest rate swaps', 'new ESG Clearing Compass', 'three-month Euro STR futures', '19 European Central Securities Depositories', 'Outstanding Post-Trade Services Provider', 'listed FX futures business', 'Amsterdam-based Cboe Clear Europe', 'FX liquidity hub', 'interest rate segment', 'new risk-free rate', 'pan-European central counterparty', 'Cécile Nagel', 'zero-coupon inflation swaps', 'sustainable transformation journey', 'new incentive program', 'distinguished awards night', 'Editors’ Choice Awards', 'Amsterdam-based clearing house', 'overnight index swaps', 'euro clearing volumes', 'overall market share', 'post-trade lifecycle management', 'ongoing Brexit deliberations', 'many high-profile developments', 'European cash equities', 'first clearing house', 'cash equities clearing', 'first non-UK CCP', 'key market participants', 'State Street clients', 'index futures', 'Cboe group', 'basis swaps', 'European Union', 'first half', 'awards categories', 'post-trade landscape', 'management team', 'incentive reward', 'record volumes', 'risk management', 'European markets', 'Euronext Clearing', 'clearing firms', 'clearing member', 'post-trade offering', 'CCP clearing', 'annual Leaders', 'technological advancements', 'regulatory change', 'complete view', 'The TRADE', 'impressive players', 'recent achievements', 'various developments', 'depositary receipts', 'equity derivatives', 'permanent recognition', 'Swiss authorities', 'SFT transactions', 'regulatory approvals', 'broad range', 'asset managers', 'BNY Mellon', 'Goldman Sachs', 'independent subsidiary', 'governance structure', 'Vikesh Patel', 'active accounts', 'regulatory objectives', 'cash-settled solution', '160 registered participants', 'repo transactions', 'multilateral netting', 'collateral optimisation', 'repo trades', 'major milestone', 'STIR derivatives', 'partnership programme', 'clearing, settlement', 'repo markets', 'Eurex Clearing', 'clients’ strategies', 'Trading gala', 'trading community', '48 trading venues', 'exchange Eurex', 'last year', '€STR', '13,000 securities', '2023 nominees', 'light', 'Basel', 'LSEG', 'LCH', 'space', 'EuroCCP', 'innovation', 'ETFs', 'options', 'CCPs', 'plans', 'January', 'Bank', 'England', 'March', 'June', 'initiative', 'Q3', 'place', 'CSDs', 'move', 'support', 'custodians', 'likes', 'Citi', 'appointment', 'President', 'December', 'role', 'September', 'partnerships', 'launches', 'November', '50,000 euros', 'OIS', 'ZCIS', 'clearinghouse', 'reliance', 'line', 'cleared', 'repos', 'domestic', 'international', 'May', 'ambition', 'April', 'transparency', 'awareness', 'portfolios', 'counterparties', 'aim']",2023-10-24,2023-10-24,thetradenews.com

Photo: GettyA second investment firm has decided to close down funds that invest in companies that are quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange.It is in response to a slew of departures from the Dublin market.Irish Life is to shut 52 different funds that invest in stocks listed on the Irish Stock Exchange  known as Euronext Dublin. There are two underlying funds  but 52 different versions of them for pension customers and investors.Among the Irish Life funds closing are Irish Equity  Canada Life/Setanta Irish Equity  Celtic Fund  Exempt Irish Equity  Indexed Ireland Fund  and Celtic Scope.Investors will be automatically switched into other funds unless they specify one they want to move to  Irish Life said.It comes weeks after investment company Zurich said it is to close its Irish equity fund in response to a number of big companies departing from the exchange.The Euronext Dublin exchange took a hit when building materials giant CRH delisted from it last month.It was previously the largest company on the exchange. It is moving its primary listing from London to New York.Another heavyweight  Smurfit Kappa  said earlier this month that it also plans to quit the Irish exchange for New York as part of a merger with a US peer.Earlier this year drinks giant and Guinness owner Diageo delisted from the Irish Stock Exchange.Paddy Power-owner Flutter Entertainment is expected to leave the Irish market soon after it decided earlier this year to take out a listing in the US.Broker Liam Ferguson  of Tullamore-based Ferga.com  said the closures reinforce the point that the Irish stock market has become too small to be considered a viable part of any diversified investment portfolio  since the departure of some of its biggest names like Diageo  CRH and Flutter.“Anyone investing solely in Dublin-listed shares is exposing themselves to concentration risk and consequent potential for volatility.“Most investors should diversify across geographical regions and industry sectors and Irish-listed shares should only be a part of a wider portfolio ” Mr Ferguson said.In a note to brokers  Irish Life said it regularly reviews its funds offering  removing or adding funds after carrying out this exercise.“Following our most recent review we have decided to close our Irish equity funds. These funds are invested in stocks listed on the Irish Stock Exchange known  as Euronext Dublin.“We have made the decision to close the funds because the number of companies on the exchange has decreased  which increases concentration risk and the potential for volatility for investors in the funds ” the note to brokers said.It said the Irish equity funds will close later this year.The funds will close to new business  switches-in and top-ups on November 20 next.Regular premiums will continue to be invested in the funds  and switches-out and withdrawals from the funds are permitted until the funds close.The investment company said the Irish equity funds will automatically switch to another fund and this will be based on fund availability. Where possible  the risk rating of the new fund will be in line with that of the closing fund  Irish Life said.A spokesman for Irish Life said it had no comment beyond what was in the note sent to brokers.Earlier this month Zurich said it will close a fund that invests in stocks listed on the Irish stock exchange.Zurich told brokers: “As the number and size of stocks listed on the exchange has reduced  the fund is becoming more concentrated as a result. For that reason  Zurich have taken the decision to close the fund.”It will close early next year.Zurich said it will no longer accept single premiums or switches into the fund.,neutral,0.11,0.88,0.01,neutral,0.03,0.86,0.11,True,English,"['Dublin stock market', 'Irish Life', '52 funds', 'Paddy Power-owner Flutter Entertainment', 'building materials giant CRH', 'The Euronext Dublin exchange', 'Tullamore-based Ferga.com', 'second investment firm', 'Broker Liam Ferguson', 'Setanta Irish Equity', 'Exempt Irish Equity', 'Guinness owner Diageo', 'diversified investment portfolio', 'Irish stock market', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'Indexed Ireland Fund', 'two underlying funds', 'Irish equity fund', 'Irish Life funds', 'drinks giant', 'Irish market', 'Irish exchange', 'Dublin market', 'investment company', 'wider portfolio', 'Mr Ferguson', 'Celtic Scope', '52 different versions', 'pension customers', 'largest company', 'New York', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'biggest names', 'Dublin-listed shares', 'concentration risk', 'geographical regions', 'industry sectors', 'Irish-listed shares', 'recent review', 'new business', 'Regular premiums', 'risk rating', 'single premiums', 'Celtic Fund', 'fund availability', 'new fund', 'closing fund', '52 different funds', 'other funds', 'primary listing', 'US peer', 'consequent potential', 'big companies', 'Most investors', 'Photo', 'Getty', 'response', 'slew', 'departures', 'stocks', 'Zurich', 'number', 'hit', 'London', 'heavyweight', 'merger', 'point', 'Anyone', 'volatility', 'note', 'brokers', 'exercise', 'decision', 'top', 'ups', 'November', 'withdrawals', 'line', 'spokesman', 'comment', 'size', 'result', 'reason']",2023-10-24,2023-10-24,independent.ie
