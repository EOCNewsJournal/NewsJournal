FOR FURTHER INFORMATION  PLEASE SEE SECTION ENTITLED ""IMPORTANT INFORMATION"" BELOW.HELSINKI  Oct. 24  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Crayfish BidCo Oy has today published the following information through a stock exchange release:On 10 January 2023  Crayfish BidCo Oy (the ""Offeror"")  a Finnish private limited liability company indirectly controlled by the entities comprising Triton Fund V (together ""Triton"")  announced a voluntary public cash tender offer for all the issued and outstanding shares in Caverion Corporation (""Caverion"" or the ""Company"") that are not held by Caverion or any of its subsidiaries (the ""Shares"" or  individually  a ""Share"") (the ""Tender Offer""). The Offeror has published a tender offer document  dated 7 March 2023  concerning the Tender Offer and supplements to the tender offer document  dated 14 March 2023  4 April 2023  13 April 2023  9 May 2023  25 May 2023  16 June 2023  27 July 2023  7 August 2023  5 September 2023  4 October 2023 and 23 October 2023 (the tender offer document as supplemented with the aforementioned supplement documents  the ""Tender Offer Document""). The acceptance period under the Tender Offer (the ""Offer Period"") commenced on 8 March 2023 at 9:30 a.m. (Finnish time) and is set to expire on 1 November 2023 at 4:00 p.m. (Finnish time).The Offeror has today received all regulatory approvals necessary for the completion of the Tender Offer and secured the fulfillment of the minimum acceptance condition of more than two-thirds (2/3) of all Shares under the Tender Offer. As all conditions to completion of the Tender Offer are thus fulfilled on the date hereof  the Offeror has decided to declare the Tender Offer unconditional and to complete the Tender Offer. However  the Offeror's intention is to acquire all the Shares and therefore the Offeror urges those Caverion shareholders who have not yet accepted the Tender Offer to accept the Tender Offer before the end of the Offer Period. The Offer Period is currently set to expire on 1 November 2023 at 4:00 p.m. (Finnish time).ALL REGULATORY APPROVALS RECEIVEDAs announced on 18 October 2023  the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority (the ""FCCA"") has on 17 October 2023 issued a conditional merger control clearance decision concerning the Tender Offer  conditional on the Offeror procuring the divestment of a certain geographically limited building automation business unit in Finland to a purchaser fulfilling certain criteria set out in the clearance decision and approved by the FCCA (the ""Divestment Commitment"").The FCCA has today issued its approval of the purchaser of the business unit to be divested under the Divestment Commitment. The Offeror has thus taken all actions required from it under the Divestment Commitment to complete the Tender Offer and thereby obtained all regulatory approvals necessary for the completion of the Tender Offer. Therefore  the Offeror announces that the condition to completion of the Tender Offer concerning the receipt of regulatory approvals has been fulfilled.FULFILLMENT OF MINIMUM ACCEPTANCE CONDITION SECUREDAs announced on 18 October 2023 and 23 October 2023  the Offeror has entered into conditional share purchases whereby it has agreed to purchase 52 005 076 Shares in aggregate against cash consideration not exceeding the Offer Price (the ""Conditional Share Purchases""). The completion of the Conditional Share Purchases was conditional only on the Offeror obtaining the final remaining merger control clearance from the FCCA  and that any conditions set in such clearance decision have been fulfilled to the extent required for the completion of the Tender Offer. Given that the Divestment Commitment has now been fulfilled to the extent required for the completion of the Tender Offer  the Conditional Share Purchases have become unconditional and the Offeror expects to complete the Conditional Share Purchases before the end of the Offer Period.Together with the Offeror's current shareholding  the Shares to be acquired under the Conditional Share Purchases represent approximately 67.82 percent of all outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) in Caverion. Consequently  the fulfillment of the minimum acceptance condition of more than two-thirds (2/3) of all Shares under the Tender Offer has been secured as the completion of the Conditional Share Purchases is no longer subject to any conditions that would not have been fulfilled.TENDER OFFER DECLARED UNCONDITIONALIn addition to having received all regulatory approvals necessary for the completion of the Tender Offer and secured the fulfillment of the minimum acceptance condition of more than two-thirds (2/3) of all Shares under the Tender Offer  the Offeror confirms that all other conditions to completion of the Tender Offer are fulfilled on the date hereof. Consequently  the Offeror has decided to declare the Tender Offer unconditional  meaning that the completion of the Tender Offer is no longer subject to any conditions and the Offeror will complete the Tender Offer. However  the Offeror's intention is to acquire all the Shares and therefore the Offeror urges those Caverion shareholders who have not yet accepted the Tender Offer to accept the Tender Offer before the end of the Offer Period. The Offeror is under no obligation to continue the Offer Period in a subsequent offer period or otherwise  so Caverion shareholders who wish to accept the Tender Offer should act now.Those Caverion shareholders who have not yet accepted the Tender Offer are advised that the Offer Period is currently set to expire on 1 November 2023 at 4:00 p.m. (Finnish time).Save for the Tender Offer having been declared unconditional  the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer remain unchanged. Shareholders who have already accepted the Tender Offer may no longer withdraw their acceptances unless permitted by law and do not have to accept the Tender Offer again or take any other action as a result of the Tender Offer having been declared unconditional. The unanimous recommendation by the Board of Directors of Caverion that the holders of shares in Caverion accept the Tender Offer  as issued on 5 April 2023  remains in force unchanged.ACCEPTANCE PROCEDURE OF THE TENDER OFFERMost Finnish account operators are expected to send a notice regarding the Tender Offer and related instructions to those who are registered as shareholders in the shareholders' register of Caverion maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy. Any acceptance must be submitted in such a manner that it will be received within the Offer Period (including any extended Offer Period) taking into account  however  the instructions given by the relevant account operator. The account operator may request the receipt of acceptances already prior to the expiration of the Offer Period.Shareholders of Caverion who do not receive such instructions from their account operator or asset manager should first contact their account operator or asset manager and can subsequently contact Danske Bank A/S  Finland Branch by sending an email to caverion-offer@danskebank.com  where such shareholders of Caverion can receive information on submitting their acceptance of the Tender Offer  or  if such shareholders are U.S. residents or located within the United States  they may contact their brokers for the necessary information. Those shareholders of Caverion whose Shares are nominee-registered  and who wish to accept the Tender Offer  must effect such acceptance in accordance with the instructions given by the custodian of the nominee-registered shareholders. The Offeror will not send an acceptance form or any other documents related to the Tender Offer to these shareholders of Caverion.Mikael Aro from Triton comments:""We are delighted to announce that we have declared the tender offer unconditional as a result of receiving all necessary regulatory approvals for the voluntary public cash tender offer for all shares in Caverion Corporation and securing the fulfillment of the minimum acceptance condition under the tender offer. We will complete the tender offer during November 2023. However  as our intention is to acquire all the outstanding shares in Caverion  we urge all the remaining shareholders of Caverion to act now and accept the tender offer before the end of the offer period.""OTHER MATTERSThe Offeror will supplement the Tender Offer Document in respect of the information included in this stock exchange release and will publish the supplement to the Tender Offer Document as soon as it has been approved by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority. The Offeror currently expects that the supplement to the Tender Offer Document will be published before the end of October 2023 at the latest.Distribution:Nasdaq Helsinki  key media  www.caverion.comABOUT CAVERIONCaverion is a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Finland with its shares listed on the official list of Nasdaq Helsinki.

Since 2016  the NYSE has grown 35.1% while the Nasdaq has ballooned 189.3% in market cap.The vast majority of companies in the S&P 500 Index  often seen as a barometer for U.S. stock market performance  are traded on these exchanges.With $7.2 trillion in market cap  Euronext is the world’s third-largest exchange. Since Brexit  the pan-European exchange has attracted more capital and by early 2021  it outranked the London Stock Exchange. Over the last two decades  London’s stock market has fallen from 13% to 4% of the global share.Ranking fourth is the Shanghai Stock Exchange  at $6.7 trillion in market cap. Beverage giant Kweichow Moutai  ICBC  and PetroChina are the largest companies traded on the exchange.Like China  as India’s economy has continued to expand  so has its primary stock market. As the twelfth-largest globally  it’s worth $3.5 trillion in market cap  growing over 133% in market value since 2016.Should You Invest Internationally?While U.S. stock markets are unmatched in scale in the global arena  investors may look to diversify exposure across the pond.In fact  by 2050  Goldman Sachs projects that emerging markets’ share of global stock market capitalization will surpass America. Given the strong economic growth of emerging markets  investors may find opportunities in broad market indexes that track these countries through investment vehicles like ETFs or mutual funds.Yet while international markets may provide opportunities for diversification  they may also present risk given political  regulatory  and economic factors.TOPICS:Business/EconomySocietyKEYWORDS:stockexchangestockmarketClick here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic  LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno  CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Details of (estimated) amortization and earn-out expenses (PPA expenses) relating to the 2022 acquisitions of LPE and Reno are found in Annex 2.Comment“ASM delivered robust results amidst continued soft market conditions ” said Benjamin Loh  President and CEO of ASM. “Revenue increased 9% at constant currencies compared to prior year to €622 million  which is at the top end of our previous guidance of €580-620 million. The gross margin was again relatively strong at around 49% in Q3  with a positive mix including again significantly higher contribution from the Chinese market. Slightly higher revenue and gross margin was offset by further increases in R&D investments resulting in an operating margin of 25.3% in Q3. For FY 2023 we expect an operating margin of at least 26%  somewhat better than the previous forecast of 26% or slightly lower.Orders came in at €627 million in Q3  about flat compared to last year (at constant currencies)  and up compared to the lower level in Q2 2023  despite the generally weaker market conditions. Against the backdrop of continued economic pressure and geopolitical tensions  large parts of the semiconductor end markets are still sluggish and the timing and strength of recovery is still uncertain. As a consequence  demand from our customers in the leading-edge logic/foundry segment remains relatively soft  and this also includes the earlier reported push outs due to delays in fab readiness. On the positive side  leading logic/foundry customers remain committed to transition to the next node which will be based on gate-all-around (GAA) technology. As previously communicated  we expect the first meaningful GAA orders in Q4 2023  of which part has now already been booked in Q3. Despite some advanced-technology investments in the DRAM segment  overall demand in memory is still low and not expected to recover in the near term. The power/analog market so far held up well but is now also showing signs of slowdown  including in the automotive and industrial segments. Traction in SiC Epi remains solid and we still expect revenues in excess of €130 million for this business this year.An important event during the quarter was our Investor Day 2023. Despite the current market weakness  we increased our revenue target for 2025 to €3.0-€3.6 billion1  assuming recovery of the WFE market. We also issued new guidance for 2027  including further revenue growth to €4.0-5.0 billion1  as we continue to execute our Growth through Innovation strategy. We also shared that we expect the ALD market to remain among the fastest growing segments with a CAGR of 10%-14% for the period 2022-2027  while in Si Epi we continue to target market share increases. In addition  with SiC Epi we have added a rapidly growing and highly synergistic product line. We are well placed to support our leading logic/foundry customers in the upcoming transition to gate-all-around (GAA)  which we expect to increase ASM’s served available market (SAM) by an estimated US$400 million per 100k wafer starts per month.During the Investor Day we also highlighted actions taken with respect to our commitment to sustainability  such as the recent SBTi verification of our Net Zero 2035 targets  and initiatives to increase the energy efficiency of our products in close collaborations with customers and suppliers.”OutlookOn a currency-comparable level  we project revenue of €600-640 million for Q4 2023. Our forecasts for the second half and the full year 2023 are largely unchanged. At constant currencies and taking into account the guidance for Q4  we expect revenue in the second half to drop by approximately 10% compared to the first half of the year  and for FY 2023  we expect revenue to show a year-on-year increase of close to 10%  including the consolidation of LPE.On October 17  2023  the US issued new export control measures. Based on our preliminary assessment  we do not expect any material additional impact  relative to what we previously communicated.Wafer fab equipment (WFE) is now expected to drop by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage in 2023. Memory WFE is still expected to show the sharpest drop. Compared to memory  leading-edge logic/foundry is relatively resilient but also impacted by the weaker market conditions. The mature node markets are expected to be up this year  although  as mentioned  power/analog is showing signs of slowdown. We continue to expect to outperform the WFE market this year.Share buyback programOn September 19  2023  ASM completed the €100 million share buyback program that was started on April 27  2023. In total  we repurchased 264 503 shares at an average price of €378.07  under the 2023 program.ASM Investor Day 2023On September 26  2023  ASM held its Investor Day  where ASM’s management provided an update on our business and financials  and discussed how new technology developments will drive expected market expansion  new growth opportunities and initiatives to improve sustainability. Highlights included:Revenue target for 2025 increased to €3.0-€3.6 billion 2   up from the previous 2021 Investor Day target of €2.8-€3.4 billion. Further growth in revenue to €4.0-€5.0 billion by 2027 (2022-2027 CAGR of 11%-16%).  up from the previous 2021 Investor Day target of €2.8-€3.4 billion. Further growth in revenue to €4.0-€5.0 billion by 2027 (2022-2027 CAGR of 11%-16%). Gross margin of 46%-50% and operating margin of 26%-31% reiterated for 2023-2025  and also targeted for 2026-2027 3   with upward trend in operating margin expected in outer years.  with upward trend in operating margin expected in outer years. Annual capex of €100-€180 million (in 2024-2027)  to support growth.Single-wafer ALD market forecast of $3.1-$3.7 billion by 2025 repeated  up from $2.6 billion in 2022; with further expected growth to $4.2-$5.0 billion by 2027  with a continued leading targeted market share of >55%.Si Epi market 2025 forecast increased to $1.9-$2.3 billion  compared to market size of $2.0 billion in 2022  with further growth to $2.3-$2.9 billion in 2027.

The difficulties encountered are both technical and linked to changing market conditions  with the unpredictable drop in a few years in the quantities of waste from the Port of Marseille's oil terminal and the rising prices of available alternative waste sources.In this context  TERF has made an offer to Ecoslops SA to buy its shares in the Ecoslops Provence joint venture  including bank debt  in order to reposition the unit in the industrial system of the La Mède platform.This offer includes the purchase of Ecoslops SA's shares and shareholder loan in Ecoslops Provence for €8.0m  payable in full at closing. This purchase is subject to the usual conditions precedent and to the release by the banks (notably the EIB) of their security interests. On the basis of preliminary discussions  the EIB has confirmed its support for the sale.The impact of Ecoslops Provence's expected exit from the Group's scope of consolidation has been accrued for in the interim financial statements  representing an extraordinary expense of €1.5m.Assuming that the transaction closes on 31 December 2023  the Group's gross debt would fall from €29.4m at 30 June 2023 to €20.5m. Free cash flow would fall from €4.7m at 30 June 2023 to €10.5m  meaning that net debt would fall from €24.7m to €10.0m at 31 December 2023.Consolidated income statement for the six months ended 30 June 2023 (in k€) - Analytical** presentation(Based on unaudited financial statements)en €'000 30/06/2023 30/06/2022 Variation Refined products - Portugal 3 512 5 647 -2 135 Refined products - Provence 776 1 884 -1 108 Scarabox 266 -266 Port services 1 230 1 105 +125 Total turnover 5 518 8 902 -3 384 Gross Margin 3 305 5 538 -2 233 Gross margin rate 60% 62% Gross margin rate excl.

Provence -1 895 -105 -1 790As already communicated  Group sales in the first half of 2023 were 38% lower than in the first half of 2022. It is worth recalling the high base effect of the previous year  with an average Brent price of €96/bbl (start of the conflict in Ukraine) in the first half of 2022  compared with an average Brent price of €74/bbl in the first half of 2023  a fall of 23%.For the Sines unit in Portugal  the sales volume is 7 989 tonnes (compared with 10 395 tonnes in 2022). This decline is mainly due to the fact that the maintenance schedule was shifted by half-years between 2022 and 2023.The Marseille unit sold 2 046 tonnes (1 401 tonnes produced)  compared with 3 300 tonnes in the first half of 2022.Excluding Ecoslops Provence  the margin rate rose from 64% to 66%.In terms of structural costs  personnel costs were stable at €1.8m  while the €0.3m increase in external costs was mainly due to the operating costs of Ecoslops Provence.As a result of these factors  the Group's EBITDA fell by €2.5m  from €0.5m at 30 June 2022 to €2.0m at 30 June 2023:en €'000 30/06/2023 30/06/2022 Variation Ecoslops Portugal 967 2 359 -1 392 R&D and holding costs -1 274 -1 199 -75 Perimeter excl.

The change in cash and cash equivalents can be analysed as follows:en €'000 30/06/2023 EBITDA (1 972) Investment subsidy recognition (63) Operating working capital variance 1 516 Operating cashflow (519) Capital expenditure (312) Investing cashflow (312) Ecoslops Provence SHL (TotalEnergies) 250 Capital increase - Loans variance (568) Interests (196) Financing cashflow (514) Cash variance (1 345) Opening cash balance 6 870 Closing cash balance 5 525 Variance (1 345)Operating cash flow was €0.5m. Ecoslops Provence's negative EBITDA (€1.7m) was financed by a change in working capital of the same amount (€0.8m in trade receivables and €0.9m in trade payables).Cash flow from investment amounted to €0.3m  and comprised maintenance capex customary in the Group's business.Lastly  financing-related transactions resulted in a net cash outflow of €0.5m  including a €0.3m contribution of a TotalEnergies shareholder loan to Ecoslops Provence  and €0.6m of net loan repayments (€0.5m of repayments on Ecoslops Provence and Ecoslops Portugal  which refinanced its debt to the tune of €1m). Interest paid mainly concerns Ecoslops Portugal. In view of ongoing discussions with the EIB  the company's ad hoc trustee obtained a suspension of payment of the 30 June 2023 instalment  which comprised €0.5m in principal repayments and €1.4m in interest.Outlook and developmentsWith a restructured balance sheet in line with its financial capabilities  the Group will be able to concentrate on its two strategic assets  Ecoslops Portugal and Scarabox.The Group will therefore continue its efforts to develop and optimise its Sines unit. In particular  it will be working with local stakeholders (port authorities  oil terminal and GALP) to renew the sub-concession in the port of Sines  which expires in mid-2027 (end of the 15-year period). The Group is maintaining its full-year production target at 20 000/22 000 tons.The Scarabox business remains an essential pillar of the Group's development  as it requires little capital and generates good margins. This market is growing  especially in emerging countries where environmental issues are becoming a priority. The Group is actively working on a contract in Côte d'Ivoire  as part of its partnership with the Parlym Group.An analyst and investor web conference will be held on Tuesday 24 October 2023 at 11am.

The forward-thinkin…,Accor  a world-leading hospitality group  today shared an update on its market leading position in the global extended stay  serviced apartments and private rentals segments including exciting new destinations for its Novotel Living brand. The forward-thinking extension of Novotel  one of the best-known midscale hotel brands in the world  is now operating in Singapore  Bangkok  Saigon  and Kazakhstan  with more locations soon to follow. With more than 380 extended stay hotels under 14 global brands  Accor is the world’s largest player in the category (outside the United States)  with a high concentration of properties across Europe and Asia.With new travel habits taking hold and more people seeking out longer stays  Accor has continued to do what we do best – lead the markets where we have deep roots  strong relationships  and a powerful presence – such as Europe  the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. “Over the past couple of decades  Accor has established solid bench strength in our extended stay portfolio with many of our flagship brands – from Adagio  which is Europe’s market leader in the aparthotel industry  to stylish serviced residences across our luxury and lifestyle portfolios. With one of the fastest growing extended stay networks in the industry  and robust demand for our popular premium to midscale brands such as Novotel Living  we will continue to push the boundaries in creating innovative places where our guests can live  work  and play. Jean-Jacques Morin  Accor Deputy CEO and Premium  Midscale & Economy Division CEOThe global extended stay hotels market is currently valued at approximately USD 54.5 billion and projected to reach USD 166.5 billion by 2032  as measured by Future Market Insights  predicting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.8% over the next 10 years. According to the Global Serviced Apartment Industry Report (GSAIR) 2023  “Europe remains the epicenter of serviced apartment demand ” while Asia Pacific accounts for the largest share of corporate serviced apartment volumes  with the UK a close second. The report further identifies the cities with the greatest growth in demand as Riyadh  London  and Singapore.Beyond the new Novotel Living destinations  Accor recently opened Pullman Living Dongguan Forum in China  and Adagio is celebrating its 15th anniversary in 2023 with the opening of eleven new aparthotels across five continents. New destinations include Abidjan Marcory in the Ivory Coast; Rome  Italy; Whitechapel London  UK; and Heidelberg  Germany. Meanwhile in Riyadh  Accor has several highly anticipated luxury serviced apartment projects underway including the 250-key Sofitel Serviced Residences Riyadh.CBRE Hotels Research and STR have noted that in the US  hotel extended stay portfolios have expanded by “more than 50% - a CAGR of 7.1% versus 3.2% for the US market as a whole.” And yet  as a recent report by Skift highlights (with figures from The Highland Group)  demand for extended-stay lodging is still “outpacing supply by nearly three-to-one in most US markets.” Furthermore  The Highland Group reports that earlier this year  “the economy  mid-price  and upscale segments saw demand increasing by double-digit percentages while supply rose by only low single-digit percentages.”Accor’s global brands with extended stay offerings range from economy to luxury  including Europe’s market leader Adagio and Adagio Access  refreshingly modern Mercure Living  and one of the newest and most popular  Novotel Living.

For the first time  the emerging green hydrogen market  supported by the French Government and the European Union  has provided sufficient visibility for a corporate power purchase agreement (CPPA) to be signed and for Kallista Energy to secure bank financing for the repowering of a wind park. For Lhyfe  this CPPA secures the power supply for its future green hydrogen production sites  thus consolidating its sustained growth.The wind park in Brachy  in Seine-Maritime (France)  has five wind turbines and is nearly 17 years old.Kallista Energy  the farm's owner and operator  plans to repower it with the latest-generation turbines. The repowered wind park will be able to generate 70% more electricity with the same number of wind turbines.The bank financing for the repowering of Brachy wind park was secured thanks to the CPPA concluded between Kallista Energy and Lhyfe for a term of 15 years.The repowered Brachy wind park  which is due to come online in summer 2024  will have five Vestas V126 wind turbines providing total power of 15 MW. It will produce 46 GWh of renewable electricity each year. The wind park's entire output will be used to power Lhyfe's green and renewable hydrogen production sites  contributing to the decarbonisation of mobility and industry which currently use fossil fuels or carbon-derived hydrogen.This new contract is part of Lhyfe's renewable power supply strategy. Lhyfe has had a production site in Pays de la Loire since 2021 and will commission two new units in Brittany and Occitanie by the end of the year  for a maximum total production capacity of 4 tonnes of green and renewable hydrogen per day. Further projects have also already been announced in new regions  such as the Central Loire Valley and eastern France. This CPPA allows Lhyfe to further reinforce its network of renewable electricity supplier partners  while securing a long-term supply of green electricity for the development of its next sites and guaranteeing competitive sales conditions for renewable hydrogen in the long term.“The complementarity of renewable energy and green hydrogen is doubly virtuous: wind energy  transformed into hydrogen  makes it possible to quickly decarbonise industries that cannot use electricity directly and hydrogen makes it possible to eliminate wind energy variability thanks to the flexibility of electrolysers. We are all the more proud to conclude this CPPA with Lhyfe as part of the repowering of one of our wind portfolio that it will significantly increase power production at our site without increasing the number of turbines”  explained Frédéric Roche  CEO of Kallista Energy.“This agreement with Kallista Energy strengthens our network of green energy supplier partners and  in practical terms  allows us to have an additional 46 GWh per year to power our future production sites. It is thanks to the trust of players such as Kallista Energy that the green and renewable hydrogen sector is ramping up  to rapidly and massively decarbonise industry and mobility”  said Matthieu Guesné  CEO and Founder of Lhyfe.Kallista Energy worked with the following partners for the realisation of this PPA:Legal advisers: Clifford Chance  Lawyer Gauthier Martin (PPA)Bank financing: SaarLB and BNP ParibasManufacturing and maintenance of wind turbines: VestasAbout LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen. Its production sites and portfolio of projects intend to provide access to green and renewable hydrogen in industrial quantities  and enable the creation of a virtuous energy model capable of decarbonising entire sectors of industry and transport.In 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the first industrial-scale green hydrogen production plant in the world to be interconnected with a wind farm.

Therefore  educated choice of the TALE-BE architecture and positioning on DNA could either prevent target sequence limitations (increasing targetable sequence space) or decrease  if not eliminate  bystander editing within the editing window  allowing for more precise genome editing outcomes.We believe that the knowledge presented will help ensure that genome editing-based strategies are skillfully designed to minimize the risk of potential genotoxic events  overall expanding the potential of TALE-BE for nuclear and mitochondrial therapeutic cell engineering.About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

Business performance was stable in the 3rd quarter  with a seasonal effect slightly more marked than last year. Third-quarter sales came to €20.0m for the Photonics division (+2% and +3% at constant exchange rates) and €21.8m for the Medical division (+2% and +6% at constant exchange rates). For the 4th quarter  with a strong order book and production facilities at full capacity  Lumibird again expects strong sales  with a cautious target of over 8% organic growth in annual revenues.Consolidated revenues (unaudited)Revenues (€m) 2023 2022 Reported change Change at constant scope and exchange rates First quarter 40.9 38.0 +8% +9% Second quarter 56.3 46.0 +22% +25% Third quarter 41.8 40.9 +2% +5% 9 months* 139.0 124.9 +11% +13% of which Photonics* 65.9 58.2 +12% +15% Medical 73.0 66.7 +9.5% +12%* Including revenues of Convergent  acquired on 31 August  representing €0.7m in September.By Market SegmentOver the first 9 months  the Photonics division grew by +13% (+15% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates) compared with the first 9 months of 2022  with €20m in the third quarter (+2% and +3% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates).The Defence/Space segment is up +32% in the third quarter at €6.9m  on a -like-for-like basis  as the Saab Group's defence laser rangefinder activities were integrated in May 2022. Over 9 months  it grew by +52% to €23.5m  driven by the laser rangefinder business  which contributed €8.9m to sales  compared with €1.2m in the first 9 months of 2022.After the strong growth in H1  the Lidar segment recorded a temporary decline in sales in the third quarter (-24% at €4.1m)  although business remains buoyant  with growth of 11% to €18.3m over the first 9 months.The Industrial and Scientific activities are stable in Q3 (+1% at €9.1m)  with 9-month sales  down 8% at €23.9m  still affected by capacity restrictions at the start of the year.The Medical division  meanwhile  posted sales of €21.8m in the 3rd quarter (+2% and +6% at constant exchange rates). Over 9-months  sales grew by 9% to €73.0m (up 12% at constant exchange rates). The division's sales are split between diagnostics (25%) and treatment (75%). This growth was driven by new product launches in several market segments and marketing authorisations in new geographical areas.By GeographyThe breakdown of 9 months sales by division and by geographical area is as follows:Revenues (€m) Photonics Chg.

Sales in the United States (-1%) catching up in the 3rd quarter for some of the delay caused by the postponement of deliveries to certain industrial customers in the 1st half of the year.The Medical division's sales for the first 9 months of the year were similar to those recorded in H1  with strong growth in Europe (+20%) and the rest of the world (+19%  mainly Australia)  good performances in Asia-Pacific  and sales in the United States which continue to be adversely affected by exchange rates and the delayed release of new products. Sales of these new products should have a favourable impact on business in the 4th quarter.With seasonality favouring business at the end of the year  a strong order book and production facilities at full capacity  Lumibird once again expects record sales in the 4th quarter.The Group can therefore maintain its target for 2023 of organic sales growth of at least 8%  based on the scope at 31 December 2022  and sufficient to confirm its EBITDA ratio target (excluding Convergent Photonics) of over 20%.LUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading specialists in lasers.

The joint venture will produce materials also known as “black mass” or “active mass.” This can be refined in Orano’s hydrometallurgical plant to be built in Dunkirk  France  so that the materials could be re-used in batteries  thus closing the loop of a circular economy.Thanks to its innovative pre-treatment approach and cutting-edge hydrometallurgy technology  the recovery rates of metals can reach exceptional levels of more than 90%. It enables OEMs to reach European Commission levels of recycling rate into batteries of electric vehicles and ensure the sustainability of the business model. In a context of increased demand for strategic metals and Europe's strong dependence on those metals  Orano positions itself as a key player in the integrated value chain  from battery recycling to the production of cathode materials.“We are delighted with this partnership with a major player such as Stellantis to work together in the recycling of used electric batteries ” said Orano Group Director of Innovation  R&D and Nuclear Medicine  Magnets and Batteries  Guillaume Dureau. “We are proud to bring our expertise and know-how with our innovative and disruptive process which allows a real closed loop. Orano continues its commitment to developing a low-carbon economy with the recycling of strategic materials for the energy transition and the circular economy.”As part of Stellantis’ Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  its Circular Economy Business Unit is pushing to increase recycling revenues by ten times and achieve more than €2 billion in total circular economy revenues by 2030. Stellantis is on track to become a carbon net zero corporation by 2038  all scopes included  with single-digit percentage compensation of remaining emissions.The new commercial recycling entity will also provide Stellantis’ partners  its after-sales network  and other OEMs with a solution to manage end-of-life batteries and scrap from gigafactories. Production will begin in the first part of 2026  reusing existing Stellantis assets and facilities. Investments to reskill and upskill Stellantis and Orano employees will open sustainable perspectives for people in their new assignments.The joint venture is subject to agreement on definitive documentation.# # #About OranoAs a recognized international operator in the field of nuclear materials  Orano delivers solutions to address present and future global energy and health challenges.

But as this date draws near  only 31% of pharmacies are prepared for full compliance with the 2023 USP 797 reference standards. Taking action to ensure compliance amid this transition  Midwest Surgical Hospital has selected Wolters Kluwer Health’s Simplifi 797® technology  alongside the full Simplifi+® Pharmacy Compliance suite of solutions  to replace manual processes and support patient safety at its 25-bed ambulatory surgical center in Omaha  Nebraska.Improving documentation efficiency to uplevel pharmacy teamsPrior to this shift  Midwest Surgical was utilizing paper-based records in its pharmacy for compounding documentation and medication inventory management across the facility. This placed an extreme administrative burden on pharmacists and led to inefficiency in medication compounding practices. By implementing the full suite of Simplifi+ Pharmacy Compliance solutions  including Simplifi 797  Simplifi+ MedTrays and Simplifi+ MedStorage  Midwest Surgical can proactively manage USP compliance  medication storage  and emergency cart medication inventory on one common platform.“Pharmacists are an underutilized resource in many health systems and healthcare centers  and this is largely due to the inability to extract them from the daily documentation and minutiae in the pharmacy. With a lean pharmacy team  we’re always looking for ways to streamline our processes – and ultimately their workloads ” said Michael Labadie  PharmD  Director of Pharmacy at Midwest Surgical Hospital. “By bringing in automated solutions from Wolters Kluwer  we are able to minimize our manual documentation  limit medication waste  and allow our pharmacists to become more involved in patient care needs.”Improving hospital USP complianceMidwest Surgical compounds many of its intraoperative medications on-site and  in light of the latest USP guidelines  was looking for a solution that would allow them to worry less about documentation requirements and focus on patient care. With Simplifi 797 in place  their pharmacy team now has a comprehensive view of their compounding compliance  including where they can take action to make improvements in real-time. The fully automated platform and expert guidance ensures the proper documentation is in place in case of a regulatory audit and allows for better tracking of wasted medication volumes  allowing their team to optimize compounding based on current usage levels.“Healthcare facilities are being pushed to find new efficiencies in their current processes to balance increasing regulatory scrutiny and patient care responsibilities ” said Karen Kobelski  Vice President and General Manager of Clinical Surveillance Compliance & Data Solutions  Wolters Kluwer Health. “By using our Simplifi+ suite  Dr. Labadie and his team at Midwest Surgical are creating a more agile and efficient backbone for their pharmacy  allowing them to quickly onboard new staff  focus on patient programs  or navigate a regulatory inspection with ease.”Beyond medication compounding  Simplifi+ MedTrays and Simplifi+ MedStorage enable the surgery center to more easily and efficiently manage medication stored throughout the facility. Simplifi+ MedTrays automates and standardizes emergency cart restocking to ensure accuracy and optimize the utilization of short-dated drugs. By automating inventory checklists  Simplifi+ MedStorage ensures medications stored across the facility are safe for patient use and achieve compliance standards so teams are inspection-ready.Visit Wolters Kluwer Health’s website to learn more about the Simplifi+ Pharmacy Compliance suite.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG.

The first of its gigafactories in Billy-Berclau (northern France) will be operational by the end of 2023  signaling ACC's official entry into the market. Once it achieves full capacity of 40 GWh  the Billy-Berclau site will represent one third of ACC's total production. The EV battery manufacturer then intends to increase its capacity by implementing two other Atos-powered gigafactories in Kaiserslautern (Germany) in 2025 and Termoli (Italy) in 2026.Atos' solution for ACC's managed infrastructure services is based on a mixed business model combining manufacturing capabilities  operational agility and financial competitiveness. Project governance and system expertise services will be overseen by the Atos teams in Bordeaux who are recognized for their experience in managed infrastructure services  which are delivered to major manufacturers over the world. Atos' Global Delivery Center in Poland will monitor and maintain network and infrastructure operations for this future flagship within European industry.During the tender process  with its focus on consulting and co-development  Atos prioritized open and transparent dialog with the ACC teams and demonstrated its agility in adapting to highly scalable factors  needs and volumes. All of these efforts aimed to establish and stabilize customer processes and architectures. Thanks to these practical solutions  ACC was able to assess the quality of Atos' offering and its ability to manage the EV battery manufacturer's critical development stage.""Several factors influence the proper implementation of our manufacturing processes; among them  a flawless IT infrastructure. The latter is a prerequisite for the ramp-up of the Billy-Berclau site and nominal capacity by end-2024. We selected Atos to supervise and maintain our three gigafactories in France  Germany and Italy not just for the quality of their proposal  but also their expertise in engineering strategic digital environments within infrastructure that is robust  industrialized  cost-effective and transparent"" said François Carrot  CIO  ACC.Backed by European authorities  TotalEnergies-Saft  Stellantis and Mercedes  ACC aspires to become Europe's leading manufacturer of high-capacity EV batteries that are sustainable and affordable. Three years on from its inception  ACC already operates an R&D center in Bruges  near Bordeaux  and is bolstered by a pilot plant in Nersac (southwestern France) and its first-ever gigafactory in Billy-Berclau  in the north of the country.""We are proud to support ACC as it steps up its manufacturing  as well as to contribute to the rollout of electric battery production in France by harnessing our expertise in mission-critical IT infrastructure. On behalf of Atos  I want to thank ACC for entrusting our expertise.

Excluding Estetrol  the increase was +30.4% (+30.5% at constant exchange rates)  mainly due to strong activity at the Turku and Aramon sites  as well as higher demand for R&D services. Sales also benefited from the price increases implemented during the course of 2022.Fine Specialty ChemicalsNet sales of Specialty Fine Chemicals totaled €57.3 million  a 7.2% decrease compared to 2022 (-7.7% at constant exchange rates).

Business at the Fine Specialties sites thus remains dynamic despite the difficult economic climate.OutlookThe ongoing dispute with customer Mithra has led to a temporary shutdown of activity at the workshops dedicated to Estetrol production since the second quarter of 2023. Due to this reduction in activity  the PCAS Board meeting of September 6  2023 decided to launch a project to reorganize the site in order to increase its versatility and reposition it on a flexible activity of contract production of pharmaceutical active ingredients and intermediates  in order to ensure its long-term perspectives. This reorganization and repositioning project requires the launch of a job protection plan (Plan de Sauvegarde de l’Emploi) which is currently under review as part of an information-consultation procedure with employee representative bodies.As indicated in the press releases of March 30  April 24  July 27 and September 6  2023  the return to positive results previously announced for 2023 has been postponed.The PCAS Group continues to benefit from the support of its majority shareholder Seqens for the financing of its activities and development. Seqens has initiated a simplified takeover bid (followed by a squeeze-out if the conditions are met) and holds to date  directly  83.66% of the capital and 90.66% of the voting rights and  after taking into account the treasury shares that will be tendered to the offer  92.91% of the capital and 95.91% of the voting rights.Proposed simplified tender offer for PCAS shares and proposed capital increaseAs a reminder  these projects were the subject of specific press releases on September 6 and October 12  2023.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:2023 Net sales – February 7  2024ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies.

Since 2016  the NYSE has grown 35.1% while the Nasdaq has ballooned 189.3% in market cap.The vast majority of companies in the S&P 500 Index  often seen as a barometer for U.S. stock market performance  are traded on these exchanges.With $7.2 trillion in market cap  Euronext is the world’s third-largest exchange. Since Brexit  the pan-European exchange has attracted more capital and by early 2021  it outranked the London Stock Exchange. Over the last two decades  London’s stock market has fallen from 13% to 4% of the global share.Ranking fourth is the Shanghai Stock Exchange  at $6.7 trillion in market cap. Beverage giant Kweichow Moutai  ICBC  and PetroChina are the largest companies traded on the exchange.Like China  as India’s economy has continued to expand  so has its primary stock market. As the twelfth-largest globally  it’s worth $3.5 trillion in market cap  growing over 133% in market value since 2016.Should You Invest Internationally?While U.S. stock markets are unmatched in scale in the global arena  investors may look to diversify exposure across the pond.In fact  by 2050  Goldman Sachs projects that emerging markets’ share of global stock market capitalization will surpass America. Given the strong economic growth of emerging markets  investors may find opportunities in broad market indexes that track these countries through investment vehicles like ETFs or mutual funds.Yet while international markets may provide opportunities for diversification  they may also present risk given political  regulatory  and economic factors.TOPICS:Business/EconomySocietyKEYWORDS:stockexchangestockmarketClick here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic  LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno  CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Details of (estimated) amortization and earn-out expenses (PPA expenses) relating to the 2022 acquisitions of LPE and Reno are found in Annex 2.Comment“ASM delivered robust results amidst continued soft market conditions ” said Benjamin Loh  President and CEO of ASM. “Revenue increased 9% at constant currencies compared to prior year to €622 million  which is at the top end of our previous guidance of €580-620 million. The gross margin was again relatively strong at around 49% in Q3  with a positive mix including again significantly higher contribution from the Chinese market. Slightly higher revenue and gross margin was offset by further increases in R&D investments resulting in an operating margin of 25.3% in Q3. For FY 2023 we expect an operating margin of at least 26%  somewhat better than the previous forecast of 26% or slightly lower.Orders came in at €627 million in Q3  about flat compared to last year (at constant currencies)  and up compared to the lower level in Q2 2023  despite the generally weaker market conditions. Against the backdrop of continued economic pressure and geopolitical tensions  large parts of the semiconductor end markets are still sluggish and the timing and strength of recovery is still uncertain. As a consequence  demand from our customers in the leading-edge logic/foundry segment remains relatively soft  and this also includes the earlier reported push outs due to delays in fab readiness. On the positive side  leading logic/foundry customers remain committed to transition to the next node which will be based on gate-all-around (GAA) technology. As previously communicated  we expect the first meaningful GAA orders in Q4 2023  of which part has now already been booked in Q3. Despite some advanced-technology investments in the DRAM segment  overall demand in memory is still low and not expected to recover in the near term. The power/analog market so far held up well but is now also showing signs of slowdown  including in the automotive and industrial segments. Traction in SiC Epi remains solid and we still expect revenues in excess of €130 million for this business this year.An important event during the quarter was our Investor Day 2023. Despite the current market weakness  we increased our revenue target for 2025 to €3.0-€3.6 billion1  assuming recovery of the WFE market. We also issued new guidance for 2027  including further revenue growth to €4.0-5.0 billion1  as we continue to execute our Growth through Innovation strategy. We also shared that we expect the ALD market to remain among the fastest growing segments with a CAGR of 10%-14% for the period 2022-2027  while in Si Epi we continue to target market share increases. In addition  with SiC Epi we have added a rapidly growing and highly synergistic product line. We are well placed to support our leading logic/foundry customers in the upcoming transition to gate-all-around (GAA)  which we expect to increase ASM’s served available market (SAM) by an estimated US$400 million per 100k wafer starts per month.During the Investor Day we also highlighted actions taken with respect to our commitment to sustainability  such as the recent SBTi verification of our Net Zero 2035 targets  and initiatives to increase the energy efficiency of our products in close collaborations with customers and suppliers.”OutlookOn a currency-comparable level  we project revenue of €600-640 million for Q4 2023. Our forecasts for the second half and the full year 2023 are largely unchanged. At constant currencies and taking into account the guidance for Q4  we expect revenue in the second half to drop by approximately 10% compared to the first half of the year  and for FY 2023  we expect revenue to show a year-on-year increase of close to 10%  including the consolidation of LPE.On October 17  2023  the US issued new export control measures. Based on our preliminary assessment  we do not expect any material additional impact  relative to what we previously communicated.Wafer fab equipment (WFE) is now expected to drop by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage in 2023. Memory WFE is still expected to show the sharpest drop. Compared to memory  leading-edge logic/foundry is relatively resilient but also impacted by the weaker market conditions. The mature node markets are expected to be up this year  although  as mentioned  power/analog is showing signs of slowdown. We continue to expect to outperform the WFE market this year.Share buyback programOn September 19  2023  ASM completed the €100 million share buyback program that was started on April 27  2023. In total  we repurchased 264 503 shares at an average price of €378.07  under the 2023 program.ASM Investor Day 2023On September 26  2023  ASM held its Investor Day  where ASM’s management provided an update on our business and financials  and discussed how new technology developments will drive expected market expansion  new growth opportunities and initiatives to improve sustainability. Highlights included:Revenue target for 2025 increased to €3.0-€3.6 billion 2   up from the previous 2021 Investor Day target of €2.8-€3.4 billion. Further growth in revenue to €4.0-€5.0 billion by 2027 (2022-2027 CAGR of 11%-16%).  up from the previous 2021 Investor Day target of €2.8-€3.4 billion. Further growth in revenue to €4.0-€5.0 billion by 2027 (2022-2027 CAGR of 11%-16%). Gross margin of 46%-50% and operating margin of 26%-31% reiterated for 2023-2025  and also targeted for 2026-2027 3   with upward trend in operating margin expected in outer years.  with upward trend in operating margin expected in outer years. Annual capex of €100-€180 million (in 2024-2027)  to support growth.Single-wafer ALD market forecast of $3.1-$3.7 billion by 2025 repeated  up from $2.6 billion in 2022; with further expected growth to $4.2-$5.0 billion by 2027  with a continued leading targeted market share of >55%.Si Epi market 2025 forecast increased to $1.9-$2.3 billion  compared to market size of $2.0 billion in 2022  with further growth to $2.3-$2.9 billion in 2027.

It is a chronic condition for most patients  with approximately 60 to 80% of the symptoms of ADHD persisting into adulthood2.Global prevalence of ADHD has increased significantly in recent years3  leading to an increased usage of ADHD therapies such as the well-established medication atomoxetine. In 2022  the Canadian market amounted to 17 million capsules (CAGR of 7 4% in the period 2020-2022)4 of atomoxetine.Atomoxetine is currently not available as an oral liquid formulation in Canada. Considering the added value  significant market share penetration was often observed in countries when an oral liquid became available in this drug category5.Kye Pharmaceuticals is targeting a regulatory submission in 2024  and will be the exclusive partner for commercialization in Canada. The territorial expansion for atomoxetine oral liquid should not result in additional product-related investments for Hyloris.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: “We are proudly partnering with this local champion focused on commercializing therapies within pediatrics and neurosciences. Partnering atomoxetine oral liquid outside of the U.S. underlines our capability to bring innovative treatments to patients on a global scale  and unlock the hidden value in our existing pipeline of reformulated and repurposed product candidates.”John McKendry  President of Kye  commented: “Many Canadians with ADHD are unable to take solid tablets as prescribed  and alternative formulations which have been available internationally are not readily available in the Canadian market. This partnership expands our growing portfolio of innovative ADHD treatments and will ensure Canadian patients have access to a liquid formulation of atomoxetine  a well-established non-stimulant medication.”Under the terms of the agreement  Hyloris will be eligible to receive attractive sales-related milestone payments (totalling up to USD 7 5 million)  and a substantial share of the revenue generated in Canada.About Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)ADHD is a chronic mental childhood-onset disorder characterized by developmentally inappropriate and impaired inattention  motor hyperactivity  and impulsivity  with difficulties often continuing into adulthood. Children and adolescents suffering from ADHD experience challenging key formative years. Because of impulsive behaviour and slower rates of processing information  they perform poorly on standardized tests  score lower grades and are more likely to drop out of school.About Atomoxetine oral liquidAtomoxetine is a non-stimulant prescription medication used to treat ADHD symptoms in adults and children over the age of 6. For patients up to 70kg body weight  administration of Atomoxetine is initiated as a total daily dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day up to a target total daily dose of approximately 1.2 mg/kg either as a single daily dose or as evenly divided doses.An easy-to-swallow oral liquid formulation of atomoxetine could facilitate accurate dosing through titration. In addition  it could offer improved patient compliance and convenience  particularly in patients with dysphagia (who have difficulty swallowing capsules).Due to the pediatric use for this product candidate  Hyloris deployed an innovative taste masking strategy targeting a preferred taste for young patients.For the U.S. market  a pivotal clinical study is in preparation as previously announced.About HylorisHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors. Hyloris has built a broad  patented portfolio of 16 reformulated and repurposed value-added medicines that have the potential to offer significant advantages over available alternatives. Outside of its core strategic focus  the Company also has 3 high barrier generic products in development.Two products are currently in initial phases of commercialization with partners: Sotalol IV for the treatment of atrial fibrillation  and Maxigesic® IV  a non-opioid post-operative pain treatment. The Company’s development strategy primarily focuses on the FDA’s 505(b)2 regulatory pathway  which is specifically designed for pharmaceuticals for which safety and efficacy of the molecule have already been established. This pathway can reduce the clinical burden required to bring a product to market  and significantly shorten the development timelines and reduce costs and risks. Hyloris is based in Liège  Belgium.

Th…,"Press releaseParis  October 24  2023 at 18h.Exail Technologies generated €65 million in revenue in the third quarter 2023  up +14% compared to the third quarter 2022 at equivalent scope and +130% compared to published Q3 2022. The quarter was marked by sustained commercial activity  with the progress of certain significant calls for tenders and an increase in order intake of +20%  driven in particular by sales of navigation systems.As a reminder  Exail Technologies now presents its revenue divided into two complementary and vertically integrated business segments:The Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment includes the group's two main activities  vertically integrated: the sale of navigation systems  positioning systems  and sonars; and the commercialization of drones and autonomous drone systems for maritime applications  integrating the group's navigation systems and other equipment in order to offer the most effective robotic solutions.This segment accounts for approximately 75% of the Group's revenues and 90% of its backlog.The Advanced Technologies segment consists of developing and selling the highest-performance photonic and quantum components (specialty optical fibers  optical modulators  quantum measurement instruments) and products using the most advanced technologies (on-board communication equipment  simulators  autonomous decision-making). These components and products are sold directly to third parties or integrated into the systems of the Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment.This segment represents approximately 25% of the group's revenues and 10% of its backlog.Revenue by segment 2023 and 2022 at equivalent scope[1](€ million)Q32023Q32022at equivalent scopeVar.%9 months 20239 months 2022at equivalent scopeVar.% Consolidated revenue 64 7 56 6 +14% 218 4 191 5 +14% Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment 49 3 42 4 +16% 165 8 147 1 +13% Advanced Technologies segment 17 9 15 2 +18% 59 2 47 4 +25% Structure & intra-Group eliminations -2 5 -1 0 - -6 6 -3 0 - Backlog at the end of the period 610 n.a - 610 n.a -Revenues 2023 and 2022 published(€ million)Q32023Q32022 publishedVar.%9 months 20239 months 2022 publishedVar.% Consolidated revenue 64 7 28 2 +130% 218 4 91 1 +140%Sustained commercial activityThe Group's commercial momentum remained intense in the 3rd quarter  in the two main areas comprising the calls for tenders and the sales of products  equipment and components.Exail Technologies has made several significant advances in calls for tenders for large-scale mine-hunting and survey systems  particularly in the Australian process (link to the dedicated press release). The commercial momentum has thus produced two notable effects since the beginning of the year: on the one hand  the increase in our chances of winning the current tenders and on the other hand  the opening of significant new opportunities in several regions of the world.These tangible advances are yet to be reflected in the published figures. As a result  new orders for systems were low this quarter  in contrast to sales of individual drones  products and components. Order intake is up +20% in the third quarter of 2023  amounting to €60 million.Orders for single drones are up this quarter. Among the notable successes  the group won a new order for DriX  the surface drone dedicated to surveying. The client  a prestigious player in hydrography  already operates multiple DriX and is a pioneer in multi-drone operations for hydrography.The most dynamic activity was in navigation and positioning systems  which accounted for almost half of orders in the quarter. Several significant orders are supporting the increase in volumes  both in the civil and defense sectors. More details are available in the dedicated press releases: A record order for a hundred inertial measurement units in the civil sector and Towards a record year with four new major orders for nearly €10 million.Finally  orders for components and products in the Advanced Technologies division have continued to grow steadily since the beginning of the year. Demand remains structurally strong in these cutting-edge businesses and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years.Since the beginning of the year  order intake amounts to nearly €200 million  i.e. +10% compared to the first nine months of 2022. This is a decent progression given the timing of the major calls for tenders  but relatively disappointing in view of the group's significant ambitions. Exail Technologies intends to significantly improve this level over the next semesters.+14% revenue growth in the third quarter 2023Navigation & Maritime Robotics: +16% growthThe increase in revenues in this segment unsurprisingly reflects the impact of commercial activity in previous quarters and the ramp-up of underwater mine countermeasures programs  including the BENL program. The latter  which accounts for around 20% of the group's revenues  is continuing its good progress with major technical milestones scheduled for the end of 2023. A notable step was reached at the beginning of October with the delivery of the SeapiX FLS (obstacle avoidance sonars) on the 1st mine-hunting vessel under construction.Growth was also driven by the acceleration of shipments of navigation systems  in order to deliver the ever-increasing order book for this activity. The third quarter has already seen a notable increase of nearly 20% and the fourth quarter is expected to see a strong acceleration with significant production challenges.Advanced Technologies: structural strong demandDeliveries in this segment increased this quarter  both for internal needs and for external customers. The drivers of this segment remain largely the same this quarter as they have been year-to-date: the aerospace industry  telecommunications  and manufacturers and users of advanced lasers  such as quantum applications.PerspectivesOne year after the acquisition of iXblue  Exail Technologies is on a sustained growth trajectory. The group is heading for a record year for its navigation systems  photonic components and is actively working on a growing number of opportunities in maritime robotics. The advancement of the tender in Australia  in which Exail has been selected for the final stages  is an important milestone. This opportunity  representing several hundred million euros  could see further advances in the coming months. The company will provide information to the market to the extent possible given the important confidentiality clauses on this tender.Exail Technologies thus achieved a good third quarter of 2023 on the back of intense commercial activity. The Group confirms its 2023 target of revenue growth of more than 15% compared to 2022 equivalent scope revenue. The fourth quarter will be the most important in terms of orders  deliveries and technical milestones  with significant production challenges given the volumes of products to be delivered.About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is the new name of the Gorgé Group  adopted after the transformation of the group at the end of 2022  now focused on the activities of its subsidiary Exail.

Photo: GettyA second investment firm has decided to close down funds that invest in companies that are quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange.It is in response to a slew of departures from the Dublin market.Irish Life is to shut 52 different funds that invest in stocks listed on the Irish Stock Exchange  known as Euronext Dublin. There are two underlying funds  but 52 different versions of them for pension customers and investors.Among the Irish Life funds closing are Irish Equity  Canada Life/Setanta Irish Equity  Celtic Fund  Exempt Irish Equity  Indexed Ireland Fund  and Celtic Scope.Investors will be automatically switched into other funds unless they specify one they want to move to  Irish Life said.It comes weeks after investment company Zurich said it is to close its Irish equity fund in response to a number of big companies departing from the exchange.The Euronext Dublin exchange took a hit when building materials giant CRH delisted from it last month.It was previously the largest company on the exchange. It is moving its primary listing from London to New York.Another heavyweight  Smurfit Kappa  said earlier this month that it also plans to quit the Irish exchange for New York as part of a merger with a US peer.Earlier this year drinks giant and Guinness owner Diageo delisted from the Irish Stock Exchange.Paddy Power-owner Flutter Entertainment is expected to leave the Irish market soon after it decided earlier this year to take out a listing in the US.Broker Liam Ferguson  of Tullamore-based Ferga.com  said the closures reinforce the point that the Irish stock market has become too small to be considered a viable part of any diversified investment portfolio  since the departure of some of its biggest names like Diageo  CRH and Flutter.“Anyone investing solely in Dublin-listed shares is exposing themselves to concentration risk and consequent potential for volatility.“Most investors should diversify across geographical regions and industry sectors and Irish-listed shares should only be a part of a wider portfolio ” Mr Ferguson said.In a note to brokers  Irish Life said it regularly reviews its funds offering  removing or adding funds after carrying out this exercise.“Following our most recent review we have decided to close our Irish equity funds. These funds are invested in stocks listed on the Irish Stock Exchange known  as Euronext Dublin.“We have made the decision to close the funds because the number of companies on the exchange has decreased  which increases concentration risk and the potential for volatility for investors in the funds ” the note to brokers said.It said the Irish equity funds will close later this year.The funds will close to new business  switches-in and top-ups on November 20 next.Regular premiums will continue to be invested in the funds  and switches-out and withdrawals from the funds are permitted until the funds close.The investment company said the Irish equity funds will automatically switch to another fund and this will be based on fund availability. Where possible  the risk rating of the new fund will be in line with that of the closing fund  Irish Life said.A spokesman for Irish Life said it had no comment beyond what was in the note sent to brokers.Earlier this month Zurich said it will close a fund that invests in stocks listed on the Irish stock exchange.Zurich told brokers: “As the number and size of stocks listed on the exchange has reduced  the fund is becoming more concentrated as a result. For that reason  Zurich have taken the decision to close the fund.”It will close early next year.Zurich said it will no longer accept single premiums or switches into the fund.,neutral,0.11,0.88,0.01,neutral,0.03,0.86,0.11,True,English,"['Dublin stock market', 'Irish Life', '52 funds', 'Paddy Power-owner Flutter Entertainment', 'building materials giant CRH', 'The Euronext Dublin exchange', 'Tullamore-based Ferga.com', 'second investment firm', 'Broker Liam Ferguson', 'Setanta Irish Equity', 'Exempt Irish Equity', 'Guinness owner Diageo', 'diversified investment portfolio', 'Irish stock market', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'Indexed Ireland Fund', 'two underlying funds', 'Irish equity fund', 'Irish Life funds', 'drinks giant', 'Irish market', 'Irish exchange', 'Dublin market', 'investment company', 'wider portfolio', 'Mr Ferguson', 'Celtic Scope', '52 different versions', 'pension customers', 'largest company', 'New York', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'biggest names', 'Dublin-listed shares', 'concentration risk', 'geographical regions', 'industry sectors', 'Irish-listed shares', 'recent review', 'new business', 'Regular premiums', 'risk rating', 'single premiums', 'Celtic Fund', 'fund availability', 'new fund', 'closing fund', '52 different funds', 'other funds', 'primary listing', 'US peer', 'consequent potential', 'big companies', 'Most investors', 'Photo', 'Getty', 'response', 'slew', 'departures', 'stocks', 'Zurich', 'number', 'hit', 'London', 'heavyweight', 'merger', 'point', 'Anyone', 'volatility', 'note', 'brokers', 'exercise', 'decision', 'top', 'ups', 'November', 'withdrawals', 'line', 'spokesman', 'comment', 'size', 'result', 'reason']",2023-10-24,2023-10-25,independent.ie

The difficulties encountered are both technical and linked to changing market conditions  with the unpredictable drop in a few years in the quantities of waste from the Port of Marseille's oil terminal and the rising prices of available alternative waste sources.In this context  TERF has made an offer to Ecoslops SA to buy its shares in the Ecoslops Provence joint venture  including bank debt  in order to reposition the unit in the industrial system of the La Mède platform.This offer includes the purchase of Ecoslops SA's shares and shareholder loan in Ecoslops Provence for €8.0m  payable in full at closing. This purchase is subject to the usual conditions precedent and to the release by the banks (notably the EIB) of their security interests. On the basis of preliminary discussions  the EIB has confirmed its support for the sale.The impact of Ecoslops Provence's expected exit from the Group's scope of consolidation has been accrued for in the interim financial statements  representing an extraordinary expense of €1.5m.Assuming that the transaction closes on 31 December 2023  the Group's gross debt would fall from €29.4m at 30 June 2023 to €20.5m. Free cash flow would fall from €4.7m at 30 June 2023 to €10.5m  meaning that net debt would fall from €24.7m to €10.0m at 31 December 2023.Consolidated income statement for the six months ended 30 June 2023 (in k€) - Analytical** presentation(Based on unaudited financial statements)en €'000 30/06/2023 30/06/2022 Variation Refined products - Portugal 3 512 5 647 -2 135 Refined products - Provence 776 1 884 -1 108 Scarabox 266 -266 Port services 1 230 1 105 +125 Total turnover 5 518 8 902 -3 384 Gross Margin 3 305 5 538 -2 233 Gross margin rate 60% 62% Gross margin rate excl.

Provence -1 895 -105 -1 790As already communicated  Group sales in the first half of 2023 were 38% lower than in the first half of 2022. It is worth recalling the high base effect of the previous year  with an average Brent price of €96/bbl (start of the conflict in Ukraine) in the first half of 2022  compared with an average Brent price of €74/bbl in the first half of 2023  a fall of 23%.For the Sines unit in Portugal  the sales volume is 7 989 tonnes (compared with 10 395 tonnes in 2022). This decline is mainly due to the fact that the maintenance schedule was shifted by half-years between 2022 and 2023.The Marseille unit sold 2 046 tonnes (1 401 tonnes produced)  compared with 3 300 tonnes in the first half of 2022.Excluding Ecoslops Provence  the margin rate rose from 64% to 66%.In terms of structural costs  personnel costs were stable at €1.8m  while the €0.3m increase in external costs was mainly due to the operating costs of Ecoslops Provence.As a result of these factors  the Group's EBITDA fell by €2.5m  from €0.5m at 30 June 2022 to €2.0m at 30 June 2023:en €'000 30/06/2023 30/06/2022 Variation Ecoslops Portugal 967 2 359 -1 392 R&D and holding costs -1 274 -1 199 -75 Perimeter excl.

The change in cash and cash equivalents can be analysed as follows:en €'000 30/06/2023 EBITDA (1 972) Investment subsidy recognition (63) Operating working capital variance 1 516 Operating cashflow (519) Capital expenditure (312) Investing cashflow (312) Ecoslops Provence SHL (TotalEnergies) 250 Capital increase - Loans variance (568) Interests (196) Financing cashflow (514) Cash variance (1 345) Opening cash balance 6 870 Closing cash balance 5 525 Variance (1 345)Operating cash flow was €0.5m. Ecoslops Provence's negative EBITDA (€1.7m) was financed by a change in working capital of the same amount (€0.8m in trade receivables and €0.9m in trade payables).Cash flow from investment amounted to €0.3m  and comprised maintenance capex customary in the Group's business.Lastly  financing-related transactions resulted in a net cash outflow of €0.5m  including a €0.3m contribution of a TotalEnergies shareholder loan to Ecoslops Provence  and €0.6m of net loan repayments (€0.5m of repayments on Ecoslops Provence and Ecoslops Portugal  which refinanced its debt to the tune of €1m). Interest paid mainly concerns Ecoslops Portugal. In view of ongoing discussions with the EIB  the company's ad hoc trustee obtained a suspension of payment of the 30 June 2023 instalment  which comprised €0.5m in principal repayments and €1.4m in interest.Outlook and developmentsWith a restructured balance sheet in line with its financial capabilities  the Group will be able to concentrate on its two strategic assets  Ecoslops Portugal and Scarabox.The Group will therefore continue its efforts to develop and optimise its Sines unit. In particular  it will be working with local stakeholders (port authorities  oil terminal and GALP) to renew the sub-concession in the port of Sines  which expires in mid-2027 (end of the 15-year period). The Group is maintaining its full-year production target at 20 000/22 000 tons.The Scarabox business remains an essential pillar of the Group's development  as it requires little capital and generates good margins. This market is growing  especially in emerging countries where environmental issues are becoming a priority. The Group is actively working on a contract in Côte d'Ivoire  as part of its partnership with the Parlym Group.An analyst and investor web conference will be held on Tuesday 24 October 2023 at 11am.

Year-to-date adjusted organic growth amounted to +18.1%.Q3 2023 HighlightsHealthy paid streaming growth continued. Revenue was  however  negatively impacted by the accelerated strengthening of the euro combined with soft ad-funded streaming monetization in certain geographies (Europe and Asia).Sustained improvement in profitability trends leading the Group to expect Adjusted EBITDA margin to be above 5.5% (c. 5.5% previously anticipated).The Group continued to drive additional market share gain across all markets and in a wider variety of music genres.Confirmed commitment to Shaping Music for Good through continued investment in education and training.2023 OutlookIn Q4’23  Believe anticipates a higher growth rate driven by a solid increase in paid streaming revenues due to positive impact of price increases  additional market share gains and slight recovery in ad-funded streaming by the end of the quarter. The Group also foresees lower but persistent currency headwinds.Advances are expected to be lower in H2’23 and the Group confirms its expectations of a positive free cash flow for H2’23.Consequently  Believe confirms its FY’23 outlook: Organic growth c. +14%. Sustained improvement in Adjusted EBITDA margin which is now anticipated to be at least 5.5% (versus c. 5.5% anticipated previously). Negative free cash flow.Denis Ladegaillerie  Founder and CEO said: “Q3’23 has been a challenging quarter  but we kept delivering a top-notch service to our artists and labels  enabling artists at various stage of their career to reach the top of the charts and labels to outperform their local market. During the quarter  we also furthered our discussions with our top digital partners to boost Believe’s roster. Our actions remained geared to further improve the quality of service that we offer.”Q3 2023 AND YEAR-TO-DATE KEY FIGURESin € million Q3 2022 Q3 2023 Change YoY Organic change2 Group Revenues 197.0 215.0 +9.1% +7.5% Premium Solutions 184.4 202.9 +10.1% +7.9% Automated Solutions 12.6 12.1 -4.5% +0.6% in € million 9M 2022 9M 2023 Change YoY Organicchange Group Revenues 549.2 630.4 +14.8% +13.9% Premium Solutions 513.6 591.4 +15.2% +14.4% Automated Solutions 35.6 39.0 +9.4% +6.2%Q3 2023 HIGHLIGHTSRevenue growth affected by challenging market conditions in line with Group’s expectationsIn Q3’23  Believe continued growing despite challenging market conditions  which affected the overall digital monetization of the Group.Paid streaming trends were solid. The Group expects them to continue in Q4’23 and to benefit in addition from price increases at some large digital platforms.Ad-funded streaming monetization remained soft notably in Europe and Asia Pacific / Africa. This situation was anticipated by the Group  which expects ad-funded monetization to start rebuilding in Q4’23.The strengthening of the euro accelerated over the quarter in line with the Group’s anticipations. Subscriptions and ad-funded streaming are collected in local currencies by digital service providers  which reversed those royalties to the Group mostly in euros. Given Believe’s geographical footprint  the exposure to non-euro digital markets amounts to c. 70%  which leads the Group to capture significant currency translation effects in its digital monetization. Digital sales adjusted for estimated embedded market forex were up +16.8%  leading to an adjusted organic growth up +15.4%.Reinforced appeal in a wider variety of music genres enabling additional market share gains in Q3’23Believe recorded another quarter of market share gains. The Group has now deployed its full offering in 15 markets and succeeded in establishing its Artist Services offer as a reference for digital artists in those countries.The Group further advanced its ability to develop artists to the very top of the market  as illustrated by the success of Jey Brownie (rap – France) or Das Lumpenpack (rock – Germany)  the entry in the 5 Spotify Global charts of Nadhif Basalamah (pop - Indonesia) or the rise of Here at last (pop - UK)  among others. Believe also enjoyed great performances in the Latin music space with the success of emerging Spanish artist Iñigo Quintero and his song “Si no estás”  which is ranking #1 as of today on Spotify’s Top 50 Global Charts and currently top charting across global markets. The new album “El Comienzo” of the established Regional Mexican Grupo Frontera released early August is also ranking as of today #14 global album on Spotify Charts and #37 global album on Apple Music. The band is one of the nominees for the Best Song of the Year and Best Regional Mexican Song at the 2023 Latin Grammy Awards  bringing to 6 the number of Believe’s nominees at the Awards (taking place on November 16  2023).Further building one of the leading music companies in Asia and strengthening its appeal to local actsThe Group further invested in Asia by building additional capabilities in Greater China or launching Premium Solutions in Japan in a context of increased digitalization of music genres locally. The Group was until now mainly present through its subsidiary TuneCore.Believe also celebrated its first decade of presence in India where it has become one of the largest players in the local music industry. With less than 0.5%3 paid streaming penetration  India offers a significant growth opportunity. The Group has been focused on building a strong local team presence with carefully tailored service offerings best adapted to India’s unique artist market. Believe has become a leading player in several market segments  including Punjabi  Bhojpuri  Haryanvi among others. Top local talents such as Punjabi Pop artists Arjan Dhillon and Chani Nattan  as well as Maharashtra’s MC Stan who cumulated +1 billion views on YouTube for his song “Insaan”  and duo Cheema Y & Gur Sidhu who reached +22 million streams on Spotify for the track “California Love”. Overall  in India  artists served directly or through their labels have generated close to 1.9 trillion streams over the past 10 years and Believe has been contributing to shape a new music market by paying out significant royalties to an ever growing number of artists and labels.Focus on artist development driving innovation and collaboration with digital partnersThe quality of service remains a top priority for Believe to allow each artist to strive in the digital world  at each stage of their career. During the quarter  the Group developed and is now deploying AI Guesser  a proprietary tool to detect music generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI).The Group has also been actively engaged in working with digital partners to deploy a new streaming model aimed at lowering streaming fraud and white noise. Believe expects to benefit both in terms of market share and revenue from these initiatives. Believe further expects to benefit from the deployment of new commercial models aiming at establishing a fair  balanced  and diverse market.Confirming commitment to education and equality in the music industry to further Shape Music for GoodAs part of its Corporate Social Responsibility strategy Shaping Music for Good  Believe is committed to support local communities and young talents  offering its expertise in the music industry  and accompanying them through educational and mentorship programs. This is particularly the case in the US where Believe partners with KeyChange  in India through its BEAMS program4  and in France where Believe participated in mock interviews with about twenty young job seekers  supporting the League of Young Talents during a Sport and Employment bootcamp. Believe is also a partner of the AdaTech school  which aims to train the new generation of tech talents  encouraging women to join the industry and supporting career transitions.On the occasion of its solidarity month ‘Shaping Together’ in October  Believe mobilized nearly 50% of its teams worldwide to participate in activities that support the four priorities of Shaping Music for Good: Gender Equality  Diversity & Inclusion  Well-being and Talent Development  as well as Planet.Q3 2023 FINANCIALSOrganic revenue growth would have been up c. +15% restated from currency headwindsQ3’23 revenue grew by +9.1% to reach €215.0 million  reflecting organic growth of +7.5%  a positive perimeter effect related to the acquisition of Sentric (publishing) of +2.1% and a positive hyperinflation effect. These positive impacts were mitigated by a negative forex effect (-1.3%) mostly related to the Turkish lira devaluation and to the dollar weakening versus the euro which affected TuneCore revenue. Revenue was also strongly affected by currency headwinds in Q3’23. As described previously  the Group’s organic growth captures currency translation effects directly embedded in the royalties that Believe receives from its digital partners. With the accelerated strengthening of the euro during the period  currency translation generated a dragging effect estimated at -8.0% on organic growth  which would have amounted to +15.4% restated from this impact.In Q3’23  paid streaming remained strong even though it was not yet impacted by the price increases of digital stores due their deployment calendar in some markets. The absence of ad-funded streaming recovery in emerging markets and currency headwinds related to the appreciation of the euro resulted in digital sales up +7.1% during the quarter. Believe continued to increase its digital market share  albeit at a slightly slower pace than last quarters. Non digital sales were up strongly in Premium Solutions driven by live music activities in France  as well as branding and other activities in Turkey where revenue was uplifted by the hyperinflation effect.Believe kept growing since January with revenues up +14.8% year-to-date mostly reflecting a +13.9% organic growth for the period closing at the end of September. The change in perimeter driven by the integration of Sentric amounted to €11.7 million (or 2.1% to revenue growth year-to-date)  but this contribution was compensated by a negative forex impact mostly related to the Turkish lira and the dollar weakening versus the euro which affected TuneCore revenue. Year-to-date digital sales adjusted for estimated embedded market forex amounted to +19.6%  leading to an organic growth adjusted for market embedded forex of +18.1%.Premium Solutions driving organic growth  Automated Solutions impacted by challenging comparison baseIn Premium Solutions  revenues amounted to €202.9 million  up +10.1% at current rate. Currency headwinds accelerated in Q3’23 with the strengthening of the euro versus local currencies and affected digital monetization of the segment. Organic growth adjusted for estimated embedded market FX amounted to +16.5% resulting in an organic growth amounting to +7.9%. Overall  the Group continued to build market share in a market which is growing mostly due to paid streaming  as ad-funded streaming monetization remained soft notably in emerging markets. The integration of Sentric contributed about €4.2 million to revenue  adding around 2% to revenue growth in the segment.Automated Solutions revenues amounted to €12.1 million  down -4.5% year-over-year  largely due to the weakening of the dollar versus the euro of around -6%. Organic growth was stable year-over-year as TuneCore also had a challenging comparison basis. The Unlimited Pricing offer  which was introduced in July’22  attracted many new subscribers in the months following the launch. The ramp up in terms of customers acquisition is still ongoing and the average revenue per user is consequently still below compared with last year. In addition  the ‘Discovery’ plan  which is part of the Unlimited Pricing offer  increased TuneCore’s exposure to ad-funded streaming  which remained soft during the quarter.Strong growth in Europe excluding France and Germany but softer performance in other geographiesin € million Q3 2022 Q3 2023 Change YoY Europe (excl.

The level of activity in Brazil and Mexico remained very strong in Q3’23  illustrating solid success in the Latin music space. TuneCore was impacted by an unfavorable comparison as revenues significantly increased in Q3’22 after the introduction of the Unlimited Pricing offer in July’22 and by the weakening of the dollar versus the euro.In Q3’23  revenue growth reached +6.6% in Asia Pacific and Africa  which represented 25.9% of Group revenues. Believe further benefited from paid streaming penetration increase and consolidated its leading positions across the region  but ad-funded streaming revenues remained soft. Digital monetization was also affected by negative currency headwinds due to the euro strengthening versus local currencies directly embedded  affecting the overall performance. Consequently  India and Southeast Asia grew only single digit. Revenue growth remained  however  very strong in Greater China  as well as in Japan where the Group expanded its presence by deploying its Premium offering.In France  revenues were slightly up in Q3’23 and represented 16.0% of Group revenues. Commercial dynamics remained solid throughout the quarter despite the lower growth rate. The comparison base was challenging as the Group grew by more than 40% in Q3’22. Over the past years  the Group has built a strong position in its domestic market and is now established among the top 3 players for local acts. This strong presence also resulted in higher live music activities during the quarter  which will be even higher in Q4 given the current pipeline. The Group also managed to re-sign numerous key acts in long-term deals both for catalogues and new releases.In Germany  revenues were down -6.4% in Q3’23 and represented 12.5% of Group revenues. Digital sales remained less dynamic during the quarter in line with the end of Q2’23  but the Group continued diversifying the roster in terms of music genres. The pursuit of the roll-out of Madizin (Schlager genre) resulted in additional promising signings. Non-digital sales were strongly down as the Group was still moving away from contracts that were too heavy in physical sales and merchandising.FY 2023 OUTLOOK AND MID-TERM OBJECTIVESBelieve grew organically by c. +14% year-to-date  reflecting a strong start to the year followed by a deceleration of the growth rate in Q2’23 and even more in Q3’23  which combined no recovery in ad-funded monetization and a peak in currency headwinds affecting its digital monetization. The Group anticipates organic growth rate to recover in Q4’23 thanks to solid paid streaming trends enhanced by price increases by some large digital partners  a slight recovery in ad-funded streaming expected at the end of the quarter and additional market share gains. Currency headwinds are expected to remain persistent but to lose in intensity. Consequently  Believe confirmed its FY’23 organic growth outlook  which has been revised around +14% as announced on H1’23 earnings release early August.Believe kept investing in the Central Platform in Q3’23 at the same controlled level as in H1’23 and will continue to manage similarly until year end  further driving improved amortization of associated costs over revenues. The Group maintained its focus on improving efficiency across the organization throughout the last quarter. Consequently  Believe further improved profitability and is now expecting an Adjusted EBITDA margin above 5.5% in FY’23 (versus c. 5.5% anticipated previously as announced in H1’23 release).As anticipated  the Group’s track record and quality of service further attracted top artists and Tier-1 labels in a wider variety of music genres and in more geographies in Q3’23  leading to a solid level of new signings and additional advances. There was however a deceleration compared to the peak reached in Q2’23 as anticipated. Believe therefore confirms its expectations of a positive free cash flow in H2’23. but free cash flow will remain negative on a full year basis.In an uncertain environment the Group is actively managing its investments policy  between new hirings  new advances and M&A. As announced in H1’23  the Group has allocated more capital to label advances because of their high returns versus M&A opportunities. After the acquisition of Sentric in March’23  which is now expected to add around 2% of revenue growth on a full year basis with a neutral impact on Adjusted EBITDA margin after accounting for integration costs  the Group identifies interesting acquisition targets but remains highly selective. Acquisitions investments will therefore slowdown in H2’23.Notwithstanding the current environment  the Group is on track to deliver on its medium-term trajectory communicated at the IPO  including a 2021-2025 CAGR of between +22% and +25% and a Group Adjusted EBITDA of 5%-7% by 2025  implying a segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%-16% (which is a ""high growth period"" margin  as the revenue growth is partially reinvested). Believe reiterates its confidence in its ability to achieve its long-term target of at least 15% Group Adjusted EBITDA margin.Webcast:We will host a webcast https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/bsgibgnn and conference call starting at 6:30 p.m. CET (5:30 p.m. GMT) today.

The Group expects them to continue in Q4’23 and to benefit in addition from price increases at some large digital platforms.Ad-funded streaming monetization remained soft notably in Europe and Asia Pacific / Africa. This situation was anticipated by the Group  which expects ad-funded monetization to start rebuilding in Q4’23.The strengthening of the euro accelerated over the quarter in line with the Group’s anticipations. Subscriptions and ad-funded streaming are collected in local currencies by digital service providers  which reversed those royalties to the Group mostly in euros. Given Believe’s geographical footprint  the exposure to non-euro digital markets amounts to c. 70%  which leads the Group to capture significant currency translation effects in its digital monetization. Digital sales adjusted for estimated embedded market forex were up +16.8%  leading to an adjusted organic growth up +15.4%.Reinforced appeal in a wider variety of music genres enabling additional market share gains in Q3’23Believe recorded another quarter of market share gains. The Group has now deployed its full offering in 15 markets and succeeded in establishing its Artist Services offer as a reference for digital artists in those countries.The Group further advanced its ability to develop artists to the very top of the market  as illustrated by the success of Jey Brownie (rap – France) or Das Lumpenpack (rock – Germany)  the entry in the 5 Spotify Global charts of Nadhif Basalamah (pop - Indonesia) or the rise of Here at last (pop - UK)  among others. Believe also enjoyed great performances in the Latin music space with the success of emerging Spanish artist Iñigo Quintero and his song “Si no estás”  which is ranking #1 as of today on Spotify’s Top 50 Global Charts and currently top charting across global markets. The new album “El Comienzo” of the established Regional Mexican Grupo Frontera released early August is also ranking as of today #14 global album on Spotify Charts and #37 global album on Apple Music. The band is one of the nominees for the Best Song of the Year and Best Regional Mexican Song at the 2023 Latin Grammy Awards  bringing to 6 the number of Believe’s nominees at the Awards (taking place on November 16  2023).Further building one of the leading music companies in Asia and strengthening its appeal to local actsThe Group further invested in Asia by building additional capabilities in Greater China or launching Premium Solutions in Japan in a context of increased digitalization of music genres locally. The Group was until now mainly present through its subsidiary TuneCore.Believe also celebrated its first decade of presence in India where it has become one of the largest players in the local music industry. With less than 0.5%3 paid streaming penetration  India offers a significant growth opportunity. The Group has been focused on building a strong local team presence with carefully tailored service offerings best adapted to India’s unique artist market. Believe has become a leading player in several market segments  including Punjabi  Bhojpuri  Haryanvi among others. Top local talents such as Punjabi Pop artists Arjan Dhillon and Chani Nattan  as well as Maharashtra’s MC Stan who cumulated +1 billion views on YouTube for his song “Insaan”  and duo Cheema Y & Gur Sidhu who reached +22 million streams on Spotify for the track “California Love”. Overall  in India  artists served directly or through their labels have generated close to 1.9 trillion streams over the past 10 years and Believe has been contributing to shape a new music market by paying out significant royalties to an ever growing number of artists and labels.Focus on artist development driving innovation and collaboration with digital partnersThe quality of service remains a top priority for Believe to allow each artist to strive in the digital world  at each stage of their career. During the quarter  the Group developed and is now deploying AI Guesser  a proprietary tool to detect music generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI).The Group has also been actively engaged in working with digital partners to deploy a new streaming model aimed at lowering streaming fraud and white noise. Believe expects to benefit both in terms of market share and revenue from these initiatives. Believe further expects to benefit from the deployment of new commercial models aiming at establishing a fair  balanced  and diverse market.Confirming commitment to education and equality in the music industry to further Shape Music for GoodAs part of its Corporate Social Responsibility strategy Shaping Music for Good  Believe is committed to support local communities and young talents  offering its expertise in the music industry  and accompanying them through educational and mentorship programs. This is particularly the case in the US where Believe partners with KeyChange  in India through its BEAMS program4  and in France where Believe participated in mock interviews with about twenty young job seekers  supporting the League of Young Talents during a Sport and Employment bootcamp. Believe is also a partner of the AdaTech school  which aims to train the new generation of tech talents  encouraging women to join the industry and supporting career transitions.On the occasion of its solidarity month ‘Shaping Together’ in October  Believe mobilized nearly 50% of its teams worldwide to participate in activities that support the four priorities of Shaping Music for Good: Gender Equality  Diversity & Inclusion  Well-being and Talent Development  as well as Planet.Q3 2023 FINANCIALSOrganic revenue growth would have been up c. +15% restated from currency headwindsQ3’23 revenue grew by +9.1% to reach €215.0 million  reflecting organic growth of +7.5%  a positive perimeter effect related to the acquisition of Sentric (publishing) of +2.1% and a positive hyperinflation effect. These positive impacts were mitigated by a negative forex effect (-1.3%) mostly related to the Turkish lira devaluation and to the dollar weakening versus the euro which affected TuneCore revenue. Revenue was also strongly affected by currency headwinds in Q3’23. As described previously  the Group’s organic growth captures currency translation effects directly embedded in the royalties that Believe receives from its digital partners. With the accelerated strengthening of the euro during the period  currency translation generated a dragging effect estimated at -8.0% on organic growth  which would have amounted to +15.4% restated from this impact.In Q3’23  paid streaming remained strong even though it was not yet impacted by the price increases of digital stores due their deployment calendar in some markets. The absence of ad-funded streaming recovery in emerging markets and currency headwinds related to the appreciation of the euro resulted in digital sales up +7.1% during the quarter. Believe continued to increase its digital market share  albeit at a slightly slower pace than last quarters. Non digital sales were up strongly in Premium Solutions driven by live music activities in France  as well as branding and other activities in Turkey where revenue was uplifted by the hyperinflation effect.Believe kept growing since January with revenues up +14.8% year-to-date mostly reflecting a +13.9% organic growth for the period closing at the end of September. The change in perimeter driven by the integration of Sentric amounted to €11.7 million (or 2.1% to revenue growth year-to-date)  but this contribution was compensated by a negative forex impact mostly related to the Turkish lira and the dollar weakening versus the euro which affected TuneCore revenue. Year-to-date digital sales adjusted for estimated embedded market forex amounted to +19.6%  leading to an organic growth adjusted for market embedded forex of +18.1%.Premium Solutions driving organic growth  Automated Solutions impacted by challenging comparison baseIn Premium Solutions  revenues amounted to €202.9 million  up +10.1% at current rate. Currency headwinds accelerated in Q3’23 with the strengthening of the euro versus local currencies and affected digital monetization of the segment. Organic growth adjusted for estimated embedded market FX amounted to +16.5% resulting in an organic growth amounting to +7.9%. Overall  the Group continued to build market share in a market which is growing mostly due to paid streaming  as ad-funded streaming monetization remained soft notably in emerging markets. The integration of Sentric contributed about €4.2 million to revenue  adding around 2% to revenue growth in the segment.Automated Solutions revenues amounted to €12.1 million  down -4.5% year-over-year  largely due to the weakening of the dollar versus the euro of around -6%. Organic growth was stable year-over-year as TuneCore also had a challenging comparison basis. The Unlimited Pricing offer  which was introduced in July’22  attracted many new subscribers in the months following the launch. The ramp up in terms of customers acquisition is still ongoing and the average revenue per user is consequently still below compared with last year. In addition  the ‘Discovery’ plan  which is part of the Unlimited Pricing offer  increased TuneCore’s exposure to ad-funded streaming  which remained soft during the quarter.Strong growth in Europe excluding France and Germany but softer performance in other geographiesin € million Q3 2022 Q3 2023 Change YoY Europe (excl. France & Germany) 53.1 66.9 +25.9% Americas 28.6 31.0 +8.4% Asia Pacific / Africa 52.3 55.8 +6.6% France 34.1 34.4 +0.7% Germany 28.8 27.0 -6.4% Total 197.0 215.0 +9.1%Revenue growth amounted to +25.9% in Europe (excluding France and Germany) and represented 31.1% of total revenues in Q3’23. Revenue growth was particularly sustained in Southern Europe  Eastern Europe and Turkey. In addition  the performance was enhanced by the integration of Sentric in Q3’23  which positively impacted revenue in the UK.Americas grew by +8.4% and represented 14.4% of Group revenues. The level of activity in Brazil and Mexico remained very strong in Q3’23  illustrating solid success in the Latin music space. TuneCore was impacted by an unfavorable comparison as revenues significantly increased in Q3’22 after the introduction of the Unlimited Pricing offer in July’22 and by the weakening of the dollar versus the euro.In Q3’23  revenue growth reached +6.6% in Asia Pacific and Africa  which represented 25.9% of Group revenues. Believe further benefited from paid streaming penetration increase and consolidated its leading positions across the region  but ad-funded streaming revenues remained soft. Digital monetization was also affected by negative currency headwinds due to the euro strengthening versus local currencies directly embedded  affecting the overall performance. Consequently  India and Southeast Asia grew only single digit. Revenue growth remained  however  very strong in Greater China  as well as in Japan where the Group expanded its presence by deploying its Premium offering.In France  revenues were slightly up in Q3’23 and represented 16.0% of Group revenues. Commercial dynamics remained solid throughout the quarter despite the lower growth rate. The comparison base was challenging as the Group grew by more than 40% in Q3’22. Over the past years  the Group has built a strong position in its domestic market and is now established among the top 3 players for local acts. This strong presence also resulted in higher live music activities during the quarter  which will be even higher in Q4 given the current pipeline. The Group also managed to re-sign numerous key acts in long-term deals both for catalogues and new releases.In Germany  revenues were down -6.4% in Q3’23 and represented 12.5% of Group revenues. Digital sales remained less dynamic during the quarter in line with the end of Q2’23  but the Group continued diversifying the roster in terms of music genres. The pursuit of the roll-out of Madizin (Schlager genre) resulted in additional promising signings. Non-digital sales were strongly down as the Group was still moving away from contracts that were too heavy in physical sales and merchandising.FY 2023 OUTLOOK AND MID-TERM OBJECTIVESBelieve grew organically by c. +14% year-to-date  reflecting a strong start to the year followed by a deceleration of the growth rate in Q2’23 and even more in Q3’23  which combined no recovery in ad-funded monetization and a peak in currency headwinds affecting its digital monetization. The Group anticipates organic growth rate to recover in Q4’23 thanks to solid paid streaming trends enhanced by price increases by some large digital partners  a slight recovery in ad-funded streaming expected at the end of the quarter and additional market share gains. Currency headwinds are expected to remain persistent but to lose in intensity. Consequently  Believe confirmed its FY’23 organic growth outlook  which has been revised around +14% as announced on H1’23 earnings release early August.Believe kept investing in the Central Platform in Q3’23 at the same controlled level as in H1’23 and will continue to manage similarly until year end  further driving improved amortization of associated costs over revenues. The Group maintained its focus on improving efficiency across the organization throughout the last quarter. Consequently  Believe further improved profitability and is now expecting an Adjusted EBITDA margin above 5.5% in FY’23 (versus c. 5.5% anticipated previously as announced in H1’23 release).As anticipated  the Group’s track record and quality of service further attracted top artists and Tier-1 labels in a wider variety of music genres and in more geographies in Q3’23  leading to a solid level of new signings and additional advances. There was however a deceleration compared to the peak reached in Q2’23 as anticipated. Believe therefore confirms its expectations of a positive free cash flow in H2’23. but free cash flow will remain negative on a full year basis.In an uncertain environment the Group is actively managing its investments policy  between new hirings  new advances and M&A. As announced in H1’23  the Group has allocated more capital to label advances because of their high returns versus M&A opportunities. After the acquisition of Sentric in March’23  which is now expected to add around 2% of revenue growth on a full year basis with a neutral impact on Adjusted EBITDA margin after accounting for integration costs  the Group identifies interesting acquisition targets but remains highly selective. Acquisitions investments will therefore slowdown in H2’23.Notwithstanding the current environment  the Group is on track to deliver on its medium-term trajectory communicated at the IPO  including a 2021-2025 CAGR of between +22% and +25% and a Group Adjusted EBITDA of 5%-7% by 2025  implying a segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%-16% (which is a ""high growth period"" margin  as the revenue growth is partially reinvested).
