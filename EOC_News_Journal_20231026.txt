Raymond Street.,"Indianapolis animal shelter to get new $30M facility amid overcrowding problemsShow Caption Hide Caption County capital fund tax rate hike would help animal shelter Look inside Indianapolis Animal Care Services building. Those who run the shelter hope to get a new building to update services  with new tax rate. Kelly Wilkinson  Indianapolis StarThe Indianapolis Animal Care Services shelter is getting a new facility at a former public housing complex  located at 5001 E. Raymond Street  Mayor Joe Hogsett announced Thursday morning.Owned by the Indianapolis Housing Agency  the Clearstream site has been vacant for nearly two decades. The city said it is collaborating with the agency and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on final terms for property transfer  which will be funded through city funds.The new shelter will be located in the 46203 zip code  the second-highest zip code for stray pick-ups and animal control-related runs  according to the city. The adjacent 46201 zip code takes the top spot for that.The approximately $30 million facility will be funded by a $19 million bond approved by the City-County Council; $6.7 million raised by the nonprofit that financially supports the shelter  Friends of Indy Animals; a $3 million grant from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust; a $1 million investment from the Lilly Endowment and a $1 million gift from the Irsay family and the Indianapolis Colts  among other sources.The facility  which is still being designed  will include a shelter  barn  dog park and garage.The current city-run animal shelter at Harding Street has long faced problems of dire overcrowding and staff have previously told IndyStar that the outdated building is falling apart and wasn't designed for housing animals for a long period of time.Upon opening the new facility  the city said the current Harding Street shelter will close.Indianapolis animal welfare: Indy's animal shelter faces 'dire' overcrowding. How to help even if you don't adopt.“With a new location  we are able to accelerate progress on a new facility while continuing our remediation and development commitments on the Near Eastside ” Hogsett  who is running for reelection Nov. 7  wrote in a news release. “This new site will bring a community resource to a vacant lot while serving Indy zip codes with some of the highest animal care needs in the city.”Hogsett's Republican challenger for mayor  Jefferson Shreve  said in response to Thursday's announcement that the timing of the announcement is no accident.Indianapolis mayoral election 2023: Everything you need to know before voting for Indianapolis mayor""This is dirty politics at its lowest  with animals being used as collateral to protect Joe Hogsett’s tenuous hold on political power "" Shreve wrote in a statement.Previous site for animal shelter at Sherman Park turned out problematicMonday night  at a televised mayoral debate on WISH-TV  Shreve pressed Hogsett on what he said was the mayor's failure to deliver on the promise for a new animal care services shelter.Hogsett had announced in August 2022 that the city would build a new animal shelter on Sherman Park  a former RCA plant. But the Sherman Park site turned out to be problematic  delaying construction  Hogsett said at the debate Monday  adding that he was frustrated that the project is not yet underway.Mayoral candidate Shreve has made animal welfare a campaign issueShreve has made animal welfare a key campaign priority  pledging in early October to improve the animal shelter and donate his entire salary  if elected mayor  to the nonprofit that financially supports the shelter.He has drawn attention to the euthanization of dogs and cats at the shelter. From January to September this year  1101 animals were euthanized.Indianapolis mayoral election 2023: Shreve pledges to improve animal shelter  donate salary  if elected mayorHogsett has defended his record on animal welfare  pointing to how the live release rate of animals has increased during his tenure. In 2015  about 81% of animals were adopted or released alive. In 2022  the number was 87%.Meanwhile  Shreve has rebutted that the live release rate has only increased because the shelter is taking in fewer animals with an appointment-only policy.The election is Nov. 7. Early voting is underway.Contact IndyStar reporter Ko Lyn Cheang at kcheang@indystar.com or 317-903-7071.

31816,Clearstream,Bing API,https://lifehacker.com/best-digital-tv-antennas-1850958729,These Indoor Digital TV Antennas (Might) Actually Work,If you're desperate to cut the cord but still want the local channels  OTA is worth a try—but results will vary,No one wants to screw over the cable companies over more than me. When Comcast almost doubled my rate a few years ago I decided it was time to ditch the box and try something else  which led me to digital antennas.The premise of a digital antenna sounds great. You bid farewell to a monthly bill  and using what amounts to a small box  get access to OTA (over the air) broadcasts that transmit in high definition (1080). If you are looking to just gain access to local networks and news  this probably sounds amazing. If you grew up with real television antenna (I did)  digital promises a different experience. But promises and reality are not the same thing.Do digital TV antennas really work?Ehhh. While old analogue antennas could relied about to work in some capacity (even if that meant a fuzzy  static-filled image)  digital signals are very much all (crystal clear HD image) or nothing (a choppy  pixilated still frame or just a black screen). What’s clear is that there are a few factors required if you want your antenna to actually work reliably. A good antenna with great range helps  knowing a bit about calibration helps  but to some degree  you live where you live and line of sight to a broadcast tower isn’t something you can really change. Most people who use digital antennas experience varying levels of success.Personally  I tried a progression of more and more expensive antennas and all sorts of amplifiers before deciding I wasn’t willing to be constantly adjusting in the middle of the Super Bowl or the season finale of my favorite TV show. (Luckily  we now have more options for watching live TV  so you’re not absolutely stuck with your cable company.)That said  if you want to give free broadcast signals a try  here’s what to look for.What to expect from the best digital antennaeIf you’re going to try the OTA route  experts seem to agree on a few pieces of advice–your antenna can’t be hidden behind a bookcase  and is best placed near a window or outside  and you should plan to spend more to get the best antenna you can—preferably one with an amplification feature. How much more? Well  even the most expensive antennas are under $150. Here are a few to consider.Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse TV AntennaThis is a peel and stick antenna  and you can choose black or white so you don’t have a giant black spot on your window. It has a shorter range than other antennas  but good ratings  and is much less expensive. Reviewers note that the shape of this antenna (circular) mean it receives better UHF signals.Price: $39.99Maximum Range: 35 milesAmplified: yesSize: 10.1x 8.6x .04 inchesBuy the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna from Amazon ($40)Winegard Flatwave Amped Pro HDTV Indoor AntennaFrom every review  Winegard seems to own the antenna space  and two of their models top the recommendations. Although they have similar results  I recommend the Amped Pro TH-3000. While it’s a bit more expensive than the comparable model below  it has additional smart functionality—and the real bonus is that the app serves to help you set up and calibrate the antenna. As someone who’s been through it with trying to get a solid signal  you’ll really appreciate that benefit.Price: $109.99Number of channels: 36Maximum Range: 60 milesAmplified: yesSize: 12x.06x13 inchesBuy the Winegard Flatwave Amped Pro from Amazon ($109)Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Amped Digital HD Indoor Amplified TV AntennaThis Winegard model  like its pricier sister  is paper thin  which means that it mounts easily. It has a slightly shorter range  and that can affect how many channels you’ll actually receive  but given it’s half the price of the smart model  you might not care.Price: $59.99Number of channels: 36Maximum Range: 50 milesAmplified: yesSize: 12x.06x13 inchesBuy the Winegard FL5500A Amplified TV Antenna ($60),neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.59,0.24,0.17,True,English,"['Indoor Digital TV Antennas', 'Digital HD Indoor Amplified TV Antenna', 'Winegard FL5500A Amplified TV Antenna', 'crystal clear HD image', 'Pro HDTV Indoor Antenna', 'Winegard Flatwave Amped Pro', 'favorite TV show', 'fuzzy, static-filled image', 'Eclipse TV Antenna', 'ClearStream Eclipse Antenna', 'giant black spot', 'additional smart functionality', 'digital TV antennas', 'old analogue antennas', 'best digital antennae', 'real television antenna', 'free broadcast signals', '12x.06x13 inches', 'live TV', 'best antenna', 'digital signals', 'digital antennas', 'good antenna', 'stick antenna', 'antenna space', 'black screen', 'broadcast tower', 'real bonus', 'Winegard model', 'smart model', 'UHF signals', 'expensive antennas', 'other antennas', 'cable companies', 'monthly bill', 'high definition', 'local networks', 'different experience', 'same thing', 'choppy, pixilated', 'great range', 'Most people', 'varying levels', 'Super Bowl', 'season finale', 'cable company', 'amplification feature', 'shorter range', 'good ratings', 'Maximum Range', 'similar results', 'comparable model', 'solid signal', 'pricier sister', 'small box', 'OTA route', 'many channels', 'one', 'Comcast', 'rate', 'time', 'something', 'premise', 'farewell', 'access', 'air', 'broadcasts', 'news', 'promises', 'reality', 'capacity', 'frame', 'factors', 'bit', 'calibration', 'degree', 'line', 'sight', 'success', 'progression', 'sorts', 'amplifiers', 'middle', 'options', 'experts', 'pieces', 'advice', 'bookcase', 'window', 'peel', 'Reviewers', 'shape', 'Price', '35 miles', 'Size', 'Amazon', 'models', 'recommendations', 'app', 'benefit', 'Number', '60 miles', 'paper', '50 miles']",2023-10-26,2023-10-26,lifehacker.com

Trade receivables were contained despite the strong growth (limited increase of €3.2 m in trade receivables net of non-recourse factoring).At 30 June 2023  available cash amounted to €6.3 m  compared with €7.4 m at 31 December 2022and €14.2 m at 30 June 2022.Shareholders' equity stood at €22.5 m at 30 June 2023.Financial debt stood at €44.6 m at the end of the 2022/23 financial year  compared with €46.7 m at the end of December 2022 and €40.7 m at 30 June 2022.

The main drivers of this dynamic were North America and Europe  particularly in the semiconductor market. Our excellent performance in the first nine months makes us confident as we enter the end of the year  enabling us to confirm the previously announced full-year guidance and to narrow the range on organic sales growth and capital expenditure.""Mersen's consolidated sales for the first nine months of 2023 totaled €910 million  up by almost 15% on an organic basis versus the same period in 2022. Around 5% of this growth was attributable to price increases.The unfavorable currency effect was mainly due to the depreciation of the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar. The scope effect corresponds to the disposal of a German tantalum anti-corrosion equipment business last August.(in millions of euros) 9M 2023 9M 2022 Organicgrowth Scopeeffect Currencyeffect Reportedgrowth Advanced Materials 500.8 460.0 13.5% -0.2% -3.9% 8.9% Electrical Power 409.0 361.3 16.5% -2.9% 13.2% Europe 299.1 265.0 15.2% -0.3% -1.7% 12.8% Asia-Pacific 228.9 238.6 2.8% -6.7% -4.1% North America 352.6 288.9 24.8% -2.2% 22.0% Rest of the world 29.2 28.8 6.5% 0.0% -4.6% 1.5% Group 909.8 821.3 14.9% -0.1% -3.4% 10.8%Mersen reported consolidated sales of €302 million for the third quarter of 2023  representing organic growth of 8.6%.The most significant exchange rate fluctuations during the period concerned the depreciation of the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar.(in millions of euros) Q3 2023 Q3 2022 Organicgrowth Scopeeffect Currencyeffect Reportedgrowth Advanced Materials 166.4 167.7 6.7% -0.6% -6.4% -0.7% Electrical Power 135.7 129.4 11.0% -5.5% 4.9% Europe 95.8 86.7 13.4% -1.1% -1.5% 10.5% Asia-Pacific 78.1 89.2 -2.8% -9.9% -12.4% North America 118.4 110.4 14.6% -6.5% 7.2% Rest of the world 9.8 10.7 -2.6% -0.1% -5.7% -8.3% Group 302.1 297.0 8.6% -0.3% -6.0% 1.7%Advanced Materials sales totaled €166 million in third-quarter 2023  an organic increase of 6.7% versus the prior-year period. Growth was especially robust in the semiconductor market and in process industries. As expected  sales in the renewable energy market contracted slightly from a very high comparable base. Finally  deliveries for the chemicals market were lower this quarter.Electrical Power sales amounted to €136 million  representing organic growth of 11% versus the same period in 2022. Electric vehicle sales rose steadily  mainly in Europe. Electrical distribution in the United States remained dynamic. On the other hand  the number of power electronics projects in Asia declined.Europe recorded robust growth in both segments  thanks to the semiconductor  rail and chemicals markets. Sales remain robust in France and Germany.In Asia  Group sales were down slightly year on year  mainly due to fewer projects in China and in Japan  both in the rail and energy markets.In North America  momentum was very brisk in both segments and in a large number of markets  particularly renewable energies  semiconductors and process industries.Lastly  in the rest of the world  business was impacted by the non-recurrence of major deliveries of chemicals projects in third-quarter 2022 in South Africa and Morocco.As part of the rollout of its 2027 roadmap  Mersen exercised the first option to extend the maturity of its €320 million syndicated loan to 2028. As a result  the average maturity of the Group's committed credit facilities is around 4.5 years.The Group confirms its objectives for full-year 2023 announced on July 27  2023  and is narrowing the range on its forecasts for organic growth and capital expenditure. The objectives are now:organic growth of between 11% and 12% (between 10% and 12% previously);operating margin before non-recurring items of between 11% and 11.2% of sales;capital expenditure of between €175 million and €200 million (between €150 million and €200 million previously).Currency effect: Calculated by comparing sales for the previous year at the exchange rate of the previous year with sales for the previous year at the exchange rate of the current year.Organic growth: Calculated by comparing sales for the year with sales for the previous year  restated at the current year's exchange rate  excluding the impact of acquisitions and disposals.Scope effect: Contribution from companies acquired in the year in relation to sales for the year.The sales conference call will be held on October 25  2023 at 18:00 CET.Full-year 2023 sales: January 25  2024  after the markets close---Mersen is a global expert in electrical power and advanced materials for high-tech industries.

Twice as many patients in the UV1 arm responded to treatment. No additional safety concerns were reported from the UV1 treatment.The positive outcome from the NIPU study is the first demonstration of a universal cancer vaccine efficacy in a randomized Phase II clinical trial  showing Proof of Concept and supporting further clinical development as per investigators' recommendation.NIPU (NCT04300244) is an investigator-initiated  randomized  multi-center  open-label Phase II clinical trial for second-line treatment in patients with malignant mesothelioma (MPM). The data from the study was published initially in a late-breaking abstract at the ESMO Congress in Madrid. Further details were provided in an oral presentation by the Principal Investigator at the ESMO Congress and was detailed in a press release announced by the Company on Monday  October 23  2023.This webcast follows the presentation of the NIPU results at ESMO by the Principal Investigator  Professor Åslaug Helland  MD  PhD. The webcast held in Madrid on Monday  October 23  2023  had technical difficulties due to unexpected bandwidth issues at the premises.The webcasts will take place on Tuesday  October 31  2023  at:9:00 am CET (in Norwegian): Link2:00 pm CET/ 8:00 am ET (in English): LinkThe webcasts can be accessed live or as a replay. Questions can be sent during the webcast  or in advance to IR@ultimovacs.comUV1 is a therapeutic cancer vaccine used to generate an immune response against the enzyme human telomerase (hTERT). The enzyme is essential for the ability of cancer cells to proliferate. Telomerase is present in 85-90% of all cancers  across the stages of the disease. The vaccine is manufactured as an off-the-shelf product with a long shelf life. UV1 is easy to use and does not require sophisticated hospital infrastructure  enabling patient access to therapy also in community centers  and in rural and underserved communities.Ultimovacs is evaluating the universal cancer vaccine UV1 in a broad clinical development program across various cancer indications with different biology and disease stages  in combination with different checkpoint inhibitors.

The average EUR/BRL rate is 5.42 during the first nine months of 2023  compared to 5.46 during the first nine months of 2022.During the first nine months of 2023  production reaches 3 TWh  compared to 2.5 TWh over the first nine months of 2022  an increase of +22%. The production of 3 TWh corresponds to the electricity supply of an equivalent of 3.8 million people  making it possible to avoid 1 144 ktons of CO 2 . The increase in production reflects the growth in operation capacity  which has increased by +35% since September 2022  from 1.5 GW to 2.0 GW.Turnover for the third quarter of 2023 from Energy Sales reaches €78.2 million  up +5% (at current and constant exchange rates) compared to the third quarter of 2022.The third quarter was marked by an acceleration in commissioning with 346 MW connected during the quarter  thanks to the achievement of full power of the Garrido complex (+25 MW) in Portugal  the commissioning of Rives charentaises (37.4 MW) in France  the finalization of the commissioning of SSM3-6 in Brazil (+243 MW)  and the dynamism of Helexia (+40.8 MW).Despite these significant advances  production for the quarter only increases by 1%  standing at 1.2 TWh  due to curtailment which temporarily reduces production in Brazil.Analysis by country:In Brazil  the electricity network has disrupted since a blackout on August 15. Capping the production of certain power plants reduced production by around 120 GWh. Furthermore  the extension of connection times for new power plants reduced production by around 40 GWh. Therefore  the contribution of the new SSM3-6 solar power plant (260 MW) was significant  but insufficient to increase the country's total production;In France  production benefits from the new installations of projects dedicated to corporate clients such as SNCF with the commissioning of the Rives charentaises wind power plant (37.4 MW) or Leroy Merlin with the commissioning of the Sud Vannier wind power plant (23.6 MW)  and other projects such as Sable Blanc in Guyana;In other countries  production increases with the contribution of new power plants  in particular those of South Farm in the United Kingdom (50 MW)  the Garrido complex in Portugal (51 MW)  as well as those of Helexia mainly in Spain and Hungary (9 MW). Production remains generally stable in Egypt and Jordan.SERVICESTurnover for the nine first months of 2023 from Services (internal and external) reaches €406.9 million  up +91% (+92% at constant exchange rates) compared to the first nine months of 2022.The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment is multiplied by x2 to reach €379.7 million  and the Operation and Maintenance segment increased by +18% to reach €27.2 million.Internal turnover (eliminated in consolidation) is multiplied by x5 to €298.1 million  driven by the internal activity of own account power plants  while turnover with third-party clients is down 29% to €108.7 million. Activity was heavily focused internally  given the numerous constructions and commissionings underway  especially during the first six months of the year.Turnover for the third quarter of 2023 from Services (internal and external) reach €135.7 million  multiplied by x2 compared to the third quarter of 2022 at current and constant exchange rates. Activity continues to be focused internally  but less than during the first half  with internal turnover (eliminated in consolidation) multiplied by x7 while turnover with third-party clients is down 6% (compared with -29% over nine months) to €48.1 million.Analysis by segment shows strong growth in the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment:The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment posts a turnover of €127.0 million  multiplied by x2. Internal activity multiplied by x7  reflecting the numerous active construction site  including 346 MW achieved during the quarter and 643 MW underway at the end of September. The external turnover of this segment fell by 9% to €42.8 million  compared to -34% over nine months  reflecting the rise of large contracts for third-party clients  particularly in Ireland;The Operation and Maintenance segment records a turnover of €8.7 million  an increase of +8%. The capacity operated on its behalf and for its third-party customers amounts to 6.4 GW  an increase of +46% compared to September 2022  including 4.3 GW for external customers up +52%.The eliminations of turnover for 9M 2023 and Q3 2023 respectively amount to €298.1 million (multiplied by x5 at current and constant exchange rates) and €87.6 million (multiplied by x7 at current and constant exchange rates)  reflecting the sharp increase in internal services.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (SINCE SEPTEMBER 30)The Karavasta solar power plant (140 MW) is fully built and ready to produce5The power plant  the largest in Albania  but also in the Western Balkans  is now built and should produce its first megawatt hours in the coming weeks. The project is capable of providing electricity equivalent to the annual consumption of 220 000 inhabitants.Start of production at the Canudos wind farm6The project  located in the state of Bahia  in Brazil  consists of 28 wind turbines  a collector station  a switching station and a 500kV transmission line. Furthermore  in line with Voltalia's commitment  since 2021  Voltalia has been collaborating with experts to implement an ambitious program to conserve the endemic Lear's macaw and restore its main local food source  the licuri palm.Full power for the SSM3-6 solar plant (260 MW)7Voltalia has commissioned the entire capacity of the SSM3-6 solar power plant  including the last tranche of 133 MW whose entry into operation was slowed down due to the consequences of the network blackout on August 15.In Brazil  Newave Energia relies on Voltalia for a 420 MW solar project8Voltalia has sold a 420 MW project  that the company fully developed  to Newave Energia  which will also rely on Voltalia for the construction and maintenance of electrical infrastructure. This ready-to-build project is located in the Arinos complex  in the state of Minas Gerais  in the southeastern region of Brazil. Future photovoltaic plants will produce the equivalent of the consumption of 1.3 million inhabitants of the country and will avoid the emission of around 350 kt of CO 2 per year.2023 OBJECTIVESIncrease of 2023 capacity target in operation and construction from 2.6 GW to around 2.8 GW: x2.8 compared to June 2019  when the objective was set  including around 2.3 GW in operation (+ 47% compared to the end of 2022).Confirmation of the 2023 normalised9 EBITDA target of around €275 million representing a x2 multiplication compared to 2022 and a x4 multiplication compared to June 2019  when the target was set. To achieve this objective  Voltalia is relying on a normalised EBITDA of €61 million recorded in the first half of 2023  to which will be added a secured normalised EBITDA of around €214 million in the second half  including:- Around €124 million from energy sales;- Around €90 million from Services and Corporate sales. Voltalia benefits in particular from the finalisation of a 420 MW10 ready-to-build project in Brazil  as well as ongoing sales of which more than 100 MW are subject of advanced exclusive negotiations.2027 AMBITIONS REAFFIRMEDReaffirmation of the following ambitions :Owned operating and construction capacity : over 5 GW ;Capacity operated on behalf of third parties : over 8 GW ;Normalised 11 EBITDA : around €475 million ;EBITDA : around €475 million ; CO 2 -equivalent avoided : over 4 million tonnes.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements about Voltalia and its subsidiaries.

The average EUR/BRL rate is 5.42 during the first nine months of 2023  compared to 5.46 during the first nine months of 2022.During the first nine months of 2023  production reaches 3 TWh  compared to 2.5 TWh over the first nine months of 2022  an increase of +22%. The production of 3 TWh corresponds to the electricity supply of an equivalent of 3.8 million people  making it possible to avoid 1 144 ktons of CO 2 . The increase in production reflects the growth in operation capacity  which has increased by +35% since September 2022  from 1.5 GW to 2.0 GW.Turnover for the third quarter of 2023 from Energy Sales reaches €78.2 million  up +5% (at current and constant exchange rates) compared to the third quarter of 2022.The third quarter was marked by an acceleration in commissioning with 346 MW connected during the quarter  thanks to the achievement of full power of the Garrido complex (+25 MW) in Portugal  the commissioning of Rives charentaises (37.4 MW) in France  the finalization of the commissioning of SSM3-6 in Brazil (+243 MW)  and the dynamism of Helexia (+40.8 MW).Despite these significant advances  production for the quarter only increases by 1%  standing at 1.2 TWh  due to curtailment which temporarily reduces production in Brazil.Analysis by country:In Brazil  the electricity network has disrupted since a blackout on August 15. Capping the production of certain power plants reduced production by around 120 GWh. Furthermore  the extension of connection times for new power plants reduced production by around 40 GWh. Therefore  the contribution of the new SSM3-6 solar power plant (260 MW) was significant  but insufficient to increase the country's total production;In France  production benefits from the new installations of projects dedicated to corporate clients such as SNCF with the commissioning of the Rives charentaises wind power plant (37.4 MW) or Leroy Merlin with the commissioning of the Sud Vannier wind power plant (23.6 MW)  and other projects such as Sable Blanc in Guyana;In other countries  production increases with the contribution of new power plants  in particular those of South Farm in the United Kingdom (50 MW)  the Garrido complex in Portugal (51 MW)  as well as those of Helexia mainly in Spain and Hungary (9 MW). Production remains generally stable in Egypt and Jordan.SERVICESTurnover for the nine first months of 2023 from Services (internal and external) reaches €406.9 million  up +91% (+92% at constant exchange rates) compared to the first nine months of 2022.The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment is multiplied by x2 to reach €379.7 million  and the Operation and Maintenance segment increased by +18% to reach €27.2 million.Internal turnover (eliminated in consolidation) is multiplied by x5 to €298.1 million  driven by the internal activity of own account power plants  while turnover with third-party clients is down 29% to €108.7 million. Activity was heavily focused internally  given the numerous constructions and commissionings underway  especially during the first six months of the year.Turnover for the third quarter of 2023 from Services (internal and external) reach €135.7 million  multiplied by x2 compared to the third quarter of 2022 at current and constant exchange rates. Activity continues to be focused internally  but less than during the first half  with internal turnover (eliminated in consolidation) multiplied by x7 while turnover with third-party clients is down 6% (compared with -29% over nine months) to €48.1 million.Analysis by segment shows strong growth in the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment:The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment posts a turnover of €127.0 million  multiplied by x2. Internal activity multiplied by x7  reflecting the numerous active construction site  including 346 MW achieved during the quarter and 643 MW underway at the end of September. The external turnover of this segment fell by 9% to €42.8 million  compared to -34% over nine months  reflecting the rise of large contracts for third-party clients  particularly in Ireland;The Operation and Maintenance segment records a turnover of €8.7 million  an increase of +8%. The capacity operated on its behalf and for its third-party customers amounts to 6.4 GW  an increase of +46% compared to September 2022  including 4.3 GW for external customers up +52%.The eliminations of turnover for 9M 2023 and Q3 2023 respectively amount to €298.1 million (multiplied by x5 at current and constant exchange rates) and €87.6 million (multiplied by x7 at current and constant exchange rates)  reflecting the sharp increase in internal services.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (SINCE SEPTEMBER 30)The Karavasta solar power plant (140 MW) is fully built and ready to produce5The power plant  the largest in Albania  but also in the Western Balkans  is now built and should produce its first megawatt hours in the coming weeks.

On the strength of this renewed growth over the quarter  cumulative sales for the first 9 months of 2023 showed a limited decline of -2% to €18.4m.After a general slowdown in the digital advertising sector since the second half of 2022 across Europe  the market has gradually regained strength in recent months  enabling Invibes to announce this return to growth.Invibes' ability to bounce back as soon as favourable market conditions reappear reflects its unique value proposition  characterised by its fully integrated proprietary technology platform  which offers a major point of differentiation in the ecosystem which has ensured its consistent capacity for innovation that appeals to the world's leading brands.During this period  Invibes also benefited from an increase of Services & Solutions - which are tailored to the specific needs of an advertisers' business sector. The contribution from these offerings made up to 15% of sales in September  and an increase in gross margin of 5 points over the first 9 months of 2023  representing an overall growth of 10.5% over the period. These performances demonstrate Invibes continuous ability to monetise its innovations  a trend that should continue over the coming months.Many advertisers have adopted the Invibes Carbon-Neutral label since it launched at the beginning of 2023.From the beginning of 2023  Invibes has been offering its customers a 100% carbon-neutral campaign  reflecting the company's desire to develop a more responsible form of advertising and radically transform advertising industry practices. To offset the carbon footprint of its campaigns and achieve a carbon-neutral balance sheet  Invibes invests in Gold Standard-certified projects to install solar panels  ensuring that its customers can take truly sustainable and responsible action.Unique on the market  and reflecting Invibes' ability to constantly innovate in its sector  this alternative has been very much welcomed by major retailers  as it allows the advertiser to underline its CSR commitments and to meet the strong expectation of consumers  who are increasingly concerned about the environment.Banque des Territoires (Caisse des Dépôts Group) inaugurated this solution in the spring with a ""Carbon Neutral Advertising"" campaign incorporating seven in-feed formats  including five video formats  to captivate and create a link with its partners while telling the story of its role and action in the ecological transformation.In the 3rd quarter of 2023  new advertisers have adopted this label for their campaigns  including: ENGIE  Neste  National Trust Scotland  Polestar  Cofidis  The Very Group  Zespri  MUSE  etc.Invibes points out that the carbon emissions of its campaigns are among the lowest in the advertising industry  with 26.1g of CO2 emitted per 1 000 impressions  96% less than the industry average.Further innovation and the launch of unique intelligent targeting solutionsIn the 3rd quarter of 2023  Invibes continued to stand out from its competitors by continuing to integrate technological Services & Solutions tailored to advertiser sectors of activity  and increasingly new intelligent targeting solutions based on big data and innovative  high-impact in-feed formats.To maintain a high level of user engagement  Invibes is constantly innovating to develop solutions that combine contextual and behavioural targeting to offer its customers more effective campaigns in order to bring them more value. This multi-dimensional approach guarantees that its customers reach the right people  with the right advertising creatives  in the right environment and at the right time  in the most effective way possible.Notable interactive targeting solutions launched during the quarter include:Drive-to-Dealership: this solution enhances the impact of national campaigns by delivering locally relevant creative and messages  such as the address of the nearest shop  local stock availability  and the Invibes Call function  which allows users to call their local shop directly from the ad.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER OF ANY OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED HEREIN.Stavanger  25 October 2023: Prosafe SE (""Prosafe"" or the ""Company"") hereby announces a contemplated private placement of up to NOK 350 million by issue of new shares (the ""Offer Shares"") in the Company (the ""Private Placement""). The subscription price per Offer Share (the “Offer Price”) and the final number of Offer Shares to be issued in the Private Placement will be set by the Company's board of directors (the ""Board"") on the basis of an accelerated bookbuilding process conducted by the Managers (as defined below).The Company has appointed Pareto Securities AS and SpareBank 1 Markets AS as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners  and Carnegie AS and Clarksons Securities AS as joint bookrunners (together the ""Managers"").The net proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement will be used for investments and mobilization costs to enable new contract opportunities  strengthening of the balance sheet and general corporate purposes.The bookbuilding period in the Private Placement will commence today 25 October 2023  at 16:30 hours CEST and close on 26 October 2023 at 08:00 hours CEST (the ""Bookbuilding Period""). The Company and the Managers may  however  at any time resolve to extend or shorten the Bookbuilding Period on short or no notice. If the Bookbuilding Period is extended or shortened  any other dates referred to herein may be amended accordingly.The allocation of Offer Shares will be determined following the Bookbuilding Period  and the final allocation will be made at the sole discretion of the Board (in consultation with the Managers). The Board will focus on criteria such as (but not limited to) current ownership in the Company  indications from the wall-crossing phase of the Private Placement  price leadership  timeliness of the application  relative order size  sector knowledge  perceived investor quality and investment horizon.Notification of conditional allocation will be sent to the applicants by the Managers on or about 26 October 2023 before 09:00 hours CEST  subject to any shortenings or extensions of the Bookbuilding Period.The Offer Shares allocated in the Private Placement are expected to be settled on a delivery versus payment (“DVP”) basis on or about 21 November 2023  following completion of the Conditions including the share capital increase pertaining to the Offer Shares being registered with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises (the “NRBE”)  expected on or about 20 November 2023. The DVP settlement will be facilitated by a pre-payment agreement expected to be entered into between the Company and the Managers (the “Pre-Payment Agreement”). The Offer Shares cannot be traded on Oslo Børs before the share capital increase pertaining to the issuance of the Offer Shares has been registered with the NRBE. The Company will announce when such registration has taken place  and the Company expects that the Offer Shares  except for those Offer Shares described in the paragraph immediately below  will commence trading on Oslo Børs on or about 20 November 2023.A portion of the Offer Shares in the Private Placement will be delivered on a separate  temporary ISIN pending approval of a listing prospectus by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway and will not be listed or tradable on Oslo Børs until the listing prospectus has been published (expected at the end of November 2023 approx. 1 week post the EGM). Certain investors with subscription indications from the wall-crossing phase in the Private Placement have accepted to take delivery of the majority of such Offer Shares. All other investors will receive a pro rata portion of their allocated Offer Shares (i) in accordance with the DVP settlement timeline described above (immediate trading after EGM)  and (ii) in accordance with the mentioned listing prospectus timeline (delayed trading after EGM). The ratio will depend on the final Offer Price.The Private Placement will be directed towards selected Norwegian and international investors  in each case subject to and in compliance with applicable exemptions from relevant prospectus  filing and other registration requirements. The minimum application and allocation amount in the Private Placement has been set to the NOK equivalent of EUR 100 000. The Company may  however  at its sole discretion  allocate an amount below EUR 100 000 to the extent applicable exemptions from the prospectus requirement pursuant to applicable regulations  including Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the EU Prospectus Regulation) and ancillary regulations  are available.Members of the Company’s executive management as well as the chairman of the Board have accepted a 3-months lock-up post the Private Placement.Completion of the Private Placement is subject to (i) the Board resolving to consummate the Private Placement and conditionally allocate the Offer Shares  (ii) an extraordinary general meeting expected to be held on or about 16 November 2023 (the “EGM”) in the Company resolving to approve the Private Placement and issue the Offer Shares  (iii) the Pre-Payment Agreement remaining in full force and effect  (iv) the share capital increase pertaining to the issuance of the Offer Shares being validly registered with the NRBE  and (v) the Offer Shares being validly issued and registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (Euronext Securities Oslo or the “VPS”) (jointly the “Conditions”).The Company reserves the right to cancel  and/or modify the terms of  the Private Placement at any time and for any reason prior to the Conditions having been met. Neither the Company nor the Managers will be liable for any losses incurred by applicants if the Private Placement is cancelled  irrespective of the reason for such cancellation.The Private Placement  if completed  represents a deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive right to subscribe for the Offer Shares. The Board has considered the Private Placement in light of the equal treatment obligations under the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act  the Norwegian Securities Trading Act  the rules on equal treatment under Oslo Rule Book II for companies listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and the Oslo Stock Exchange's Guidelines on the rule of equal treatment  and deems that the proposed Private Placement is in compliance with these obligations. The Board is of the view that it will be in the common interest of the Company and its shareholders to raise equity through a private placement  in particularly in light of the current market conditions and the purpose for which the funds are raised. By structuring the equity raise as a private placement  the Company is expected to raise equity efficiently and in a timely manner  with a lower discount to the current trading price  at a lower cost and with a significantly reduced completion risk compared to a rights issue. It has also been taken into consideration that the Private Placement is based on a publicly announced accelerated bookbuilding process. The Company may  subject to completion of the Private Placement  approval from the EGM and certain other conditions  decide to carry out a subsequent repair offering of new shares at the Offer Price in the Private Placement which  subject to applicable securities law  will be directed towards existing shareholders in the Company as of 25 October 2023 (as registered in the VPS two trading days thereafter)  who (i) were not included in the wall-crossing phase of the Private Placement  (ii) were not allocated Offer Shares in the Private Placement  and (iii) are not resident in a jurisdiction where such offering would be unlawful or would (in jurisdictions other than Norway) require any prospectus  filing  registration or similar action.Ro Sommernes advokatfirma DA is acting as legal advisor to the Company in connection with the Private Placement.Prosafe is a leading owner and operator of semi-submersible accommodation vessels.

Valneva was also granted accelerated assessment1 for the application by EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) based on the vaccine candidate’s “major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation”.VLA1553 is currently the first and only chikungunya vaccine candidate worldwide for which regulatory review processes are underway. A Biologic License Application (BLA) is currently under priority review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)2 with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date planned for the end of November 20233. Additionally  a marketing application is under review by Health Canada4.If approved  VLA1553 could become the first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “We welcome EMA’s accelerated assessment and will work closely with them to bring this vaccine to market. Chikungunya virus  or CHIKV  is a serious and debilitating mosquito-borne viral infection that poses a significant unmet need and the risk of chikungunya spreading in Europe is relatively high due to the possibility of infected travelers5. No vaccine or specific treatments are currently available for this debilitating disease. We will continue to work diligently to bring VLA1553 to different territories as soon as possible.”The regulatory submissions with the EMA  FDA and Health Canada follow final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 20226 (Lancet article)  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20227  twelve-month persistence data in December 20228 and positive initial Phase 3 safety data in adolescents9.VLA1553 was granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by EMA in 2020 and received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 203210. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries11. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas12 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 110 countries13. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 202214  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202215  positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202216 and positive initial Phase 3 safety data in Adolescents17. The pivotal Phase 3 data were published in The Lancet18(article link)  the world’s leading peer-reviewed medical journal  in June 2023.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA155319. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201920  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Today  Lectra’s Board of Directors  chaired by Daniel Harari  reviewed the consolidated financial statements for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023  which have not been reviewed by the Statutory Auditors.Comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are based on 2022 exchange rates unless otherwise stated (“like-for-like”). As the impact of the acquisition of TextileGenesis on the financial statements for 2023 is not material  like-for-like changes exclude only the variations in exchange rates.Currency changes between 2022 and 2023 mechanically decreased revenues and EBITDA before non-recurring items by 6.4 million euros (-5%) and 2.8 million euros (-10%) respectively in Q3  and by 7.3 million euros (-2%) and 3.0 million euros (-5%) respectively in the first nine months of the year  at actual exchange rates compared to like-for-like figures.1. Q3 2023The environment remained highly degraded in the third quarter  owing primarily to expectations of lower growth or even recession in some countries  persistent high energy costs  and historically high interest rates. With many customers also experiencing lower demand for their products  investment decisions continued to be postponed.As a result  orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (32.3 million euros) were down 26% compared to Q3 2022.Orders for new software subscriptions  of which the annual value came to 2.2 million euros  continued to rise  displaying a growth of 19%.Q3 revenues (118.7 million euros) were down 11%.EBITDA before non-recurring items (23.9 million euros) was down 10% and despite the decline in revenues  the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items rose 0.3 percentage points to 20.1%  thanks to the sharp improvement in gross margin (+5.7 percentage points compared to Q3 2022) and the impact of actions to reduce fixed overhead costs.2. FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2023The uncertainty that characterized the first nine months of the year has led many companies to take a very cautious wait-and-see attitude. In these circumstances  orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (107.1 million euros) were down 29% compared to the same period of 2022.The annual value of new software subscription orders came to 7.7 million euros  up 27% compared to the first nine months of 2022.Revenues (358.3 million euros) were down 7%. While revenues from perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (117.6 million euros) decreased by 25%  recurring contract revenues (134.5 million euros)  which benefited from the growth in software subscription orders and the acceleration of synergies from the Gerber acquisition  increased by 11%. Revenues from consumables and parts (106.1 million euros) were stable.Gross profit amounted to 249.6 million euros  down 2% compared to 2022  while revenues fell by 7%. The gross profit margin came to 69.7%  up 3.7 percentage points. This increase stems mainly from the synergies coming from the Gerber acquisition.EBITDA before non-recurring items (59.2 million euros) was down 17% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items came to 16.5%  down 2.1 percentage points.Income from operations came to 39.3 million euros. This included a 9.5-million-euro charge for amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisitions carried out since 2021 and a non-recurrent income item of 2.6 million euros.Net income (24.9 million euros) decreased by 30% at actual exchange rates.Free cash flow before non-recurring items was 32.1 million euros (31.6 million euros in the first nine months of 2022). It is higher than net income.At September 30  2023  the Group had a particularly robust balance sheet with a consolidated shareholders’ equity of 426.2 million euros and a positive net cash position of 12.5 million euros  consisting in financial debt of 98.0 million euros and cash of 110.6 million euros.The working capital requirement at September 30  2023 was a negative 7.6 million euros.3. BUSINESS TRENDS AND OUTLOOKIn its 2022 Financial Report  published February 8  2023  Lectra presented its new roadmap for 2023-2025. The Group also specified that 2023 remained unpredictable given the degraded macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  which resulted in many uncertainties that could continue to weigh on its customers’ investment decisions.At the beginning of the year  the Group set itself objectives of achieving  in 2023  revenues in the range of 522 to 576 million euros and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 90 to 113 million euros. It subsequently reported on April 27 that it then anticipated revenues in the range of 485 to 525 million euros and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 78 to 95 million euros.In what continues to be a highly degraded environment in macroeconomic and geopolitical terms  orders and revenues from new systems in Q3 were lower than anticipated by the Group. Recurring revenues  on the other hand  which should account for over 65% of total revenues in 2023  continued to grow in Q3  and provide good visibility. In addition  the initial measures to reduce overhead costs have begun to bear fruit.In light of these factors  full-year revenues are now anticipated in the range of 474 to 481 million euros  thus slightly lower than anticipated on April 27  and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 78 to 82 million euros  in the lower part of the range indicated on April 27. These scenarios are based on September 30 exchange rates for Q4  including $1.06 to the euro.Because the Group's customers operate in a highly competitive environment that demands they continue to improve performance  their investments will pick up as soon as the macroeconomic situation improves. Lectra's roadmap for 2023-2025  which was launched on January 1  2023  will enable the Group to take full advantage of the upturn and accelerate its growth.The 2022 Annual Financial Report  as well as the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and the financial statements for the first nine months of 2023 are available on lectra.com.

This evolution is reflected in our third quarter performance despite satisfactory commercial developments in Merchant Services. In this context  we decided to update our 2023 objectives.To reinforce Worldline competitiveness and structural mid-term profile and successfully face this temporarily challenging environment  we announce Power24  our planned post-integration transformation ambition . We target €200m run-rate cash costs savings in 2025  with a fast ramp-up in 2024.In 10 years  Worldline has created one of the largest payment companies in Europe  benefitting from a unique value proposition based on cutting edge technology  strong market positions and powerful distribution channels alongside leading banking partners. As we are reaching the completion of Ingenico integration  we are ready to enter into a new phase of our company journey ready to unleash the power of our combined assets  and to make Worldline more agile to boost its growth potential. More than ever  we are convinced by the unique and structural opportunity that the European and wider digital payment market represent.”Q3 2023 revenue by Global Business Linein € million Q3 2023 Q3 2022* Organic Growth Merchant services 868 807 +7.6% Financial services 232 239 -2.9% Mobility & e-transactional Services 81 81 -0.2% Worldline 1 182 1 128 +4.8%* at constant scope and exchange ratesWorldline’s Q3 2023 revenue reached € 1 182 million  representing a +4.8% organic growth. This was mainly driven by Merchant Services at +7.6% organically (+10.0% excluding Germany)  impacted by temporary headwinds. Financial Services was down -2.9%  due to delays of new signing contracts as expected. Finally  Mobility & e-Transactional Services was broadly stable supported by a good commercial dynamics in Trusted e-Ticketing activity while not yet fully benefitting from the ramp-up of new signed contracts.Macroeconomics deterioration in some of our core geographies and termination of some of our specific merchants’ relationshipsDuring the third quarter of 2023  some of our core geographies  in particular the German market  have shown macroeconomics slowdown. In effect  consumers have started to allocate more of their spendings to non-discretionary verticals rather than discretionary ones  impacting our growth and profitability.In light of an increase cybercrime in general  newly emerging fraudulent patterns and accelerating trend of reinforced regulatory guidelines and market constraints  we have tightened our risk appetite policy. Consequently  we have terminated in an orderly manner some specific merchants’ relationships whose associated costs and potential risks did not match our revised requirements.The scope of such online merchants could represent a maximum of c. € 130 million in run rate 2023 revenues  of which c.€ 30 million impacting H2 2023 and c. € 100 million mostly in H1 2024 impacting comparison basis.Merchant ServicesMerchant Services’ revenue in Q3 2023 reached € 868 million  representing an organic growth of +7.6%. This performance was based on c.7% growth in transaction volumes  with macroeconomic slowdown impacting consumer spendings patterns in particular in Germany. The revenue dynamism has also been impacted by the implementation of our [revised risk appetite framework]. By division  the growth was mainly led by:Commercial Acquiring: Good overall high single-digit growth with almost all geographic regions contributing  but impacted by the termination of some of our existing merchants’ relationships based on our [revised risk appetite framework].Payment Acceptance: Double digit growth mainly fueled by the solid performance of Digital Commerce division  particularly thanks to the new customers signed the previous quarters such as Lufthansa and Pearson. Digital Services: Globally stable  with Germany impacted by macroeconomic headwinds.During the third quarter of the year  commercial activity in Merchant Services materialized in numerous wins for both Instore Omnichannel and Online X-Border activities  with among others  S+M  934  Nopayn  SNCF  Alsa  Goethe Institut  and Gamers Outlet.Financial ServicesQ3 2023 revenue reached € 232 million  or a -2.9% organic growth. The organic decline occurred despite good underlying growth in the account payment activity  offset by delays in pipeline execution within issuing business mainly. The performance by division was the following:Card-based payment processing activities (Issuing Processing and Acquiring Processing altogether: Contraction in growth driven by delays of new signings in most of the geographies.Account Payments: Solid growth with strong activity in Germany. Digital Banking: Growth improving with a good momentum in Belgium and France.During the third quarter on the commercial front  Financial Services signed an agreement with Commerzbank to extend their cooperation in the field of instant payments  including the realization of Swiss instant payments.Mobility & e-Transactional ServicesRevenue in Mobility & e-Transactional Services reached € 81 million  stable organically  with a positive underlying growth mainly led by good volumes in e-ticketing activity while not currently benefitting from the ramp-up in new contract signed. The performance by division was the following:Trusted Digitization: Broadly stable driven by new projects signed in France and volumes development on electronic bracelets and & energy subsidies activities.e-Ticketing: Double-digit growth driven by increasing projects activity (Network Rail  Lennon) as well as increasing volumes on rail ticketing solutions in the UK. Finally  e-Consumer & Mobility: Organic decline mainly due to lower volumes on existing contract and despite contribution of the new contracts signed in Iberia and in France.Commercial activity in Mobility & e-Transactional Services recorded two key wins  in particular with the signature of a contract with Drägerwerk (International company in the industry of medical and safety technology) for the delivery of a Smart Remote Service offering to connect and secure their worldwide deployments remotely. Another significant achievement was the signing of a 3-year agreement with Irish Rail company to provide train management and planning solutions that will enable them to enhance their fleet management capability in readiness for their transition to a Traffic Management System.Power24: acceleration of our post-integration transformationGiven this challenging environment  we announce Power24  our planned post-integration transformation ambition to reinforce Worldline competitiveness and enhance our operational efficiency. It will focus on product transformation  technology optimization  organization improvement and sourcing streamlining.Power24 is expected to deliver c. € 200 million run-rate cash costs savings in 2025  with a fast ramp-up in 2024.

New potential terms  subject to formal approval by the European Investment Bank  have also been formulated for the long-term extension of the existing loan financing with the European Investment Bank in the context of ongoing equity raise process. Implementation of the terms agreed with all three lenders is subject to the completion of an equity investment in the Company.In August 2023  BioSenic announced the allowance of a new patent entitled ‘Use of metal ions to potentiate the therapeutic effects of arsenic’ by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA). This patent (ZL202080040613.1) covers the use of its ATO platform in combination with metal ions like copper  allowing further further potential upon the use of arsenic to improve the treatment of autoimmune diseases  starting with cGvHD (the European Patent Office had granted a parallel wide patent protection in eight countries in Europe - EP3972613 - in April 2023).In September 2023  BioSenic published data in a peer-reviewed international journal “Arthritis Research & Therapy”  providing additional indications of its lead API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) arsenic trioxide (ATO) to treat systemic sclerosis (SSc). These results give ground to the proposed clinical relevance of ATO treatment in SSc  and more generally in autoimmune related pathologies.In September 2023  BioSenic announced the completion of a post-hoc analysis of its phase 2 clinical trial of ATO  finding the most adapted scheme for administration of an efficient treatment for chronic Graft-versus-Host-Disease (cGvHD). As a result  BioSenic will further use this 2-cycle treatment in its forthcoming phase 3 clinical trial. This involves the administration of a double four-week course  separated by a rest period  resulting in the use of two to four times more doses of ATO.Financial highlightsNet cash at the end of September 2023 amounted to €0.39 million (1). Upon receipt of the two final instalments of €300 000 under the existing convertible bonds program with GTO15  BioSenic anticipates having sufficient cash to carry out its business objectives until the end of January 2024. BioSenic will continue to require additional financing over the last 2023 Quarter and therefore actively evaluates various options  including a significant fundraising operation.Outlook for the remainder of 2023BioSenic is involved in preliminary discussions with Pregene  and other potential partners  to reach an agreement for the global development and commercialization of proprietary ALLOB cells  derived from mesenchymal stem cells.Since BioSenic has obtained new statistical analysis results from the past Bone Therapeutics JTA-004 Phase 3 clinical trial data  the therapeutic profile of JTA-004 has significantly changed. The results allow to specifically target patients severely affected by osteoarthritis  suggesting to proceed to a new  optimized phase 3 clinical study in this pathologyand possibly other indications. BioSenic is actively working on new intellectual property rules and new patent submissions related to a better use of the JTA-004 technology and improved versions.The Medsenic (BioSenic's subsidiary) phase 2 clinical study with ATO in the first-line treatment of cGvHD has provided additional positive results  with new data related to the optimal duration of the treatment. The phase 3 study with oral ATO in the first-line treatment of cGvHD  for which Medsenic received positive pre-IND response from the FDA  is indeed anticipated to start in 2024. A previous phase 2a clinical trial for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) had established safety for the patient and efficacy on the development of the autoimmune disease. Positive studies on preclinical models further give good grounds for a phase 2 clinical trial on systemic sclerosis (SSc). Phase 2b clinical trials for SLE and SSc are in the planning stage with the synopsis for both studies ready.In 2024 BioSenic expects to use the proceeds of anticipated future fundraisings in priority for progressing the phase 3 clinical trial in cGvHD. As a result  it will only be possible to start the SLE and SSc phase 2b clinical trials if the BioSenic Group succeeds in concluding a strong partnership with a biopharmaceutical company or if it manages to successfully out-license some of its technology. The start of SLE and SSc phase 2 clinical trials is therefore not envisioned before 2025.(1) Unaudited numbersAbout BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc)) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in orthopedics.Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined a strategic positionings and strengths to use  separately and combined  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The ATO platform  which has been successfully developed  has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T and other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). cGvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. BioSenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol.2) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform developed by BioSenic  with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. ALLOB has recently been evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled phase 2b study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late-delayed union. However  in June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in this exploratory phase 2b clinical trial  interpreted as a failure of a too early cell injection  just after fracture. BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (choice between early or late treatment).Note: Biosenic has reevaluated a previous important and years-long clinical development program. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its phase 3 JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient subpopulation. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. This leads to a next generation of JTA  off-the-shelf enhanced viscosupplement to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives are intended to provide effective lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic (OA) pain and inflammation.The company  will nevertheless focus its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

New potential terms  subject to formal approval by the European Investment Bank  have also been formulated for the long-term extension of the existing loan financing with the European Investment Bank in the context of ongoing equity raise process. Implementation of the terms agreed with all three lenders is subject to the completion of an equity investment in the Company.In August 2023  BioSenic announced the allowance of a new patent entitled ‘Use of metal ions to potentiate the therapeutic effects of arsenic’ by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA). This patent (ZL202080040613.1) covers the use of its ATO platform in combination with metal ions like copper  allowing further further potential upon the use of arsenic to improve the treatment of autoimmune diseases  starting with cGvHD (the European Patent Office had granted a parallel wide patent protection in eight countries in Europe - EP3972613 - in April 2023).In September 2023  BioSenic published data in a peer-reviewed international journal “Arthritis Research & Therapy”  providing additional indications of its lead API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) arsenic trioxide (ATO) to treat systemic sclerosis (SSc). These results give ground to the proposed clinical relevance of ATO treatment in SSc  and more generally in autoimmune related pathologies.In September 2023  BioSenic announced the completion of a post-hoc analysis of its phase 2 clinical trial of ATO  finding the most adapted scheme for administration of an efficient treatment for chronic Graft-versus-Host-Disease (cGvHD). As a result  BioSenic will further use this 2-cycle treatment in its forthcoming phase 3 clinical trial. This involves the administration of a double four-week course  separated by a rest period  resulting in the use of two to four times more doses of ATO.Financial highlightsNet cash at the end of September 2023 amounted to €0.39 million (1) .. Upon receipt of the two final instalments of €300 000 under the existing convertible bonds program with GTO15  BioSenic anticipates having sufficient cash to carry out its business objectives until the end of January 2024. BioSenic will continue to require additional financing over the last 2023 Quarter and therefore actively evaluates various options  including a significant fundraising operation.Outlook for the remainder of 2023BioSenic is involved in preliminary discussions with Pregene  and other potential partners  to reach an agreement for the global development and commercialization of proprietary ALLOB cells  derived from mesenchymal stem cells.Since BioSenic has obtained new statistical analysis results from the past Bone Therapeutics JTA-004 Phase 3 clinical trial data  the therapeutic profile of JTA-004 has significantly changed. The results allow to specifically target patients severely affected by osteoarthritis  suggesting to proceed to a new  optimized phase 3 clinical study in this pathologyand possibly other indications. BioSenic is actively working on new intellectual property rules and new patent submissions related to a better use of the JTA-004 technology and improved versions.The Medsenic (BioSenic's subsidiary) phase 2 clinical study with ATO in the first-line treatment of cGvHD has provided additional positive results  with new data related to the optimal duration of the treatment. The phase 3 study with oral ATO in the first-line treatment of cGvHD  for which Medsenic received positive pre-IND response from the FDA  is indeed anticipated to start in 2024. A previous phase 2a clinical trial for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) had established safety for the patient and efficacy on the development of the autoimmune disease. Positive studies on preclinical models further give good grounds for a phase 2 clinical trial on systemic sclerosis (SSc). Phase 2b clinical trials for SLE and SSc are in the planning stage with the synopsis for both studies ready.In 2024 BioSenic expects to use the proceeds of anticipated future fundraisings in priority for progressing the phase 3 clinical trial in cGvHD. As a result  it will only be possible to start the SLE and SSc phase 2b clinical trials if the BioSenic Group succeeds in concluding a strong partnership with a biopharmaceutical company or if it manages to successfully out-license some of its technology. The start of SLE and SSc phase 2 clinical trials is therefore not envisioned before 2025.(1) Unaudited numbersAbout BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc)) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in orthopedics.Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined a strategic positionings and strengths to use  separately and combined  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com .About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:The ATO platform  which has been successfully developed  has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T and other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). cGvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. BioSenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol. The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform developed by BioSenic  with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. ALLOB has recently been evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled phase 2b study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late-delayed union. However  in June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in this exploratory phase 2b clinical trial  interpreted as a failure of a too early cell injection  just after fracture. BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (choice between early or late treatment).Note: Biosenic has reevaluated a previous important and years-long clinical development program. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its phase 3 JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient subpopulation. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. This leads to a next generation of JTA  off-the-shelf enhanced viscosupplement to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives are intended to provide effective lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic (OA) pain and inflammation.The company  will nevertheless focus its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

GTT  the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gases  today announces its revenues for the first nine months of 2023.Commenting on the results  Philippe Berterottière  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GTT  said: “With a total of 52 LNG carrier orders and one FLNG unit order in the first nine months of 2023  the commercial performance of our core business continues to be very strong. LNG demand remains particularly high and sustainable  as illustrated by the number of final investment decisions for new liquefaction plants made since the beginning of the year  leading to additional LNG carrier needs.GTT booked 15 orders for LNG as fuel in the third quarter of 2023  indicating a resumption of commercial activity as LNG spot prices stabilise.Since the start of the year  Ascenz Marorka has won some major contracts with leading ship-owners  underlining the relevance of our digital solutions. Finally  Elogen  our subsidiary specialising in electrolysers for green hydrogen production  posted a strong increase in revenues  reflecting the order book growth seen since 2022.The GTT Group is pursuing its continued R&D and innovation efforts  as evidenced by the numerous new approvals obtained from classification societies during the first nine months of 2023  notably in the field of alternative fuels.On the financial front  revenues for the first nine months of 2023 were up by 35.1% compared to the first nine months of 2022  driven by the gradual increase in the number of LNG carriers under construction. Revenues for the third quarter were up by 57.0% compared to the same period last year. Therefore  in the absence of significant delays in vessel building schedules  the Group confirms its 2023 objectives  which it now expects in the upper half of the initial ranges.”Business activity during the first nine months- LNG carriers: Order momentum continuesFollowing a record year in 2022 in terms of orders received  GTT booked 52 orders for LNG carriers in the first nine months of 2023  including ten in the third quarter. Deliveries are scheduled between the first quarter of 2026 and the first quarter of 2028.As previously announced  GTT also received an order for one FLNG unit at the start of the year  which will be delivered in the first quarter of 2027.- LNG as fuel: Commercial activity resumesIn July 2023  GTT received an order from the Chinese shipyard Yangzijiang to design the cryogenic tanks for ten LNG-powered ultra-large container ships.In September 2023  a new order for five large container ships was received from HD Hyundai Heavy Industries on behalf of Yang Ming. This is the first time that a Chinese ship-owner has chosen LNG propulsion technology for its container ships.These orders mark a resumption of LNG-as-fuel activity as LNG spot prices stabilise. Delivery of all these container ships is scheduled between the second quarter of 2026 and the first quarter of 2028.- Services for vessels in operationIn early October  GTT announced that it had signed a service contract for the maintenance and operation of 49 CMA CGM LNG-powered container ships. The contract includes on-site technical support from GTT teams during inspections  maintenance  repairs  operations and engineering services  as well as training and access to the HEARS® emergency hotline. The contract also includes solutions provided by Ascenz Marorka (see below).As previously announced  in May 2023 GTT signed a Technical Service Agreement with the maritime transportation company Eastern Pacific Shipping and its subsidiary Coolco to support them with the maintenance and operation of a fleet of 33 vessels (24 LNG carriers  six ethane carriers and three container ships).- Ascenz Marorka: New contracts and new digital solutionsAscenz Marorka’s business activity was further strengthened in the third quarter of 2023 as it signed three important contracts with leading ship-owners.Ascenz Marorka was awarded a contract by GasLog  a world-leading LNG transportation service provider  to equip its entire fleet of over 35 LNG carriers with its Smart Shipping solution. The five-year contract covers the integration of high-frequency-sensor data and manually reported data  as well as a comprehensive set of online applications for managing  monitoring and optimising vessel performance.Ascenz Marorka’s advanced weather routing solution was selected by the Clean Products Tankers Alliance (CPTA) to equip its entire fleet. CPTA  a leading medium-sized tanker pool  operates approximately 20 vessels.Finally  as part of a service contract announced in early October (see above)  Ascenz Marorka will equip 49 CMA CGM LNG-powered vessels with high-frequency data-collection systems. CMA CGM’s onboard crew and shore staff will have access to Ascenz Marorka’s online platform  benefitting from advanced features such as trip management  vessel performance monitoring and LNG fuel management.As previously announced  Ascenz Marorka won numerous contracts in the first half of 2023  demonstrating the growing strength of its business activity. A standout item was an important contract with a European ship-owner to equip 30 container ships with automatic data-collection systems and intelligent software to manage and optimise energy and environmental performance.Ascenz Marorka also continued to develop innovative solutions.In September 2023  Ascenz Marorka obtained certification for its shaft power limitation (ShaPoLi) solution from the classification society Bureau Veritas. As previously announced  Ascenz Marorka had previously received a conformity certification for its ShaPoLi solution from the DNV classification society in June 2023. This solution helps ship-owners and operators comply with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and carbon intensity by 40% by 2030.Finally  at the beginning of October  Ascenz Marorka announced the creation of a Real-time Fleet Performance Monitoring Centre. The centre brings together a team of maritime experts with in-depth knowledge in navigation  meteorology  performance management  LNG operations and offshore operations to offer a holistic approach to optimise vessel operation.- ElogenFrom the commercial point of view  Elogen is continuing to implement its selective approach to projects  while showing good sales momentum and a growing order book (20.3 million euros at September 30  2023).In July 2023  Elogen signed its first contract with its Korean partner Valmax for the construction of a 2.5 MW electrolyser. In September 2023  Elogen signed a new contract with Valmax for the construction of a second 2.5 MW electrolyser. With a production capacity of up to one tonne of hydrogen per day each  these two electrolysers will be integrated into mobility projects in Korea.As previously announced  during the first half of 2023  Elogen secured a flagship contract with CrossWind  a joint venture between Shell and Eneco  to build a 2.5 MW electrolyser for an offshore wind farm off the Netherlands coast.Elogen is pursuing the implementation of its strategy around three imperatives: “Be efficient  be reliable  be ready”. Within this framework  Elogen is developing its R&D activities to improve the competitiveness and energy efficiency of its solutions  diversifying its technologies to produce large-scale electrolysers and continuing the development of its network of local partners for Balance-Of-Plant assembly and maintenance. The company is also strengthening its technical and project management teams. Finally  Elogen is gearing up for industrial scale-up with its Vendôme gigafactory project (part of the IPCEI Hydrogen programme). Construction will begin in December 2023.- Development of new technologiesInnovation in the field of LNG carriersAt the start of the year  GTT obtained several approvals in principle for the adoption of new technologies in the LNG carrier field. A notable example was from Lloyd’s Register concerning a new LNG carrier design in collaboration with Samsung Heavy Industries  incorporating the three-tank concept developed by GTT and equipped with the Mark III Flex membrane containment system.Innovation in the field of LNG-fuelled vessels / alternative fuelsIn September 2023  GTT obtained three new approvals in principle from ABS in the field of alternative fuels. These approvals are for the following concepts  all equipped with GTT Mark III system:A dual-fuel very large crude carrier (VLCC) with a 12 500 m 3 LNG tank  developed in collaboration with Deltamarin;LNG tank  developed in collaboration with Deltamarin; A dual-fuel Suezmax tanker with a 5 500 m 3 LNG tank  developed in collaboration with Deltamarin;LNG tank  developed in collaboration with Deltamarin; An LNG tank allowing a pressure of up to 1 barg for LNG-as-fuel applications.As already announced  numerous other approvals in the field of alternative fuels were received by GTT in the first half of 2023  notably from the classification societies ClassNK  Bureau Veritas and DNV.Developments in the field of liquid hydrogen transportationIn July 2023  GTT received an approval in principle from ClassNK for a new concept of membrane containment system for liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ).As previously announced  in April 2023  GTT  TotalEnergies  LMG Marin and Bureau Veritas signed an agreement for a joint development project aimed at developing a concept for a LH 2 carrier with a capacity of 150 000 m3  equipped with GTT’s membrane containment system.- GTT Strategic VenturesGTT Strategic Ventures  the GTT Group’s investment fund  is dedicated to minority investments in technology start-ups  whose innovations have the potential to contribute to the Group's strategic roadmap.In September 2023  GTT Strategic Ventures announced that it had led a funding round to support the development of bound4blue  the technology expert in wind-assisted automated propulsion systems for maritime transportation. Following this transaction  GTT holds approximately 9% of the voting rights of the company.A technology company founded in 2014  bound4blue develops wind-assisted propulsion systems called “suction sails”  which enable ship-owners and vessel operators to reduce their fuel consumption for more sustainable and economically efficient maritime transportation.This is the third investment made by GTT Strategic Ventures since September 2022.Order book at September 30  2023At January 1  2023  GTT’s order book excluding LNG as fuel comprised 274 units. It has since changed as follows:Deliveries completed: 21 LNG carriers  2 ethane carriers  2 FSU;Orders received: 52 LNG carriers  1 FLNGAt September 30  2023  the order book excluding LNG as fuel stood at 302 units  broken down as follows:287 LNG carriers;2 ethane carriers;1 FSRU;1 FLNG;11 onshore storage tanks.Regarding LNG as fuel  following the delivery of one vessel and 15 orders for 15 containership tanks  the number of vessels in the order book stood at 84 units at September 30  2023.Evolution of consolidated revenues for the first nine months of 2023(in millions of euros) 9M 2022 9M 2023 Change Revenues 222.0 300.0 +35.1% New builds 200.4 272.6 +36.0% LNG/ethane carriers 174.7 246.9 +41.3% FSUs1 13.6 2.4 -82.2% FSRUs2 - - - FLNGs3 1.2 - -100.0% Onshore storage tanks and GBSs4 8.0 3.4 -57.4% LNG-powered vessels 2.9 19.9 +595.6% Electrolysers 3.0 6.7 +124.5% Services 18.7 20.7 +10.8%Consolidated revenues for the first nine months of 2023 were 300 million euros  up 35.1% compared to the first nine months of 2022. Revenues for the third quarter of 2023 amounted to 122.2 million euros  up 57.0% compared to the third quarter of 2022  benefitting from the gradual increase in the number of LNG carriers under construction.Newbuild revenues amounted to 272.6 million euros  up 36.0% compared to newbuild revenues for the first nine months of 2022. Royalties amounted to 246.9 million euros from LNG and ethane carriers  2.4 million euros from FSUs and 3.4 million euros from onshore storage tanks and GBSs. Royalties generated by the LNG-as-fuel business (19.9 million euros  +595.6%) are now benefitting from the large number of orders received in 2021 and 2022.Revenues from the Elogen electrolyser business amounted to 6.7 million euros for the first nine months of 2023  reflecting the strong order book growth seen in 2022.Revenues from services were up by 10.8% at 20.7 million euros for the first nine months of 2023  with income from assistance services for vessels in operation and material certifications more than offsetting the decrease in pre-project studies  for which demand is fluctuating by nature.2023 objectives expected in the upper half of the rangesIn its 2022 annual results press release dated February 16  2023  the Group issued the following objectives for 2023  assuming no significant order deferrals or cancellations:2023 consolidated revenues of between 385 million euros and 430 million euros 2023 consolidated EBITDA of between 190 million euros and 235 million euros the distribution of a dividend for the 2023 financial year corresponding to a minimum payout ratio of 80% of consolidated net income5.Given the absence of any significant delay in ship construction schedules during the first nine months of 2023  the Group now expects to reach the upper half of the revenue and EBITDA ranges indicated last February.***First nine months of 2023 activity update presentationPhilippe Berterottière  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  and Thierry Hochoa  Chief Financial Officer  will comment on GTT’s business during the first nine months of 2023 and answer questions from the financial community during a conference call to be held  in English  on Wednesday  October 25  2023  at 8.30 a.m. Paris time.This conference will be broadcast live on GTT’s website (www.gtt.fr/finance).To participate in the conference call  please dial one of the following numbers five to ten minutes before the start of the conference:France: +33 1 70 91 87 04UK: +44 1 212 818 004USA: +1 718 705 87 96Confirmation code: 140215The presentation document will be available on the website on October 25  2023  from 7.30 a.m.Financial agendaPayment of an interim dividend of 1.85 euro per share for the 2023 financial year: December 14  2023 (ex-dividend date December 12  2023)Publication of 2023 annual results: February 26  2024 (after close of trading)2024 first-quarter activity update: April 19  2024 (after close of trading)Shareholders’ Meeting: June 12  2024Publication of 2024 half-year results: July 25  2024 (after close of trading)2024 third-quarter activity update: October 25  2024 (after close of trading)About GTTGTT is a technological expert in containment systems with cryogenic membranes used to transport and store liquefied gases.

On 5 May 2023  the Board of Directors appointed Mr. John Textor as Chairman of the Board of Directors and interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company on 5 May 2023  replacing Mr. Jean-Michel Aulas[4] .1/ REVENUES AND RESULTSin €M (from 1 July to 30 June) 30/06/23 30/06/22 Varin M€ Varin % Revenue excluding player trading 199.1 160.5 38.7 +24% Gains on sale of player registrations 77.3 53.6 23.7 44% Revenue from sale of player registrations 90.5 92.1 -1.6 -2% Residual value of players registrations -13.2 -38.6 25.3 -66% Total revenue (API*) 289.7 252.6 37.1 +15% External purchases and expenses -113.2 -91.2 -22.0 -24% Taxes other than income taxes -8.4 -7.5 -0.9 -11% Personnel costs -156.7 -99.4 -57.3 -58% EBITDA -1.8 15.9 -17.7 - Net depreciation  amortisation and provisions -62.0 -65.8 3.7 +6% Other ordinary income and expenses -12.5 8.7 -21.2 - Operating profit/loss -76.3 -41.1 -35.2 -86% Net financial expense -22.8 -15.7 -7.1 -45% Pre-tax profit/loss -99.1 -56.8 -42.3 -74% Income tax expense 1.3 1.8 -0.5 -29% Share in net profit/loss of associates -1.1 0.0 -1.1 - Net profit/loss -99.0 -55.0 -44.0 -80% Net profit/loss attributable to equity holders of the parent -97.8 -54.1 -43.7 -81%*API (Alternative Performance Indicator) created at 30/06/20 ""Total business income""  which includes income from non-trading activities as well as income from the sale of player contractsACTIVITY IN THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2022/23Total operating revenues amounted to €289.7M  compared with €252.6M in the previous financial year  an increase of €37.1m (+15%) (see press release of 25 July 2023).EBITDA: -€1.8m (€15.9m in N-1)Purchases and external charges totaled €113.2M  compared with €91.2M in the previous year  an increase of €22M (+24%)  reflecting on the one hand the growth in business (Events  Derivatives  etc.) and on the other hand the global inflationary context  which is having an impact on operating costs  particularly electricity costs  which increased by a factor of 3 over the year. Operating expenses also include one-off costs relating to the Eagle Football deal  totaling €5.9M.Personnel costs came to €156.7M  compared with €99.4M as of 30 June 2022. In N-1  they had benefited from URSSAF aid (in connection with the COVID health crisis) amounting to €42.8m  recorded as a deduction from expenses. Restated for the URSSAF aid in N-1  personnel costs rose by €14.5m (+10%)  mainly due to the arrival and extension of players (Lacazette  Tolisso  Lovren  Lepenant  Caqueret  etc.)  and to a lesser extent to the increase in the Group's average workforce and salary increases in line with inflation and the end of the Covid crisis.NET INCOMENet income (Group share) was -€97.8M (-€54.1M in N-1).As of 30 June 2023  “Other ordinary operating income and expenses” amounted to - €12.5M  mainly including the €10M termination indemnity for the service agreement between Holnest and OL Groupe. In N-1  they amounted to €8.7M  including state aid in connection with the health crisis.Net amortization and provisions amounted to €62.0M (€65.8M in N-1). Net amortization and provisions on player contracts amounted to €41.2M (€46.3M in N-1)  including a one-off charge of €8.3M for additional amortization on player contracts sold after the balance sheet date.Net financial expense was -€22.8M (-€15.7M in N-1). The deterioration was due in particular to the impact of the first interest payments under PGE 2 and the increase in Euribor rate (€3M)  interest on the RCF line (€0.8M) correlated with the increase in the average drawdown (€31.4M vs. €0.5M in N-1)  charges on debt financing (€3.2M)  and interest on the Eagle Football current account (€1.2m). In total  the impact of the completion of the transaction with Eagle Football is estimated at €3.2M on financial expenses for the year.2/ SIMPLIFIED BALANCE SHEET* AND DEBTASSETS (M€) 30/062023 30/062022 LIABILITIES (M€) 30/062023 30/062022 Player registrations 53.3 73.3 Equity (incl.non controlling interests) 3 105.4 78.1 Property  plant and equipment1 444.3 384.0 Infrastructure bonds and bank loans4 114.2 160.5 Other non-current assets (including assets held for sale) 57.6 6.1 Other borrowings and financial liabilities5 344.2 222.9 TOTAL NON-CURRENT ASSETS 555.2 463.4 TOTAL FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 458.5 383.4 Deferred tax 5.7 4.8 Provisions 3.0 2.7 Player registration receivables 22.9 40.2 Player registration payables 44.2 55.8 Other assets2 123.1 115.8 Other liabilities 29.8 21.8 Treasury 34.6 27.5 Current liabilities 100.7 109.9 TOTAL ASSETS 741.5 651.6 TOTAL LIABILITIES 741.5 651.6 *simplified presentation  not conforming to IFRS standards 1 including IFRS 16 impact 3 o/w TSDI (excl. structuring costs) 10.5 10.5 o/w stadium NBV 300.2 307.9 4 o/w recovery bonds (excl. structuring costs) 19.0 18.5 o/w training center NBV 15.8 16.6 5 including IFRS 16 impact o/w OL Academy NBV 8.1 9.2 o/w RCF drawdown (excl. structuring costs) 52.0 0.0 o/w Arena NBV 113.1 44.8 o/w ""PGE"" borrowings (excl. struct. costs) 149.2 169.0 o/w other NBV 7.2 5.5 o/w property lease debt (excl. struct. costs) 104.5 42.92 o/w funds advanced by OL Groupe under the property lease 40.7 40.7 o/w shareholder loan 22.2 0.0Shareholders' equity (including minority interests) benefited from the capital increase subscribed by Eagle Football in December 2022 (€83.3M  net of expenses) and was impacted by another year of heavy losses. It therefore totaled €105.4M (vs. €78.1M as of 30 June 2022).As of 30 June 2023  Infrastructure bonds and bank borrowings reflected the early repayment of €50M of long-term debt relating to the stadium  in accordance with the agreements reached with the Group's lenders as part of the transaction with Eagle Football in December 2022  and amounted to €114.2M  compared with €160.5M as of 30 June 2022.The increase in other borrowings (up €121.4M) was due to the setting up of a shareholder's current account with Eagle Football (up €22.2M)  the drawdown on the RCF line (€52M vs. 0 in N-1)  and the increase in CBI debt relating to the Arena (up €61.6M) in line with the progress of the works. Conversely  other borrowings benefited from the first repayments of PGE debt (-€20M).Net assets linked to players' contracts amounted to €53.3M (€73.3M in N-1)  reflecting disposals during the year (Lucas PAQUETA  Cenk OZKACAR)  acquisitions of players' contracts (Johann LEPENANT  Achraf LAAZIRI  Nicolas TAGLIAFICO  Saël KUMBEDI  Amin SAAR and Jeffinho)  and amortization plans.At the same time  payables on player contracts amounted to €44.2M  compared with €55.8M as of 30 June 2022  and receivables on player contracts to €22.9M  compared with €40.2M at N-1. As a result  the net balance between payables and receivables on player contracts fell slightly to -€21.2M from -€15.7M as of 30 June 2022.As of 30 June 2023  the market value of the men's professional squad is estimated at €274M (OL value based on Transfermarkt and CIES)  compared with €269M as of 30 June 2022  resulting in a still high level of potential capital gains  estimated at over €220M (nearly €200M as of 30 June 2022). The proportion of potential capital gains on Academy players continued to rise  accounting for 68% of total potential capital gains (62% in N-1).Property  plant and equipment (including the impact of IFRS 16)  mainly comprising infrastructure (stadium  training centre and Arena)  amounted to €444.3M (€384.0M as of 30 June 2022). The change is mainly due to the progress of work on the Arena  which is scheduled for completion at the end of 2023.Other non-current assets (including current assets held for sale) increased by €51.5M (€57.6M as of 30 June 2023  compared with €6.1M in N-1). This change is mainly due to the revaluation of OL Reign shares in the NWSL  carried out as part of the OL Reign disposal  which is currently underway.Total cash and cash equivalents (gross amount) amounted to €34.5M (€27.3M in N-1).Net cash debt (excluding player contract liabilities and receivables) amounted to €383.1M (€315.1M in N-1)  reflecting the €121.5M increase in Other financial debt (detailed above) and the reduction in bonds and bank infrastructure loans (in particular the partial early repayment of the €50M long-term stadium debt).Net cash debt (including net receivables and payables on player contracts) came to €404.4M  compared with €330.8M in N-1.As of 30 June 2023  the Group benefited from a ""holiday covenant"" from its lenders.3/ RECENT EVENTSThe compulsory simplified tender offer (the ""Tender Offer"") filed by Eagle Football ran from 20 July to 2 August 2023 and enabled minority shareholders wishing to do so to obtain liquidity at the same price as that offered by Eagle Football to the Company's former reference shareholders (Pathé  IDG and Holnest)  i.e. €3 per share. Following completion of this takeover bid on 4 August 2023  Eagle Football now holds 87.69% of the Company's share capital (Holnest retaining an 8.23% stake).In terms of the Company's management and governance  following the appointment of John Textor as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on 5 May  the Executive Committee was strengthened with the arrival of Santiago Cucci as interim executive president on 13 July. At the same time  the Board of Directors was largely reconstituted  with several resignations and the co-option of Michele Kang  Bethel Gottlieb and Deborah Andrews in September 2023. The Board now has 12 members  5 of whom are independent. The Board's committees have also been reconstituted.On the sporting front  the 2023 summer transfer period was a very active one (see details in the appendix)  in compliance with the a framework for payroll and transfer compensation decided by the DNCG at the beginning of July 2023. The sales of the player registrations caried out during July and August 2023 represent more than €90M. Fabio Grosso  OL's former Italian international player  was appointed head coach on 16 September following the departure of Laurent Blanc.The start of the financial year 2023/2024 will also be marked by significant events activity  with a concert by the Red Hot Chili Peppers (11 July 2023) and five Rugby World Cup matches at Groupama Stadium (in September and October 2023).4/ OUTLOOKAfter the first two payments (€40M in total) linked to the LFP/CVC[5] deal  the Group should benefit from the 3rd and final tranche of payments (€50M) in 2023/2024  subject to completion of the forthcoming deals between LFP and CVC Capital Partners.The Group is also actively working on refinancing the majority[6] of its existing debt  and negotiations with several leading financial institutions are well advanced. The Group is confident in its ability to finalize this long-maturity refinancing before the 30 June 2024 deadline.Construction work on the LDLC Arena  which is currently 100% owned by OL Groupe  is nearing completion. The venue is due to open on 23 November this year  with a full program already on offer  including 11 LDLC Asvel Euroleague basketball matches  as well as shows and events by Florence Foresti  Lomepal  Sting  Calogero  Shaka Ponk  Michel Sardou  Hoshi  Grand corps Malade  Slimane  Patrick Bruel  Alors On Danse  ERA  Molière Opéra Urbain  Starmania  Gims  etcThe Groupama Stadium has a rich program of events lined up for the coming months  including some major concerts: Taylor Swift (2 and 3 June 2024)  Rammstein (15 June 2024)  Coldplay (22  23 and 25 June 2024) as well as sporting events the France/England rugby match (16 March 2024 - 6 Nations Tournament)  a French football team match (March 2024)  11 football matches (men's and women's) as part of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games (July and August 2024)  the opening and closing ceremonies of WorldSkills Lyon 2024 at the Groupama Stadium and the LDLC Arena (September 2024)  and the TOP 14 semi-finals (June 2025).On the sporting front  the club's ambition remains recurring participation in the European Cup. After a difficult start to the season 23/24  the club wants to do everything it can to improve its performance in the short term and move closer to the top of the French Ligue 1 league table.The creation by OL Groupe and Michele Kang of a global multi-team structure dedicated to women's football  announced last May  should be completed shortly provided final conditions are met. The Group would hold 48%[7] of the share capital of a new structure (Kyniska Sports Group)  to which the Olympique Lyonnais women's team and the Washington Spirit (an NWSL team) would be contributed. The new organization aims to acquire additional women's clubs in other countries.Given the Group's and Michele Kang's future indirect stakes in OL Reign and Washington Spirit  both of which play in the American women's NWSL  OL Groupe is working on the disposal of its stake in OL Reign in order to eliminate any future conflict of interest within the NWSL and annual operating losses from this entity.5/ STRATEGIC ROADMAPIn general  the Group intends to refocus on its activities related to men's football and to divest all or part of certain non-core assets  the proceeds from the sale of which could be used to invest in the training and development of young players and to reduce the Group's debt.At the same time  OL Groupe is considering the possibility of listing its shares in the United States on the New York Stock Exchange to potentially realize greater liquidity and valuation benefits (following a preliminary reorganisation whereby the Eagle Football group's interests in each of Palace Holdco UK Limited  SAF Botafogo and RWD Molenbeek Future SA may be transferred to OL Groupe  with the latter becoming the holding company owning the interests in each football club in which the Eagle Football group has ownership interests). Such a listing  if completed  could be announced during the 1st half of 2024.In this context  the Company's objective is to further develop its capabilities  benefitting in particular from the resources and synergies (such as operational synergies between the aforementioned football clubs and the Company  notably relating to player transfers or player loans between such clubs  and the sharing of administrative and sport best practices)  while retaining its identity  heritage and community base.This is part of a global strategy  aimed at fostering collaboration between communities  clubs  the strengthening of competitive positions and enhancing fan experience  with the support of an investment consortium having significant experience in the ownership  management and development of sporting organizations.In connection with this global strategy  it is also envisaged to broaden the corporate purpose of the Company and to change its legal name. Such changes will be subject to the approval of the next general shareholders' meeting.In view of the redefinition of the Group's strategy  including in particular the envisaged acquisitions and disposal of certain assets  OL Groupe will communicate its medium-term objectives at a later date.This document contains indications about OL Groupe's objectives. The reader's attention is drawn to the fact that the achievement of these objectives may be affected by known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which could cause OL Groupe's future results  performance and achievements to differ significantly from the objectives formulated or suggested. These factors may include changes in economic and business conditions  regulations  as well as risk factors detailed in OL Groupe's Half-Year Financial Report at 12/31/22 and in the forthcoming Universal Registration Document 2022/23.""Tel: +33 (0)4 81 07 55 00Fax: +33 (0)4 81 07 45 65Email: investisseurs@ol.frwww.ol.fr Euronext Paris -

Organic growth was 5.8% against a particularly strong Q3 last year. 9-month organic revenue grew by 8.1%.Leading the growth in Q3 were the three activities  Marine & Offshore  Industry and Certification  which delivered double-digit organic growth  driven by the continued momentum in Sustainability and ESG  including marine decarbonization and renewable energy projects. Agri-Food & Commodities delivered low-single-digit organic revenue growth led by Agri-Food markets and government services. Buildings & Infrastructure and Consumer Products Services were flat. Buildings & Infrastructure having seen particularly strong growth in Q3 2022 and Consumer Products Services continuing to be impacted by the consequences of lower consumer spending seen throughout the year.By geography  activities in Americas were solid (29% of revenue; up 6.6% organically)  led by a double-digit increase in Latin America (in Brazil and Chile notably)  as well as in Canada. Europe (33% of revenue; up 4.8% organically) was primarily led by high activity levels in Southern Europe. In Asia Pacific (29% of revenue; up 1.8% organically)  robust growth was achieved in Australia alongside Southern Asia (notably in India) and South-East Asian countries. Finally  activity was also strong in Africa and the Middle East (9% of revenue; up 19.8% organically)  primarily driven by Buildings & Infrastructure and energy projects in the Middle East.The scope effect was a positive 0.3%  reflecting bolt-on acquisitions realized last year  largely offset by a minor disposal.Currency fluctuations had a significant negative impact of 8.4%  mainly due to the strength of the euro against USD and pegged currencies and some emerging countries’ currencies.SOLID FINANCIAL POSITIONAt September 30  2023  the Group's adjusted net financial debt was up on the level recorded at June 30  2023  due to the dividend payment in July 2023.

Double-digit organic revenue growth in the Core In-service activity (45% of divisional revenue)  still led by a sustained high level of occasional surveys  especially on old ships  combined with price increases and the growth of the classified fleet. Slower growth rate in percentage terms remains expected in Q4 after an exceptionally strong Q4 2022 linked to one-off regulatory benefits. At September 30  2023  the fleet classified by Bureau Veritas comprised 11 635 ships  representing 147.2 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT).activity (45% of divisional revenue)  still led by a sustained high level of occasional surveys  especially on old ships  combined with price increases and the growth of the classified fleet. Slower growth rate in percentage terms remains expected in Q4 after an exceptionally strong Q4 2022 linked to one-off regulatory benefits. At September 30  2023  the fleet classified by Bureau Veritas comprised 11 635 ships  representing 147.2 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT). High-single digit organic revenue growth for Services (14% of divisional revenue  including Offshore) was driven by a combination of strong commercial development for non-classification services  including consulting services related to energy efficiency.Bureau Veritas new orders reached 6.8 million gross tons at September 30  2023  bringing the order book to 21.6 million gross tons at the end of the quarter  up 14.3% compared to 18.9 million gross tons at end-September 2022. It is composed of LNG fueled ships  container ships and specialized vessels.Marine & Offshore continued to focus on efficiency levers through digitalization and high added-value services. In September 2023  the Group has announced a strategic partnership with OrbitMI  the New York-based maritime software company  formalized through Bureau Veritas investment in OrbitMI. Aimed at accelerating the development of both existing and new data-driven solutions  the collaboration will leverage combined strengths to address the dual opportunities of the digital transformation and the decarbonization of shipping (more information by clicking here).Sustainability achievementsThis quarter  Bureau Veritas issued its Approval in Principle (AiP) to a shipbuilding group for the design of the newest largest Liquified Natural Gas Carrier (LNGC) in history. In order to do so  a preliminary design review and hazard identification analysis was carried out to help ensure the highest levels of safety  feasibility  and performance of this design in compliance with applicable classification Rules and Regulations.AGRI-FOOD & COMMODITIESIN EUR MILLIONS 2023 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 305.5 323.9 (5.7)% +2.6% - (8.3)% 9M revenue 917.1 911.9 +0.6% +5.1% - (4.5)%The Agri-Food & Commodities business delivered organic revenue growth of 2.6% in the third quarter of 2023  with different trends for each activity. This brought the 9-month organic revenue growth to 5.1%.Oil & Petrochemicals (O&P  31% of divisional revenue) achieved low-single digit organic revenue growth overall. While Europe has been gaining ground with key customers in specific locations (Belgium  Spain  Greece) and is recording high-single-digit organic revenue growth  the O&P Trade activity has also been facing tougher competition in North America and Asia.Throughout the third quarter  non-trade related services and value-added segments such as Verifuel bunker quantity services continued to expand across O&P. Elsewhere  the Group continues to benefit from sustained good demand for its new initiatives around biofuels and OCM (Oil Condition Monitoring).Metals & Minerals (M&M  32% of divisional revenue) faced contrasting trends. Upstream activity’s (nearly two-thirds of M&M) underlying trends are solid  but the growth rate was mitigated by the strong Q3 2022. The Group continued to benefit from the success of its on-site laboratories’ strategy with important wins this quarter. In mining related testing  the Middle East region is starting to benefit from the recent efforts in capabilities expansion and diversification. Trade activities recorded robust revenue growth  with strong trade volumes in Asia.Agri-Food (22% of divisional revenue) activities achieved mid-single-digit organic growth in the third quarter  once again led by Agricultural products. Agricultural trade-related activities showed strong growth  benefiting from the massive exports of key players from Brazilian ports following the exceptionally good harvests for different food commodities (corn  soybean  cotton). The good momentum on biodiesel in Latin America is also supporting the growth. Within the Food business  which grew low-single-digit organically  testing activities in Australia continue to gradually benefit from diversification. The North American and Middle East areas also strongly benefited from the ramp-up of new labs.Government services (15% of divisional revenue) recorded high single-digit organic revenue growth in the third quarter  with a sustained strong growth delivered in Asia  Middle East and Africa. This was driven by the solid ramp-up of the newly signed VOC (Verification of Conformity) and Single Window contracts across the World.Sustainability achievementsIn the third quarter of 2023  the group provided cargo inspection and sampling services on biofuels products made from multi-seed crush and vegetable oils on behalf of an American global food corporation in Belgium. The Group was also awarded a Sustainability data assurance contract for one of the world’s largest Food companies.INDUSTRYIN EUR MILLIONS 2023 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 309.0 305.0 +1.3% +16.2% (1.4)% (13.5)% 9M revenue 927.3 867.4 +6.9% +15.8% (0.5)% (8.4)%Industry delivered strong organic revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023 with organic growth of 16.2%  in line with the previous quarters. This brought the 9-month organic revenue growth to 15.8%.All segments and most geographies contributed to the divisional growth  with Americas  Middle East and Africa outperforming. Energy transition remained a key catalyst overall and triggered clean energy investment and decarbonation solutions which benefited the division.By market  Power & Utilities (14% of divisional revenue) remained a growth driver for the portfolio with a double-digit organic performance for Capex activities during the third quarter. In Latin America  the Group continues to benefit from its leading grid Opex platform and contract wins with various Power Distribution clients  although the growth is cushioned by the Group’s desire to be more selective on contract profitability  as illustrated by a large contract termination in Chile in the last quarter of 2022. In Europe  the nuclear power generation segment was a growth enhancer  notably in the UK  France and in Eastern countries (dismantling projects in Lithuania).Renewable Power Generation activities (solar  wind  hydrogen) maintained strong momentum during the quarter  with a high double-digit organic performance delivered across most geographies. The US delivered a stellar performance led by Bureau Veritas’ Bradley Construction Management activities focusing on solar  onshore wind and high-voltage transmission projects. In the third quarter  Bureau Veritas launched its Renewable Ammonia scheme  which helps assure safe  sustainable ammonia production from renewable energy. This followed the launch of its Renewable Hydrogen scheme early 2023.In Oil & Gas (33% of divisional revenue)  double-digit organic revenue growth was maintained in the third quarter. The two-thirds of the business related to Opex services increased 22.9% led by the conversion of a solid sales pipeline. Capex-related activities grew double-digit organically  benefiting from to the startup of new projects in the gas sector (LNG). Large contracts ramped up in the US  Australia  Middle East  Africa and Latin America  in Brazil in particular.The non-energy activities performed well driven by both Opex and Capex services. They benefited from a range of drivers around ageing assets  tightening regulations  and willingness to manage assets in a more sustainable way from different industries (towards net zero targets). In Canada  Site Assessment & Remediation continued to drive business with new infrastructure projects and increased concerns about PFAS.Sustainability achievementsIn the third quarter of 2023  Bureau Veritas was awarded a major contract in South Korea with Anma Offshore Wind Energy Co. (a consortium of Hyundai Engineering & KHNP)  to provide integrated QA/QC services during the fabrication  manufacture  and installation of all major components of the 0.5 GW offshore wind farm. In Saudi Arabia  the Group was also selected to deliver owner's engineering services including design review  procurement support and construction supervision for a 1.4 GW solar photovoltaic farm.BUILDINGS & INFRASTRUCTUREIN EUR MILLIONS 2023 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 413.8 427.2 (3.1)% +0.1% +1.4% (4.6)% 9M revenue 1 282.6 1 205.0 +6.4% +7.0% +2.0% (2.6)%The Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) business achieved an organic growth of 0.1% in the third quarter of 2023 against very challenging comparables. This brought the 9-month organic revenue growth to 7.0%.During the period  the building-in service activity outperformed the construction-related activities.The Americas region (28% of divisional revenue) delivered varied performance by geography. In Latin America  a strong growth was recorded thanks to the ramp-up of large Capex contracts for project management assistance. In Northern America  the activity was lower after strong numbers in Q3 2022 and efforts to improve contract revenue mix with enhanced selectivity on some contracts. In addition  persistent high interest rates continued to create headwinds for the commercial real estate transactions business. The rest of the Group’s diversified portfolio performed well with data center commissioning leading growth  up double-digit organically; code compliance was robust as the business benefits from its exposure to the most attractive geographies in terms of population growth.In Europe (49% of divisional revenue)  moderate growth was delivered led by a double-digit performance in Italy  the Netherlands and the UK thanks to more stringent regulation benefiting both Opex and Capex activities around energy efficiency and building safety. The broadly stable activity in France (37% of divisional revenue) stemmed from an expected seasonality effect on revenue in relation to energy efficiency for the Opex business (three quarter of French operations). Beyond  growth momentum remained steady with continued price increases  while the capex related activities grew slightly  above the market  as it is more weighted towards infrastructure and public works versus residential building. In the fourth quarter  the growth is expected to resume.The Asia-Pacific and Middle East region (23% of divisional revenue) was slightly down year on year on an organic basis. While outstanding performances were delivered in India and Southeastern Asia  the Chinese activity suffered from the unfavorable comparable following the reopening of the Chinese market in the prior year (post lockdown measures in Q2 2022) and from lower spend for infrastructure projects in the transportation field. The Power-related construction activities remained robust and benefited from the energy transition drive.The Middle East & Africa region was the best-performing area  recording a double-digit organic revenue increase in the third quarter. In the Middle East  the Group continued to deliver very high growth primarily led by the roll-out of numerous development projects. In Saudi Arabia  the Group is still strongly engaged in delivering QA/QC Services for the NEOM smart city project.Sustainability achievementsIn the third quarter of 2023  the Group was awarded several contracts in the field of energy audits and sustainability requirements. This ranges from implementing several energy audit campaigns according to the EU Energy Efficiency Directives for large asset owners to establishing a decarbonization pathway by performing energy assessments and simulating carbon trajectory for real estate owners. The Group was also selected to co-develop a sustainability standard for Unibail Rodamco Westfield  as part of its Better Places 2030 strategy  followed by audits and monitoring of the label on their european portfolio.CERTIFICATIONIN EUR MILLIONS 2023 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 106.7 101.2 +5.4% +11.7% - (6.3)% 9M revenue 334.5 310.4 +7.7% +11.4% - (3.7)%The Certification business recorded strong organic growth of 11.7% in the third quarter of 2023  a similar growth trend to the last two quarters (9-month organic revenue growth of 11.4%).This was supported by both volume and price increases. The acceleration of our portfolio diversification also continued to drive growth with a quarter of the divisional revenue contributing to nearly half of the growth.The growth was broad-based across the schemes and the geographies. Americas  Asia Pacific and the Middle East and Africa region delivered the strongest organic revenue performances thanks to commercial development and exposure to new services including Sustainability and CSR-driven solutions.During the period  the business continued to be led by the increased client demand for more brand protection  traceability  and social responsibility commitments all along the supply chain. Double-digit growth was recorded for QHSE schemes  Supply Chain and Food Safety. Sustainability-driven solutions grew 21% fueled by a continuing high demand for verification of greenhouse gas emissions and supply chain audits on ESG topics. In the near future  it will benefit from the upcoming regulatory changes (CS3D -Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence-  EU Deforestation Regulation  EU CSRD -Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive-) which will require more audit and certification services than done voluntarily today.The momentum remained strong on solutions dedicated to companies around IT Service Management and information security. In particular  the Cybersecurity offering posted stellar performance similarly to H1 2023. This is due to an extremely robust commercial development and by rising demand for more control on security systems.Sustainability achievementsIn the third quarter of 2023  Bureau Veritas has signed a partnership with Capgemini  a global leader in business consulting  technology and engineering. Both companies will jointly deliver a structured and scalable approach to help companies bring transparency and credibility to their ESG commitments and put their Sustainability strategy in motion. Through its proprietary ESG solution  Clarity  Bureau Veritas will be able to assess a customer organization and prioritize the global digitalization of their ESG data  monitor the progress and review the data collection in accordance with relevant standards.During the period  Bureau Veritas won numerous contracts in the Sustainability field. For instance  the Group was selected by the government of Dubai (Legal Affairs department) to train and audit law firms on their sustainability and quality practices yearly. The Group was also awarded the Sustainability Assurance services for the 2023 annual report of a large pharmaceutical company.CONSUMER PRODUCTS SERVICESIN EUR MILLIONS 2023 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 178.8 195.1 (8.4)% 0.0% +0.9% (9.3)% 9M revenue 527.9 546.6 (3.4)% (2.0)% +4.2% (5.6)%The Consumer Products Services division recorded a stable performance in the third quarter of 2023  a slight improvement compared to the first half of 2023  with varying geographical and service trends.During the period  Asia remained the region most impacted by the weak consumer spending backdrop  while the Americas (especially Latin America) and the Middle East & Africa continue to benefit from the diversification strategy implemented over the last years.Softlines  Hardlines & Toys (49% of divisional revenue) saw low-single-digit organic growth in the third quarter of 2023. Softlines showed mixed performance by country: China returned to growth  Southern Asia maintained a strong momentum (led by Bangladesh and India) -still benefiting from the structural sourcing shift outside of China- and growth was moderated in South-Eastern Asia facing challenging comparables.Health  Beauty & Household (8% of divisional revenue) recorded solid double-digit organic growth in Q3  led by the US and Asia. China notably benefited from two recent labs openings. Advanced Testing Laboratory (ATL) and Galbraith Laboratories Inc.  which were both acquired last year in the US  progressed well with a promising sales pipeline.Inspection & Audit services (13% of divisional revenue) maintained their growth thanks to strong momentum for Sustainability services over the course of the third quarter of 2023. This includes organic  recycling  social audits and green claim verification across most geographies.Lastly  Technology8 (30% of divisional revenue)  as expected  saw a single-digit organic contraction  still affected by the global decrease in demand for electrical and wireless equipment as well as the resulting temporary reduction in new product launches. The New Mobility sub-segment delivered double-digit growth  led by both Asia and the US  thanks to the ramp-up of a new lab in Detroit  Michigan. This reflected good traction on testing of electric vehicle systems and component. In the third quarter of 2023  the Group continued to pursue its geographical diversification strategy by opening an electronic ATEX (European Directives for controlling explosive atmospheres) regulated lab in Brazil.Sustainability achievementsIn the third quarter of 2023  the Group won a contract with one of the world's leading sportswear and footwear brand to help them in their supply chain decarbonization efforts through SBTI & greenhouse gas reduction programs. Bureau Veritas also performed social audits for a major European food delivery service company as part of its supply chain due diligence program for products used in their daily business (helmets  delivery bags).PRESENTATION Q3 2023 revenue will be presented on Wednesday  October 25  2023  at 6:00 p.m. (Paris time) An audio conference will be webcast live.

These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group’s budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Group’s performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (“TIC”) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as a complement to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.GROWTHTotal revenue growthThe total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:organic growth;impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect);impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growthThe Group internally monitors and publishes “organic” revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Group’s operating performance in each of its business sectors.The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  or organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control  as well as scope effects  which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Group’s performance internally.Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations – in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends.The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses  and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Group level and for each business  based on constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period;constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.Scope effectTo establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:for acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year;for acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated;for disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group;for disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.Currency effectThe currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.1 Alternative performance indicators are presented  defined and reconciled with IFRS in appendices 6 and 8 of this press release.2 Net cash generated from operating activities/Adjusted Operating Profit.3 Net cash generated from operating activities/Adjusted Operating Profit.4 TAR: Total Accident Rate (number of accidents with and without lost time x 200 000/number of hours worked).5 Proportion of women on the Executive Committee in Band II (internal grade corresponding to an executive management position) in the Group (number of women on a full-time equivalent basis in a leadership position/total number of full-time equivalents in leadership positions).6 Indicator calculated over a 9-month period compared to a 12-month period for FY 2022 and 2025 target values.7 Greenhouse gas emissions from offices and laboratories  12 months trailing tons of CO 2 equivalent per employee and per year for Scopes 1  2 and 3 (emissions related to business travel).8 The Technology segment comprises Electrical & Electronics  Wireless testing activities and Automotive connectivity testing

Organic growth was 5.8% against a particularly strong Q3 last year. 9-month organic revenue grew by 8.1%.Leading the growth in Q3 were the three activities  Marine & Offshore  Industry and Certification  which delivered double-digit organic growth  driven by the continued momentum in Sustainability and ESG  including marine decarbonization and renewable energy projects. Agri-Food & Commodities delivered low-single-digit organic revenue growth led by Agri-Food markets and government services. Buildings & Infrastructure and Consumer Products Services were flat. Buildings & Infrastructure having seen particularly strong growth in Q3 2022 and Consumer Products Services continuing to be impacted by the consequences of lower consumer spending seen throughout the year.By geography  activities in Americas were solid (29% of revenue; up 6.6% organically)  led by a double-digit increase in Latin America (in Brazil and Chile notably)  as well as in Canada. Europe (33% of revenue; up 4.8% organically) was primarily led by high activity levels in Southern Europe. In Asia Pacific (29% of revenue; up 1.8% organically)  robust growth was achieved in Australia alongside Southern Asia (notably in India) and South-East Asian countries. Finally  activity was also strong in Africa and the Middle East (9% of revenue; up 19.8% organically)  primarily driven by Buildings & Infrastructure and energy projects in the Middle East.The scope effect was a positive 0.3%  reflecting bolt-on acquisitions realized last year  largely offset by a minor disposal.Currency fluctuations had a significant negative impact of 8.4%  mainly due to the strength of the euro against USD and pegged currencies and some emerging countries’ currencies.SOLID FINANCIAL POSITIONAt September 30  2023  the Group's adjusted net financial debt was up on the level recorded at June 30  2023  due to the dividend payment in July 2023. The Group had EUR 0.9 billion in available cash and cash equivalents and EUR 600 million in undrawn committed credit lines. Bureau Veritas has a solid financial structure with the bulk of its maturities beyond 2025 and 100% at fixed interest rates.2023 OUTLOOK CONFIRMEDBased on the 9-month performance  a healthy sales pipeline and the significant growth opportunities related to Sustainability and energy transition  Bureau Veritas expects for full-year 2023 to deliver:mid-to-high single-digit organic revenue growth;a stable adjusted operating margin at constant exchange rates;strong cash flow  with a cash conversion3 above 90%.COMMITMENT TOWARDS EXTRA-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCECorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) key indicatorsUNITED NATIONS’SDGS 9M 2023 FY 2022 2025 target SOCIAL & HUMAN CAPITAL Total Accident Rate (TAR) 4 #3 0.24 0.26 0.26 Proportion of women in leadership positions5 #5 27.5% 29.1% 35.0% Number of learning hours per employee (per year)6 #8 22.9 32.5 35.0 ENVIRONMENT CO 2 emissions per employee (tons per year) 7 #13 2.39 2.32 2.00 GOVERNANCE Proportion of employees trained to the Code of Ethics #16 96.8% 97.1% 99.0%Bureau Veritas’ joined CAC SBT 1.5° indexOn September 18  2023  Bureau Veritas was included in the CAC SBT 1.5° index.

This is the Euronext’s index of the top 40 companies from the CAC Large 60 index (CAC40 + Next 20) in terms of environmental  social and governance (ESG) practices.The Group is also included in various Sustainability indices  such as the DJSI and Axylia’s Vérité 40  and features in S&P Global’s Sustainability Yearbook 2022.Q3 2023 BUSINESS REVIEWMARINE & OFFSHOREIN EUR MILLIONS 2023 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 110.0 104.7 +5.1% +13.4% - (8.3)% 9M revenue 338.6 309.2 +9.5% +14.8% - (5.3)%The Marine & Offshore business was among the best performing businesses within the Group’s portfolio in the third quarter of 2023 with organic growth of 13.4% (9-month organic revenue growth of 14.8%) led by all geographies and activities:Double-digit organic revenue growth in New Construction (41% of divisional revenue)  reflecting the solid backlog and acceleration of new order conversion  pushed by sector drivers across the shipping industry (renewal of the world ageing fleet and decarbonization regulations).(41% of divisional revenue)  reflecting the solid backlog and acceleration of new order conversion  pushed by sector drivers across the shipping industry (renewal of the world ageing fleet and decarbonization regulations). Double-digit organic revenue growth in the Core In-service activity (45% of divisional revenue)  still led by a sustained high level of occasional surveys  especially on old ships  combined with price increases and the growth of the classified fleet. Slower growth rate in percentage terms remains expected in Q4 after an exceptionally strong Q4 2022 linked to one-off regulatory benefits. At September 30  2023  the fleet classified by Bureau Veritas comprised 11 635 ships  representing 147.2 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT).activity (45% of divisional revenue)  still led by a sustained high level of occasional surveys  especially on old ships  combined with price increases and the growth of the classified fleet. Slower growth rate in percentage terms remains expected in Q4 after an exceptionally strong Q4 2022 linked to one-off regulatory benefits. At September 30  2023  the fleet classified by Bureau Veritas comprised 11 635 ships  representing 147.2 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT). High-single digit organic revenue growth for Services (14% of divisional revenue  including Offshore) was driven by a combination of strong commercial development for non-classification services  including consulting services related to energy efficiency.Bureau Veritas new orders reached 6.8 million gross tons at September 30  2023  bringing the order book to 21.6 million gross tons at the end of the quarter  up 14.3% compared to 18.9 million gross tons at end-September 2022. It is composed of LNG fueled ships  container ships and specialized vessels.Marine & Offshore continued to focus on efficiency levers through digitalization and high added-value services. In September 2023  the Group has announced a strategic partnership with OrbitMI  the New York-based maritime software company  formalized through Bureau Veritas investment in OrbitMI. Aimed at accelerating the development of both existing and new data-driven solutions  the collaboration will leverage combined strengths to address the dual opportunities of the digital transformation and the decarbonization of shipping (more information by clicking here).Sustainability achievementsThis quarter  Bureau Veritas issued its Approval in Principle (AiP) to a shipbuilding group for the design of the newest largest Liquified Natural Gas Carrier (LNGC) in history. In order to do so  a preliminary design review and hazard identification analysis was carried out to help ensure the highest levels of safety  feasibility  and performance of this design in compliance with applicable classification Rules and Regulations.AGRI-FOOD & COMMODITIESIN EUR MILLIONS 2023 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 305.5 323.9 (5.7)% +2.6% - (8.3)% 9M revenue 917.1 911.9 +0.6% +5.1% - (4.5)%The Agri-Food & Commodities business delivered organic revenue growth of 2.6% in the third quarter of 2023  with different trends for each activity. This brought the 9-month organic revenue growth to 5.1%.Oil & Petrochemicals (O&P  31% of divisional revenue) achieved low-single digit organic revenue growth overall. While Europe has been gaining ground with key customers in specific locations (Belgium  Spain  Greece) and is recording high-single-digit organic revenue growth  the O&P Trade activity has also been facing tougher competition in North America and Asia.Throughout the third quarter  non-trade related services and value-added segments such as Verifuel bunker quantity services continued to expand across O&P. Elsewhere  the Group continues to benefit from sustained good demand for its new initiatives around biofuels and OCM (Oil Condition Monitoring).Metals & Minerals (M&M  32% of divisional revenue) faced contrasting trends. Upstream activity’s (nearly two-thirds of M&M) underlying trends are solid  but the growth rate was mitigated by the strong Q3 2022. The Group continued to benefit from the success of its on-site laboratories’ strategy with important wins this quarter. In mining related testing  the Middle East region is starting to benefit from the recent efforts in capabilities expansion and diversification. Trade activities recorded robust revenue growth  with strong trade volumes in Asia.Agri-Food (22% of divisional revenue) activities achieved mid-single-digit organic growth in the third quarter  once again led by Agricultural products. Agricultural trade-related activities showed strong growth  benefiting from the massive exports of key players from Brazilian ports following the exceptionally good harvests for different food commodities (corn  soybean  cotton). The good momentum on biodiesel in Latin America is also supporting the growth. Within the Food business  which grew low-single-digit organically  testing activities in Australia continue to gradually benefit from diversification. The North American and Middle East areas also strongly benefited from the ramp-up of new labs.Government services (15% of divisional revenue) recorded high single-digit organic revenue growth in the third quarter  with a sustained strong growth delivered in Asia  Middle East and Africa. This was driven by the solid ramp-up of the newly signed VOC (Verification of Conformity) and Single Window contracts across the World.Sustainability achievementsIn the third quarter of 2023  the group provided cargo inspection and sampling services on biofuels products made from multi-seed crush and vegetable oils on behalf of an American global food corporation in Belgium. The Group was also awarded a Sustainability data assurance contract for one of the world’s largest Food companies.INDUSTRYIN EUR MILLIONS 2023 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 309.0 305.0 +1.3% +16.2% (1.4)% (13.5)% 9M revenue 927.3 867.4 +6.9% +15.8% (0.5)% (8.4)%Industry delivered strong organic revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023 with organic growth of 16.2%  in line with the previous quarters. This brought the 9-month organic revenue growth to 15.8%.All segments and most geographies contributed to the divisional growth  with Americas  Middle East and Africa outperforming. Energy transition remained a key catalyst overall and triggered clean energy investment and decarbonation solutions which benefited the division.By market  Power & Utilities (14% of divisional revenue) remained a growth driver for the portfolio with a double-digit organic performance for Capex activities during the third quarter. In Latin America  the Group continues to benefit from its leading grid Opex platform and contract wins with various Power Distribution clients  although the growth is cushioned by the Group’s desire to be more selective on contract profitability  as illustrated by a large contract termination in Chile in the last quarter of 2022. In Europe  the nuclear power generation segment was a growth enhancer  notably in the UK  France and in Eastern countries (dismantling projects in Lithuania).Renewable Power Generation activities (solar  wind  hydrogen) maintained strong momentum during the quarter  with a high double-digit organic performance delivered across most geographies. The US delivered a stellar performance led by Bureau Veritas’ Bradley Construction Management activities focusing on solar  onshore wind and high-voltage transmission projects. In the third quarter  Bureau Veritas launched its Renewable Ammonia scheme  which helps assure safe  sustainable ammonia production from renewable energy. This followed the launch of its Renewable Hydrogen scheme early 2023.In Oil & Gas (33% of divisional revenue)  double-digit organic revenue growth was maintained in the third quarter. The two-thirds of the business related to Opex services increased 22.9% led by the conversion of a solid sales pipeline. Capex-related activities grew double-digit organically  benefiting from to the startup of new projects in the gas sector (LNG). Large contracts ramped up in the US  Australia  Middle East  Africa and Latin America  in Brazil in particular.The non-energy activities performed well driven by both Opex and Capex services. They benefited from a range of drivers around ageing assets  tightening regulations  and willingness to manage assets in a more sustainable way from different industries (towards net zero targets). In Canada  Site Assessment & Remediation continued to drive business with new infrastructure projects and increased concerns about PFAS.Sustainability achievementsIn the third quarter of 2023  Bureau Veritas was awarded a major contract in South Korea with Anma Offshore Wind Energy Co. (a consortium of Hyundai Engineering & KHNP)  to provide integrated QA/QC services during the fabrication  manufacture  and installation of all major components of the 0.5 GW offshore wind farm. In Saudi Arabia  the Group was also selected to deliver owner's engineering services including design review  procurement support and construction supervision for a 1.4 GW solar photovoltaic farm.BUILDINGS & INFRASTRUCTUREIN EUR MILLIONS 2023 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 413.8 427.2 (3.1)% +0.1% +1.4% (4.6)% 9M revenue 1 282.6 1 205.0 +6.4% +7.0% +2.0% (2.6)%The Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) business achieved an organic growth of 0.1% in the third quarter of 2023 against very challenging comparables. This brought the 9-month organic revenue growth to 7.0%.During the period  the building-in service activity outperformed the construction-related activities.The Americas region (28% of divisional revenue) delivered varied performance by geography. In Latin America  a strong growth was recorded thanks to the ramp-up of large Capex contracts for project management assistance. In Northern America  the activity was lower after strong numbers in Q3 2022 and efforts to improve contract revenue mix with enhanced selectivity on some contracts. In addition  persistent high interest rates continued to create headwinds for the commercial real estate transactions business. The rest of the Group’s diversified portfolio performed well with data center commissioning leading growth  up double-digit organically; code compliance was robust as the business benefits from its exposure to the most attractive geographies in terms of population growth.In Europe (49% of divisional revenue)  moderate growth was delivered led by a double-digit performance in Italy  the Netherlands and the UK thanks to more stringent regulation benefiting both Opex and Capex activities around energy efficiency and building safety. The broadly stable activity in France (37% of divisional revenue) stemmed from an expected seasonality effect on revenue in relation to energy efficiency for the Opex business (three quarter of French operations). Beyond  growth momentum remained steady with continued price increases  while the capex related activities grew slightly  above the market  as it is more weighted towards infrastructure and public works versus residential building. In the fourth quarter  the growth is expected to resume.The Asia-Pacific and Middle East region (23% of divisional revenue) was slightly down year on year on an organic basis. While outstanding performances were delivered in India and Southeastern Asia  the Chinese activity suffered from the unfavorable comparable following the reopening of the Chinese market in the prior year (post lockdown measures in Q2 2022) and from lower spend for infrastructure projects in the transportation field. The Power-related construction activities remained robust and benefited from the energy transition drive.The Middle East & Africa region was the best-performing area  recording a double-digit organic revenue increase in the third quarter. In the Middle East  the Group continued to deliver very high growth primarily led by the roll-out of numerous development projects. In Saudi Arabia  the Group is still strongly engaged in delivering QA/QC Services for the NEOM smart city project.Sustainability achievementsIn the third quarter of 2023  the Group was awarded several contracts in the field of energy audits and sustainability requirements. This ranges from implementing several energy audit campaigns according to the EU Energy Efficiency Directives for large asset owners to establishing a decarbonization pathway by performing energy assessments and simulating carbon trajectory for real estate owners. The Group was also selected to co-develop a sustainability standard for Unibail Rodamco Westfield  as part of its Better Places 2030 strategy  followed by audits and monitoring of the label on their european portfolio.CERTIFICATIONIN EUR MILLIONS 2023 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 106.7 101.2 +5.4% +11.7% - (6.3)% 9M revenue 334.5 310.4 +7.7% +11.4% - (3.7)%The Certification business recorded strong organic growth of 11.7% in the third quarter of 2023  a similar growth trend to the last two quarters (9-month organic revenue growth of 11.4%).This was supported by both volume and price increases. The acceleration of our portfolio diversification also continued to drive growth with a quarter of the divisional revenue contributing to nearly half of the growth.The growth was broad-based across the schemes and the geographies. Americas  Asia Pacific and the Middle East and Africa region delivered the strongest organic revenue performances thanks to commercial development and exposure to new services including Sustainability and CSR-driven solutions.During the period  the business continued to be led by the increased client demand for more brand protection  traceability  and social responsibility commitments all along the supply chain. Double-digit growth was recorded for QHSE schemes  Supply Chain and Food Safety. Sustainability-driven solutions grew 21% fueled by a continuing high demand for verification of greenhouse gas emissions and supply chain audits on ESG topics. In the near future  it will benefit from the upcoming regulatory changes (CS3D -Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence-  EU Deforestation Regulation  EU CSRD -Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive-) which will require more audit and certification services than done voluntarily today.The momentum remained strong on solutions dedicated to companies around IT Service Management and information security. In particular  the Cybersecurity offering posted stellar performance similarly to H1 2023. This is due to an extremely robust commercial development and by rising demand for more control on security systems.Sustainability achievementsIn the third quarter of 2023  Bureau Veritas has signed a partnership with Capgemini  a global leader in business consulting  technology and engineering. Both companies will jointly deliver a structured and scalable approach to help companies bring transparency and credibility to their ESG commitments and put their Sustainability strategy in motion. Through its proprietary ESG solution  Clarity  Bureau Veritas will be able to assess a customer organization and prioritize the global digitalization of their ESG data  monitor the progress and review the data collection in accordance with relevant standards.During the period  Bureau Veritas won numerous contracts in the Sustainability field. For instance  the Group was selected by the government of Dubai (Legal Affairs department) to train and audit law firms on their sustainability and quality practices yearly. The Group was also awarded the Sustainability Assurance services for the 2023 annual report of a large pharmaceutical company.CONSUMER PRODUCTS SERVICESIN EUR MILLIONS 2023 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 178.8 195.1 (8.4)% 0.0% +0.9% (9.3)% 9M revenue 527.9 546.6 (3.4)% (2.0)% +4.2% (5.6)%The Consumer Products Services division recorded a stable performance in the third quarter of 2023  a slight improvement compared to the first half of 2023  with varying geographical and service trends.During the period  Asia remained the region most impacted by the weak consumer spending backdrop  while the Americas (especially Latin America) and the Middle East & Africa continue to benefit from the diversification strategy implemented over the last years.Softlines  Hardlines & Toys (49% of divisional revenue) saw low-single-digit organic growth in the third quarter of 2023. Softlines showed mixed performance by country: China returned to growth  Southern Asia maintained a strong momentum (led by Bangladesh and India) -still benefiting from the structural sourcing shift outside of China- and growth was moderated in South-Eastern Asia facing challenging comparables.Health  Beauty & Household (8% of divisional revenue) recorded solid double-digit organic growth in Q3  led by the US and Asia. China notably benefited from two recent labs openings. Advanced Testing Laboratory (ATL) and Galbraith Laboratories Inc.  which were both acquired last year in the US  progressed well with a promising sales pipeline.Inspection & Audit services (13% of divisional revenue) maintained their growth thanks to strong momentum for Sustainability services over the course of the third quarter of 2023. This includes organic  recycling  social audits and green claim verification across most geographies.Lastly  Technology8 (30% of divisional revenue)  as expected  saw a single-digit organic contraction  still affected by the global decrease in demand for electrical and wireless equipment as well as the resulting temporary reduction in new product launches. The New Mobility sub-segment delivered double-digit growth  led by both Asia and the US  thanks to the ramp-up of a new lab in Detroit  Michigan. This reflected good traction on testing of electric vehicle systems and component. In the third quarter of 2023  the Group continued to pursue its geographical diversification strategy by opening an electronic ATEX (European Directives for controlling explosive atmospheres) regulated lab in Brazil.Sustainability achievementsIn the third quarter of 2023  the Group won a contract with one of the world's leading sportswear and footwear brand to help them in their supply chain decarbonization efforts through SBTI & greenhouse gas reduction programs. Bureau Veritas also performed social audits for a major European food delivery service company as part of its supply chain due diligence program for products used in their daily business (helmets  delivery bags).PRESENTATION Q3 2023 revenue will be presented on Wednesday  October 25  2023  at 6:00 p.m. (Paris time) An audio conference will be webcast live.

These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group’s budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Group’s performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (“TIC”) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as a complement to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.GROWTHTotal revenue growthThe total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:organic growth;impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect);impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growthThe Group internally monitors and publishes “organic” revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Group’s operating performance in each of its business sectors.The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  or organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control  as well as scope effects  which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Group’s performance internally.Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations – in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends.The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses  and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Group level and for each business  based on constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period;constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.Scope effectTo establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:for acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year;for acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated;for disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group;for disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.Currency effectThe currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.1 Alternative performance indicators are presented  defined and reconciled with IFRS in appendices 6 and 8 of this press release.2 Net cash generated from operating activities/Adjusted Operating Profit.3 Net cash generated from operating activities/Adjusted Operating Profit.4 TAR: Total Accident Rate (number of accidents with and without lost time x 200 000/number of hours worked).5 Proportion of women on the Executive Committee in Band II (internal grade corresponding to an executive management position) in the Group (number of women on a full-time equivalent basis in a leadership position/total number of full-time equivalents in leadership positions).6 Indicator calculated over a 9-month period compared to a 12-month period for FY 2022 and 2025 target values.7 Greenhouse gas emissions from offices and laboratories  12 months trailing tons of CO 2 equivalent per employee and per year for Scopes 1  2 and 3 (emissions related to business travel).8 The Technology segment comprises Electrical & Electronics  Wireless testing activities and Automotive connectivity testing activities.Attachment,neutral,0.1,0.89,0.01,mixed,0.5,0.23,0.27,True,English,"['Solid organic revenue growth', 'BUREAU VERITAS', 'third quarter', '2023 outlook', 'US based maritime software company',

Well on-track to achieve our five-year plan of doubling EPS by 2023 as initially planned.Bernard Charlès  Dassault Systèmes’ Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer commented:“Today  our clients are driven by the ambition to bring about a metamorphosis where they not only embrace a sustainable economy  accomplishing more with fewer resources  but also cultivate an experience economy characterized by personalization  contextualization  and automatic updates of experiences.In this context  virtual twins  as central pillars of a company's knowledge and know-how  prove to be essential  not only during innovation phases but throughout the product lifecycle. They pave the way for more efficient resource management and the continuous enhancement of the user experience. Virtual twins enable ‘software-defined experiences’  shifting the value from physical assets to software  all the while empowering our clients to establish direct connections with their end customers  providing tailored experiences.What sets us apart is our ability to provide a scientific representation of the world's complexity through our science-based virtual twin experiences. When combined with artificial intelligence  we can design 'human-centered generative experiences'  placing humans at the core  amplifying their capabilities  bridging the real and the virtual  and facilitating informed decision-making.”Dassault Systèmes’ Deputy Chief Executive Officer & Chief Operating Officer CommentaryPascal Daloz  Dassault Systèmes’ Deputy Chief Executive Officer & Chief Operating Officer commented:“In the third quarter  we saw a significant number of large commercial agreements for our 3DEXPERIENCE platform. This is driven by the imperative for our customers to gain a competitive edge while staying profitable  meeting regulatory sustainability deadlines  and decoupling economic growth from resource consumption.Our solutions are gaining momentum in the manufacturing sector  particularly in Transportation & Mobility  Aerospace & Defense  Home & Lifestyle  and Consumer Packaged Goods & Retail. While entering a less favorable investment cycle in the Life Sciences sector  we firmly believe that the demand for new  efficient  and affordable drugs will necessitate breakthrough innovations an aspect deeply embedded in our DNA. By brand  this quarter has been outstanding for many of them  notably with double-digit growth for CATIA  SIMULIA  ENOVIA  DELMIA  NETVIBES  and CENTRIC PLM. This performance attests our ability to gain market share in multiple domains  strengthening our unique competitive position through our existing product portfolio.The strength of our performance in core industries  together with our diversification across sectors and domains  position us well to achieve our 2018-2023 objective of doubling EPS within a 5-year period  as initially planned. These accomplishments lay a solid foundation for our next financial plan.”Financial SummaryIn millions of Euros except per share data and percentagesIFRS IFRS Q3 2023 Q3 2022 Change Change in constant currencies YTD 2023 YTD 2022 Change Change in constant currencies Total Revenue 1 424.7 1 373.0 4% 11% 4 308.0 4 081.4 6% 9% Software Revenue 1 286.7 1 229.8 5% 12% 3 883.9 3 685.4 5% 9% Operating Margin 21.2% 19.3% +2.0pts 20.0% 22.3% (2.4)pts Diluted EPS 0.18 0.16 13% 0.54 0.46 19%In millions of Euros except per share data and percentagesNon-IFRS Non-IFRS Q3 2023 Q3 2022 Change Change in constant currencies YTD 2023 YTD 2022 Change Change in constant currencies Total Revenue 1 424.7 1 373.0 4% 11% 4 308.0 4 081.6 6% 9% Software Revenue 1 286.7 1 229.9 5% 12% 3 883.9 3 685.6 5% 9% Operating Margin 31.0% 31.6% (0.5)pt 31.0% 32.8% (1.8)pt Diluted EPS 0.28 0.26 7% 20% 0.84 0.80 5% 11%Third Quarter 2023 Versus 2022 Financial Comparisons(unaudited  IFRS and non-IFRS unless otherwise noted all revenue growth rates in constant currencies)Total Revenue: Total revenue grew by 11% to €1.42 billion and software revenue increased 12%  to €1.29 billion.

Total revenue growth accelerated to 11% due to fundamental strength in software revenue  up 12% year-over-year  both above the high end of our objectives.This momentum is driven by robust subscription revenue growth  up 18% year-over-year  driven by 3DEXPERIENCE and Mainstream customers adopting the subscription model. This provides evidence that our growth strategy as outlined during our Capital Market Day in June this year  is already in operation. In addition  to complement the strong software revenue growth  we also saw a rebound in licenses & other revenue  up 20%  reflecting the strength in new business growth.Profitability for the quarter was excellent  with operating margin at 31.0% and diluted EPS at €0.28  up 20%  both above our objectives. Profitability improved by 50 basis points year-over-year  at constant currency. Year-to-date cash flow from operations totaled €1.27 billion. These strong results lead us to confirm our full-year objectives of revenue growth between 8% and 9% and the outlook for EPS at €1.20.”Financial Objectives for 2023Dassault Systèmes’ fourth quarter and 2023 financial objectives presented below are given on a non-IFRS basis and reflect the principal 2023 currency exchange rate assumptions for the US dollar and Japanese yen as well as the potential impact from additional non-Euro currencies:Q4 2023 FY 2023 Total Revenue (billion) €1.637 - €1.677 €5.945 - €5.985 Growth 3 - 6% 5 - 6% Growth ex FX 8 - 10% 8 - 9% Software revenue growth * 8 - 10% 8 - 9% Of which licenses and other software revenue growth * (1) - 3% 3 - 4% Of which recurring revenue growth * 11 - 13% 10 - 11% Services revenue growth * 3 - 7% 8 - 9% Operating Margin 35.8% - 36.6% 32.3% - 32.6% EPS Diluted €0.35 - €0.37 €1.19 - €1.21 Growth 4 - 8% 5 - 7% Growth ex FX 9 - 14% 11 - 13% US dollar $1.08 per Euro $1.08 per Euro Japanese yen (before hedging) JPY 150.0 per Euro JPY 149.7 per Euro * Growth in Constant CurrenciesThese objectives are prepared and communicated only on a non-IFRS basis and are subject to the cautionary statement set forth below.The 2023 non-IFRS financial objectives set forth above do not take into account the following accounting elements below and are estimated based upon the 2023 principal currency exchange rates above: no significant contract liabilities write-downs; share-based compensation expenses  including related social charges  estimated at approximately €222 million (these estimates do not include any new stock option or share grants issued after September 30  2023); amortization of acquired intangibles and of tangibles reevaluation  estimated at approximately €378 million  largely impacted by the acquisition of Medidata; and lease incentives of acquired companies at approximately €3 million.The above objectives also do not include any impact from other operating income and expenses  net principally comprised of acquisition  integration and restructuring expenses  and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets; from one-time items included in financial revenue; from one-time tax effects; and from the income tax effects of these non-IFRS adjustments.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 17  2023  as updated in the 2023 Half-Year Financial Report (‘Rapport Financier Semestriel’ as of June 30  2023) filed with the AMF on July 25  2023  both available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Economic Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within the automotive  aerospace  energy or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Systèmes’ business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of inflation could adversely affect the financial position of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and political crises in particular – could have consequences both for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees and for the Company. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing and supply capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.”In preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.08 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY150.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the fourth quarter 2023. The Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.08 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY149.7 to €1.00  before hedging for the full year 2023. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group’s results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations.

The Group believes it is helpful to evaluate its growth exclusive of currency impacts  particularly to help understand revenue trends in its business. Therefore  the Group provides percentage increases or decreases in its revenue and expenses (in both IFRS as well as non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values  particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen  relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed “in constant currencies”  the results of the “prior” period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year  and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year.While constant currency calculations are not considered to be an IFRS measure  the Group believes these measures are critical to understanding its global revenue results and to compare with many of its competitors who report their financial results in U.S. dollars. Therefore  Dassault Systèmes includes this calculation for comparing IFRS revenue figures as well non-IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods. All information at constant exchange rates is expressed as a rounded percentage and therefore may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.Information on Growth excluding acquisitions (“organic growth”)In addition to financial indicators on the entire Group’s scope  Dassault Systèmes provides growth excluding acquisitions effect  also named organic growth. In order to do so  the data relating to the scope is restated excluding acquisitions  from the date of the transaction  over a period of 12 months.Information on Industrial SectorsDassault Systèmes’ Industries develop Industry Solution Experiences  offerings specifically designed to deliver value to companies and users in a particular industry.

(Photo: Carbios)Carbios  (Euronext Growth Paris: ALCRB) (Paris:ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  announces that it has been granted the building permit and operating authorization for the world’s first PET1 biorecycling plant  allowing construction to start. The plant will be built in Longlaville (54) in the Grand-Est Region on a 13.7-hectare site adjacent to the existing PET production plant of Indorama Ventures  its strategic partner. This state-of-the-art facility  scheduled for commissioning in 2025  will play a crucial role in the fight against plastic pollution by providing an industrial-scale enzymatic recycling solution for PET waste. Carbios’ technology enables PET circularity and offers an alternative raw material to virgin fossil-based monomers  allowing PET producers  chemical companies  waste management firms  public entities  and brands to have an effective solution to meet regulatory requirements and fulfill their sustainability commitments. The plant will have a processing capacity of 50 000 tons of post-consumer PET waste per year (mostly waste that is non-recyclable mechanically  equivalent to 2 billion colored PET bottles or 2.5 billion PET food trays) and will generate 150 direct and indirect jobs in the region.Emmanuel Ladent  CEO of Carbios: “Everything is now in place so that construction of our plant can officially begin! We obtained the permits in line with the announced schedule  and we are eager to deliver a facility of great local and international significance for a circular economy of plastic. We would like to thank the French State and the Municipality of Longlaville for their support throughout the administrative procedure and for their commitment in issuing the operating and building permits in 10 months.”Lionel Arras  Director of Industrial Development: “I am very proud of the Carbios teams who have reached this critical milestone in this significant project. With more than 80 engineers involved  both internally and externally  it is a tremendous team effort with our goal of commissioning in 2025 on track.”Construction progress according to scheduleOn 28 September 2023  Françoise Souliman  Prefect of Meurthe-et-Moselle  issued the environmental operating permit  followed by the building permit on 24 October 2023 by Mr. Hamdi Toudma  Mayor of Longlaville. These permits were obtained after an administrative procedure  including public consultation  which evaluated the site’s future impacts on water resources and aquatic environment protection  energy consumption  landscape integration  traffic  etc.Carbios submitted the authorization requests to local authorities last December. Construction of the plant can start before the end of this year for commissioning in 2025.Carbios acquires Indorama Ventures’ landThe plant will be built on a 13.7-hectare site acquired by Carbios on Indorama Ventures’ existing PET plant site without suspensive conditions2. The land area gives the possibility to double the facility’s capacity.A plant designed to minimize its carbon footprintThe plant is designed to maximize circularity  with high-quality output products  and minimize its environmental footprint  especially with regards to energy consumption. Optimizations are underway to further increase the recycling of water required for the process.Located near the borders with Belgium  Germany  and Luxembourg  the plant’s location is strategic for nearby waste supply. Moreover  Carbios’ biorecycling technology can process complex waste that conventional technologies cannot recycle and produce food-grade products  enhancing the plant’s flexibility for waste supply. Carbios and Indorama Ventures will collaborate to ensure the feedstock supply of the Longlaville plant  located in a geographical area where the supply potential could reach 400 000 tons in 2023  and up to 500 000 tons in 2030 with improved selective collection.Carbios has already secured an initial supply source by winning part of the CITEO tender for the biorecycling of multilayer food trays. The consortium composed of Carbios  Wellman (a subsidiary of Indorama Ventures)  and Valorplast has been selected to handle 30% of the tonnage proposed by CITEO. Carbios will handle the portion of the flow consisting of multilayer food trays at its Longlaville plant starting in 2025.Plant funding securedIn July 2023  Carbios successfully completed its capital increase for approximately €141 million  the largest capital increase on Euronext Growth since 2015. This amount is mainly intended to finance the construction of this plant  for which the total investment is estimated at around €230 million. The portion of the investment not funded by the proceeds from the July 2023 capital increase is expected to be covered by Indorama Ventures  which plans to mobilize approximately €110 million for this project  French state subsidies of €30 million  and €12.5 million3 from the Grand-Est Region  as well as a portion of Carbios Group’s available cash  which amounted to €78 million as of 30 June 2023.###About Carbios:Carbios is a biotech company developing and industrializing biological solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles.
