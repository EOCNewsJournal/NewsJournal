The Belgian government said that a large part of these funds  €180 billion  is being stored in Euroclear  the world’s largest securities depository  which has its headquarters in Brussels.Euroclear stated on 26 October that it had earned nearly €3 billion on these frozen Russian assets in the first nine months of this year alone  compared to €347 million during the same period in 2022  and that this increase was due to a rise in interest rates.ADVERTISEMENT AdvertisementCoupon payments and bond redemption relating to frozen Russian assets have got stuck in Euroclear since they cannot be paid to sanctioned clients. Euroclear is constantly reinvesting such cash balances  and the rise in interest rates means the depositary is earning more on these investments.EU officials are searching for ways to direct this income to Ukraine  but the European Central Bank has warned them about potential risks for the euro related to access to these funds  stressing that it may encourage other central banks to give up their euro-denominated assets and weaken the currency.However  the leaders who gathered at the summit on 27 October approved this step  calling upon the European Commission to ""accelerate work with a view to submitting proposals"".The summit’s concluding statement mentions the need for progress  in coordination with partners  on using any extraordinary revenues of private entities stemming directly from Russia’s immobilised assets to support  rebuild and reconstruct Ukraine  consistent with applicable contractual obligations  as well as EU and international law. The European Council called on the High Representative and the Commission to accelerate work with a view to submitting proposals.The Commission is planning to present the proposals in early December  two officials involved in their preparation told the Financial Times.""These conclusions are a green light for us "" one of them said.Brussels is regularly in touch with London and Washington in order to facilitate the synchronisation of their approaches  the officials added.Some EU member states  such as Germany  had been sceptical about these plans due to legal problems connected with the legal right to the funds. That changed at the beginning of this month when US Treasury Secretary Janet Ellen supported the idea of using windfall profits. The G7 has also supported these plans.Estonia  one of the countries strongly pushing for this measure  said it was important for Russia to pay for the damage it was doing in Ukraine. ""The restoring of the damage that Russia has caused  it has to be paid [for] by Russia . . . so we have to think outside of the box "" said Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas.""The EU proposals in December are expected to clarify the legal obligations around windfall earnings at securities depositories such as Euroclear and mandate that they be set aside.

31869,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://lifehacker.com/best-digital-tv-antennas-1850958729,These Indoor Digital TV Antennas (Might) Actually Work,No one wants to screw over the cable companies over more than me. When Comcast almost doubled my rate a few years ago I decided it was time to ditch the box and try something else  which led me to digital antennas. Read more...,No one wants to screw over the cable companies over more than me. When Comcast almost doubled my rate a few years ago I decided it was time to ditch the box and try something else  which led me to digital antennas.The premise of a digital antenna sounds great. You bid farewell to a monthly bill  and using what amounts to a small box  get access to OTA (over the air) broadcasts that transmit in high definition (1080). If you are looking to just gain access to local networks and news  this probably sounds amazing. If you grew up with real television antenna (I did)  digital promises a different experience. But promises and reality are not the same thing.Do digital TV antennas really work?Ehhh. While old analogue antennas could relied about to work in some capacity (even if that meant a fuzzy  static-filled image)  digital signals are very much all (crystal clear HD image) or nothing (a choppy  pixilated still frame or just a black screen). What’s clear is that there are a few factors required if you want your antenna to actually work reliably. A good antenna with great range helps  knowing a bit about calibration helps  but to some degree  you live where you live and line of sight to a broadcast tower isn’t something you can really change. Most people who use digital antennas experience varying levels of success.Personally  I tried a progression of more and more expensive antennas and all sorts of amplifiers before deciding I wasn’t willing to be constantly adjusting in the middle of the Super Bowl or the season finale of my favorite TV show. (Luckily  we now have more options for watching live TV  so you’re not absolutely stuck with your cable company.)That said  if you want to give free broadcast signals a try  here’s what to look for.What to expect from the best digital antennaeIf you’re going to try the OTA route  experts seem to agree on a few pieces of advice–your antenna can’t be hidden behind a bookcase  and is best placed near a window or outside  and you should plan to spend more to get the best antenna you can—preferably one with an amplification feature. How much more? Well  even the most expensive antennas are under $150. Here are a few to consider.Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse TV AntennaThis is a peel and stick antenna  and you can choose black or white so you don’t have a giant black spot on your window. It has a shorter range than other antennas  but good ratings  and is much less expensive. Reviewers note that the shape of this antenna (circular) mean it receives better UHF signals.Price: $39.99Maximum Range: 35 milesAmplified: yesSize: 10.1x 8.6x .04 inchesBuy the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna from Amazon ($40)Winegard Flatwave Amped Pro HDTV Indoor AntennaFrom every review  Winegard seems to own the antenna space  and two of their models top the recommendations. Although they have similar results  I recommend the Amped Pro TH-3000. While it’s a bit more expensive than the comparable model below  it has additional smart functionality—and the real bonus is that the app serves to help you set up and calibrate the antenna. As someone who’s been through it with trying to get a solid signal  you’ll really appreciate that benefit.Price: $109.99Number of channels: 36Maximum Range: 60 milesAmplified: yesSize: 12x.06x13 inchesBuy the Winegard Flatwave Amped Pro from Amazon ($109)Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Amped Digital HD Indoor Amplified TV AntennaThis Winegard model  like its pricier sister  is paper thin  which means that it mounts easily. It has a slightly shorter range  and that can affect how many channels you’ll actually receive  but given it’s half the price of the smart model  you might not care.Price: $59.99Number of channels: 36Maximum Range: 50 milesAmplified: yesSize: 12x.06x13 inchesBuy the Winegard FL5500A Amplified TV Antenna ($60),neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.59,0.24,0.17,True,English,"['Indoor Digital TV Antennas', 'Digital HD Indoor Amplified TV Antenna', 'Winegard FL5500A Amplified TV Antenna', 'crystal clear HD image', 'Pro HDTV Indoor Antenna', 'Winegard Flatwave Amped Pro', 'favorite TV show', 'fuzzy, static-filled image', 'Eclipse TV Antenna', 'ClearStream Eclipse Antenna', 'giant black spot', 'additional smart functionality', 'digital TV antennas', 'old analogue antennas', 'best digital antennae', 'real television antenna', 'free broadcast signals', '12x.06x13 inches', 'live TV', 'best antenna', 'digital signals', 'digital antennas', 'good antenna', 'stick antenna', 'antenna space', 'black screen', 'broadcast tower', 'real bonus', 'Winegard model', 'smart model', 'UHF signals', 'expensive antennas', 'other antennas', 'cable companies', 'monthly bill', 'high definition', 'local networks', 'different experience', 'same thing', 'choppy, pixilated', 'great range', 'Most people', 'varying levels', 'Super Bowl', 'season finale', 'cable company', 'amplification feature', 'shorter range', 'good ratings', 'Maximum Range', 'similar results', 'comparable model', 'solid signal', 'pricier sister', 'small box', 'OTA route', 'many channels', 'one', 'Comcast', 'rate', 'time', 'something', 'premise', 'farewell', 'access', 'air', 'broadcasts', 'news', 'promises', 'reality', 'capacity', 'frame', 'factors', 'bit', 'calibration', 'degree', 'line', 'sight', 'success', 'progression', 'sorts', 'amplifiers', 'middle', 'options', 'experts', 'pieces', 'advice', 'bookcase', 'window', 'peel', 'Reviewers', 'shape', 'Price', '35 miles', 'Size', 'Amazon', 'models', 'recommendations', 'app', 'benefit', 'Number', '60 miles', 'paper', '50 miles']",2023-10-26,2023-10-27,lifehacker.com

As Russian securities reach maturity and are reinvested by financial intermediaries  they generate a profit.The EU has floated the idea of taxing those profits for Ukraine’s benefit — but the European Central Bank and some EU capitals  including Paris and Berlin  have expressed doubts. They are afraid the move would roil financial markets and weaken the euro’s standing as a reserve currency.At a summit in Brussels on Friday  Commission President Ursula von der Leyen asked leaders for a mandate to make legal proposals  pointing to a supporting statement from G7 finance ministers issued earlier this month  according to people familiar with the leaders’ discussions.In the EU  the Baltic countries  Denmark  Sweden  Finland and Poland all spoke in favor of the idea.

However  the idea of tapping those Russian assets for the benefit of rebuilding Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin's all-out invasion has been circulating since they were frozen under Western sanctions more than a year ago.In June  von der Leyen pledged to create a proposal on how to leverage Russian state assets ""before the summer break "" but none was forthcoming  due to concerns raised by the ECB and some capitals.The Commission then sought to marshal a G7 statement on leveraging Russian assets for Ukraine  in order to ensure the EU would not bear the legal and financial risks of taking such an unprecedented move alone.

The cooperation now includes direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) of the EFOY series and EFOY lithium batteries for the consumer (motor homes and marine) and industry segments. Thus  Auto AG Group is now the general distributor for EFOY fuel cells in Switzerland and moving into the small and compact equipment segment. So far  the cooperation has been limited to the development of the mobile and emission-free hydrogen fuel cell solution H2Genset  which both companies realized together with the Austrian company TEST-FUCHS GmbH. The methanol-based SFC fuel cells EFOY and EFOY Pro reliably and autonomously produce electricity regardless of weather and time of day. Both fuel cell versions are extremely economical with their fuel  quiet and can be installed in a very space-saving manner.Depending on requirements  different power ranges are offered  from 40 watts for the EFOY fuel cell to 125 watts for the EFOY Pro fuel cell. The range of applications for fuel cells for environmentally friendly power supply is extremely diverse. They can be used in the consumer segment in motor homes  yachts or mountain cabins as well as in industrial plants for wind measurement and for measuring environmental data such as climate data or seismic movements. The more powerful EFOY Pro is particularly suitable for outdoor applications  as it can be installed weather-protected in boxes  trailers or control cabinets. The EFOY and EFOY Pro fuel cells can be used to charge an EFOY lithium battery or conventional lead-based battery in a trouble-free and environmentally friendly manner.

31873,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.boersen-zeitung.de/english/deutsche-bank-scores-at-the-stock-market,Deutsche Bank scores at the stock market,Deutsche Bank's reduced earnings are being met with celebration on the stock market. This is not without reason. There are (at least) three explanations for this phenomenon.,Of particular note is the fact that the stable interest income benefits from increased deposit volume in retail banking. This is happening despite the likely deterrent effect of the Postbank incident  which also led to an overload in the back office. This back office  under the watchful eye of BaFin  primarily has to process the backlog. According to Moltke  the negative impact was in the single-digit million range in the third quarter and could reach 15 to 30 million euros in the final quarter. More relevant for stock investors than successes in retail deposits are dividends. The announcement that Deutsche Bank has created room to distribute up to 3 billion euros to shareholders likely influenced the initial stock price gains significantly.,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.2,0.27,0.53,True,English,"['Deutsche Bank scores', 'stock market', 'initial stock price gains', 'stable interest income', 'single-digit million range', '15 to 30 million euros', 'stock investors', '3 billion euros', 'particular note', 'deposit volume', 'retail banking', 'deterrent effect', 'Postbank incident', 'back office', 'watchful eye', 'negative impact', 'third quarter', 'final quarter', 'retail deposits', 'Deutsche Bank', 'fact', 'likely', 'overload', 'BaFin', 'backlog', 'Moltke', 'successes', 'dividends', 'announcement', 'room', 'shareholders']",2023-10-27,2023-10-27,boersen-zeitung.de

While trading volumes improved compared to last quarter  they remain down significantly compared to the same period a year ago. Market volatility  on the other hand  continued to decline compared to last quarter. Average VIX reached a low of 14 in the month of July before rebounding slightly in August and September.Looking across the regions  the same market-wide dynamic was seen within each region  with some regions faring better than others. The Americas saw a stronger rebound in trading volumes in the quarter compared to EMEA as it experienced a more severe decline in the prior quarter. APAC saw a similar rebound in the quarter compared to the last quarter and continues to outperform all other regions  driven in part by a strong rebound in trading volumes in China.Volumes and volatility also remained depressed from an asset class perspective. In a continuation from last quarter  fixed income fared slightly better than other asset classes in terms of volumes but volatility was down significantly compared to a year ago  similar to the other classes. Cryptocurrencies continue to see the most pressure as Bitcoin  the bellwether of the industry  continued the downward trend in trading volumes and volatility as compared to the prior quarter.Share BuybackAfter a brief pause during a period of unusually subdued market trading environment  execution of the €15m share buyback program that was previously extended until 26 October 2024 will commence shortly.OutlookThe firm continues to remain fully focused on operational and cost efficiencies across the business while implementing its prioritized growth strategies. Normalized Fixed Operating Expenses are expected to remain in the range of €175-185m for the full year and headcount is expected to remain broadly flat for the year  in-line with previous guidance.Management CommentsMike Kuehnel  CEO“We saw an improved trading environment in the third quarter when compared to the second quarter  though volumes and volatility were still down significantly compared to the same period last year. We are  however  seeing a slight increase in volatility recently after a period of subdued market activity. We are pleased to see our diversification strategy yielded solid results during a seasonally quiet period which we may not have been able to achieve otherwise when looking at the varying degrees of rebounds in different segments of the market globally. While the structural growth of ETPs across different asset classes around the world continues unabated  the recent surge of investor interest in bonds and digital assets  offset in turn by less interest in equity  validates the strategic and economic relevance of our diversification strategy.Throughout the quarter  we remained focused on structurally enhancing our trading capabilities and related infrastructure in different asset classes and regions to take full advantage of arising opportunities when market volumes and volatility return. In Europe  given the continued increase of institutional interest towards the digital assets space  we are increasingly focused on supporting trading of new products and accelerating the related infrastructure build-up  which we will provide more information on in the coming quarters. We continue to be optimistic in relation to the regulatory development in both Europe and progressive conversations in the Americas on digital assets. In the Americas  we appointed Bill Stush as the firm’s regional CEO and continue to be focused on systematically enhancing our ETP proposition in North America and Latam as well as building our algorithmic fixed income trading capabilities. In APAC  we remained focused on building out our China operations amidst a rebound in trading volumes there.From an efficiency and cost perspective  we are on track with our previous cost guidance as we remain focused on balancing our key growth initiatives while improving the underlying operational efficiency of the business in parallel. We believe the continuous fostering of talent through all cycles of the market that has underpinned the success of Flow Traders remains as important as ever.During the quarter  the firm’s leadership experienced a transition as Folkert Joling left the firm as Chief Trading Officer after a 17-year tenure and Hermien Smeets-Flier was approved by our shareholders and formally elected as Chief Financial Officer and member of the Flow Traders Board. Hermien will focus on further expanding the effectiveness of our global control functions in the coming months and we are delighted that she has joined our firm. I continue to be excited to be able to lead Flow Traders at this important juncture in its growth trajectory with a variety of tangible growth opportunities ahead of us. Together with the Flow Traders’ leadership team  I therefore very much look forward to unlocking the full potential of the firm’s growth initiatives as we build a truly global diversified liquidity provider and market maker.”Preliminary Financial Calendar18 January 2024 Start silent period ahead of Q423 / FY23 results8 February 2024 Release Q423 / FY23 results (incl. analyst conference call)1 March 2024 Release 2023 Annual Report31 March 2024 Start silent period ahead of Q124 trading update25 April 2024 Release Q124 trading update (no analyst conference call)13 June 2024 AGMContact DetailsFlow Traders Ltd.InvestorsEric PanPhone: +31 20 7996180Email: investor.relations@flowtraders.comMediaLaura PeijsPhone: +31 20 7996125Email: press@flowtraders.comAbout Flow TradersFlow Traders is a leading trading firm providing liquidity in multiple asset classes  covering all major exchanges.

The policy is to exclude or adjust items that are considered to be significant in both nature or size and where the treatment as an adjusted item provides stakeholders with useful information to assess the year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter underlying performance. On this basis  the following items were adjusted or excluded for the Q323 trading update: Removal of IFRS 2 treatment of share-based payments which include the deferral of a portion of the current year share plans as well as recognition of prior years’ share plans. This adjustment provides insights into the relationship between the current year variable employee expenses and current year trading performance. Other income line includes all the realized and unrealized results on Flow Traders’ long-term equity investments whether accounted for as Fair Value Other Comprehensive Income (FV OCI)  Fair Value Profit and Loss (FVPL) or Results of Equity Accounted Investments. Exclusion of one-off expenses which relate specifically to the completed corporate holding structure update. These are not considered to be part of the underlying operating expenses of the business. Tax expenses are adjusted based upon the pre-tax adjustments and/or excluded items above.IFRS Financial Overview€million Q323 Q322 Change YTD23 YTD22 Change Total income 67.7 111.7 (39%) 229.6 343.1 (33%) Net trading income 67.6 111.8 (40%) 227.6 344.5 (34%) Other income 0.1 (0.1) - 2.0 (1.3) - Employee expenses3 27.1 39.9 (32%) 94.4 130.2 (28%) Technology expenses 15.8 16.1 (2%) 49.1 44.8 10% Other expenses 11.5 7.1 61% 26.0 19.4 34% One-off expenses6 1.0 0.8 23% 4.3 12.5 (66%) Total operating expenses 55.3 63.9 (13%) 173.8 207.0 (16%) EBITDA 12.4 47.8 (74%) 55.8 136.2 (59%) Profit before tax 8.1 43.4 (81%) 37.2 123.7 (70%) Net profit 6.3 33.8 (81%) 29.8 97.4 (69%) Basic EPS4 (€) 0.15 0.78 (81%) 0.69 2.23 (69%) Fully diluted EPS7 (€) 0.14 0.75 (81%) 0.66 2.16 (69%) EBITDA margin 18% 43% 24% 40%Normalized EBITDA and margin are based on the relevant profit share percentage of operating result for the relevant financial period without any IFRS 2 adjustments for share-based payments.

We are back to meaningful subscriber growth and secured top line acceleration starting in Q4 thanks to the implementation of a new wave of price increases  as well as the ongoing growth of new partnerships. Additionally  we once again lead an important change in music streaming with the introduction of the new Artist Centric model which will help create a healthier ecosystem and better reward artists and music  while enhancing fan experience. And finally  we have successfully renewed the majority of our contracts with key content providers  with improved terms ahead of time.""BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS FOR Q3 2023Artist-centric model: on September 6th  Deezer announced the launch of the first comprehensive artist-centric music streaming model  which started to be implemented in Q4 2023 in France and with additional markets to follow. Several labels announced their support for the artist centric approach and around half of Deezer streams are already running on the new model.Price adjustment: on September 21st  Deezer adjusted prices in several markets (France  UK  Spain  Italy and the Netherlands) to better recognise the value of music streaming and to ensure the continuous improvement of product and fan experiences; the new prices will start to apply from end of October 2023 and progressively be rolled out to the whole Direct subscriber base; Since this announcement  the Group has seen minimal churn impact on its subscriber base  in line with prior pricing changes.Partnership expansion: Deezer became the official music streaming partner for Mercado Libre's new subscription program Meli+  launched in August 2023  with very strong initial subscriber growth in Brazil and Mexico. RTL launched its new Multimedia App (including Video and Music) in August. Q3 2023 also marked the first full quarter managing the Sonos Radio service.Contract renewals: The Company renewed several contracts with key rightholders  including with Major labels  ahead of contractual date and with improved terms which will positively impact profitability in 2024.CONSOLIDATED REVENUE FOR Q3 2023Consolidated revenue amounted to €120.7 million in Q3 2023  up 4.8% compared to Q3 2022 (+5.5% at constant currency)  reflecting the execution of the strategy of the Group  with the ramp-up of the new Partnerships (including RTL+  Sonos and Mercado Libre)  and continued Direct subscriber growth in France.Partnerships revenue amounted to €34.2 million in Q3 2023  up 11.9% compared to Q3 2022 (+12.0% at constant currency)  driven by the strong subscriber acquisition dynamic (+0.5 million or +11.8%). This performance reflects the success of the first few weeks of the Meli+ offering  exceeding our initial expectations  as well as the gradual build-up of the RTL partnership  with the launch of the Multimedia App (including Video and Music) at the end of Q3 2023  and the initial contribution of the Sonos partnership launched in Q2 2023. In the third quarter  the Partnership subscriber base increased from 3.7m to 4.3m compared to the end of June.Direct revenue totaled €82.5 million in Q3 2023  up 3.3% compared to Q3 2022 (+4.1% at constant currency). Revenue growth is supported by the continued expansion of the Group's subscriber base in France (+7.3%)  more than offsetting the expected decline in the Rest of World in line with the Group's strategy to focus on selected key markets. ARPU growth of +3.4% (€4.9 per subscriber) is driven by an improved geo mix and reflects the end of the impact of the first wave of price increases. ARPU growth will further accelerate on the back of the new wave of price increases that were announced at the end of the third quarter.Other revenue  which is mainly made up of advertising and ancillary revenue  totaled €4.1 million in Q3 2023 compared to €4.9 million in Q3 of 2022. The segment was impacted by an unfavorable comparison basis (€1.1m one-offs in 2022) as well as by the weak performance of Driift.CONSOLIDATED REVENUE FOR 9M 2023Consolidated revenue amounted to €354.0 million for the first 9 months of 2023  up 5.8% compared to the first 9 months of 2022 (+6.1% at constant currency). As for Q3 2023  this revenue increase is mainly driven by:The ongoing profitable expansion in Partnerships (+9.7%)  thanks to the contribution of new and existing deals with large Telecom operators in France and Brazil and the progressive ramp up of the RTL partnership launched in Q3 2022 (Germany)  the Sonos partnership launched in Q2 2023 (US) and the Mercado Libre partnership launched in Q3 2023 (Brazil and Mexico);Direct performance (+4.9%)  mainly driven by the continued growth of the subscribers base in France as well as ARPU increasePERSPECTIVES FOR 2023: REVENUE GROWTH AND ADJUSTED EBITDA IN LINE WITH GUIDANCEIn line with its strategy and medium-term outlook  the Group will continue to prioritize profitability while targeting revenue growth from Partnerships and Direct subscriptions in selected key markets.In Q4 2023  the Group expects a significant acceleration of its revenue growth  benefiting from the increased contribution of recently signed Partnerships  including Mercado Libre  and the impact of new price increases which are being progressively rolled out to the entire Direct subscriber base from end of October.In light of the above  the Group confirms its guidance to achieve 7 to 10% revenue growth for FY 2023 vs. FY 2022 and confirms it is on track to achieve another significant reduction in adjusted EBITDA loss in H2 2023  compared to H2 2022.FINANCIAL CALENDAR- 28 February 2024: 2023 annual results (press release to be published after market close)CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCASTJeronimo Folgueira  CEO and Stéphane Rougeot  Deputy CEO and CFO will host a conference call and webcast for analysts and investors  including a Q&A session  on Friday  27 October 2023 at 9.30 a.m. CEST.Connect to the live webcast by clicking on the following link:https://channel.royalcast.com/landingpage/deezer-en/20231027_1/Conference call dial-in details:- France: +33 (0) 1 70 37 71 66- UK-wide: +44 (0) 33 0551 0200- US: +1 786 697 3501Password: ""Deezer"" (to be communicated verbally to the operator)The related presentation and a replay of the webcast will be made available on www.deezer-investors.com in the Financial Information section after the live event.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Deezer  which shall not be considered per se as historical facts  including the ability to manufacture  market  commercialize and achieve market acceptance for specific projects developed by Deezer  estimates for future performance and estimates regarding anticipated operating losses  future revenues  capital requirements  needs for additional financing.

FCF1 is expected to be positive  but lower than the previous guidance  mainly because of developments in working capital.On a challenging base of comparison for Connected Home  Vantiva experienced a 38% revenue decline in the quarter due to decreasing market demand.Visibility for 2024 is limited  but first indications demonstrate a need for prudency about the market development.The group’s revenues amounted to €473m in the quarter  down 38% (-34% at constant exchange rate).Connected Home contributed €339m  a decrease of 42% (-37% at constant exchange rate).SCS contributed €134m  a decrease of 26% (-22% at constant exchange rate).With the announcement of the projected acquisition of CommScope Home Networks activities  Vantiva has achieved a key strategic milestone which is expected be a game changer for the group.The Group’s liquidity position at September 30 th stood at €39m (including €16m of undrawn credit facility).

FY guidance unchanged for adjusted EBITDA and EBITA  but FCF1 still expected positive  should be lower than expected.Luis Martinez-Amago  Chief Executive Officer of Vantiva  said:“Our solid operating performance and continuing efficiencies are allowing us to confirm our guidance for EBITDA for the year. This is being achieved in a market with weaker demand from our customers due to the overall macroeconomic conditions  as previously communicated. Performance is nevertheless still in the range of our scenarios. The FCF 1 will be lower than the guidance due to the timing of revenues within Q4 for Connected Home.We expect the market to remain weak in 2024. However  with the announced agreement to acquire CommScope’s Home Division  we are in a perfect position to reinforce our operational performance from a customer perspective  and from an efficiency and productivity perspective. We anticipate that a sizeable amount of synergies will be realized  which will improve our profitability and performance over the coming years.

This  combined with high levels of inventories  led our clients to cut  or at least to postpone  their orders. Both divisions have been significantly impacted by this negative trend and showed decreasing revenues in the quarter on high base of comparison. The revenue trend and the change of timing for some orders have penalized the development of our working capital  and in consequence our liquidity situation has been negatively impacted. A new financing of €85m  maturing in March 2024  has been put in place in October to meet this temporary liquidity need.OutlookThanks to the continuing efforts to improve our operational efficiency  and as Q4 is traditionally stronger than Q3  the full year guidance remains unchanged for adjusted EBITDA and EBITA. However we are revising our FCF1 guidance from more than €50m to positive  mostly because of the negative movement in working capital already mentioned.2024 is likely to be another difficult year for our industry  and we anticipate a lower group performance than for 2023 at constant scope.Guidance for the fiscal year 2023:EBITDA > €140m UnchangedEBITA> € 45 m UnchangedFCF (1) > €50m > 0mQ3 & 9M Segment ReviewConnected Home Revenues breakdown by product Q3 9M In € million  continuing operations 2023 2022 Actual Change Change at Constant Rate 2023 2022 Actual Change Change at Constant Rate Revenues 339 584 (42.0)% (37.3)% 1 146 1 481 (22.6)% (20.9)% o/w Broadband 284 414 (31.5)% (26.2)% 931 1 108 (16.0)% (14.5)% o/w Video 55 171 (67.8)% (64.5)% 215 373 (42.3)% (40.2)% Connected Home revenues represented 72% of group revenues in the quarter (76% in Q3 22)  and totaled €339 million  down 42%. At constant exchange rate  the decline would have been 37% compared with Q3 2022. As in the previous quarters  Video activities have suffered in all regions  while Broadbrand showed some growth in Latam and EMEA  but this was not enough to offset the decrease in North America and APAC. This development in revenue resulted from a fall in demand from our main clients in North America  which have faced a high level of inventory. Both the Fiber and Video businesses have been particularly hit in the region. In Latin America  especially in Brazil  the market has been also relatively weak as economic conditions were adverse. However  Fiber products’ strong growth has mitigated lower demand for DOCSIS products. In EMEA  the situation has not been significantly better  with a strong decline for DOCSIS and Video products  not fully compensated by high growth in Fiber. In APAC  on the one hand  one of our large customers  facing a high level of inventories for gateways in a context of softening demand  adjusted its volume of orders  and on the other hand demand in India for Video devices was weak. As management had anticipated a declining demand  strict cost control and efficiency measures have been put in place without delay in order to defend the profitability of the business. Connected Home continues to prepare the next generation of devices based on DOCSIS4.0 and Wi-Fi 7 technologies to support its growth  and win its first contracts for 5G FWA technology in North America and Europe.Supply Chain Solutions Q3 9M In € million  continuing operations 2023 2022 Actual Change Change at Constant Rate 2023 2022 Actual Change Change at Constant Rate Revenues 134 181 (26)% (22)% 365 476 (23)% (22)% Supply Chain Solutions’ revenues for the quarter represented 28% of Group revenues (24% in Q3 22) and totaled €134 million in the quarter  a 26% decrease compared to Q3 22. At constant exchange rate the drop would have been 22%. This decline was not only due to the structural downward trend affecting the optical discs business  but also to the economic conditions which has penalized the discretionary consumption. All major studios have revised downwards their orders  and volumes of disc were down 33% in the quarter. Some pricing actions have mitigated the negative impact on the revenues. Vinyl volumes have grown although not reaching expectations. The other diversification activities also suffered from this general slowdown. ### Warning: Forward Looking Statements This press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements""  including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

At constant exchange rate the drop would have been 22%. This decline was not only due to the structural downward trend affecting the optical discs business  but also to the economic conditions which has penalized the discretionary consumption. All major studios have revised downwards their orders  and volumes of disc were down 33% in the quarter. Some pricing actions have mitigated the negative impact on the revenues. Vinyl volumes have grown although not reaching expectations. The other diversification activities also suffered from this general slowdown. ### Warning: Forward Looking Statements This press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements""  including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

At constant exchange rate  the decline would have been 37% compared with Q3 2022. As in the previous quarters  Video activities have suffered in all regions  while Broadbrand showed some growth in Latam and EMEA  but this was not enough to offset the decrease in North America and APAC. This development in revenue resulted from a fall in demand from our main clients in North America  which have faced a high level of inventory. Both the Fiber and Video businesses have been particularly hit in the region. In Latin America  especially in Brazil  the market has been also relatively weak as economic conditions were adverse. However  Fiber products’ strong growth has mitigated lower demand for DOCSIS products. In EMEA  the situation has not been significantly better  with a strong decline for DOCSIS and Video products  not fully compensated by high growth in Fiber. In APAC  on the one hand  one of our large customers  facing a high level of inventories for gateways in a context of softening demand  adjusted its volume of orders  and on the other hand demand in India for Video devices was weak.

Turnover was up 5.7% at constant consolidation scope and exchange rates.Bogart Fragrances & Cosmetics achieved turnover of €11.4 million in Q3 2023  from €12.8 million a year earlier (-10.9%). This decline reflects the shift to an indirect sales model in Spain  with the subsidiary now refocused on marketing and support functions. This new model will serve to limit the Group's fixed costs.

This illustrates the good momentum of the Group’s activity  despite headwinds on major Tech clients and a weak economic recovery in China.Revenue for the first nine months of the year stands at 1 675.1 million euros  with 0.8% organic growth. Total growth stands at -2.8% due to significant unfavorable exchange rate effects (-3.5%) and slight perimeter effects.PERFORMANCE BY QUARTER2023 vs. 2022 In millions of euros 2023RevenueTotalgrowth Organicgrowth 1st quarter 532.0 -2.9% -2.8% 2nd quarter 555.1 -3.3% 0.5% 3rd quarter 588.0 -2.3% 4.3% Revenue 1 675.1 -2.8% 0.8%PERFORMANCE BY REGIONIn millions of euros 2023 9 months revenue Contribution Q3 Organic growth Organicgrowth over 9 months EMEA 722.5 43% 6.8 % 1.4% Americas 659.6 39% 2.3 % -0.9% Asia-Pacific 292.9 17% 3.1 % 2.8% Revenue 1 675.1 100% 4.3 % 0.8%All regions recorded organic growth in Q3.The activity in EMEA shows good momentum  with nearly 7% organic growth over the quarter and 1.4% year to date  mainly driven by Continental Europe. This quarter is the first one no longer affected by negative base effects related to the end of Covid contracts.Business in the Americas is growing organically by more than 2% in Q3  reflecting contrasting situations in Latin America (8% organic growth) and North America (slightly under 2%). In the United States  declining demand from major Tech clients continued to weigh on our activity during the summer. However  ongoing discussions with these major clients  both on traditional market research activities and on new opportunities related to generative AI  are encouraging.Finally  Asia-Pacific is recording around 3% organic growth this quarter. In China  the weakness of the economic rebound is weighing on our activity  but India and Southeast Asia have kept their momentum  with double-digit growth.PERFORMANCE BY AUDIENCEIn millions ofeuros 20239 months revenue Contribution Q3 Organic growth Organic growthover 9 monthsConsumers1 786.7 47% 8.3% 4.8% Customers and employees2 372.1 22% -3.3% -0.9% Citizens3 253.6 15% 2.8% -7.5% Doctors and patients4 262.6 16% 5.7% 0% Revenue 1 675.1 100% 4.3% 0.8%Breakdown of Service Lines by audience segment:1- Brand Health Tracking  Creative Excellence  Innovation  Ipsos UU  Ipsos MMA  Market Strategy &Understanding  Observer (excl. public sector)  Social Intelligence Analytics  Strategy32- Automotive & Mobility Development  Audience Measurement  Customer Experience  ChannelPerformance (Mystery Shopping and Shopper)  Media development  ERM  Capabilities3- Public Affairs  Corporate Reputation4- Pharma (quantitative and qualitative)Our Service Lines focusing on the understanding of consumers  mainly in the consumer goods sector  are recording 8.3% organic growth in Q3.

This illustrates the good momentum of the Group’s activity  despite headwinds on major Tech clients and a weak economic recovery in China.Revenue for the first nine months of the year stands at 1 675.1 million euros  with 0.8% organic growth. Total growth stands at -2.8% due to significant unfavorable exchange rate effects (-3.5%) and slight perimeter effects.PERFORMANCE BY QUARTER2023 vs. 2022 In millions of euros 2023RevenueTotalgrowth Organicgrowth 1st quarter 532.0 -2.9% -2.8% 2nd quarter 555.1 -3.3% 0.5% 3rd quarter 588.0 -2.3% 4.3% Revenue 1 675.1 -2.8% 0.8%PERFORMANCE BY REGIONIn millions of euros 2023 9 months revenue Contribution Q3 Organic growth Organicgrowth over 9 months EMEA 722.5 43% 6.8 % 1.4% Americas 659.6 39% 2.3 % -0.9% Asia-Pacific 292.9 17% 3.1 % 2.8% Revenue 1 675.1 100% 4.3 % 0.8%All regions recorded organic growth in Q3.The activity in EMEA shows good momentum  with nearly 7% organic growth over the quarter and 1.4% year to date  mainly driven by Continental Europe.

In the United States  declining demand from major Tech clients continued to weigh on our activity during the summer. However  ongoing discussions with these major clients  both on traditional market research activities and on new opportunities related to generative AI  are encouraging.Finally  Asia-Pacific is recording around 3% organic growth this quarter. In China  the weakness of the economic rebound is weighing on our activity  but India and Southeast Asia have kept their momentum  with double-digit growth.PERFORMANCE BY AUDIENCEIn millions ofeuros 20239 months revenue Contribution Q3 Organic growth Organic growthover 9 monthsConsumers1 786.7 47% 8.3% 4.8% Customers and employees2 372.1 22% -3.3% -0.9% Citizens3 253.6 15% 2.8% -7.5% Doctors and patients4 262.6 16% 5.7% 0% Revenue 1 675.1 100% 4.3% 0.8%Breakdown of Service Lines by audience segment:1- Brand Health Tracking  Creative Excellence  Innovation  Ipsos UU  Ipsos MMA  Market Strategy &Understanding  Observer (excl. public sector)  Social Intelligence Analytics  Strategy32- Automotive & Mobility Development  Audience Measurement  Customer Experience  ChannelPerformance (Mystery Shopping and Shopper)  Media development  ERM  Capabilities3- Public Affairs  Corporate Reputation4- Pharma (quantitative and qualitative)Our Service Lines focusing on the understanding of consumers  mainly in the consumer goods sector  are recording 8.3% organic growth in Q3.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines  which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

Extension of the maturity of outstanding notes €1.25 million  Implemented a reverse stock split  exchanging 50 old to 1 current share  applied for and obtained safeguard proceeding  applied for conversion of the safeguard proceeding to a court-ordered receivership and announced the opening of a process to find a buyerCurrent cash runway until was extended to the end of December 2023 with the opening of the safeguard proceedingCash position at 30 June 2023 was €3.7 millionParis  France  October 26  2023 – 7:00 (CET) – Pixium Vision SA (Euronext Growth Paris - FR001400JX97; Mnemo: ALPIX)  a bioelectronics company developing innovative vision systems to enable patients who have lost their sight to live more independent lives  announces its financial results for the first half of 2023. The H1 2023 financial statements were approved by Pixium Vision’s Board of Directors at its meeting on 25 October 2023.Despite implementing the below measures the strict control of operating expenses and extensive attempts to find appropriate financing as well as alternative options for the Company worldwide  Pixium Vision does not have sufficient resources to finance its operations until after the end of December 2023.Received in July 2023 a shareholder loan of €3m from Bpifrance and Sofinnova to extend the cash runway  providing more flexibility to pursue the Company’s longer-term funding needs to support its strategic ambitions.Our request for an accelerated payment of the Research Tax Credit for the year 2022 for an amount of EUR 1 829 961 was granted and paid during H1 2023.Freeze of the maturities due under the State-guaranteed loans granted to the Company by Bpifrance and CIC was extended until end of September 2023.Rescheduling request for the majority of the social security liabilities for H1 2023 was granted for the repayment in 24 monthsIn light of this short-term liquidity risk and the lack of new financing obtained to date  Pixium Vision applied for the opening of safeguard proceedings to the Commercial Court in Paris which was obtained on October 9  2023  extending the cash runway until the end of December 2023. Having been unable to find financial investors within the restricted timeframe  and in consideration of the Company's needs  the management considered that a safeguard plan was no longer an option. As a result  on October 18  2023  the Company announced the filing for conversion of the safeguard proceeding into a court-ordered receivership and furthermore announced the opening of a process to find a buyer.In this context  the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  based on the situation existing at the balance sheet date.This situation gives rise to significant uncertainty as to the going concern assumption  as in the event of an unfavorable outcome of the receivership proceedings  the company will not be in a position to realize its assets and settle its liabilities in the normal course of business  and the application of IFRS as adopted in the European Union in the normal context of continuing operations  particularly in regards to the valuation of assets and liabilities  could prove inappropriate.Given the above  our auditors were unable to express a conclusion on the condensed half-yearly consolidated financial statements.Analysis of H1 2023Income statement summary In thousands of euros H1 2023 H1 2022 Change Operating revenue 896.8 1 043.8 (14.1) % Current operating expenses (6 573.9) (7 148.5) (8.0) % Research and Development (4 133.9) (4 086.1) +1.2 % General and administrative expenses (2 440.0) (3 062.4) (20.3) % Operating loss (5 677.1) (6 104.7) (7.0) % Net loss for the period (5 819.9) (5 614.3) +3.7 % Net earnings per share (0.07) (0.12)Operating revenue amounted to €0.9 million and is mainly comprised of Research Tax Credit (CIR).Research and Development (R&D) expenses remained at a similar level and totalled €4.1 million in H1 2023  €48 thousand below previous year. During the first half of 2023  Pixium Vision continued to support its clinical studies  mainly the PRIMAvera study  but also the feasibility studies in Europe and the US. In addition  the Group continued to develop and manufacture its Prima bionic vision system to ensure availability for the ongoing studies.Current general and administrative (G&A) expenses decreased in H1 2023 by €0.6 million  totalling €2.4 million  compared to €3.1 million in H1 2022. The decrease is mainly due to H1 2022 costs for legal and financial services in preparation of various financing options.Operating result presented a loss of €5.7 million  which is €0.4 lower than in H1 2022 (€6.1 million). Net result was a loss of €5.8 million (compared to a loss of €5.6 million in H1 2022). The loss per share is limited to €0.07 in H1 2023 compared to €0.12 in H1 2022.Statement of cash flows summary In thousands of euros H1 2023 H1 2022 Opening cash and cash equivalents 7 687.4 14 504.9 (Decrease)/Increase in cash position (3 949.3) (7 283.6) O/W net cash flows from operating activities (3 945.7) (7 064.1) O/W net cash flows from investment activities (5.3) (26.8) O/W net cash flows from financing activities 2.5 (196.4) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (0.8) 3.7 Closing cash and cash equivalents 3 738.1 7 221.2Net cash outflow from operating activities decreased in H1 2023 to €3.9 million  compared to €7.1 million in H1 2022. The decrease in net cash outflow mainly reflects the accelerated payment of the research tax credit of €1.8 million.Net cash flows from financing activities totalled €3 thousand for H1 2023. In H1 2022  financing activities reflected €(0.2) million primarily related to the repayment of lease liabilities under IFRS16.Pixium Vision ended H1 2023 with a net cash position of €3.7 million  compared to €7.2 million a year earlier.Update on Pixium Vision’s businessAfter the successful completion of enrolment of 38 patients in Pixium Vision’s European PRIMAvera pivotal trial in December 2022  we have focused on enabling and ensuring the successful rehabilitation of all our patients in H1 2023. The European PRIMAvera pivotal trial  evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Prima System in patients affected by dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (dry AMD)  is intended to restore vision  targeting to report on initial data read out of data in H1 2024.Our French feasibility study is still ongoing and 48-month data is in the peer review process  targeted to be published by the end of 2023.In the US Pixium Vision received breakthrough device designation from the FDA in March 2023  and we are in the process to negotiate our US pivotal study that is expected to be approved by mid-2024. Results from our US feasibility study are estimated in the first half of next year.Further events of H1 2023:On 12 January 2023  Pixium Vision announced the 3 peer-reviewed publications amongst others demonstrating the potential of the next-generation PRIMA implant  with the potential to achieve up to 20/20 vision with magnification.After 30 June 2023  Pixium Vision received a shareholder loan of €3 million from Bpifrance and Sofinnova extending the cash runway to the end of December 2023.On 28 July 2023  a reverse stock split was announced  exchanging 50 old Pixium Vision shares for 1 new share.Furthermore  on 11 July 2023 Pixium Vision announced the extension of the maturity of the outstanding notes amounting to €1.25 million (associated with the terminated ESGO financing facility) to 13 January 2024.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

We are ready for the next phase and will update the market on our strategy and mid-term targets at our Capital Markets Day on 14 November 2023.""We again realised substantially higher revenue in renewables  to one third of group revenue year-to-date. Despite recent news flow around delays in several offshore wind projects  we anticipate continued growth going forward  supported by the recent launch of the 'Wind Power Package' in the EU. While the energy transition is underway  the world needs reliable and affordable energy. Therefore  we also expect further growth in traditional energy  especially in the gas market  where Fugro's solutions continue to enable our clients to operate safely and efficiently.Mark Heine  CEO: ""I am excited to report another strong set of results. All regions contributed to significantly higher margins  in particular the Americas and Europe-Africa.

This increase was offset by higher working capital as a result of high revenue growth. The working capital position is expected to be partially unwound in the fourth quarter  in line with previous years. At the end of September  working capital as a percentage of revenue amounted to 15.6% compared to 14.6% per September last year. Capital expenditure was EUR 31.7 million (compared to 29.1 million last year). As a result  free cash flow amounted to EUR 66.9 million  in line with last year. Net leverage declined to 0.7x at the end of the quarter.Following steep growth during the previous quarters  the 12-month backlog continues to be robust with an increase of 14.5%; all business lines report a higher backlog.The group's profitability continued its upward trajectory. All regions reported higher margins as a result of top line growth in combination with operational efficiencies. Driven by an outstanding performance in marine site characterisation  the EBIT margin amounted to 16.0% compared to 10.9% in the third quarter of last year and 11.8% in the second quarter of this year.Revenue was up by 32.6% on a currency comparable basis  by successfully capturing high client demand in all regions  most notably in renewables and oil & gas. In Marine  revenue increased by 46.6%  supported by an increase in the number of paid vessel days  enabled by a larger geotechnical fleet and higher pricing. Overall  the utilisation rate of Fugro's owned and long-term chartered vessels was 75%. Land revenue was in line with last year.Press Release - Trading update Q3 2023Outlook 2023Fugro expects ongoing growth in the energy markets  in particular renewables  resulting in strong revenue growth for the full year. The EBIT margin and return on capital employed will be within the mid-term target range of 8-12% and 10-15% respectively  and free cash flow is anticipated to be positive.In the fourth quarter  Fugro will unwind the sale and leaseback arrangement for the Fugro Scout and Fugro Voyager. Enabled by its strong liquidity  Fugro will take early delivery of the vessels instead of extending the financing arrangement  resulting in a further reduction of gross debt and financing costs. The cash consideration  net of deposits  of USD 39 million will be financed from existing cash resources.Total capital expenditure for 2023 is estimated at around EUR 200 million  excluding the reclassification of the Fugro Scout and Voyager from right-of-use assets to fixed assets.In conjunction with benefiting from further opportunities in the market  Fugro will amend its dividend policy to 25-45% of net result. For full-year 2023  Fugro intends to resume dividends with a pay-out EUR 0.40 per share subject to shareholder approval.Analyst callAt 10:00 CET  Fugro will host an analyst call.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today provided a comprehensive overview of the progress of the ongoing clinical development of varoglutamstat  an orally administered novel small molecule. Varoglutamstat’s mid to late-stage clinical studies  VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  evaluating its potential to treat early Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  are comprised of a broad range of key primary and secondary endpoints covering cognition  function and neuronal connectivity.“The breadth and significance of data collected thus far from varoglutamstat’s clinical development program further expands our understanding of early AD pathology and treatment. With independent DSMB dose decisions for both of our ongoing Phase 2 studies across multiple geographies and different titration regimens  varoglutamstat  has been cleared from a safety and tolerability standpoint to proceed with the highest investigated dose of 600mg twice daily. By evaluating varoglutamstat in two parallel clinical studies with varying efficacy endpoints  we can meaningfully support our regulatory strategies and provide a clear picture of the cognitive changes potentially resulting from treatment on study. Utilizing a stepwise methodology for clinical development  we have been able to create a statistically robust trial setting in VIVIAD with the intent of VIVA-MIND designed to confirm the findings of VIVIAD ” said Frank Weber  M.D.  CEO of Vivoryon. “Building upon the positive findings from the SAPHIR Phase 2a study  we have meticulously designed VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  grounded in the understanding that N3pE-Abeta presence has been identified in and beyond plaques  in the synaptic space of neurons and within their cell walls. Varoglutamstat has shown convincing results of neuronal recovery after only 12 weeks of treatment  which supports our belief in the advantages of this mechanism of action to substantially reduce the production of N3pE-Abeta  rather than increase the clearance once synthesized and deposited in the plaque. Together  SAPHIR  VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND culminate in an immensely comprehensive Phase 2 clinical development program in early AD conducted so far with a planned total of nearly 800 patients. The program is further supported by varoglutamstat’s Fast Track designation granted by the FDA. Vivoryon is committed to improving the daily lives of patients with early AD and their families and we look forward to our imminent  final study readout from VIVIAD in the first quarter of 2024 at which point we intend to share final topline data  with the full dataset to be presented at a subsequent medical meeting.”Varoglutamstat Clinical ProgramThe clinical development program of varoglutamstat in early AD is based on a strong scientific rationale rooted in Vivoryon‘s research and discovery activities in conjunction with support from leading academic partners and scientific organizations worldwide. Varoglutamstat is designed to prevent N3pE-Abeta formation  rather than aiming to clear existing plaques  making it an intervention upstream of other approaches such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Through a second mode of action  varoglutamstat also modulates neuroinflammation via the CCL2 pathway  which  in turn  has an additional positive impact on tau pathology. Preclinical data supports the N3pE-Abeta hypothesis with the following key highlights:Pyroglutamate-modified Abeta (N3pE-Abeta) is a trigger of toxicity and disease pathology in AD and there is a strong rationale for targeting N3pE-Abeta to create a tailored AD therapy.Experimental data show that N3pE-Abeta has very different physio-chemical properties compared to other Abeta variants  including its potential to form highly toxic oligomers and fibrils together with non-modified Abeta variants.Strong preclinical evidence supports the hypothesis that reducing N3pE-Abeta formation by inhibiting the enzyme QPCT  has the potential to change the course of progression of AD.Varoglutamstat is a differentiated investigational small-molecule medicine in development to treat early AD. As an orally administered treatment which can conveniently be taken at home  varoglutamstat holds significant advantages in ease of use by patients. Importantly  in line with its mode of action  safety data to-date indicate that varoglutamstat could potentially come without comparable risks of brain swelling and bleeding (ARIA) seen with amyloid lowering mAbs. It is currently being investigated in two large Phase 2 studies  VIVIAD (NCT04498650) in Europe and VIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) in the U.S. The two studies taken together enable a deep and robust understanding of the effect of varoglutamstat on cognition and daily function of patients with early AD  capturing a range of key primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. In addition  VIVALONG (the open label extension study) will allow for the potential confirmation of the long-term safety and health outcome benefits of varoglutamstat after patients have completed the double blinded studies VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND. The study will also help to generate relevant pharmacoeconomic data.VIVIADVIVIAD (NCT04498650) is a state-of-the-art Phase 2b study being conducted in Europe and is designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of varoglutamstat in 259 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD. The primary endpoint  which is a combination of three elements of the Cogstate neuropsychological test battery (NTB)  called “Cogstate 3-item scale ” includes Identification  Detection and One Back tests and evaluates attention and working memory domains over 48-96 weeks. Key secondary efficacy endpoints include in hierarchical order: Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB  4-item scale)  the full Cogstate NTB (8-item scale)  the Amsterdam Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q)  and electroencephalogram (EEG).The objective of the Cogstate 3-item scale (Identification  Detection  One Back) as the primary endpoint is to confirm the positive findings on working memory and attention observed in the SAPHIR study.The CBB (3-item scale plus One Card Learning)  which is the first secondary endpoint  is marketed as Cognigram and has approval as a medical device by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and multiple other regulatory authorities to assess cognition in early AD patients.The full Cogstate NTB (8-item scale) enables an assessment of outcome on various cognitive domains.Th A-IADL-Q is a fully validated and sensitive scale to measure the impairment of daily function in patients with early AD.The EEG captures change in large scale neuronal and synaptic activity. Theta power has been selected as a key secondary endpoint because it is well correlated to working memory and has been shown to increase (worsen) in AD.Formal testing for significance will begin with the Cogstate NTB 3-item scale and continue until the first endpoint does not show a p value of <=0.05. Furthermore  there will be additional exploratory analysis for domains such as working  executive and episodic memory and language via the Winterlight Labs speech assessment. In sum  the analysis provides a detailed performance assessment of varoglutamstat across key relevant cognitive performance parameters.The end of the active treatment phase in VIVIAD is estimated to occur by year end 2023  which is then followed by a period of safety follow up visits and rigorous data and statistical analysis. Vivoryon remains on track to share final topline data in the first quarter of 2024 and the full dataset at a subsequent medical meeting.VIVA-MINDVIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) is an ongoing Phase 2 study for varoglutamstat being conducted in the U.S.  complementary to Vivoryon’s VIVIAD Phase 2b study being conducted in Europe. VIVA-MIND seeks to enroll 180 patients with early AD into the Phase 2a adaptive dose finding portion and enroll a further 234 patients in the Phase 2b portion of the study.In July 2023  the Company announced that the first cohort of the study was fully randomized as planned and is now recruiting participants into the second cohort with 21 sites open across the U.S. The primary endpoint of the study is evaluating Clinical Dementia Rating scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) over a 72-week treatment period. In addition to evaluating safety  key secondary efficacy endpoints include ABC score  quantitative EEG-relative theta wave power  FAQ (Functional Activities Questionaire) Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog-13) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory.While the Cogstate NTB applied in VIVIAD and the CDR-SB used in VIVA-MIND are distinct and very different scales with each having a specific strength  there has been a positive correlation established between both scales. 1Recently  Vivoryon shared a positive DSMB dose decision recommending that the highest dose of varoglutamstat 600mg twice daily (BID) be selected for the remainder of the trial  based on a quarterly safety review and subsequent analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest (AESI) pertaining to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and hepatobiliary disorders  as well as target occupancy and plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) data.With VIVA-MIND  the Company has confirmed the feasibility of an up-titration protocol to the final dose of 600mg BID which is accelerated compared to the ongoing VIVIAD Phase 2b study.VIVALONGIn July 2023  Vivoryon announced that it commenced preparations for an open-label extension (OLE) study  now termed “VIVALONG “ to provide a long-term treatment option to patients after completion of treatment under the VIVIAD or VIVA-MIND protocol.The launch of VIVALONG is contingent on the outcome of VIVIAD.Pending VIVIAD results  Vivoryon plans to assess the long-term treatment of varoglutamstat including positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and other key safety and efficacy endpoints.###1 Maruff et al.; BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2013About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines.

For the first nine months of the year  our sales grew +20% and  as previously announced  are expected to accelerate strongly in Q4 for full year 2023 growth of almost +30%  in line with our objective. The record sales anticipated in Q4 will be driven by a strong order book  particularly in the United States. During the first nine months of the year  revenue for software  services and non-ESL solutions (VAS) also continued to expand  with sales reaching €80m. Strong ongoing sales are reflected in the solid momentum in order entries during Q3  which enabled us to deliver already +30% growth over 9 months  and which lead us to prepare for another year of strong increases in 2024. But the indicator of which we are most proud is the NPS (net promoter score) of 65 given to SES-imagotag by our customers  reflecting expanding customer satisfaction. I wish to thank  in particular  our customers for the constant trust they place in SES-imagotag  and our employees for their continued dedication.”Sales in Q3 2023 at same level as record Q3 2022Sales in Q3 2023 grew a slight +0.4% to €182.5m  cycling the record +108% top-line growth SES-imagotag posted in Q3 2022 (vs. Q3 2021). In light of the roll-out schedule  and as mentioned previously  sales in the second half of 2023 are expected to be back-end loaded  with a larger portion of revenue generated in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless  Q3 2023 marks SES-imagotag's best-ever third quarter sales.For the first 9 months of 2023  revenue grew +20% versus the previous year to €563.2m. On a 12-month rolling basis  sales increased +19% to €716.4m.The global macroeconomic outlook remains challenging for retailers  with high inflation  lower consumption in terms of volume  and strong downward pressure on margins.Despite this difficult backdrop  order entries for the nine-month period totaled €710m  representing +30% growth versus year-ago  as retailers continue to consider investing in the digitalization of their stores a strategic priority.Order entries (€m) 2023 2022 % Change 9 months 710.0 547.0 +29.8% 12-mont rolling 848.0 700.3 +21.1%Sales momentum by regionRevenue in the EMEA region (Europe  Middle East  Africa) totaled €156.2m in Q3 2023 representing growth of +13% versus the record high growth of 122% posted in Q3 2022. For the 9-month period  sales in EMEA increased +32% to €473.9m. Growth in the region was driven in particular by sales in the DACH region (Germany  Austria and Switzerland)  France and Italy.Top-line in the Americas and Asia-Pacific region during Q3 2023 totaled €26.4m  a decrease of -39% versus the same period one year ago. In the first nine months of 2023  sales in the region contracted-17% to €89.3m. The delivery schedules due to the strong momentum in the United States are concentrated in Q4 2023. For the full-year 2023  growth in SES-imagotag's markets ex-Europe is also expected to grow significantly.Software  Services and Non-ESL Solutions (VAS)VAS revenue in Q3 2023 totaled €27m  equivalent to 14.8% of the company's total revenue for the period. In the first nine months of the year  VAS sales were €80m for a year-on-year growth rate of +11% and accounted for 14.2% of total year-to-date revenue.As announced previously  due to the challenging macroenomic context  some retailers have slowed down or postponed certain projects involving new solutions  which has led to slower growth in the sale of services.Nevertheless  the recurring part of VAS sales -- although still a small proportion within the total VAS top line -- has continued to increase strongly. SES-imagotag's Cloud platform continued to grow strongly  with more than 15 500 stores and 72 million ESLs connected to the Cloud at the end of September 2023  for year-to-date increases of +49% and +44% respectively.This second half of the year is focused on driving the integration and synergies between Captana  Belive  Memory and Pulse  particularly with the development of collaborative solutions that apply AI and algorithms to a very large scope of data. This data combines trading and loyalty data  price / promo  and shelf analysis data (assortment  planogram  stockouts) carried out by Captana. In addition  stores' computer vision coverage is currently being extended to many strategically important departments for grocery retailers such as all fresh products  produce  bakery products  fish and seafood  meats  etc. These solutions will be unveiled alongside a large number of VAS and shelf-edge technology innovations at the NRF show in New York next January.OutlookSES-imagotag is on track to meet its annual revenue target of €800m  driven by strong estimated +50% year-over-year sales growth in Q4  to reach €240m during the quarter. Order entries are also expected to continue to display strong momentum during the period. The company anticipates a further increase in its profitability in the second half of the year.For 2024  the company foresees ongoing strong growth  driven in particular by an acceleration of sales in the United States.FinancialsSales (€m) Europe Rest of World Total Q1 2023 130.2 29.1 159.3 Q1 2022 91.4 28.8 120.2 Change (%) +42.5% +0.9% +32.5% Q2 2023 187.5 33.8 221.4 Q2 2022 129.9 35.8 165.6 Change (%) +44.4% -5.4% +33.6% Q3 2023 156.2 26.4 182.5 Q3 2022 138.3 43.5 181.8 Change (%) +12.9% -39.4% +0.4% 9 months 2023 473.9 89.3 563.2 9 months 2022 359.6 108.1 467.7 Change (%) +31.8% -17.4% +20.4% 2023 12-month rolling 601.0 115.4 716.4 2022 12-month rolling 457.2 143.1 600.3 Change (%) +31.5% -19.4% +19.3%About SES-imagotag and the VUSION Retail IoT platformSES-imagotag is a world leader in smart digital labels and IoT solutions for physical retail  serving over 350 large retailer groups around the world in Europe  Asia and North America.SES-imagotag has developed the VUSION Retail IOT technology platform to help retailers transform their physical stores into high value digital assets  more automated  data-driven  and connected in real-time to suppliers and consumers.

Growth was driven by increased use of digital solutions  serving our recurring client base and leveraging our global expertise. We saw continued strong momentum in Resilience  Mobility and Intelligence. The currency impact was -5%  mostly driven by weaker US and Australian dollar. The operating EBITA margin improved to 10.6% (Q3‘22: 10.3%)  driven by operational leverage and resulting in a year-to-date margin of 10.1% already meeting the strategic target of >10% for end of 2023.ORDER INTAKE & BACKLOGOrder intake of €832 million for the quarter was in line with seasonality  resulting in a backlog of €3 144 million (Q3‘22: €2 813 million). Organic backlog growth was 5.4% year-on-year  as of this quarter inclusive of Arcadis IBI  reflecting market demand remaining high for Resilience offsetting softer market conditions in some of our geographies in Places. Demand for Intelligence products and services remains strong resulting with good order intake and backlog. The pipeline is resilient  driven by the solid positions in our high growth end markets  with ample opportunities from stimulus-driven investments coming our way.BALANCE SHEET & CASH FLOWNet working capital as a percentage of annualized gross revenues improved to 12.9% (Q3’22: 13.8%) and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) was 68 days (Q3‘22: 72 days). As a result of disciplined working capital management  both metrics are within the strategic targets set for 2023. Free cash flow in the quarter was well above last year at €117 million (Q3‘22: €38 million)  reflecting strong billing performance and the increased size of the business combined with our usual seasonality pattern.PERFORMANCE BY GLOBAL BUSINESS AREASRESILIENCE(35% of net revenues) in € millions Third Quarter Year-to-date Period ended 30 September 2023 2023 2022 change 2023 2022 change Net revenues 328 320 3% 1 006 909 11% Organic growth1 11.2% 13.7% 12.1% 9.7% Order intake 328 325 1% 1 107 953 16% Backlog net revenues 972 943 3% Backlog organic growth (%  yoy)1 12.0% 5.4% Backlog organic growth (%  ytd)1 10.6% 5.2%The Resilience market remains very strong driven by US  UK and Germany.​ Demand remains high for our solutions on Climate Adaptation  PFAS and Energy Transition where we see very positive trends across markets.

This came on the back of a high comparison base in 2022  during which the Group cut back on promotional expenditure and benefited from purchase gains among consumers  following numerous shortages of products in the same price positioning; The on-trade sector posted higher sales for the quarter  against a lower 2022 comparative base  as a result of stockpiling by distributors at the end of June 2022.International: slowdown in the quarter (down 7.6%) with widening regional disparities - Nine-month 2023 revenues up 10.9% Slower sales growth in Europe than in the first half of 2023  with continued significant growth in Lithuania and Bulgaria and their export zones  but a cyclical downturn in Spain and a moderate recovery in the UK market; Further sharp decline in the United States in a challenging market environment marked by falling depletions and inventory destocking by our importer; Persisting sluggish environment in Asia Pacific.Price increases applied in 2023 across almost all Group markets in an attempt to offset soaring input costs since 2022 are impacting consumer demand.Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits (Euronext: MBWS) today announces its unaudited revenues for the period from 1 January to 30 September 2023.Nine-month 2023 revenues:€m 9M2022 LFL change Currencyimpact 9M2023 LFL change(excl. currencyimpact) Reportedgrowth (incl.currencyimpact) France 60.4 1.2 - 61.6 +2.0% +2.0% International 74.6 8.1 -0.1 82.6 +10.9% +10.8% TOTAL MBWS GROUP 135.0 9.3 -0.1 144.2 +6.9% +6.8%Q3 2023 revenues€m Q32022 LFL change Currencyimpact Q32023 LFL change(excl. currencyimpact) Reportedgrowth (incl.currencyimpact) France 20.3 -0.8 - 19.5 -4.2% -4.2% International 28.2 -2.1 -0.1 25.9 -7.6% -8.1% TOTAL MBWS GROUP 48.5 -3.0 -0.1 45.4 -6.1% -6.4%France clusterAmid a continuing slowdown in the spirits market in France  mainly in off-trade  France Cluster sales  at €19.5m  were down 4.2% in Q3 2023 versus the previous year  which was marked by lower promotional pressure and out of stock of products in the same price range as our brands. However  nine-month 2023 sales were up 2.0% at €61.6m.All the spirits market is affected  particularly the 12-year blended Scotch whisky category in off-trade  down 0.9% in terms of sales revenue and down 4.9%2 in volume  with impacts particularly the William Peel brand. The other strategic brands  Sobieski  Marie Brizard and San José  were also down over the quarter. Only sales of the Berger brand posted very modest growth  driven by a period of promotional activity and stock shortage among certain competitors. In addition  the context is somewhat unsettled for the business in off-trade  with some legislative changes relating to annual negotiation timing periods coming soon.The on-trade sector reported a 13.9% rise in revenues for the third quarter across all strategic brands  compared with a weak third quarter in 2022 impacted by early inventory build-up by distributors at the end of H1 2022.International clusterInternational cluster sales amounted to €25.9m in Q3 2023  down 7.6% versus Q3 2022. Revenues for the nine months ended 30 September 2023 amounted to €82.6m  up 10.9% versus 2022 at constant exchange rates.Spain posted an 11.1% fall in third quarter sales versus 2022 and a 19.0% increase in nine-month sales  impacted by a cyclical downturn in industrial subcontracting services after a brisk third quarter 2022 which enabled the company to make up the delay caused by shortages of raw materials in the first half of 2022. Market performance among strategic brands was mixed.In Western European export markets  revenues fell 16.5% in Q3  reflecting poor sales performances in all markets except Benelux and the UK  where the Group is benefiting from new listings for its brands  notably Sobieski. The Africa region saw a sharp decline over the quarter.Lithuania posted a 15.0% rise in Q3 revenues and a 29.3% increase in nine-month revenues versus 2022  driven by the export business and  in particular  growth in sales to the Ukrainian market. Domestic sales were down compared with Q3 2022  impacted by unfavourable market conditions for the industrial services business.In Bulgaria  revenues continued to grow strongly in Q3 2023 (up 39.8% versus 2022) after a buoyant first half (up 37.1% versus H1 2022)  with sales still driven by export markets (industrial subcontracting in particular) and significant price increases in H1 2023  which nonetheless led to price sensitivity in the wine category.Revenues in Scandinavia were down 23.9% in Q3 2023 after a strong performance in Q3 2022 amid the continuing sharp upswing in business following the early 2022 lifting of health restrictions. The decline in sales also reflects demand volume elasticity in the face of price hikes  the restructuring of certain distributors in the sector and a number of on-trade delistings due to greater concentration among competitors and the resulting tightening of market conditions. However  Gautier sales held up well.In Eastern European export markets  Q3 2023 and nine-month sales in Poland continued to fall short of 2022 levels  which were boosted by stock-building of the newly launched Gautier brand. Moreover  the spirits market in Poland has followed a downward trend in 2023 to date across all categories.In the United States  after a slight upturn in revenues in Q2 2023  the third quarter saw a further fall in sales (down 46.8%). This is linked to the inventory destocking policy pursued by the local distributor and a low depletion rate following difficulties caused by the change in some routes to market in key states. In addition  operational  logistical and commercial difficulties impacted the performance of our brands  particularly Sobieski and Gautier. However  the Marie Brizard brand performed well  up 18%.In Brazil  in contrast to the first two quarters  Q3 2023 revenues were down 15.2% (up 22.3% over the first nine months versus 2022)  impacted mainly by shortages of imported brands and a squeeze on purchasing power linked to the non-renewal of government support programmes. The strong performance by local brands  up 11%  and the continuation of a rigorous sales and pricing policy over 2023 only partly succeeded in offsetting this decline.In the Americas export region  revenues continued to decline significantly in Canada in Q3 2023  again due to the highly competitive vodka segment and continuing decline in the cognac category  despite a highly respectable performance by the Marie Brizard brand.Lastly  Asia Pacific saw a sharp decline in Q3 2023  particularly in Australia  South Korea and Japan  although modest sales in Taiwan continued to grow steadily.OutlookThe first half of 2023 demonstrated the overall resilience of the Group in the face of the challenges of availability and significant price rises resulting from the persistent increases in input costs at the beginning of 2023. The decline in sales in Q3 2023 and the recent negative trend over the last few months are in line with the cautious comments made in the last quarterly press releases for 2023.It should be remembered that  at this stage  the price increases designed to cushion the rise in input costs since 2022 only partly offset them  leading to pressure on margins despite these efforts.However  in most markets (both in France and internationally)  the sharp rises in raw material and energy prices in 2022 and 2023 and resulting increases in consumer goods prices in general (including Group products impacted by the aforementioned price rises) have led to changes in consumer purchasing patterns  resulting in a gradual reduction in demand  to a greater or lesser extent depending on the geographical regions.The Group continues to closely monitor these changes in consumer demand in response to the prioritisation of their purchases and  despite these persistent challenges  is committed to staying flexible and focused on the operational direction. To this end  the Group will leverage its diversified business portfolio and broad geographical footprint in order to deliver a strong and steady performance  as demonstrated this year (e.g. growth in Europe vs. challenges in the US  development of industrial services vs. market slowdown affecting certain strategic categories). The Group is committed to expanding this diversity.The current sluggishness of international growth  which remains one of the Group’s development priorities  is compounded by a French market that is increasingly mature  concentrated and highly focused on purchasing power. Against this backdrop  the Group remains cautious regarding the short to medium-term business outlook.Financial calendarQ4 and full-year 2023 revenues: 15 February 2024Contact Relations Investisseurs et ActionnairesGroupe MBWSEmilie Drexleremilie.drexler@mbws.comTél : +33 1 43 91 62 40Contact PresseImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurence Maurycdoligez@image7.fr – lmaury@image7.frTél : +33 1 53 70 74 70A propos de Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits est un Groupe de vins et spiritueux implanté en Europe et aux Etats-Unis.

Growth was driven by increased use of digital solutions  serving our recurring client base and leveraging our global expertise. We saw continued strong momentum in Resilience  Mobility and Intelligence. The currency impact was -5%  mostly driven by weaker US and Australian dollar. The operating EBITA margin improved to 10.6% (Q3‘22: 10.3%)  driven by operational leverage and resulting in a year-to-date margin of 10.1% already meeting the strategic target of >10% for end of 2023.ORDER INTAKE & BACKLOGOrder intake of €832 million for the quarter was in line with seasonality  resulting in a backlog of €3 144 million (Q3‘22: €2 813 million). Organic backlog growth was 5.4% year-on-year  as of this quarter inclusive of Arcadis IBI  reflecting market demand remaining high for Resilience offsetting softer market conditions in some of our geographies in Places. Demand for Intelligence products and services remains strong resulting with good order intake and backlog. The pipeline is resilient  driven by the solid positions in our high growth end markets  with ample opportunities from stimulus-driven investments coming our way.BALANCE SHEET & CASH FLOWNet working capital as a percentage of annualized gross revenues improved to 12.9% (Q3’22: 13.8%) and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) was 68 days (Q3‘22: 72 days). As a result of disciplined working capital management  both metrics are within the strategic targets set for 2023. Free cash flow in the quarter was well above last year at €117 million (Q3‘22: €38 million)  reflecting strong billing performance and the increased size of the business combined with our usual seasonality pattern.PERFORMANCE BY GLOBAL BUSINESS AREASRESILIENCE(35% of net revenues) in € millions Third Quarter Year-to-date Period ended 30 September 2023 2023 2022 change 2023 2022 change Net revenues 328 320 3% 1 006 909 11% Organic growth1 11.2% 13.7% 12.1% 9.7% Order intake 328 325 1% 1 107 953 16% Backlog net revenues 972 943 3% Backlog organic growth (%  yoy)1 12.0% 5.4% Backlog organic growth (%  ytd)1 10.6% 5.2%The Resilience market remains very strong driven by US  UK and Germany.​ Demand remains high for our solutions on Climate Adaptation  PFAS and Energy Transition where we see very positive trends across markets.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today provided a comprehensive overview of the progress of the ongoing clinical development of varoglutamstat  an orally administered novel small molecule. Varoglutamstat’s mid to late-stage clinical studies  VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  evaluating its potential to treat early Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  are comprised of a broad range of key primary and secondary endpoints covering cognition  function and neuronal connectivity.“The breadth and significance of data collected thus far from varoglutamstat’s clinical development program further expands our understanding of early AD pathology and treatment. With independent DSMB dose decisions for both of our ongoing Phase 2 studies across multiple geographies and different titration regimens  varoglutamstat  has been cleared from a safety and tolerability standpoint to proceed with the highest investigated dose of 600mg twice daily. By evaluating varoglutamstat in two parallel clinical studies with varying efficacy endpoints  we can meaningfully support our regulatory strategies and provide a clear picture of the cognitive changes potentially resulting from treatment on study. Utilizing a stepwise methodology for clinical development  we have been able to create a statistically robust trial setting in VIVIAD with the intent of VIVA-MIND designed to confirm the findings of VIVIAD ” said Frank Weber  M.D.  CEO of Vivoryon. “Building upon the positive findings from the SAPHIR Phase 2a study  we have meticulously designed VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  grounded in the understanding that N3pE-Abeta presence has been identified in and beyond plaques  in the synaptic space of neurons and within their cell walls. Varoglutamstat has shown convincing results of neuronal recovery after only 12 weeks of treatment  which supports our belief in the advantages of this mechanism of action to substantially reduce the production of N3pE-Abeta  rather than increase the clearance once synthesized and deposited in the plaque. Together  SAPHIR  VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND culminate in an immensely comprehensive Phase 2 clinical development program in early AD conducted so far with a planned total of nearly 800 patients. The program is further supported by varoglutamstat’s Fast Track designation granted by the FDA. Vivoryon is committed to improving the daily lives of patients with early AD and their families and we look forward to our imminent  final study readout from VIVIAD in the first quarter of 2024 at which point we intend to share final topline data  with the full dataset to be presented at a subsequent medical meeting.”Varoglutamstat Clinical ProgramThe clinical development program of varoglutamstat in early AD is based on a strong scientific rationale rooted in Vivoryon‘s research and discovery activities in conjunction with support from leading academic partners and scientific organizations worldwide. Varoglutamstat is designed to prevent N3pE-Abeta formation  rather than aiming to clear existing plaques  making it an intervention upstream of other approaches such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Through a second mode of action  varoglutamstat also modulates neuroinflammation via the CCL2 pathway  which  in turn  has an additional positive impact on tau pathology. Preclinical data supports the N3pE-Abeta hypothesis with the following key highlights:Pyroglutamate-modified Abeta (N3pE-Abeta) is a trigger of toxicity and disease pathology in AD and there is a strong rationale for targeting N3pE-Abeta to create a tailored AD therapy.Experimental data show that N3pE-Abeta has very different physio-chemical properties compared to other Abeta variants  including its potential to form highly toxic oligomers and fibrils together with non-modified Abeta variants.Strong preclinical evidence supports the hypothesis that reducing N3pE-Abeta formation by inhibiting the enzyme QPCT  has the potential to change the course of progression of AD.Varoglutamstat is a differentiated investigational small-molecule medicine in development to treat early AD. As an orally administered treatment which can conveniently be taken at home  varoglutamstat holds significant advantages in ease of use by patients. Importantly  in line with its mode of action  safety data to-date indicate that varoglutamstat could potentially come without comparable risks of brain swelling and bleeding (ARIA) seen with amyloid lowering mAbs. It is currently being investigated in two large Phase 2 studies  VIVIAD (NCT04498650) in Europe and VIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) in the U.S. The two studies taken together enable a deep and robust understanding of the effect of varoglutamstat on cognition and daily function of patients with early AD  capturing a range of key primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. In addition  VIVALONG (the open label extension study) will allow for the potential confirmation of the long-term safety and health outcome benefits of varoglutamstat after patients have completed the double blinded studies VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND. The study will also help to generate relevant pharmacoeconomic data.VIVIADVIVIAD (NCT04498650) is a state-of-the-art Phase 2b study being conducted in Europe and is designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of varoglutamstat in 259 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD. The primary endpoint  which is a combination of three elements of the Cogstate neuropsychological test battery (NTB)  called “Cogstate 3-item scale ” includes Identification  Detection and One Back tests and evaluates attention and working memory domains over 48-96 weeks. Key secondary efficacy endpoints include in hierarchical order: Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB  4-item scale)  the full Cogstate NTB (8-item scale)  the Amsterdam Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q)  and electroencephalogram (EEG).The objective of the Cogstate 3-item scale (Identification  Detection  One Back) as the primary endpoint is to confirm the positive findings on working memory and attention observed in the SAPHIR study.The CBB (3-item scale plus One Card Learning)  which is the first secondary endpoint  is marketed as Cognigram and has approval as a medical device by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and multiple other regulatory authorities to assess cognition in early AD patients.The full Cogstate NTB (8-item scale) enables an assessment of outcome on various cognitive domains.Th A-IADL-Q is a fully validated and sensitive scale to measure the impairment of daily function in patients with early AD.The EEG captures change in large scale neuronal and synaptic activity. Theta power has been selected as a key secondary endpoint because it is well correlated to working memory and has been shown to increase (worsen) in AD.Formal testing for significance will begin with the Cogstate NTB 3-item scale and continue until the first endpoint does not show a p value of <=0.05. Furthermore  there will be additional exploratory analysis for domains such as working  executive and episodic memory and language via the Winterlight Labs speech assessment. In sum  the analysis provides a detailed performance assessment of varoglutamstat across key relevant cognitive performance parameters.The end of the active treatment phase in VIVIAD is estimated to occur by year end 2023  which is then followed by a period of safety follow up visits and rigorous data and statistical analysis. Vivoryon remains on track to share final topline data in the first quarter of 2024 and the full dataset at a subsequent medical meeting.VIVA-MINDVIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) is an ongoing Phase 2 study for varoglutamstat being conducted in the U.S.  complementary to Vivoryon’s VIVIAD Phase 2b study being conducted in Europe. VIVA-MIND seeks to enroll 180 patients with early AD into the Phase 2a adaptive dose finding portion and enroll a further 234 patients in the Phase 2b portion of the study.In July 2023  the Company announced that the first cohort of the study was fully randomized as planned and is now recruiting participants into the second cohort with 21 sites open across the U.S. The primary endpoint of the study is evaluating Clinical Dementia Rating scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) over a 72-week treatment period. In addition to evaluating safety  key secondary efficacy endpoints include ABC score  quantitative EEG-relative theta wave power  FAQ (Functional Activities Questionaire) Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog-13) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory.While the Cogstate NTB applied in VIVIAD and the CDR-SB used in VIVA-MIND are distinct and very different scales with each having a specific strength  there has been a positive correlation established between both scales. 1Recently  Vivoryon shared a positive DSMB dose decision recommending that the highest dose of varoglutamstat 600mg twice daily (BID) be selected for the remainder of the trial  based on a quarterly safety review and subsequent analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest (AESI) pertaining to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and hepatobiliary disorders  as well as target occupancy and plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) data.With VIVA-MIND  the Company has confirmed the feasibility of an up-titration protocol to the final dose of 600mg BID which is accelerated compared to the ongoing VIVIAD Phase 2b study.VIVALONGIn July 2023  Vivoryon announced that it commenced preparations for an open-label extension (OLE) study  now termed “VIVALONG “ to provide a long-term treatment option to patients after completion of treatment under the VIVIAD or VIVA-MIND protocol.The launch of VIVALONG is contingent on the outcome of VIVIAD.Pending VIVIAD results  Vivoryon plans to assess the long-term treatment of varoglutamstat including positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and other key safety and efficacy endpoints.###1 Maruff et al.; BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2013About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines.

Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:“Besi reported solid Q3-23 results with revenue and operating profit above the midpoint of prior guidance. For the quarter  revenue of € 123.3 million and net income of € 35.0 million decreased by 24.1% and 33.5%  respectively  versus Q2-23 but orders grew by 13.1% reflecting increased demand for next generation computing  hybrid bonding and photonics applications. The sequential revenue decrease was principally due to decreased shipments for high-end smartphone applications post the H1-23 seasonal capacity build and general market weakness. Profit levels in the quarter remained elevated driven primarily by gross margins of 64.6% and a 15.6% decrease in operating expenses  both of which were better than prior guidance.For the nine months ended September 30  2023  revenue and net income declined by 28.4% and 39.1%  respectively  reflecting the impact of adverse market conditions on Besi’s business this year. 2023 revenue and order trends primarily reflect a broad-based downturn in demand for computing applications by both IDMs and Asian subcontractors  and  to a lesser extent  reduced demand for automotive applications following strong growth over the past two years. Our profit performance in this market environment remained strong with gross margin up by 3.7 points and a net margin realized of 29.1% as a result of the timely adjustment of Besi’s operating model to current market realities.Besi ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position including cash and deposits of € 391.2 million  up 3.4% from Q2-23. Our cash position reflects the capital allocation of € 412.4 million to shareholders YTD-23  up 17.4% versus YTD-22. In addition  the current € 300 million share repurchase program will be completed on October 27  2023. Effective November 1  we will initiate a € 60 million program designed to further reduce share dilution from the conversion of Convertible Notes outstanding.We are also pleased to report significant progress on our advanced packaging roadmap this quarter. We received new orders for hybrid bonding systems in Q3-23 from two customers including the first order from a leading subcontractor as well as significant orders for photonics applications from various customers. Subsequent to quarter-end  we received further hybrid bonding orders from two customers and anticipate additional orders in Q4-23.At present  we are primarily focused on maintaining solid margins in the current industry environment and executing development and operating initiatives to help capitalize on market opportunities in the next upturn. We believe we are in the early phase of a new assembly market upturn based on independent research data and customer utilization rates. However  there are many variables which could affect the upward slope of its trajectory including global economic growth  geopolitical conflict and the development of each of our principal mobile  computing and automotive end user markets. As such  we remain cautiously optimistic  encouraged by the ongoing progress of our wafer level assembly portfolio and market leadership position in key advanced packaging assembly systems. For Q4-23  we anticipate that revenue will increase by 15-25% versus Q3-23 due to planned shipments from backlog of hybrid bonding and other advanced packaging systems. In addition  we expect gross margins to range between 62-64% and for operating expenses to increase by approximately 5% versus Q3-23.”Third Quarter Results of Operations€ millions Q3-2023 Q2-2023 Δ Q3-2022 Δ Revenue 123.3 162.5 -24.1% 168.8 -27.0% Orders 127.3 112.6 +13.1% 125.3 +1.6% Book to Bill Ratio 1.0x 0.7x +0.3 0.7x +0.3Besi’s Q3-23 revenue decreased by 24.1% versus Q2-23 due to decreased shipments for smartphone applications post the H1-23 seasonal capacity build.

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM/NASDAQ: PHAR) presents its preliminary  unaudited financial report for the three months ended September 30  2023.Sijmen de Vries  Chief Executive Officer  commented:“Pharming delivered a strong third quarter  increasing quarterly revenues to US$66.7 million and putting the Company at US$164.1 million in revenues for the first nine months of the year. The 23% revenue growth seen in the third quarter of 2023  versus the same period last year  was attributable to increased RUCONEST® revenue  coupled with initial Joenja® revenues of US$6.5 million.To ensure we continue to find new Joenja® patients and grow revenues  Pharming continues to execute a focused U.S. patient finding strategy. Our strategy  which will be ramped up in the fourth quarter of 2023 and into the first quarter of 2024  focuses on early detection and diagnosis of potential APDS patients  genetic testing family members of APDS patients  and expanding the list of genetic variants confirmed to cause APDS.Looking towards 2024  we continue to progress in our efforts to make Joenja® (leniolisib) available to APDS patients in key global launch markets. Discussions with the EMA are ongoing and we continue to expect a CHMP opinion in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition  the regulatory submissions filed for leniolisib in Australia  Canada and Israel are progressing as expected  as is the Japanese clinical trial for patients 12 years and older. We also continue to make headway in our pediatric clinical trials with the majority of patients enrolled in the 4 to 11 year old trial  and have initiated recruiting in the second pediatric trial for ages 1 to 6.The third quarter was an example of Pharming’s strong commercialization acumen as we succeeded in not only finding new Joenja® patients and quickly put them on therapy  but also in our ability to deliver growth for RUCONEST® in the competitive HAE landscape. None of this could have been achieved without our employees and partners who work tirelessly to bring our global HAE and APDS patients the medicines they need.”Third quarter highlightsCommercialized assetsRUCONEST® marketed for the treatment of acute HAE attacksRUCONEST® continued to perform well in the third quarter of 2023  with revenues of US$60.2 million  an 11% increase compared to the third quarter of 2022 and an 18% increase compared to the second quarter of 2023. Revenues for the first nine months of 2023 were US$153.8 million  a 2% increase compared to the same period in 2022. The acceleration of RUCONEST® revenue seen in the second and third quarters puts Pharming firmly on track to achieve our previously indicated outlook for full year 2023 percentage revenue growth in the low single digits.The U.S. market contributed 97% of revenues  while the EU and Rest of World contributed 3% in the third quarter.In the U.S.  we continued to see strength in the third quarter in key leading revenue indicators including new physicians prescribing  active patients  new patients on therapy and vials shipped to patients. For the third quarter in a row we exceed 70 RUCONEST® new patient enrollments. These positive indicators demonstrate the importance of RUCONEST® in treating hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks and should position us well for the fourth quarter. Furthermore  we continue to see a broad mix of patients using RUCONEST®  with reduced reliance on patients who have highly frequent HAE attacks.Joenja® (leniolisib) marketed in the U.S. - the first and only approved disease modifying treatment for APDSThe U.S. commercial launch of Joenja®  approved by the US FDA in March 2023 for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in patients 12 years of age and older  continued its strong trajectory in the third quarter.As of September 30  2023 we have 76 APDS patients enrolled  of which 63 patients are on paid therapy. All but one of the patients who were on therapy prior to FDA approval under our Expanded Access Program (EAP) or Open Label Extension trial (OLE) have been successfully converted to paid therapy.Access and reimbursement discussions have been proceeding as previously disclosed. We have seen high approval rates and fast timelines to covered therapy. Pharming’s market access teams have made significant progress working with government and private payors to provide the resources needed by the payors to formulate their policies to ensure access and reimbursement.APDS patient findingBased on available literature  Pharming estimates that over 1 500 patients are affected by APDS in our key global launch markets including the U.S.  Europe  U.K.  Japan  Canada  Australia and Israel.Pharming has identified over 640 patients in these key global launch markets. Of these 640 patients  approximately 200 are in the U.S. with approximately 75% being 12 years of age or older  the majority of whom are currently eligible for treatment with Joenja®.Pharming has initiated numerous activities to help diagnose and find APDS patients.First  we continue to raise awareness of APDS and share new data on leniolisib at medical and scientific conferences worldwide.Next  we continue to emphasize the importance of genetic testing when APDS is suspected. In addition to our sponsored genetic testing program in the U.S.  we have genetic counselors available to provide educational resources to patients both before and after they’ve obtained a genetic test. Moreover  we have partnered with several genetic testing companies allowing outreach to patients whom they have identified as having APDS through their own testing efforts.Finally  as APDS is an inherited genetic disease  we know that APDS patients may have affected family members. We have initiated a number of programs collaborating with clinicians and patients to aid in reducing the barriers and allowing the appropriate testing in families with APDS.APDS patient finding - Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) resolutionAPDS is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms  assessment of immune cell function  and genetic testing. For a patient to receive a definitive APDS diagnosis  a genetic test revealing a disease-causing (pathogenic or likely pathogenic) variant in either the PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes is required.Patients with clinical symptoms compatible with APDS frequently receive inconclusive genetic variant test results  i.e. previously unseen variants in the PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes. It is important to determine if these Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) cause APDS.Pharming has several ongoing initiatives and partnerships to resolve VUSs. We anticipate that these efforts will expand the list of genetic variants that are considered APDS disease causing and lead to more patients being diagnosed with APDS.Joenja® (leniolisib) strategic highlights - regulatory and clinical updatesLeniolisib for APDSPharming made continued progress in the third quarter towards obtaining additional leniolisib regulatory approvals for APDS patients 12 years of age and older and for pediatric patients in key global launch markets.EEA and U.K. marketsAs part of the review process of the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib for patients 12 years of age and older  Pharming submitted its response to the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) Day 180 list of outstanding issues in October 2023.As announced on August 3  2023  considering the rarity of APDS and the unmet need for the treatment of APDS patients  as part of its review process the CHMP will consult an Ad-hoc Expert Group (AEG) at a closed meeting  also involving Pharming representatives including leniolisib investigators and APDS patients. Under EMA regulations  the CHMP may call an AEG meeting when a medicine is being assessed that requires input from specialized scientific advisors on matters that may fall outside the expertise of the EMA’s established Scientific Advisory Groups  as is typically the case for rare diseases with few experts.Pharming continues to anticipate a CHMP opinion in the fourth quarter of 2023  with European Marketing Authorisation following approximately two months later  assuming a positive opinion.In the U.K.  we intend to file the leniolisib dossier with the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) within five days of a positive CHMP opinion  which is in line with the current European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure (ECDRP).JapanIn August  Pharming announced that the first patient has been enrolled in a Phase III clinical trial in Japan evaluating leniolisib for the treatment of activated APDS in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.The single-arm  open-label clinical trial will evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of leniolisib in three patients  12 years of age and older  who have a confirmed APDS diagnosis. Each patient will receive weight-based dosing up to 70mg of leniolisib twice daily for 12 weeks.The study’s primary efficacy endpoints and secondary endpoints mirror those used to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the earlier leniolisib APDS trials.Pharming plans to file an application for the approval of leniolisib with Japan’s Pharmaceuticals andMedical Devices Agency (PMDA) following completion of the trial. Eligible patients enrolled in the trial will continue to receive the investigational drug for at least one year through an open-label extension trial.Additional markets - Canada  Australia and IsraelPharming filed regulatory submissions in Canada and Australia in the third quarter  and Israel in the second quarter. These submissions are progressing as expected and we continue to anticipate regulatory approvals by the second quarter of 2024 for Canada and Australia and an anticipated regulatory approval for Israel in the first half of 2024.Pediatric clinical developmentThe majority of patients for our Phase III pediatric clinical trial with leniolisib for the treatment of APDS in patients 4 to 11 years of age have been enrolled. The single-arm  open-label  multinational clinical trial will evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of leniolisib in 15 children at sites in the U.S.  Europe  and Japan.The second pediatric clinical trial for APDS patients 1 to 6 years of age commenced in the third quarter of 2023. The trial is currently recruiting and we anticipate the first patient will be enrolled in the fourth quarter. The single-arm  open-label  multinational clinical trial will evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of leniolisib in 15 children at sites in the United States  Europe  and Japan.Both studies are being conducted as part of Pharming’s Pediatric Investigational Plan for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children.Leniolisib for additional indications (PI3Kδ platform)As announced in our Joenja® approval conference call on March 27  2023  we have begun working towards prioritizing other indications where leniolisib has the potential to deliver value for patients. PI3Kδ has been identified as an important factor in a variety of disease states  and leniolisib has demonstrated an attractive  long-term efficacy  safety and tolerability profile in clinical trials conducted in both healthy volunteers and patients. This provides a basis for the investigation and investment in plans for further leniolisib indications. We have already advanced plans for the second indication for leniolisib development  and we are in a dialogue with the FDA on a clinical trial plan. We expect to provide further details later this year.Pre-Clinical PipelineOTL-105Work is continuing on the preclinical proof of concept studies. We anticipate providing further updates as OTL-105 progresses towards an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing.Organizational highlightsAt the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on September 25  2023  shareholders approved the appointment of Dr. Richard Peters as a Non-Executive Director for a period of four years.

This was driven by U.S. Joenja® revenues of US$6.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Next to that  RUCONEST® net sales increased 11% compared to the same period last year and increased 18% compared to the second quarter of 2023. Joenja® revenues increased in the third quarter by 72% compared to the previous quarter.Gross profit in the third quarter increased by US$6.5 million compared the third quarter of 2022. This was driven by an increase in revenues  which was partly offset by the prior year’s favorable FX tailwind and the current years’ increased RUCONEST® production costs  as well as royalty payments to Novartis on Joenja® sales.Operating expenses increased by US$12.0 million in the third quarter compared to last year. This was driven by higher research and development expenses and higher marketing and sales expenses. These were both mainly related to Joenja®.In the third quarter of 2023  an operating profit of US$1.9 million was realized.Nine months 2023Revenues for the first nine months of 2023 were US$164.1 million  a 9% increase compared to the first nine months of 2022 (US$151.0 million)  which was driven by 2% net sales growth of RUCONEST® and US$10.3 million in Joenja® sales subsequent to the FDA approval in March 2023.Gross profit for the first nine months of 2023 increased by US$6.3 million  or 5%  to US$146.0 million. This increase was driven by a growth in revenues  which was partly offset by increased production costs for RUCONEST® and royalty expenses for Joenja®.Operating loss for the first nine months of 2023 amounted to US$6.5 million as compared to an Operating profit of US$28.4 million in the same period last year. This was mainly due to a US$48.4 million increase in operating expenses when compared with the first nine months of 2022. Of that  US$10.5 million is related to milestone payments for Joenja® in the second quarter of 2023. A further US$17.4 million expense increase is directly related to leniolisib in the form of increased R&D spend  marketing costs  market access costs and the commencement of the amortization of acquired rights. An increase of US$17.1 million is related to an increase in payroll expenses  which was in large part driven by the expansion of the organization  resulting from the preparations for launch and further commercialization of leniolisib. The remainder of the increase relates to general costs of US$2.3 million and incidental cost relating to the discontinuation of the Pompe disease program of US$0.9 million.Net result for the first nine months of 2023 was negative US$7.4 million  compared to US$28.3 million profit in the same period last year. This was driven by a decreased operating result of US$34.9 million  as well as a negative impact of net finance gains and losses of US$7.9 million when compared to the first nine months of 2022. These were mainly due to favorable EUR/USD exchange rate developments last year. This was partly offset by US$1.7 million interest income from AAA rated treasury certificates  which was further offset by an income tax credit of US$2.6 million  whereas in the same period last year an income tax expense of US$4.8 million was recorded.Cash and cash equivalents  together with restricted cash and marketable securities  decreased from US$208.7 million at the end of 2022  to US$199.2 million at the end of the third quarter 2023.OutlookFor the financial year of 2023:On track for low single digit growth in annual revenues from RUCONEST®.We anticipate the CHMP to issue their opinion for leniolisib in 4Q 2023.

It provides for the conclusion by the parties and the other creditors supporting the Agreement in Principle of a binding lock-up agreement during September 2023.The lock-up agreement  to which a signatory commits to support and take all steps and actions reasonably necessary to implement and consummate the group’s restructuring  allowed the opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings by October 2023 and the effective completion of all the restructuring operations during the course of the 1st quarter 2024.On September 18th 2023  the conciliators filed an application with the Paris Commercial Court for an extension of the conciliation proceedings until October 25th 2023.

In this context  since several months we have been implementing an action plan based on pursuing our full-price strategy  prioritizing our investments  enhancing the quality of our physical and digital networks  and improving the productivity of our teams.

The third quarter saw a slight decline of -2% on a high basis of comparison. The period was impacted by lower traffic due to persistent inflation  which mechanically affects the purchasing power of both local consumers and tourists. However  the Group outperformed market indicators (IFM  Banque de France)  consolidating its competitive position. Digital sales posted a positive like-for-like growth. The POS network remained stable over the quarter.In EMEA  nine-month sales reached €286m  up +5% on an organic basis vs 2022. Sales in the third quarter slightly declined by -2%  impacted by inflation  consumption slowdown in the UK and Italy and a decrease of tourist flow. However  in the Middle East  the trend remained positive.The network grew by 20 points of sale in Q3 with the opening of a new country Egypt through local partner  in addition to some openings in key EMEA retail markets in B&M and digital.In America  after an outstanding performance in 2022  nine-month sales reached €123m  -5% organic. Third quarter sales were down by -7% vs 2022 with contrasted performances by country. While the activity in Canada is still heavily impacted by the deep reconstruction of the retail market environment and the lack of tourism  sales in the US were more resilient despite a complex economic context. With positive results in key cities (like Miami and Houston)  the Group is well positioned compared to market trends.The network regained growth momentum with nine net openings in Q3.In APAC  nine-month sales reached €195m  i.e. an organic growth of +13% vs 2022. Third quarter sales were up by +1%. In a context of slow and weak economic recovery  sales in Greater China were slightly up in Q3; the trend remains more favorable in some other Asian markets (like Singapore and Malaysia). Finally  the network continued its sustained expansion with 17 openings  mainly in South Korea  China and Vietnam.CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVESTo cope with a deteriorating economic environment  the Group is fully committed and focused on the implementation of its action plan launched in July and articulated around four key pillars:continuation of the full price strategy;prioritization of investments  with a particular focus on marketing and IT expenditure;qualitative expansion of the physical and digital network  with scope effects expected to be more visible by the end of the year;and improvement of store teams’ productivity  as well as the adjustment of the recruitment policy for the in head office teams.The savings plan is starting to deliver the expected positive effects  which will be consolidated in the fourth quarter. The Group is also focusing its attention on cash and liquidity management: as a reminder  its financing facilities have been extended until 2026/2027. Particular attention is being paid to controlling inventory levels; aiming to stabilize the level at year-end vs 2022.Thanks to this action plan  supported by committed teams and strong brand desirability  and provided that the geopolitical situation and the macroeconomic and social context do not deteriorate further in the fourth quarter  SMCP is confident in its resilience  and confirms its annual targets revised in September.NEXT PUBLICATIONEnd of February 2024 – 2023 Annual ResultsA conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 9:00 a.m. (Paris time).Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.APPENDICESBreakdown of DOSNumber of DOS Q3-22 2022 H1-23 Q3-23 vs.H1 23 vs.2022 vs.Q3 22 By region France 455 460 463 463 - +3 +8 EMEA 392 395 399 401 +2 +6 +9 America 167 166 167 171 +4 +5 +4 APAC 258 259 301 314 +13 +55* +56* By brand Sandro 547 551 575 583 +8 +32 +36 Maje 453 457 477 485 +8 +28 +32 Claudie Pierlot 203 201 206 206 - +5 +3 Suite 341 2 2 - - - -2 -2 Fursac 67 69 72 75 +3 +6 +8 Total DOS 1 272 1 280 1 330 1 349 +19 +69 +77Breakdown of POSNumber of POS Q3-22 2022 H1-23 Q3-23 vs.H1 23 vs.2022 vs.Q3 22 By region France 456 461 464 464 - +3 +8 EMEA 544 552 520 540 +20 -12 -4 America 198 198 200 209 +9 +11 +11 APAC 472 472 474 491 +17 +19 +19 By brand Sandro 745 752 744 765 +21 +13 +20 Maje 620 627 615 633 +18 +6 +13 Claudie Pierlot 236 233 227 231 +4 -2 -5 Suite 341 2 2 - - - -2 -2 Fursac 67 69 72 75 +3 +6 +8 Total POS 1 670 1 683 1 658 1 704 +46 +21 +34 o/w Partners POS 398 403 328 355 +27 -48* -43** Including the stores transferred from POS to DOS in Australia and New Zealand from January 2023FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSNumber of points of sale (POS)The number of the Group’s points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly operated stores (DOS)  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth is the total sales in a given period compared to the same period in the previous year.

Consolidated net sales rose organically by 5.7%  driven in particular by the very good performances of Bureau Veritas and Crisis Prevention Institute. Our companies also pressed ahead with their targeted external growth strategies.We embarked on the new strategic directions announced in March  with a strong portfolio rotation  with the acquisition of a majority stake in the Scalian Group  and the announcement of the ongoing sale of Constantia Flexibles  above Net Asset Value.Last week  we announced the potential acquisition of IK Partners  a major step in the deployment of the strategy we announced on March 16. It will be the foundation of the private asset management division we are building. Implementing this ambitious strategy will accelerate Wendel’s diversification  boost recurring cash flow generation and enhance our attractiveness as an investor and as a listed company.I am convinced that in the years to come  we will be able to grow our asset management activity through both organic growth or new opportunities for external growth together with direct investments from our permanent capital. This will create value for Wendel’s shareholders with both NAV increase and significant dividends while preserving our company’s strong financial profile.""Nine-month 2023 sales of Group companiesNine-month 2023 consolidated sales(in millions of euros) 9-month 2022 9-month 2023 Δ Organic Δ Bureau Veritas 4 150.5 4 328.0 +4.3% +8.1% Stahl (1) 696.4 677.3 -2.7% -10.8% Crisis Prevention Institute 83.5 95.6 +14.5% +17.3% ACAMS (2) 39.6 62.7 n.a n.a Consolidated net sales (3)(4) 4 970.0 5 163.5 +3.9% +5.7%(1) Including the acquisition of ICP Industrial Solutions Group (ISG) since March 2023 (sales’ contribution of €62.7 m in the period).(2) ACAMS accounts have been consolidated since March 11  2022.

Organically  sales were down -10.8%  in a context of muted market demand across Leather and Coating  while FX contributed -1.0%.

Crisis Prevention Institute had a strong third quarter with revenues up +26.3% compared to the same period of the previous year.Growth was relatively consistent across geographies. North American revenues were up +18% vs. 2022 driven by higher price and volume mix (+24% increase in renewals)  whilst international revenue grew by +10% over the same period  primarily reflecting the +14% year-over-year growth in the UK  Ireland and Australia which collectively comprise 90% of non-North American business.The targeted country-specific strategies implemented by CPI are yielding early benefits  notably in France and the recently established office in the UAE  to which CPI expanded through a partnership with the US-based Cleveland Clinic.ACAMS – Q3 sales increased by +5.5% vs. last year and +2.6% year-to-date(full consolidation)ACAMS  the global leader in training and certifications for anti-money laundering and financial-crime prevention professionals  generated third-quarter revenue of $22.3 million4  up +5.5% vs. Q3 2022  and year-to-date revenue of $71.45 million  or +2.6% above the same period in the prior year.

Excluding revenue from this customer  year-to-date revenue would have increased 8% versus the same period in 2022. The Company’s growth throughout the year reflects momentum in its expanded enterprise sales efforts  notably in the U.S. and Europe  and increased adoption by banks in China in preparation for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) mutual evaluation.ACAMS anticipates modest growth through the end of the year  the extent of which will depend upon the execution timing of certain large enterprise contracts.

The ACAMS Board of Directors is working with an executive search firm to identify a new CEO.Tarkett – Organic sales growth of +6.0% in Q3 2023. Record revenue in Sports.

Organic growth was +6.0% (or +5.7% including sales price variations in the CIS region). The total effect of the selling price increases implemented across all segments is +3.1% on average compared to the third quarter of 2022.

The economic context of high inflation and interest rates is penalizing renovation and new construction projects throughout the area. Activity in the Residential segment was significantly lower than in 2022 due to an unfavorable product mix  with vinyl rolls performing better than more expensive categories such as parquet. Activity in the Commercial segments fell only slightly compared to 2022 thanks to the good performance of volumes in the two main categories  vinyl products for the health and education sector and carpets for offices.

Consolidated net sales rose organically by 5.7%  driven in particular by the very good performances of Bureau Veritas and Crisis Prevention Institute. Our companies also pressed ahead with their targeted external growth strategies.We embarked on the new strategic directions announced in March  with a strong portfolio rotation  with the acquisition of a majority stake in the Scalian Group  and the announcement of the ongoing sale of Constantia Flexibles  above Net Asset Value.Last week  we announced the potential acquisition of IK Partners  a major step in the deployment of the strategy we announced on March 16. It will be the foundation of the private asset management division we are building. Implementing this ambitious strategy will accelerate Wendel’s diversification  boost recurring cash flow generation and enhance our attractiveness as an investor and as a listed company.I am convinced that in the years to come  we will be able to grow our asset management activity through both organic growth or new opportunities for external growth together with direct investments from our permanent capital. This will create value for Wendel’s shareholders with both NAV increase and significant dividends while preserving our company’s strong financial profile.""Nine-month 2023 sales of Group companiesNine-month 2023 consolidated sales(in millions of euros) 9-month 2022 9-month 2023 Δ Organic Δ Bureau Veritas 4 150.5 4 328.0 +4.3% +8.1% Stahl (1) 696.4 677.3 -2.7% -10.8% Crisis Prevention Institute 83.5 95.6 +14.5% +17.3% ACAMS (2) 39.6 62.7 n.a n.a Consolidated net sales (3)(4) 4 970.0 5 163.5 +3.9% +5.7%(1) Including the acquisition of ICP Industrial Solutions Group (ISG) since March 2023 (sales’ contribution of €62.7 m in the period).(2) ACAMS accounts have been consolidated since March 11  2022.

Organically  sales were down -10.8%  in a context of muted market demand across Leather and Coating  while FX contributed -1.0%.

Crisis Prevention Institute had a strong third quarter with revenues up +26.3% compared to the same period of the previous year.Growth was relatively consistent across geographies. North American revenues were up +18% vs. 2022 driven by higher price and volume mix (+24% increase in renewals)  whilst international revenue grew by +10% over the same period  primarily reflecting the +14% year-over-year growth in the UK  Ireland and Australia which collectively comprise 90% of non-North American business.The targeted country-specific strategies implemented by CPI are yielding early benefits  notably in France and the recently established office in the UAE  to which CPI expanded through a partnership with the US-based Cleveland Clinic.ACAMS – Q3 sales increased by +5.5% vs. last year and +2.6% year-to-date(full consolidation)ACAMS  the global leader in training and certifications for anti-money laundering and financial-crime prevention professionals  generated third-quarter revenue of $22.3 million4  up +5.5% vs. Q3 2022  and year-to-date revenue of $71.45 million  or +2.6% above the same period in the prior year.

Excluding revenue from this customer  year-to-date revenue would have increased 8% versus the same period in 2022. The Company’s growth throughout the year reflects momentum in its expanded enterprise sales efforts  notably in the U.S. and Europe  and increased adoption by banks in China in preparation for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) mutual evaluation.ACAMS anticipates modest growth through the end of the year  the extent of which will depend upon the execution timing of certain large enterprise contracts.

Organic growth was +6.0% (or +5.7% including sales price variations in the CIS region).

The economic context of high inflation and interest rates is penalizing renovation and new construction projects throughout the area. Activity in the Residential segment was significantly lower than in 2022 due to an unfavorable product mix  with vinyl rolls performing better than more expensive categories such as parquet. Activity in the Commercial segments fell only slightly compared to 2022 thanks to the good performance of volumes in the two main categories  vinyl products for the health and education sector and carpets for offices.

Revenue in the third quarter of 2023 included a €53 million benefit in Music Publishing from the accrual for a catch-up payment from certain DSPs related to the Copyright Royalty Board Phonorecords III ruling in 2023 (the ""CRB Phonorecords III Accrual"") . Revenue in the third quarter of 2022 included a previously disclosed €71 million benefit in Recorded Music from the settlement of a copyright infringement lawsuit with an internet service provider (the ""Legal Settlement""). Excluding both of these items  revenue grew 4.1% year-over-year  or 10.6% in constant currency.UMG's Recorded Music  Music Publishing and Merchandising and Other segments all contributed to the revenue growth in the quarter  as discussed further below.EBITDA for the quarter declined 11.3% year-over-year  or 5.9% in constant currency  to €478 million. EBITDA margin was 17.4%  compared to 20.2% in the third quarter of 2022. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €103 million during the third quarter of 2023  compared to €14 million during the third quarter of 2022. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expenses  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was €581 million  up 5.1% year-over-year  or 11.3% in constant currency  driven by the revenue growth and cash compensation savings of €21 million associated with the equity plan rollout. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.1%  compared to 20.8% in the third quarter of 2022.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2023 included a €11 million benefit in Music Publishing from the CRB Phonorecords III Accrual. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 included a €52 million benefit from the Legal Settlement. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA was up 13.8% year-over-year  or 20.0% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 1.8 percentage points to 21.1%  compared to 19.3% in the third quarter of 2022.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA were also impacted by revenue mix  as revenues in the third quarter of 2023 were more heavily weighted towards Merchandising and Other revenues  which carry a lower EBITDA margin than the Company's Recorded Music and Music Publishing revenues  and towards physical sales  which carry a lower EBITDA margin than digital sales. This impact was partially offset by the timing of certain A&R expenses  which were elevated in the third quarter of 2022.YTD 2023 ResultsIn the nine months ended September 30  2023  UMG's revenues of €7 901 million increased by 6.8% year-over-year  or 9.4% in constant currency  compared to the nine months ended September 30  2022.

EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €448 million during the first nine months of 2023  compared to €16 million during the first nine months of 2022. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2023 was €1 692 million  up 11.7% compared to the first nine months of 2022  and up 14.4% in constant currency  driven by the revenue growth and cash compensation savings of €55 million associated with the equity plan rollout.

In prior years  these revenues were recognized when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue  in both 2022 and 2023  was based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters compared to periods before 2022 and also  notably in the second quarter of 2022  reflected the receipt of higher income than was accrued at the end of 2021.Legal SettlementRevenue  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 included a benefit from the settlement of a copyright infringement lawsuit with an internet service provider previously disclosed and booked in Q3 2022.CRB Phonorecords III AccrualRevenue  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 included the accrual for a catch-up payment from certain DSPs related to the Copyright Royalty Board Phonorecords III ruling in 2023 disclosed and booked in Q3 2023.Conference Call DetailsThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results on Thursday  October 26  2023  at 6:15pm CEST .

These non-IFRS measures (also known as alternative performance indicators) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of UMG's performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which UMG operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. UMG believes that an understanding of its sales performance  profitability  financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS measures. All non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  other IFRS measures of operating and financial performance as described in this press release. In addition  it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-IFRS measures that differ from those used by UMG  thereby affecting comparability.EBITDA and EBITDA marginUMG considers EBITDA and EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess its operating performance and the performance of its operating segments as reported in the segment data. It enables UMG to compare the performance of operating segments regardless of whether their performance is driven by the operating segment's organic growth or by acquisitions. It excludes restructuring expenses  which may impact period-to-period comparability. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue.

It will be the foundation of the private asset management division we are building. Implementing this ambitious strategy will accelerate Wendel’s diversification  boost recurring cash flow generation and enhance our attractiveness as an investor and as a listed company.I am convinced that in the years to come  we will be able to grow our asset management activity through both organic growth or new opportunities for external growth together with direct investments from our permanent capital.

Organically  sales were down -10.8%  in a context of muted market demand across Leather and Coating  while FX contributed -1.0%.

Crisis Prevention Institute had a strong third quarter with revenues up +26.3% compared to the same period of the previous year.Growth was relatively consistent across geographies. North American revenues were up +18% vs. 2022 driven by higher price and volume mix (+24% increase in renewals)  whilst international revenue grew by +10% over the same period  primarily reflecting the +14% year-over-year growth in the UK  Ireland and Australia which collectively comprise 90% of non-North American business.The targeted country-specific strategies implemented by CPI are yielding early benefits  notably in France and the recently established office in the UAE  to which CPI expanded through a partnership with the US-based Cleveland Clinic.ACAMS – Q3 sales increased by +5.5% vs. last year and +2.6% year-to-date(full consolidation)ACAMS  the global leader in training and certifications for anti-money laundering and financial-crime prevention professionals  generated third-quarter revenue of $22.3 million4  up +5.5% vs. Q3 2022  and year-to-date revenue of $71.45 million  or +2.6% above the same period in the prior year.

Excluding revenue from this customer  year-to-date revenue would have increased 8% versus the same period in 2022. The Company’s growth throughout the year reflects momentum in its expanded enterprise sales efforts  notably in the U.S. and Europe  and increased adoption by banks in China in preparation for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) mutual evaluation.ACAMS anticipates modest growth through the end of the year  the extent of which will depend upon the execution timing of certain large enterprise contracts.

Organic growth was +6.0% (or +5.7% including sales price variations in the CIS region). The total effect of the selling price increases implemented across all segments is +3.1% on average compared to the third quarter of 2022.

The economic context of high inflation and interest rates is penalizing renovation and new construction projects throughout the area. Activity in the Residential segment was significantly lower than in 2022 due to an unfavorable product mix  with vinyl rolls performing better than more expensive categories such as parquet. Activity in the Commercial segments fell only slightly compared to 2022 thanks to the good performance of volumes in the two main categories  vinyl products for the health and education sector and carpets for offices.

Consolidated net sales rose organically by 5.7%  driven in particular by the very good performances of Bureau Veritas and Crisis Prevention Institute. Our companies also pressed ahead with their targeted external growth strategies.We embarked on the new strategic directions announced in March  with a strong portfolio rotation  with the acquisition of a majority stake in the Scalian Group  and the announcement of the ongoing sale of Constantia Flexibles  above Net Asset Value.Last week  we announced the potential acquisition of IK Partners  a major step in the deployment of the strategy we announced on March 16. It will be the foundation of the private asset management division we are building. Implementing this ambitious strategy will accelerate Wendel’s diversification  boost recurring cash flow generation and enhance our attractiveness as an investor and as a listed company.I am convinced that in the years to come  we will be able to grow our asset management activity through both organic growth or new opportunities for external growth together with direct investments from our permanent capital. This will create value for Wendel’s shareholders with both NAV increase and significant dividends while preserving our company’s strong financial profile.""Nine-month 2023 sales of Group companiesNine-month 2023 consolidated sales(in millions of euros) 9-month 2022 9-month 2023 Δ Organic Δ Bureau Veritas 4 150.5 4 328.0 +4.3% +8.1% Stahl (1) 696.4 677.3 -2.7% -10.8% Crisis Prevention Institute 83.5 95.6 +14.5% +17.3% ACAMS (2) 39.6 62.7 n.a n.a Consolidated net sales (3)(4) 4 970.0 5 163.5 +3.9% +5.7%(1) Including the acquisition of ICP Industrial Solutions Group (ISG) since March 2023 (sales’ contribution of €62.7 m in the period).(2) ACAMS accounts have been consolidated since March 11  2022.

Organically  sales were down -10.8%  in a context of muted market demand across Leather and Coating  while FX contributed -1.0%.

Crisis Prevention Institute had a strong third quarter with revenues up +26.3% compared to the same period of the previous year.Growth was relatively consistent across geographies. North American revenues were up +18% vs. 2022 driven by higher price and volume mix (+24% increase in renewals)  whilst international revenue grew by +10% over the same period  primarily reflecting the +14% year-over-year growth in the UK  Ireland and Australia which collectively comprise 90% of non-North American business.The targeted country-specific strategies implemented by CPI are yielding early benefits  notably in France and the recently established office in the UAE  to which CPI expanded through a partnership with the US-based Cleveland Clinic.ACAMS – Q3 sales increased by +5.5% vs. last year and +2.6% year-to-date(full consolidation)ACAMS  the global leader in training and certifications for anti-money laundering and financial-crime prevention professionals  generated third-quarter revenue of $22.3 million4  up +5.5% vs. Q3 2022  and year-to-date revenue of $71.45 million  or +2.6% above the same period in the prior year.

Excluding revenue from this customer  year-to-date revenue would have increased 8% versus the same period in 2022. The Company’s growth throughout the year reflects momentum in its expanded enterprise sales efforts  notably in the U.S. and Europe  and increased adoption by banks in China in preparation for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) mutual evaluation.ACAMS anticipates modest growth through the end of the year  the extent of which will depend upon the execution timing of certain large enterprise contracts.

Organic growth was +6.0% (or +5.7% including sales price variations in the CIS region). The total effect of the selling price increases implemented across all segments is +3.1% on average compared to the third quarter of 2022.

The economic context of high inflation and interest rates is penalizing renovation and new construction projects throughout the area. Activity in the Residential segment was significantly lower than in 2022 due to an unfavorable product mix  with vinyl rolls performing better than more expensive categories such as parquet. Activity in the Commercial segments fell only slightly compared to 2022 thanks to the good performance of volumes in the two main categories  vinyl products for the health and education sector and carpets for offices.

Net new business contribution accelerated quarter on quarter to reach 2% in the second half. The end of the Testing Centers contract in the UK impacted the first three quarters and accounted for -1.2% in the full year organic growth. Finally  an accounting change related to the revenue recognition in a large Energy & Resources contract affected the organic growth of the year by -0.5%  and by -2.3% for the fourth quarter alone where the change was implemented retroactively for the full year.Organic growth was boosted by a strong recovery in Food services up +16%. FM services were up +3%  or +6% excluding the impact of the end of the Testing Centers contract in the UK. Food services represented 64% of total On-Site revenues during the period  increasing from 60% in Fiscal 2022  and almost back up to pre-Covid levels.Key performance indicators improved significantly in Fiscal 2023:client retention rate reached a record at 95.2%  up +70 bps compared to the previous year  which was already the highest rate ever. This performance was the result of the strong focus and discipline of the teams  and improvement in processes that have been implemented over the last years.new sales development was 7.0%  down -50 bps versus last year in percentage of prior year revenue  but up in value and in the target range of 7-8%. Total new signings during the year  including cross-selling  amounted to 1.7 billion euros compared to 1.5 billion euros in Fiscal 2022.as a result  the net new business signed during the year was more than 2% for the second year in a row  demonstrating the ability of the business to generate consistent net new development to sustain future growth.North AmericaREVENUES BY SEGMENT(in million euros) FISCAL 2023 FISCAL 2022 ORGANIC GROWTH Business & Administrations 3 866 2 983 +23.4% Healthcare & Seniors 3 440 3 047 +8.8% Education 3 173 2 798 +9.1% NORTH AMERICA TOTAL 10 479 8 828 +13.9%Fiscal 2023 North America revenues totaled 10.5 billion euros  up +13.9% organically. This strong growth resulted from the post-Covid recovery in the first half  and the acceleration of revenue contribution from net development and cross-selling in the second half. The growth was also driven by consistent 5% of price revisions throughout the fiscal year  although with a slight decrease in the fourth quarter as the cost inflation drivers on cost plus accounts declined.Organic growth in Business & Administrations was +23.4%  boosted by the return to the office and new contracts in Corporate Services  increased activity in Sports events  convention centers and airport lounges  with increased passenger counts and higher spend per capita  as well as inflation pass-through. Although coming from a smaller base  Convenience solutions and Entegra also contributed to the momentum with strong organic growth.In Healthcare & Seniors  revenues were up +8.8% organically  driven by price increases  cross-selling and retail volume improvement. The net new development contribution has accelerated through-out the year with the full impact of the Ardent mobilization  now visible in the second half.In Education  organic growth was up +9.1% compared to the previous year  driven by Universities up +13.4%  benefiting from strong attendance levels  price increases  and a higher level of board plans  retail sales and event catering.

The growth was driven by strong price revisions  continued improvement in return to the office and very strong Sports & Leisure activity. Thanks to a strong fourth quarter in Sports & Leisure in France and new business in Government in the United Kingdom  combined with high level of growth in Corporate services  organic growth in the fourth quarter in Europe was +9.0%  trending favorably compared to the third quarter which was at +6.9% excluding the impact of Testing Centers affected by strikes and bank holidays.In Business & Administration  organic growth was +12.2%  boosted by strong price revisions  continued improvement in the return to the office  significant IFM project works and retail picking up  particularly in Continental Europe. Sports & Leisure growth was very strong  boosted by record sales in tourism in France  sports events (Roland Garros and Tour de France)  and an increase in number and size of corporate events.This was somewhat offset by contract losses in Energy & Resources in Northern Europe.In Healthcare & Seniors  organic growth of -2.4% was impacted by the end of the Testing Centers. The rest of the business was +9.1%  with the contribution of new openings and solid occupancy in Seniors particularly in France.Organic revenue growth in Education was +4.4%  reflecting in the first half some volume recovery following the impact of Covid lock downs in the previous year. The third quarter was affected by strikes in France and an overall increase in bank holidays  offset in the fourth quarter by positive impact of working days. Pricing contribution was lower than in most segments  particularly in France where passing on inflation was hampered by the use of inadequate indices.

This significant increase is due to M&A costs  one-off spin-off costs of Pluxee this year (12 million euros) and restructuring costs principally related to the change in organization from global segments to geographies. Prior year also benefited from 52 million euros of net gains related to the disposals program  including the Childcare business.As a result  the Operating Profit is 847 million euros compared to 812 million euros in the previous year.Fiscal 2023 Net financial expenses increased to 101 million euros against 87 million euros in the previous year. The increase is mainly due to 14 million euros costs linked to the bond consent process related to the spin-off project of Pluxee. The blended cost of debt at Fiscal 2023 year-end was at 1.7%  10 basis points higher than at Fiscal 2022 year end  mainly due to the increased costs associated with the USD floating rates swaps.The tax charge was down significantly to 181 million euros  despite a higher pre-tax profit  leading to an Effective Tax Rate of 24.6% against 28.8% in the prior year. This improvement is explained by the decrease in the CVAE rate in France and the better pre-tax results in France where deferred tax assets are not recognized. In addition  improved financial outlook in some geographies (mainly Germany and Netherlands) have led to a recognition of deferred tax assets related to prior years losses  excluding which  the Effective Tax Rate would have been of 25.5%.The share of profit of other companies accounted for using the equity method was 12 million euros  slightly up compared to 8 million euros last year. Profit attributed to non-controlling interests was 8 million euros compared to the previous year amount of 6 million euros.As a result  Sodexo continuing operations net income amounted to 560 million euros  against 514 million euros in Fiscal 2022. Underlying net profit adjusted for Other operating income and expenses net of tax reached 659 million euros  compared to 525 million euros in Fiscal 2022.1.5 Net profit from discontinued operation (Pluxee)The following income statement for Pluxee is built by difference between Group (before classification of Pluxee as discontinued operation) and Sodexo income statement under IFRS 5. Therefore  it does not reflect Pluxee stand-alone.

The margin increased to 33.1% up +450 bps or +480 bps excluding currencies  resulting from operating leverage  fueled by strong growth in business volumes across all regions  despite sustained investments in Tech & Digital  and significant increase in interest rates boosting financial revenues and margins.Pluxee Other operating income and expenses include 19 million euros of spin-off costs.The increase in Pluxee net financial expense is the result of the intercompany debt costs.The tax charge was up to 80 million euros.As a result  Pluxee net income (group share) amounted to 234 million euros  against 181 million euros in Fiscal 2022. Given the accounting of Pluxee as discontinued operations  the net income is presented in the Group Income Statement on a separate line after income from continuing operations.2 Consolidated financial position(with Pluxee as discontinued operations)2.1 Cash flows(in million euros) FISCAL 2023 FISCAL 2022restated Operating cash flow 1 130 977 Change in working capital (222) (193) IFRS 16 leases outflow (186) (196) Net capital expenditure (348) (262) Free cash flow from continuing operations(1) 374 326 Net acquisitions (21) (41) Share buy-backs/Treasury stock (57) (13) Dividends paid to shareholders (352) (294) Other changes (including scope and exchange rates)(2) 646 2 (Increase)/decrease in net debt from continuing operations 590 (20) Pluxee Free cash flow (discontinued operation) 438 305 Pluxee (Increase)/decrease in net debt (discontinued operation)(2) (397) 230 Group Free cash flow 812 631 Group (Increase)/decrease in net debt 193 210(1) The Group does not believe the accounting treatment introduced by IFRS16 modifies the operating nature of its lease transactions. Accordingly  to ensure the Group’s performance measures continue to best reflect its operating performance  the Group considers repayments of lease liabilities as operating items impacting the Free cash flow  which integrates all lease payments (fixed or variable). To be consistent  the lease liabilities are not included in Net debt (treated as operating items).(2) includes debt push-down from Sodexo to Pluxee for 0.6 billion eurosFree cash flow from continuing operations  adjusted for IFRS16  was 374 million euros against 326 million euros in Fiscal 2022.Operating cash flow improved to 1 130 million euros against 977 million euros in the previous year  as a result of the improvement in Underlying operating profit.The Working capital outflow in Fiscal 2023 of 222 million euros was similar to last year. It was affected by some residual unwinding of government Covid-linked payment delays in North America and Northern Europe  a change in supplier payment delays in Europe  as well as significant payroll timing impact in North America.Net capital expenditure  including client investments  increased to 348 million euros  and 1.5% of revenues  compared to 262 million euros in the preceding year  at 1.3% of revenues. Gross capex was 520 million euros  or 2.3% of revenues of which more than 85% was client facing investments. The increase in capital expenditure compared to the prior year is mainly coming from more significant client investments in North America  in the Education and Healthcare segments  in particular with the Ardent contract  in Australia in Mining and in the UK related to new sales in Government and Healthcare. M&A activity was limited in Fiscal 2023 with net acquisition spend of 21 million euros.In order to project the post spin-off financial position  intragroup loans and deposits between Sodexo and Pluxee are considered as settled as at August 31  2023 in this table  even though they will be settled only just prior to the listing date of Pluxee. As a consequence  Other changes includes in Fiscal 2023 a 0.6 billion euros debt push-down to Pluxee.The resulting restated net debt from continuing activities reduced by 590 million euros ending the year to 2 918 million euros at August 31  2023.Pluxee net debt increased by 397 million euros due to the 610 millions d'euros debt push-down (considered as settled as of August 31  2023).2.2 Adjusted condensed consolidated statement of financial position at August 31  2023(in million euros) AUGUST 31  2023 (1) AUGUST 31  2022 (in million euros) AUGUST 31  2023 (1) AUGUST 31  2022 Non-current assets 9 406 10 785 Shareholders’ equity 4 542 4 415 Current assets excluding cash 4 044 5 648 Non-controlling interests 12 10 Interco loans / deposits with Pluxee 1 215 — Non-current liabilities 6 440 7 223 Restricted cash + financial assets Pluxee — 1 257 Current liabilities 5 481 9 272 Cash 1 455 3 225 Assets held for sale 5 889 5 Liabilities held for sale 5 534 — TOTAL ASSETS 22 009 20 920 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY 22 009 20 920 Borrowings 5 588 5 742 Net debt (adjusted1) 2 918 1 268 Gearing (adjusted1) 64% 29% Net debt ratio (adjusted1) 2.4x 1.0x(1) In order to project the post spin-off financial position  in this table intragoup loans and deposits between Sodexo and Pluxee are not eliminated (on the one hand €1 215m loan from Sodexo to Pluxee  presented in this table in Assets  into ""interco loans / deposits with Pluxee"" with counterpart in ""Liabilities held for sale""  and on the other hand deposits from Pluxee in Sodexo cash-pooling for €570m  presented in the table in Assets as a reduction of Cash with counterpart in ""Assets held for sale"". These restatements explain the gaps with the Consolidated financial position in note 4.1.3  in which intragroup loans are eliminated. Moreover  these intragroup loans are considered as settled as at August 31  2023  and thus are part of the net debt calculation  as they will be settled just prior to the listing date of Pluxee.Reconciliation of balance sheet accounts as of August 31  2023 (in million euros) Consolidated financial position as published Adjustment Adjusted Consolidated financial position Interco loans to Pluxee — 1 215 1 215 Cash 2 025 (570) 1 455 Assets held for sale 5 319 570 5 889 Liabilities held for sale 4 319 1 215 5 534As of August 31  2023  Sodexo continuing operations net debt (adjusted to reflect the post spin-off situation) was 2 918 million euros  up significantly compared to the previous year at 1 268 million euros  which still included the Pluxee cash. As a result  gearing is at 64% and the net debt ratio is 2.4x for Sodexo continuing operations  compared to 1.0x last year for the Group including Pluxee. Restated with Pluxee as discontinued operations  net debt at the end of Fiscal 2022 would have been 3 508 million euros and the net debt ratio 3.4x.Fiscal 2023 Net debt is shown adjusted post spin-off  including Sodexo continuing activities net debt reduction of 0.6 billion euros due to the push-down to Pluxee.At year end  Sodexo continuing operations gross debt of 5.6 billion euros was 72% euro-denominated  21% dollar-denominated and 6% sterling denominated  with an average maturity of 3.8 years  95% at fixed rates and 100% covenant-free.By the end of Fiscal 2023  Operating cash of Sodexo continuing operations adjusted post spin-off reached a total of 1 455 million euros.At the year end  unused credit lines totaled 1.8 billion euros.2.3 Acquisitions and disposals for the periodFiscal 2023 has been a quiet period for both acquisitions and disposals of non-core activities and geographies.2.4 Earnings per sharePublished EPS was 5.44 euros against 4.75 euros in Fiscal 2022. The weighted average number of shares for Fiscal 2023 was more or less stable at 146 127 620 compared to 146 295 576 shares for Fiscal 2022. Underlying EPS was 6.21 euros  up +30% compared to the prior year.2.5 Proposed dividendThe Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of 3.10 euros  up +29.2% compared to Fiscal 2022  in line with our policy of a pay-out-ratio of 50% of Underlying net profit.2.6 Currency effectExchange rate fluctuations do not generate operational risks  because each subsidiary bills its revenues and incurs its expenses in the same currency.1€= AVERAGERATE FY 2023 AVERAGERATE FY 2022 AVERAGERATE FY 2023VS.

However  the euro has been increasing since the end of the first half Fiscal 2023 and therefore the currency impact is negative in the second half. On the other hand  UK sterling was down -2.8% during the year  explaining a negative impact of currencies in Europe. The impact of currency mix on the Underlying operating margin was negligible. Group net income was impacted by a negative currency impact of -1.3%  mainly coming from Pluxee discontinued operations.Sodexo (continuing activities) operates in 45 countries. The percentage of total revenues and Underlying operating profit denominated in the main currencies are as follows:FISCAL 2023 % OF REVENUES % OF UNDERLYINGOPERATING PROFIT U.S. dollar 44% 63% Euro 23% -4% UK pound Sterling 8% 11% Brazilian real 4% 8%The currency effect is determined by applying the previous year’s average exchange rates to the current year figures.2.7 OutlookGiven the strategic progress made in Fiscal 2022 and 2023  Sodexo is on track to pursue its recovery in North America  enhance efficiency and agility  continue to transform the food offers and operations and grow selectively in Facilities Management. Commercial excellence  data and digital investments and supply management support  will all contribute to better commercial momentum and better margins.The Underlying revenue organic growth exit rate in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023 was over +10%.With continued inflation being passed through  pricing is expected to average out at 3-4% for Fiscal 2024.

Therefore  it corresponds to the Net Income Group share excluding Other Income and Expense and significant non-recurring elements in both Net Financial Expense and Income Tax Expense where relevant.Underlying net profit per shareUnderlying Net profit per share presents the Underlying net profit divided by the average number of shares.Underlying operating profit marginThe underlying operating profit margin corresponds to Underlying operating profit divided by revenues.Underlying operating profit margin at constant ratesThe underlying operating profit margin at constant rates corresponds to Underlying operating profit divided by revenues  calculated by converting 2023 figures at Fiscal 2022 rates  except for countries with hyperinflationary economies.Fiscal 2023Condensed consolidated financial statementsNotes to the Financial Statements will be found in the Universal Registration Document to be published on November 3  2023The comparative period presented in the consolidated income statement and in the consolidated cash flow statement disclosed in the document has been restated to reflect the classification as discontinued operations of Benefit & Rewards Service activity (Pluxee) in accordance with IFRS 5 “Assets held for sale and discontinued operations”.

(  GeoJunxion  ) and Road Runner B.V. in connection with the sale of all issued an,(MENAFN- GlobeNewsWire - Nasdaq) This is a joint press release by GeoJunxion N.V. ( GeoJunxion ) and Road Runner B.V. in connection with the sale of all issued and outstanding ordinary shares in the share capital of GeoJunxion B.V.  GeoJunxion's sole operating entity. This announcement does not constitute an offer  or any solicitation of any offer  to buy or subscribe for any securities in GeoJunxion. This announcement is not for release  publication or distribution  in whole or in part  in or into  directly or indirectly  in any jurisdiction in which such release  publication or distribution would be unlawful.GeoJunxion to sell its entire business and dissolveCapelle aan den IJssel  the Netherlands  26 October 2023With reference to the publication of the shareholder circular ( Shareholder Circular ) today  GeoJunxion and Road Runner B.V. jointly announce that they reached a definitive  conditional agreement in the form of a share purchase agreement ( SPA ) relating to the sale of all issued and outstanding ordinary shares in the share capital of GeoJunxion B.V. (the Share Sale ). Pursuant to the SPA  the shares in GeoJunxion B.V. will be transferred to Road Runner B.V.  and  as a result thereof  GeoJunxion's entire business and all its assets and liabilities will be indirectly transferred  effectively transforming GeoJunxion in a listed shell company (or cash box) holding only the proceeds from the Share Sale and without any liabilities. It is anticipated that GeoJunxion will  subject to completion of the Share Sale in accordance with the SPA ( Completion ) taking place  be dissolved (the Dissolution ) following which GeoJunxion will liquidate its assets and liabilities ( Liquidation ) and the ordinary shares in the share capital of GeoJunxion (the Listed Shares ) will be delisted from Euronext Amsterdam (the Delisting ). Completion is subject to  among others  approval by the general meeting of shareholders of GeoJunxion.The transactions contemplated under the SPA  including the Share Sale  Dissolution  Liquidation  Distribution (as defined below) and Delisting are hereinafter referred to as the Proposed Transaction .The management board ( Management Board ) and the supervisory board ( Supervisory Board   together with the Management Board  the Boards ) of GeoJunxion believe that the Proposed Transaction is in the best interest of GeoJunxion and GeoJunxion B.V.  promoting the continued success of their business and sustainable long-term value creation  taking into account the interests of all of its stakeholders  including Disinterested Shareholders (as defined below).Transaction highlightsSale of all issued and outstanding ordinary shares in the share capital of GeoJunxion B.V. to Road Runner B.V. at a fixed purchase price of EUR 4 670 795.80 (the Purchase Price )  which reflects a price per Listed Share of EUR 1.10. As a result  GeoJunxion will hold only the proceeds from the Share Sale and no liabilities. Upon Completion it is anticipated that GeoJunxion will be dissolved following which the Liquidation and Delisting will take place.As part of the Liquidation  an advance liquidation distribution equal to the Purchase Price will be made to holders of Listed Shares (each a Shareholder ). The advance liquidation distribution to be made to Shareholders will be EUR 1.10 per Listed Share assuming no changes to the issued share capital prior to Completion (the Distribution ). The Distribution shall be paid free from Dutch dividend withholding tax. Given that GeoJunxion N.V. is expected to have no other assets and liabilities  no further liquidation distributions are expected. On that basis the total proceeds for the Shareholders in the Proposed Transaction will be EUR 1.10 per Listed Share. Road Runner B.V. and GeoJunxion have agreed to appropriate indemnities to protect GeoJunxion in relation to the Liquidation and Distribution.The Proposed Transaction delivers immediate  certain and attractive value to the Shareholders. The Purchase Price represents a premium of approximately 24% to the GeoJunxion closing price per Listed Share on 24 October 2023 and a premium of approximately 41% to the average volume weighted price per Listed Share for the 20 days prior to and including 24 October 2023 of EUR 0.78.The Proposed Transaction is entered into with two existing longstanding (direct or indirect) Shareholders which (directly or indirectly) hold an aggregate of 38.31% of the Listed Shares: Parkland Resources B.V.  and Magnus I B.V. (together  the Purchasers ). Road Runner B.V. has been established by the Purchasers for the sole purpose of the Proposed Transaction. The Purchasers are also debt providers of GeoJunxion and GeoJunxion B.V. Instead of receiving EUR 1.10 in cash per Listed Share held by them pursuant to the Distribution  the Purchasers' and Purchaser Related Parties' (as defined in the Shareholder Circular) right to the Distribution will be settled separately as part of the Purchase Price.The Boards fully support the Proposed Transaction and unanimously recommend Shareholders to vote in favour of the resolutions ( Resolutions ) to be proposed at the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to be held in connection with the Proposed Transaction ( EGM ).The EGM will take place on 12 December 2023 at 10:00 CET.Completion is subject to certain conditions  including that the Share Sale is approved with a majority of the votes cast in the EGM on the issued and outstanding Listed Shares held by Shareholders other than the Purchasers and the Purchaser Related Parties ( Disinterested Shareholders ) as present and represented at the EGM.The Purchasers have irrevocably undertaken on customary terms and conditions to vote their respective Listed Shares in favour of the Resolutions. In addition  the other debt provider of GeoJunxion and GeoJunxion B.V.  QuaeroQ N.V.  has also irrevocably undertaken on customary terms and conditions to vote its Listed Shares in favour of the Resolutions. The Purchasers and QuaeroQ N.V. hold approximately 49.60% of the Listed Shares.Completion of the Share Sale is expected on 15 January 2023.Background and rationale of the Proposed TransactionThe entering into the SPA followed the earlier announcement by Euronext Amsterdam N.V. ( Euronext ) that it would delist the Listed Shares from Euronext Amsterdam due to GeoJunxion's recent annual accounts not having been audited by an“OOB” certified auditor. The initiation of the delisting process qualifies as an event of default under the Bridge Loan Agreement (as defined in the Shareholder Circular) entered into between GeoJunxion  GeoJunxion B.V  Parkland Resources B.V. and QuaeroQ N.V.  making the amounts outstanding under the Bridge Loan Agreement to become immediately due and payable. In anticipation of an expected formal announcement by Euronext to start the delisting procedure  the Purchasers  initially together with QuaeroQ N.V.  expressed their possible interest to explore a potential joint acquisition of GeoJunxion B.V. and the Boards entered into exploratory discussions with the Purchasers regarding the Proposed Transaction. Negotiations later on continued between the Purchasers on the one hand and GeoJunxion on the other hand.Before entering into the SPA  the Management Board and Supervisory Board made a thorough assessment of the Proposed Transaction taking into account the interests of GeoJunxion  GeoJunxion B.V. and all their stakeholders  including the Disinterested Shareholders. The Boards followed a comprehensive process and gave careful consideration to determining the best strategic option for GeoJunxion and GeoJunxion B.V. As part of this process  the Boards  during several meetings and conference calls  together and also separately  intensively discussed GeoJunxion's and GeoJunxion B.V.'s interests  the best course for their continued success and long-term value creation and the interests of all their stakeholders. Their considerations  reasoned views and recommendations regarding the Proposed Transaction are set out in detail in the Shareholder Circular.At the end of the process  the Boards unanimously concluded that the SPA  and the actions and transactions contemplated under the Proposed Transaction  are in the best interest of GeoJunxion and GeoJunxion B.V.  promoting the continued success of the business and sustainable long-term value creation  taking into account the interests of all of its stakeholders  including the Disinterested Shareholders  and that Road Runner B.V. becoming the sole shareholder of GeoJunxion B.V. will provide strategic and other benefits to its business.Dissolution  Liquidation and DistributionThe objective of the Proposed Transaction is that  at Completion  all of the Listed Shares and thereby GeoJunxion's entire business and all its assets and liabilities will be transferred to Road Runner B.V.  effectively transforming GeoJunxion in a listed shell company without any liabilities and that the Dissolution  Liquidation  Distribution and Delisting can be executed. Shareholders are therefore requested to  in addition to approving the Share Sale  adopt resolutions to effectuate the Dissolution  Liquidation and Distribution  subject to Completion. The Distribution of EUR 1.10 per Listed Share will be made to the Disinterested Shareholders in cash. The steps for the settlement of the non-cash portion of the Distribution owed to the Purchasers and/or Purchaser Related Parties are set out in more detail in the Shareholder Circular.DelistingGeoJunxion will submit a formal request to Euronext to delist the Listed Shares after the resolutions to approve the Share Sale and the Dissolution have taken effect. It is expected that the listing of the Listed Shares will end shortly following Completion.Conditions PrecedentCompletion of the Share Sale is conditional upon  among others  satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions prior to or ultimately on 31 January 2024:1. adoption of the resolution approving the Share Sale with a majority of the votes cast in the EGM by Shareholders  including a simple majority of the votes cast at the EGM on the issued and outstanding Listed Shares held by the Disinterested Shareholders as present and represented at the EGM;2. adoption of the other resolutions set out in items 2 - 6 of the agenda as included in Section 9 of the Shareholder Circular in accordance with the articles of association;3. the corporate warranties relating to GeoJunxion are true and accurate on the date of satisfaction of the Conditions Precedent under (1) and (2) above (the Unconditional Date );4. there is no material breach of the other warranties included in the SPA on the Unconditional Date;5. between the date of the SPA and the Unconditional Date  no event has occurred that has or is likely to have a materially adverse effect on the business  operations  assets  position (financial or trading) or profits of GeoJunxion B.V.;6. no legal proceedings from any Shareholder  which cannot reasonably be resolved on reasonable commercial terms prior to 31 January 2024  against GeoJunxion  GeoJunxion B.V.  the Purchasers or Road Runner B.V. in connection with the Share Sale  the Liquidation or the Distribution shall be pending on the Unconditional Date; and7. no Competing Offer (as defined in the Shareholder Circular) having been announced or made public.GovernanceIt is anticipated that all of the members of the Boards will resign from their current board positions with GeoJunxion as from Completion.At least during eighteen months as from Completion  the following governance is agreed upon.The management board of GeoJunxion B.V. will consist of the current members of the Management Board  being Messrs I.E.M.

Considerations herein are: (i) the withdrawal from the transaction of one of the Initial Consortium members (as defined in the Shareholder Circular)  (ii) the updated offer made by the remaining Initial Consortium members of EUR 1.35 per outstanding Listed Share  (iii) the deterioration in the economic environment (following interest hikes announced by the ECB)  (iv) lower business valuations  and (v) a slow-down in the company's business  reflected in the preliminary first quarter results and in the short-to-medium-term outlook.The Boards concluded that obtaining an updated Fairness Opinion was not feasible given the timeline for the transaction. The Boards are also taking into consideration that (i) the updated offer of EUR 4 670 795.80 still falls withing the valuation ranges of the Discounted Cash Flow and Trading Multiples valuation of the valuation report underlying the Fairness Opinion issued on 4 August 2023 and (ii) the updated offer represents a 41% premium compared with the average volume weighted price per Listed Share for the 20 days prior to and including 24 October 2023 of EUR 0.78.Financing of the Purchase PriceThe Purchaser has sufficient financing in place to fund the cash portion of the Purchase Price from readily available sources.Unanimous support and recommendation by the BoardsHaving reviewed the terms and conditions of the Proposed Transaction (including the strategic rationale and financial aspects of the Proposed Transaction)  the SPA  including the Non-Financial Covenants  compared to a standalone strategy and available alternative options  and having taken the interests of all of GeoJunxion's and GeoJunxion B.V.'s stakeholders into account  including its employees  Disinterested Shareholders  customers  suppliers and creditors  the Boards unanimously determined that the Proposed Transaction is in the best interest of GeoJunxion and GeoJunxion B.V.  promoting the continued success of their business and sustainable long-term value creation and that Road Runner B.V. becoming the sole shareholder of GeoJunxion B.V. will provide strategic and other benefits to it and its business. The strategic fit with the Purchasers  combined with the Non-Financial Covenants and the deal certainty  provide a clear path to execute on the strategy of GeoJunxion's and GeoJunxion B.V.'s business (including the support of the Strategy).Based on the above  on the terms and subject to the conditions of the SPA  the Boards unanimously (i) support the Proposed Transaction and (ii) recommend to the Shareholders to approve the Proposed Transaction and vote in favour of the Resolutions.Irrevocable undertakingsThe Purchasers and QuaeroQ N.V. have irrevocably undertaken on customary terms and conditions to vote their respective shares  amounting to approximately 49.61% based on the issued and outstanding share capital of GeoJunxion on the date of the SPA  in favour of the Resolutions.
