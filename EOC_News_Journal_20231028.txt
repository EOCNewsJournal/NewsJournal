31942,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-leaders-approve-taxing-profits-of-russian-assets-ukraine-war/,EU leaders approve using profits from frozen Russian assets,More than €200B in Russian assets are sitting in the EU.,"BRUSSELS — EU leaders endorsed unprecedented plans to use profits generated by frozen Russian state assets for Ukraine reconstruction  and called on the European Commission to make legal proposals to that effect  according to European Council summit conclusions.""Decisive progress is needed  in coordination with partners  on how any extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from Russia’s immobilized assets could be directed to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction  consistent with applicable contractual obligations  and in accordance with EU and international law. The European Council calls on the High Representative and the Commission to accelerate work with a view to submitting proposals "" they wrote.Of around $300 billion of Russian foreign reserves frozen by countries participating in sanctions at the onset of Moscow's war on Ukraine  the majority — more than €200 billion — sit in the EU. As Russian securities reach maturity and are reinvested by financial intermediaries  they generate a profit.The EU has floated the idea of taxing those profits for Ukraine’s benefit — but the European Central Bank and some EU capitals  including Paris and Berlin  have expressed doubts. They are afraid the move would roil financial markets and weaken the euro’s standing as a reserve currency.At a summit in Brussels on Friday  Commission President Ursula von der Leyen asked leaders for a mandate to make legal proposals  pointing to a supporting statement from G7 finance ministers issued earlier this month  according to people familiar with the leaders’ discussions.In the EU  the Baltic countries  Denmark  Sweden  Finland and Poland all spoke in favor of the idea. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo demanded that all legal  macroeconomic and monetary risks involved be taken into account  as did Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel  cautioning prudence.Belgian clearinghouse Euroclear sits on €180 billion of Russian state assets  according to the Belgian government  and generated €3 billion in profits in the first nine months of the year  it said in quarterly results published Thursday. Luxembourg is home to Clearstream  another clearinghouse currently holding frozen Russian securities.The decision comes on the last day of the European Council summit of EU leaders in Brussels. However  the idea of tapping those Russian assets for the benefit of rebuilding Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin's all-out invasion has been circulating since they were frozen under Western sanctions more than a year ago.In June  von der Leyen pledged to create a proposal on how to leverage Russian state assets ""before the summer break "" but none was forthcoming  due to concerns raised by the ECB and some capitals.The Commission then sought to marshal a G7 statement on leveraging Russian assets for Ukraine  in order to ensure the EU would not bear the legal and financial risks of taking such an unprecedented move alone. Despite EU attempts to broker one at recent gatherings of G7 justice and finance ministers  that also didn’t happen.EU leaders made the breakthrough as the Israel-Hamas war threatened to overshadow Russia's war in Ukraine.

The sales gain of approximately EUR 1.0 million (as released on July 4  2023) has been reduced by a goodwill allocation of EUR 0.4 million associated with the divested operation.CEO’s reviewThe third quarter started with major events  as we sold our fully-owned subsidiary FutureLab & Partners AB  acquired a Swedish brand  strategy  and communications company Open Communications International AB  and decreased business operations in Canada to focus on our core businesses in the European markets.Our turnover for the first nine months of 2023 experienced a decline compared to the same period last year  registering at 12.5 MEUR as opposed to 14.3 MEUR for the same period in 2022. In spite of the positive revenue impact of acquiring Open Communications International AB in Sweden  the revenue impact of selling FutureLab and downgrading expectations regarding our operations in Canada jointly resulted in decreasing our guidance regarding the turnover as announced in early July.The EBIT  EBITDA  and net income for the period felt the positive impact of a booked gain of 0.6 million EUR from the FutureLab sale. Nevertheless  even without this factor  our results showed improvement over the previous year with a EBITDA of -0.5 MEUR compared to -2.0 MEUR in the first nine months. Despite this progress  it's clear we have much more work ahead to reach a satisfactory level of profitability.Our primary markets  Sweden and Finland  have been affected by challenging general economic conditions  which has undoubtedly impacted segments of our business. This necessitates that we remain agile and responsive to the market's fluctuations.To forge ahead towards profitability  we've instituted several strategic measures this year  including:The acquisition of Open Communications International to strengthen our Brand strategy and communications offerings in Sweden and at the same time open up for synergies with Grow.Further savings programs have been implemented in Grow AB and in Digitalist Finland Oy to adapt the cost to the current market outlook.Selling FutureLab & Partners AB  which supports our equity  increased the financial flexibility and the focus on our core business.Downsizing our business operations in Canada  focusing increasingly on our core businesses in the European markets  especially in Sweden and Finland.We are constantly looking for new ways of running our business more effectively and are implementing even more actions during the fourth quarter.This said our most important task is to improve our topline. LeanLab  our SaaS business  is growing with new clients and recurring revenue. Adding to our open tech offering  we have also launched a new SaaS offering  Open Cloud  where we offer open technology products as a service. This opens up a new way for companies to leverage the strengths of open technology.We are continuing to serve both the private and public sector and are proud to have closed deals with clients like City of Helsinki  EQT  Pembroke  Business Sweden and Finnish VTT during the third quarter.While our profitability indicators reflect an upward momentum  we acknowledge that the pace of transformation needs acceleration. Every individual within our organisation is relentlessly committed to driving our business forward and enhancing value./CEO  Magnus LeijonborgFUTURE PROSPECTSIn 2023  turnover is expected to decrease and EBITDA is expected to improve in comparison with 2022.EVENTS DURING THE THIRD QUARTERDigitalist Group reorganized its business operations and decreased its earlier guidance regarding turnover 4.7.2023Digitalist Group sold its fully-owned subsidiary FutureLab & Partners ABDigitalist Group signed 4.7.2023 a share purchase agreement to divest its fully-owned subsidiary FutureLab & Partners AB.

(""ESOP 2023"") in accordance with items 8a - 8c below.The resolutions under items 8a - 8b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 8b below not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that Immunovia shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 8c below and resolutions under items 8a and 8c shall then be conditional upon each other.ESOP 2023 is a program under which the participants will be granted stock options (so called non-qualified in the United States) to purchase shares in Immunovia (""Options""). The Board of Directors proposes that a maximum of 1 934 463 Options may be allocated to the participants.8a - Adoption of a long-term incentive program for the Company's management and key personnelThe rationale for the proposalESOP 2023 is intended for members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Immunovia AB and Immunovia  Inc. The Board of Directors of Immunovia believes that an equity-based incentive program in the form of stock options is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate competent members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Immunovia and Immunovia  Inc.  and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. The proposed program is designed to match US market practices  reflecting the importance of attracting US-based personnel.Conditions for OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Options.The Options shall be granted at no cost to the participants.The Board of Directors shall resolve upon the allocation of Options upon commencement of employment and from time to time during employment based upon performance up until Immunovia's annual general meeting 2024 (with each respective granting falling on a ""Grant Date"").Each Option entitles the holder to purchase one share in Immunovia for a pre-determined exercise price. The exercise price will correspond to 100 percent of the volume weighted average price of the Immunovia share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five (5) trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Options are subject to a four-year cliff vesting  with 25 percent vesting after first year of commencement of employment/consultancy (or grant  as applicable) and remaining 75 percent vesting in equal monthly instalments thereafter. For allocations to existing employees  vesting could thus take place already upon grant if the employees have been employed for more than one year already upon grant.The Options may be exercised from vesting up until the ten-year anniversary of the Grant Date. The Board of Directors considers that a time period from the Grant Date until exercise being shorter than three years is appropriate since the proposed program is key for the Company's ability to attract  retain and motivate competent key persons and top talents especially in the United States and that the proposed program is based on an analysis of  and in line with  the current market practice for long-term incentive programs in the United States.and that the proposed program is based on an analysis of  and in line with  the current market practice for long-term incentive programs in the United States. The number of Options shall be subject to Swedish customary re-calculation rules  for example in the event that changes occur in Immunovia' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.The Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The Options may be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Immunovia group.In the event of a public tender offer  merger  acquisition or other similar transaction which results in a shareholder (alone or together with closely-related parties) reaching a shareholding in Immunovia of in total at least 30 percent of the votes  the Options will vest immediately and in their entirety in case the employment or assignment is terminated within 12 months following completion of such a transaction  provided that the termination is carried out by Immunovia without cause.AllocationThe right to receive Options shall accrue to employees and consultants of Immunovia AB and Immunovia  Inc. The Board of Directors may grant Options upon commencement of employment and from time to time during employment based on performance up until Immunovia's annual general meeting 2024. The maximum number of Options that may be allocated to the participants under the ESOP 2023 program is 1 934 463 and the maximum allocation per individual shall be 967 232 Options.Preparation  administration and the right to amend the terms of the OptionsThe Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of ESOP 2023  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions  including resolving on cash or other settlement if deemed favorable for Immunovia based on foreign tax regulations. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in Immunovia or its environment would result in a situation where the existing terms and conditions of ESOP 2023 no longer serve their purpose.Preparation of the proposalESOP 2023 has been initiated and prepared by the Board of Directors of Immunovia together with external counsel including US legal counsel. It has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice in the United States in order to attract  retain and motivate employees and consultants in the United States.DilutionSubject to certain recalculation conditions  the maximum number of shares that may be issued to participants under ESOP 2023 is 1 934 463 shares and  in addition  a maximum of 662 771 shares may be issued in order to cover any social security costs due to ESOP 2023  i.e. a maximum of 2 597 234 shares  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 5.4 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to warrants under the Company's outstanding incentive programs as well as the proposed long-term incentive program for the Company's board of directors  the maximum dilution amounts to approximately 6.7 percent on a fully diluted basis.The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information about Immunovia' existing incentive programs can be found in the Company's annual report 2022 in note 10.Scope and costs of the programESOP 2023 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Options shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Options of SEK 0.87 and that all Options are allocated up-front under the assumptions set out under ""Dilution"" above  the cost for Immunovia according to IFRS 2 is estimated to be approximately KSEK 619 before tax (non-cash flow). The social security costs over the vesting period are estimated to be approxi mately a total of KSEK 198  based on the above assumptions  that all Options are fully vested  based on a ten-year period from grant until the expiry date of the Options and social security costs of 31.4 percent. It is envisaged that the social security costs associated with ESOP 2023 will be covered by the cash received from the participants at exercise of Options. If necessary  social security costs will be covered by hedging measures through the issue of warrants (see item 8b below) which would be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the Options. In either case  the social security costs associated with ESOP 2023 will be fully covered and will hence not affect the Company's cash flow.The total cost of ESOP 2023  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 817 000 under the above assumptions. However  the actual costs are likely to be lower  since not all participants are Swedish residents and social security costs will therefore not apply to all participants.The costs associated with ESOP 2023 are expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicators.Delivery of shares under ESOP 2023In order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2023 and if necessary for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves to issue and use warrants in accordance with item 8b below.8b - Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2023  and for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves to issue not more than 2 597 234 warrants  whereby the Company's share capital could be increased by not more than SEK 129 861.7.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only be granted the wholly owned subsidiary Immunovia Incentive AB (the ""Subsidiary""). The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of ESOP 2023. The Subsidiary shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants or a financial intermediary in connection with exercise.The warrants shall be issued free of charge and shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than 31 December 2023. The Board of Directors may extend the subscription period. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value.The full terms and conditions for the warrants are presented in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders in accordance with the below.8c - Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 8b above not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves that ESOP 2023 instead shall be hedged through an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Immunovia to the participants.Majority rulesThe implementation of the Board of Directors' proposals under item 8b above requires approval of at least nine tenths (9/10) of the shares represented and votes cast at the extraordinary general meeting.§ 9 Resolution on adoption of an equity incentive program for the Company's board of directorsThe Nomination Committee of Immunovia AB (publ) proposes the introduction of an incentive program for the Company's board of directors in accordance with the following.The Nomination Committee proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves to implement an incentive program for board of directors in Immunovia (""Board ESOP 2023"") in accordance with items 9a - 9c below.The resolutions under items 9a - 9b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 9b below not be met  the Nomination Committee proposes that Immunovia shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 9c below and resolutions under items 9a and 9c shall then be conditional upon each other.Board ESOP 2023 is a program under which the participants will be granted stock options (so called non-qualified in the United States) to purchase shares in Immunovia (""Options""). The Nomination Committee proposes that a maximum of 483 616 Options may be allocated to the participants.9a - Adoption of a long-term incentive program for the Company's board of directorsThe rationale for the proposalBoard ESOP 2023 is intended for board of directors in Immunovia AB. The Nomination Committee of Immunovia believes that an equity-based incentive program in the form of stock options is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate competent board members in Immunovia and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. The proposed program is designed to match US market practices  reflecting the importance of attracting US-based board members.Conditions for OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Options.The Options shall be granted at no cost to the participants.The Options shall be allocated as soon as practicable following the approval by the extraordinary general meeting up until Immunovia's annual general meeting 2024 (with each respective granting falling on a ""Grant Date"").Each Option entitles the holder to purchase one share in Immunovia for a pre-determined exercise price. The exercise price will correspond to 100 percent of the volume weighted average price of the Immunovia share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five (5) trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Options shall vest from allocation up to Immunovia's annual general meeting 2024 provided that the holder is still a board member of Immunovia on said date.Participants shall enter into option agreements with Immunovia.The Options may be exercised from vesting up until the ten-year anniversary of the Grant Date. Thus  the earliest date of exercise may be shorter than three years from the Grant Date. The Nomination Committee considers  based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice in the United States   that such terms are necessary in order to attract the right expertise given the Company's business plan.  that such terms are necessary in order to attract the right expertise given the Company's business plan. The number of Options shall be subject to Swedish customary re-calculation rules  for example in the event that changes occur in Immunovia' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.The Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The Options may be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Immunovia group.In the event of a public tender offer  merger  acquisition or other similar transaction which results in a shareholder (alone or together with closely-related parties) reaching a shareholding in Immunovia of in total at least 30 percent of the votes  the Options will vest immediately and in their entirety in case the assignment as board member is terminated prior to the annual general meeting 2024  provided that the board member is willing to continue the assignment during this period.The Options shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board ESOP 2023.AllocationThe right to receive Options shall accrue to board members of Immunovia AB. The Options shall be granted as soon as practicable to the board members following approval by the extraordinary general meeting up until Immunovia's annual general meeting 2024. The maximum number of Options that may be allocated to the participants under the Board ESOP 2023 program is 483 616 and shall be allocated in accordance with the following:138 176 Options shall be allocated to the Chair of the board of directors; and69 088 Options shall be allocated to each of the board members.The number of Options to each of the board members is based on the condition that the board of the Company consists of six board members (including the board members proposed to the extraordinary general meeting). The number of Options under the Board ESOP 2023 will thus be reduced accordingly if the number of board members is less than six.Preparation  administration and the right to amend the terms of the OptionsThe Nomination Committee is responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of Board ESOP 2023  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Nomination Committee shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions  including resolving on cash or other settlement if deemed favorable for Immunovia based on foreign tax regulations. The Nomination Committee may also make other adjustments if significant changes in Immunovia or its environment would result in a situation where the existing terms and conditions of Board ESOP 2023 no longer serve their purpose.Preparation of the proposalBoard ESOP 2023 has been initiated and prepared by the Nomination Committee of Immunovia together with external counsel including US legal counsel. It has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice in the United States in order to attract  retain and motivate board members.DilutionSubject to certain recalculation conditions  the maximum number of shares that may be issued to participants under Board ESOP 2023 is 483 616 shares and  in addition  a maximum of 165 693 shares may be issued in order to cover any social security costs due to Board ESOP 2023  i.e. a maximum of 649 309 shares  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.4 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to warrants under the Company's outstanding incentive programs as well as the proposed long-term incentive program for the Company's employees and consultants  the maximum dilution amounts to approximately 6.7 percent on a fully diluted basis.The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information about Immunovia' existing incentive programs can be found in the Company's annual report 2022 in note 10.Scope and costs of the programBoard ESOP 2023 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Options shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Options of SEK 0.87 and that all Options are allocated up-front under the assumptions set out under ""Dilution"" above  the cost for Immunovia according to IFRS 2 is estimated to be approximately KSEK 155 before tax (non-cash flow). The social security costs over the vesting period are estimated to be approximately a total of KSEK 50  based on the above assumptions  that all Options are fully vested  a vesting period for all Options up until Immunovia's annual general meeting 2024 and social security costs of 31.4 percent. It is envisaged that the social security costs associated with Board ESOP 2023 will be covered by the cash received from the participants at exercise of Options. If necessary  social security costs will be covered by hedging measures through the issue of warrants (see item 9b below) which would be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the Options. In either case  the social security costs associated with Board ESOP 2023 will be fully covered and will hence not affect the Company's cash flow.The total cost of Board ESOP 2023  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 204 000 under the above assumptions. However  the actual costs are likely to be lower  since not all participants are Swedish residents and social security costs will therefore not apply to all participants.The costs associated with Board ESOP 2023 are expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicators.Delivery of shares under Board ESOP 2023In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board ESOP 2023 and if necessary for hedging of social security costs  the Nomination Committee proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves to issue and use warrants in accordance with item 9b below.9b - Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board ESOP 2023  and for hedging of social security costs  the Nomination Committee proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves to issue not more than 649 309 warrants  whereby the Company's share capital could be increased by not more than SEK 32 465.45.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only be granted the wholly owned subsidiary Immunovia Incentive AB (the ""Subsidiary""). The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of Board ESOP 2023. The Subsidiary shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants or a financial intermediary in connection with exercise.The warrants shall be issued free of charge and shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than 31 December 2023. The Board of Directors may extend the subscription period. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value.The full terms and conditions for the warrants are presented in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders in accordance with the below.9c - Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 9b above not be met  the Nomination Committee proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves that Board ESOP 2023 instead shall be hedged through an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Immunovia to the participants.Majority rulesThe implementation of the Nomination Committee's proposals under item 9b above requires approval of at least nine tenths (9/10) of the shares represented and votes cast at the extraordinary general meeting.Number of shares and votesAs per the date of this notice  there are a total of 45 287 498 shares in the Company  each share representing one vote. The Company does not hold any of its own shares.DocumentsAll documentation for the general meeting  including a proxy form  will be available at the Company and posted on the Company's website https://immunovia.com/sv/bolagsstamma/ no later than three weeks prior to the extraordinary general meeting.

Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war. We follow the crisis in the Middle East and monitor possible impact to our business.Suominen’s other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: risks related to manufacturing  competition  raw material prices and availability and customer specific volumes and credits  changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions and investments  and financial risks.A more detailed description of risks is available in Suominen’s Annual Report 2022 at suominen.fi/investors.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods  such as wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen  the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand  even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.We see some positive signs in nonwovens market  but the overall global economic uncertainty and fierce competition makes the longer-term visibility challenging. The raw material prices continued to decline in Q3/2023 from the previous quarter (Q2/2023) and in the short term we are not expecting major changes in the raw material prices  but longer-term visibility is unclear. It remains to be seen how the current economic climate impacts the end consumer demand and consumer preferences regarding wipes. Historically  the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation.OUTLOOK FOR 2023Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2023 will increase from 2022. In 2022  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.3 million.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND REMUNERATION REPORTSuominen has prepared a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for 2022  which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies.

Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Some of the other key ratios Suominen publishes are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparisons between the reporting periods.The link between the components of the key ratios per share and the consolidated financial statements is presented in the consolidated financial statements of 2022. The link between the components of the alternative performance measures and the consolidated financial statements is presented in Suominen’s Annual Report for 2022.Calculation of key ratios per shareEarnings per shareBasic earnings per share (EPS)=Profit for the period Share-issue adjusted average number of shares excluding treasury shares Diluted earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury sharesEUR thousand 30.9.2023 30.9.2022 31.12.2022 Profit for the period -11 359 -5 054 -13 863 Average share-issue adjusted number of shares 57 643 772 57 425 760 57 439 615 Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 715 794 57 510 358 57 533 196 Earnings per share EUR Basic -0.20 -0.09 -0.24 Diluted -0.20 -0.09 -0.24Cash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.9.2023 30.9.2022 31.12.2022 Cash flow from operations  EUR thousand 17 647 -1 553 14 027 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 692 459 57 480 727 57 480 727 Cash flow from operations per share  EUR 0.31 -0.03 0.24Equity per shareEquity per shareTotal equity = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.9.2023 30.9.2022 31.12.2022 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent  EUR thousand 130 283 165 188 145 916 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 692 459 57 480 727 57 480 727 Equity per share  EUR 2.26 2.87 2.54Market capitalizationMarket capitalization = Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares x share price at the end of period30.9.2023 30.9.2022 31.12.2022 Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares 57 692 459 57 480 727 57 480 727 Share price at end of the period  EUR 2.85 2.64 3.00 Market capitalization  EUR million 164.4 151.7 172.4Share turnoverShare turnover = The proportion of number of shares traded during the period to weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares30.9.2023 30.9.2022 31.12.2022 Number of shares traded during the period 2 312 906 9 800 783 10 902 032 Average number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 643 772 57 425 760 57 439 615 Share turnover  % 4.0 17.1 19.0Calculation of key ratios and alternative performance measuresOperating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityIn order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs.

The European Council calls on the High Representative and the Commission to accelerate work with a view to submitting proposals "" they wrote.Of around $300 billion of Russian foreign reserves frozen by countries participating in sanctions at the onset of Moscow's war on Ukraine  the majority — more than €200 billion — sit in the EU. As Russian securities reach maturity and are reinvested by financial intermediaries  they generate a profit.The EU has floated the idea of taxing those profits for Ukraine’s benefit — but the European Central Bank and some EU capitals  including Paris and Berlin  have expressed doubts. They are afraid the move would roil financial markets and weaken the euro’s standing as a reserve currency.At a summit in Brussels on Friday  Commission President Ursula von der Leyen asked leaders for a mandate to make legal proposals  pointing to a supporting statement from G7 finance ministers issued earlier this month  according to people familiar with the leaders’ discussions.In the EU  the Baltic countries  Denmark  Sweden  Finland and Poland all spoke in favor of the idea. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo demanded that all legal  macroeconomic and monetary risks involved be taken into account  as did Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel  cautioning prudence.Belgian clearinghouse Euroclear sits on €180 billion of Russian state assets  according to the Belgian government  and generated €3 billion in profits in the first nine months of the year  it said in quarterly results published Thursday. Luxembourg is home to Clearstream  another clearinghouse currently holding frozen Russian securities.The decision comes on the last day of the European Council summit of EU leaders in Brussels. However  the idea of tapping those Russian assets for the benefit of rebuilding Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin's all-out invasion has been circulating since they were frozen under Western sanctions more than a year ago.In June  von der Leyen pledged to create a proposal on how to leverage Russian state assets ""before the summer break "" but none was forthcoming  due to concerns raised by the ECB and some capitals.The Commission then sought to marshal a G7 statement on leveraging Russian assets for Ukraine  in order to ensure the EU would not bear the legal and financial risks of taking such an unprecedented move alone. Despite EU attempts to broker one at recent gatherings of G7 justice and finance ministers  that also didn’t happen.EU leaders made the breakthrough as the Israel-Hamas war threatened to overshadow Russia's war in Ukraine.

Sanofi today provided a comprehensive update regarding its Play to Win strategy. This strategy continues to focus on the critical goals of executing transformative medicine and vaccines launches  driving agile and efficient resource deployment and enhancing R&D productivity. To that end  Sanofi announced plans to increase its R&D investments to fully realize its pipeline potential  drive long-term growth and enhance shareholder value. The Company also announced its intention to separate its Consumer Healthcare Business enabling greater management focus and resource allocation to the needs of the Biopharma business  where value-creating opportunities and longer-term operational levers have been identified to support the accelerated R&D investments. Sanofi reiterates its financial guidance for 2023 and provides a preliminary outlook for 2024 and 2025 that reflects this new chapter of its strategy.Paul HudsonChief Executive Officer  Sanofi“We have made tremendous progress on our Play to Win strategy by bringing new and transformative products to market and building an industry-leading immunology pipeline  evidenced by our recent  strong flow of positive R&D data readouts. In this new chapter of our strategy  we are deepening our investment in R&D  taking steps toward becoming a pure play biopharma company  and further optimizing our cost structure. This will help us accelerate innovation and strengthen our growth drivers  while ensuring long-term profitability and enhancing shareholder value. We are excited to build on the success of our strategy and confident in the long-term value our investments will generate for all Sanofi stakeholders.”Play to Win Achievements Since 2019Sanofi’s multi-year Play to Win strategy  which focused on growth  innovation  and efficiency  has positioned Sanofi for long-term success and achieved significant progress since 2019  including:Achieving 13 consecutive quarters of growthSuccessfully scaling Dupixent ® to be among the world’s leading medicines with Q3 2023 annualized sales nearing €11 billionto be among the world’s leading medicines with Q3 2023 annualized sales nearing €11 billion Building a high-growth Vaccines business  which delivered mid- to high-single digit sales growth since 2018  with at least five new programs expected to enter Phase 3 by 2025Successfully launching six new molecular entities in the last two years (Xenpozyme ®   Nexviazyme ®   Enjaymo ®   ALTUVIIIO ®   TZIELD ® and Beyfortus ® )  Nexviazyme   Enjaymo   ALTUVIIIO   TZIELD and Beyfortus ) Developing an industry-leading immunology and strong neuro-inflammation pipeline  with currently 7 assets in mid- to late-stage development  each with a peak sales potential of at least €2 to €5 billion (itepekimab  tolebrutinib  amlitelimab  frexalimab  rilzabrutinib  SAR443765 (IL13/TSLP)  SAR441566 (oral TNFi))Executing a €2.7 billion cost savings plan to reinvest in the Company’s growth driversInvesting in over 25 value-creating business development and M&A deals to further strengthen Sanofi’s pipelineStreamlining Consumer Healthcare product portfolio to focus on priority brandsSignificantly improving BOI4 and free cash flowStrengthening the Pipeline through Increased R&D InvestmentSanofi’s strategic mission is to transform the practice of medicine through breakthrough science that improves people’s lives. To that end  the Company is accelerating its R&D investments to deliver high-value innovation.These further investments will strengthen and sustain the Company’s long-term trajectory of profitable growth by fueling existing or new clinical development.As previously announced  Sanofi will host an R&D Day for investors in New York City on December 7  2023  where the Company will provide further insights into its pipeline and new growth avenues. The meeting will include presentations from Sanofi’s new Head of R&D  Houman Ashrafian  as well as key members from the research and development teams.Houman AshrafianHead of Research and Development  Sanofi“This is an exciting and important moment for Sanofi’s R&D journey  as we double down on our investments from a position of strength in order to unlock our pipeline’s full potential. Our investments will follow Sanofi’s strategy of transforming medicine through breakthrough science  enabling greater access to medicines and vaccines that benefit the patients and communities we serve. We are committed to investing in innovation with discipline  and we will reallocate resources  further prioritizing first and or best in class medicines to help fund our future growth. We look forward to discussing our plan further with investors at our upcoming R&D Day  where we will dig deeper into the compelling science underpinning this opportunity.”Strategic Cost InitiativesSanofi is announcing new steps to further its ongoing effort to improve its cost structure  launching efficiency initiatives across the Biopharma business that will free operational resources to support the accelerated R&D investments and unlock value-creation opportunities. This will include prioritizing its investments in R&D and modernizing its approach to commercial delivery. Sanofi is targeting savings of a total of up to €2 billion from 2024 to the end of 2025  of which most will be reallocated to fund innovation and growth drivers.Intention to Separate the Consumer Healthcare BusinessFollowing the announcement in December 2019 of the creation of a standalone Global Business Unit  Sanofi’s Consumer Healthcare (“CHC”) has grown into a leading consumer healthcare platform with a presence in 150 countries and over 11 000 employees  dedicated resources in R&D  manufacturing  information technology as well as its distinct sustainability roadmap.Sanofi announces its intention to separate the CHC Business as it increases its focus on innovative medicines and vaccines. The intended separation will seek to create two entities  each better equipped to pursue its own business strategy  resourcing and capital allocation and enabling each to focus on long-term growth in its respective markets. Sanofi believes that the separation will unlock further opportunities for CHC to leverage its portfolio of leading brands and continue to drive growth and shareholder value.Julie van OngevalleExecutive Vice President  Consumer Healthcare Sanofi“We have achieved significant milestones at Sanofi Consumer Healthcare since we embarked on our journey to become a standalone Global Business Unit within Sanofi. We have adapted our business to the evolving needs of the Consumer Healthcare sector  offered a streamlined yet diverse brand portfolio of science-based products and solutions and achieved the B Corp accreditation as the first large consumer healthcare business in North America. The CHC teams and I look forward to becoming a standalone global leader in the attractive and growing consumer health market  with increased agility and flexibility to grow our portfolio of brands and further address our customers’ needs across categories.”Sanofi is reviewing potential separation scenarios  but believes that the most likely path would be through a capital markets transaction  by creating a listed entity headquartered in France. The timing is driven by the desire to maximize value creation and reward Sanofi shareholders. Subject to market conditions  the separation could be achieved at the earliest in Q4 2024  following consultation with social partners. Further details will be provided at a later date.2023 Guidance and Preliminary 2024 and 2025 Outlook1Sanofi reiterates its 2023 guidance of mid-single digit2 Business EPS3 growth at constant exchange rates.As a result of changes to global tax regulations  Sanofi’s effective tax rate is expected to increase from 19% in 2023 to 21% in 2024. Due to the increased R&D investment  Sanofi expects 2024 Business EPS to remain roughly stable to 2023 levels excluding the impact of the expected tax rate change  and therefore decline low-single digits including the higher expected tax rate.In 2025  Sanofi expects a strong rebound in business EPS growth  driven by continued sales growth supported by its leading franchises  the full benefit from planned efficiency initiatives  and its expectation of relatively stable R&D expenses year on year.Given Sanofi’s decision to support the full realization of its pipeline’s long-term potential  its continued investment around the new launches  as well as pricing headwinds in General Medicines  the Company will no longer target a 32% BOI4 margin for 2025 while maintaining a focus on long-term profitability.The company reiterates its goal to generate over €22 billion in sales in immunology  and over €10 billion in sales in vaccines by 20301.Capital Allocation ReaffirmedThe Company’s capital allocation policy remains unchanged. Sanofi expects to maintain a gradually growing dividend  consistent with its historical dividend policy.Q3 2023 Earnings Call & Upcoming R&D Day InformationThird quarter 2023 results and the announcements above will be discussed by management during a conference call with the financial community today.

Sanofi today provided a comprehensive update regarding its Play to Win strategy. This strategy continues to focus on the critical goals of executing transformative medicine and vaccines launches  driving agile and efficient resource deployment and enhancing R&D productivity. To that end  Sanofi announced plans to increase its R&D investments to fully realize its pipeline potential  drive long-term growth and enhance shareholder value. The Company also announced its intention to separate its Consumer Healthcare Business enabling greater management focus and resource allocation to the needs of the Biopharma business  where value-creating opportunities and longer-term operational levers have been identified to support the accelerated R&D investments. Sanofi reiterates its financial guidance for 2023 and provides a preliminary outlook for 2024 and 2025 that reflects this new chapter of its strategy.Paul HudsonChief Executive Officer  Sanofi“We have made tremendous progress on our Play to Win strategy by bringing new and transformative products to market and building an industry-leading immunology pipeline  evidenced by our recent  strong flow of positive R&D data readouts. In this new chapter of our strategy  we are deepening our investment in R&D  taking steps toward becoming a pure play biopharma company  and further optimizing our cost structure. This will help us accelerate innovation and strengthen our growth drivers  while ensuring long-term profitability and enhancing shareholder value. We are excited to build on the success of our strategy and confident in the long-term value our investments will generate for all Sanofi stakeholders.”Play to Win Achievements Since 2019Sanofi’s multi-year Play to Win strategy  which focused on growth  innovation  and efficiency  has positioned Sanofi for long-term success and achieved significant progress since 2019  including:Achieving 13 consecutive quarters of growthSuccessfully scaling Dupixent ® to be among the world’s leading medicines with Q3 2023 annualized sales nearing €11 billionto be among the world’s leading medicines with Q3 2023 annualized sales nearing €11 billion Building a high-growth Vaccines business  which delivered mid- to high-single digit sales growth since 2018  with at least five new programs expected to enter Phase 3 by 2025Successfully launching six new molecular entities in the last two years (Xenpozyme ®   Nexviazyme ®   Enjaymo ®   ALTUVIIIO ®   TZIELD ® and Beyfortus ® )  Nexviazyme   Enjaymo   ALTUVIIIO   TZIELD and Beyfortus ) Developing an industry-leading immunology and strong neuro-inflammation pipeline  with currently 7 assets in mid- to late-stage development  each with a peak sales potential of at least €2 to €5 billion (itepekimab  tolebrutinib  amlitelimab  frexalimab  rilzabrutinib  SAR443765 (IL13/TSLP)  SAR441566 (oral TNFi))Executing a €2.7 billion cost savings plan to reinvest in the Company’s growth driversInvesting in over 25 value-creating business development and M&A deals to further strengthen Sanofi’s pipelineStreamlining Consumer Healthcare product portfolio to focus on priority brandsSignificantly improving BOI4 and free cash flowStrengthening the Pipeline through Increased R&D InvestmentSanofi’s strategic mission is to transform the practice of medicine through breakthrough science that improves people’s lives. To that end  the Company is accelerating its R&D investments to deliver high-value innovation.These further investments will strengthen and sustain the Company’s long-term trajectory of profitable growth by fueling existing or new clinical development.As previously announced  Sanofi will host an R&D Day for investors in New York City on December 7  2023  where the Company will provide further insights into its pipeline and new growth avenues. The meeting will include presentations from Sanofi’s new Head of R&D  Houman Ashrafian  as well as key members from the research and development teams.Houman AshrafianHead of Research and Development  Sanofi“This is an exciting and important moment for Sanofi’s R&D journey  as we double down on our investments from a position of strength in order to unlock our pipeline’s full potential. Our investments will follow Sanofi’s strategy of transforming medicine through breakthrough science  enabling greater access to medicines and vaccines that benefit the patients and communities we serve. We are committed to investing in innovation with discipline  and we will reallocate resources  further prioritizing first and or best in class medicines to help fund our future growth. We look forward to discussing our plan further with investors at our upcoming R&D Day  where we will dig deeper into the compelling science underpinning this opportunity.”Strategic Cost InitiativesSanofi is announcing new steps to further its ongoing effort to improve its cost structure  launching efficiency initiatives across the Biopharma business that will free operational resources to support the accelerated R&D investments and unlock value-creation opportunities. This will include prioritizing its investments in R&D and modernizing its approach to commercial delivery. Sanofi is targeting savings of a total of up to €2 billion from 2024 to the end of 2025  of which most will be reallocated to fund innovation and growth drivers.Intention to Separate the Consumer Healthcare BusinessFollowing the announcement in December 2019 of the creation of a standalone Global Business Unit  Sanofi’s Consumer Healthcare (“CHC”) has grown into a leading consumer healthcare platform with a presence in 150 countries and over 11 000 employees  dedicated resources in R&D  manufacturing  information technology as well as its distinct sustainability roadmap.Sanofi announces its intention to separate the CHC Business as it increases its focus on innovative medicines and vaccines. The intended separation will seek to create two entities  each better equipped to pursue its own business strategy  resourcing and capital allocation and enabling each to focus on long-term growth in its respective markets. Sanofi believes that the separation will unlock further opportunities for CHC to leverage its portfolio of leading brands and continue to drive growth and shareholder value.Julie van OngevalleExecutive Vice President  Consumer Healthcare Sanofi“We have achieved significant milestones at Sanofi Consumer Healthcare since we embarked on our journey to become a standalone Global Business Unit within Sanofi. We have adapted our business to the evolving needs of the Consumer Healthcare sector  offered a streamlined yet diverse brand portfolio of science-based products and solutions and achieved the B Corp accreditation as the first large consumer healthcare business in North America. The CHC teams and I look forward to becoming a standalone global leader in the attractive and growing consumer health market  with increased agility and flexibility to grow our portfolio of brands and further address our customers’ needs across categories.”Sanofi is reviewing potential separation scenarios  but believes that the most likely path would be through a capital markets transaction  by creating a listed entity headquartered in France. The timing is driven by the desire to maximize value creation and reward Sanofi shareholders. Subject to market conditions  the separation could be achieved at the earliest in Q4 2024  following consultation with social partners. Further details will be provided at a later date.2023 Guidance and Preliminary 2024 and 2025 Outlook1Sanofi reiterates its 2023 guidance of mid-single digit2 Business EPS3 growth at constant exchange rates.As a result of changes to global tax regulations  Sanofi’s effective tax rate is expected to increase from 19% in 2023 to 21% in 2024. Due to the increased R&D investment  Sanofi expects 2024 Business EPS to remain roughly stable to 2023 levels excluding the impact of the expected tax rate change  and therefore decline low-single digits including the higher expected tax rate.In 2025  Sanofi expects a strong rebound in business EPS growth  driven by continued sales growth supported by its leading franchises  the full benefit from planned efficiency initiatives  and its expectation of relatively stable R&D expenses year on year.Given Sanofi’s decision to support the full realization of its pipeline’s long-term potential  its continued investment around the new launches  as well as pricing headwinds in General Medicines  the Company will no longer target a 32% BOI4 margin for 2025 while maintaining a focus on long-term profitability.The company reiterates its goal to generate over €22 billion in sales in immunology  and over €10 billion in sales in vaccines by 20301.Capital Allocation ReaffirmedThe Company’s capital allocation policy remains unchanged. Sanofi expects to maintain a gradually growing dividend  consistent with its historical dividend policy.Q3 2023 Earnings Call & Upcoming R&D Day InformationThird quarter 2023 results and the announcements above will be discussed by management during a conference call with the financial community today.

HealthBeacon has 75 employees  of which 50 are based in Ireland. It is expected that about 20 staff members will be made redundant.The petition for examinership came in “most unusual” circumstances  as “literally there is no more gas in the tank” for the company to financially support itself even during the 100-day period of court protection  said senior counsel Kelley Smith  on behalf of HealthBeacon’s directors.The facility from Hamilton Beach Brands was predicated on an interim examiner being appointed and will be repaid before all other secured and unsecured debts in the event the examinership fails and the firm needs to be liquidated  Ms Smith told the court  adding that the debts are largely unsecured.Shane McCarthy of KPMG was named interim examiner. The appointment as examiner will be confirmed on November 7.HealthBeacon has developed a digital health platform aimed at improving patient support and ensuring they adhere to home injection regimes.In a statement  HealthBeacon said it believes it can survive.“The board believes that the company can stabilise  recover and emerge from this process as a going concern with the resultant preservation of jobs and will work closely with the examiner throughout the process ” it said.In 2021  Hamilton Beach Brands and HealthBeacon entered into a strategic partnership to provide a smart injection care management system in the US and Canada.The court heard HealthBeacon has a net asset position of €10m  with liabilities of €6.3m primarily due to trade creditors and general unsecured creditors. Taoglas  a Co Wexford firm  is the largest creditor  the court heard.Nicholas O’Dwyer  of Grant Thornton  determined that HealthBeacon has a “reasonable prospect of survival” as a going concern if a successful rescue plan is put together. HealthBeacon has projected growth of 387pc from 2024 to 2026  the court heard.In an interview with the Irish Independent earlier this year  HealthBeacon founder and former CEO Jim Joyce said the deal struck with the US company in 2021 would free up working capital at the Irish group. Mr Joyce stepped down as CEO in September.HealthBeacon’s shares remain suspended on the stock exchange.It raised €25m when it floated in Dublin in 2021  valuing at close to €100m.

Against this backdrop  we have accelerated our core market investment plans which are key to operational excellence  margin improvement and driving future growth.”[1] Reported P&L figures  represent continuing operations  i.e. Core Markets  only. As from 2022  Emerging Markets are reported as assets held for sale and discontinued operations  following the strategic decision to divest these businesses.Unless otherwise indicated  all comments in this document on changes are on a year-on-year basis and for revenue specifically on a like-for-like (LFL) basis (at constant currencies and scope and excluding hyperinflation effects).

The LFL comparison is corrected for the scope reduction.[2] Balance sheet data are compared to start of the period  i.e. September 2023 versus December 2022.Q3 2023 business review of Core Markets (continuing operations)RevenueRevenue was €457 million  up 10% like for like versus the third quarter of 2022  driven by sustained pricing and volume growth. Adult care revenue was up 14% like for like  while in baby care and in feminine care 9% like-for-like growth was recorded. Forex had a significantly adverse effect  reducing total revenue growth to 6% year on year.Volume and mix had a 3% growth impact. In Europe market demand remained subdued overall  albeit better than in the first half of the year  while retail brand volumes were up year on year and thus continued to gain share. Volume growth was most pronounced in adult care  where retail brands had been underperforming the market in the year so far. This largely reflected Ontex’s own sales volumes in Europe with strong growth of adult care products in Southern Europe and of baby pants in Western and Central Europe. Sales volumes in feminine care remained lower. In North America volumes were back up by double digits thanks to customer gains and following the customer destocking affecting the first half of the year.Prices were up 8% on average compared to the third quarter of 2022  reflecting increases across categories. The price increases were largely implemented in 2022  and prices in the third quarter were sustained at the levels of the first half of the year.Forex fluctuations had an adverse impact of 5%. The strong year-on-year depreciation of the Russian ruble  and to a lesser extent the US dollar and the Australian dollar  more than offset the appreciation of the Polish zloty.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA was €44 million  up €20 million or 81% year on year  and slightly up versus the second quarter of 2023  thanks to relentless focus on delivering 5% operational efficiencies. Pricing helped to offset the year-on-year cost inflation and to manage the highly negative forex impact. The adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 9.5%  up 4.0pp year on year.Volume and mix growth had a slight €1 million positive impact on adjusted EBITDA.Cost transformation measures resulted in €20 million savings  leading to a reduction of the operational cost base by more than 5%. Procurement and supply chain initiatives  as well as operational efficiency were the main drivers behind the improvement.Cost inflation continued to weigh on the year-on-year comparison  albeit less than in the previous quarters. Raw material costs were up by €5 million. While all raw material indices are down compared to the third quarter of 2022  especially those for oil-based materials  the impact on the P&L comes with a lag. Other operating costs were up by €7 million year on year  and also higher quarter on quarter  due to wage inflation and rising energy costs. These also included temporary higher energy costs in Ontex’s retained plant in Tijuana  Mexico  following its carve-in triggered by the divestment of the main Mexican business in the second quarter. SG&A costs were up slightly with wage inflation as well  but remained at 9% of revenue.Pricing efforts contributed €33 million year on year. While this offset the adverse forex evolution and the additional input cost inflation versus the previous year  thanks to continued disciplined approach  it still does not cover the cumulative cost increase incurred since the start of the inflation wave in 2021 in all markets and categories. Thereby careful management of the pricing policy is required.Forex fluctuations had a €21 million net negative impact  reflecting the impact on the revenue  whereas the net impact on costs was largely neutral  with the appreciation of the Mexican peso offsetting the depreciation effect of the US dollar.Q3 2023 financial review of Total GroupP&LThe operating profit (of continuing operations) was €29 million  a significant increase versus €3 million in the third quarter of 2022  reflecting the strong increase in adjusted EBITDA. Depreciation was €16 million  slightly lower than in 2022 due to forex fluctuations. EBITDA adjustments were made for a €2 million income  consisting mostly of a reversal of impairment related to the re-activation of production equipment.Discontinued operations  consisting of the Emerging Markets division  generated a revenue of €111 million  up 8% like for like compared with last year  increasing across geographies. Strong pricing more than offset slightly lower volumes. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €15 million  with the largest contribution from the Brazilian business activities. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.3%  was up 8.0pp year on year. EBITDA adjustments were made for €2 million mostly divestment-related costs. The operating profit thereby was €12 million.Cash and balance sheetNet financial debt for the total Group was €652 million at the end of September 2023  a €6 million decrease compared to €658 million at the start of the quarter. The increase in working capital needs came to a halt. Active measures allowed to improve the cash conversion cycle  more than offsetting the impact of growing sales. As in the second quarter  capex grew to more than 4% of revenue. The investment intensity has been raised to support the transformation of the operations in Europe as well as the expansion in the US. The financing cash-out was in line with the previous year and included the semi-annual coupon payment on the fixed rate bond.The leverage ratio decreased further to 3.6 times from 4.5 times at the end of June 2023 and less than half of the peak of 7.7 times in September 2022. The strong improvement is mostly driven by the increase in adjusted EBITDA over the last quarters.During the quarter  an agreement was reached to divest Ontex’s business activities in Algeria and Pakistan to two different third parties. The finalization of these divestments is foreseen before the end of the year. There were no significant changes reported on the net asset value of these entities. In the second quarter of this year the divestment of Ontex’s Mexican business activities was closed. This deal is still subject to post-closing adjustments  as well as a deferred receivable of €39 million.Additional informationAlternative Performance MeasuresAlternative performance measures (non-GAAP) are used in this press release since management believes that they are widely used by certain investors  securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measure of performance and liquidity.

The regulation adopted by Consob with resolution no. Issuers' Regulation 11971 of 14 May 1999  as subsequently amended and sup- plemented. OPC Regulation The regulation adopted by Consob with resolution no. 17221 of 12 March 2010  as subsequently amended and supplemented. TUF Legislative Decree no. 58 of 24 February 1998. 3PREMISE This Information Document has been prepared by Giglio pursuant to Article 5 and in accordance with the scheme set out in Annex 4 of the RPT Regulation  as well as pursuant to Article 12.2 of the RPT Procedure. This Information Document refers in particular to the subscription of the capital increase (the ""Transaction"" or ""Capital Increase"") by (i) the majority shareholder Meridiana Holding S.r.l. (""Meridiana"" or the ""Majority Shareholder"") and/or Mr. Alessandro Giglio  controlling shareholder of the Company and Meridiana and the company Luxury Cloud S.r.l. ( "" Luxury "")  headed by the director Anna Maria Lezzi (Meridiana and Luxury  jointly  the "" OPC Shareholders "") . Taking into account the qualification of Mr. Alessandro Giglio  Anna Maria Lezzi and the companies controlled by them (i.e. Meridiana and Luxury) as related parties of the Company  the latter  since the first expression of interest received from the OPC Shareholders  although not yet recognizing the prerequisites  has prudently adopted the safeguards referred to in the RPT Regulations and the OPC Procedure  involving the Committee and keeping it constantly informed of the relations between the Company and the OPC Shareholders. Since the OPC Shareholders are related parties of the Company  as described in paragraph 2.2 below  the subscription of the Capital Increase by the latter could constitute transactions between relevant related parties pursuant to the RPT Procedure and the Issuers' Regulation. In particular  the amount of any subscription to the Capital Increase by Meridiana could result in the qualification of the subscription as a Transaction of Greater Significance pursuant to art. 8.1 of the RPT Procedure  while any subscription by Luxury could constitute a Transaction of Minor Significance pursuant to art. 8.2 of the OPC Procedure. In any case  the two transactions are treated together. For this reason  prior to the approval of the proposed resolution on the Transaction by the Board of Directors  the Committee issued a reasoned opinion (attached to this Information Document under Annex 1) on Giglio's interest in the completion of the Transaction as well as on the convenience and substantial fairness of the related conditions (the ""Committee's Opinion""). The proposed resolution submitted to the extraordinary shareholders' meeting of Giglio regarding the Transaction was approved by the Company's Board of Directors on 22 October 2023  pursuant to Article 8.3 (entitled ""Transactions within the competence of the Shareholders' Meeting"") of the RPT Procedure (for further details on the procedure for approving the Transaction  please refer to paragraph 2.8 below). This Information Document has been prepared by Giglio pursuant to and for the purposes of art. 5 of the OPC Regulation as well as art. 12.2 of the OPC Proce- dure. 4WARNINGS 1.1 Risks related to potential conflicts of interest arising from transactions with related parties As already pointed out in the preamble  the Transaction involves (i) Meridiana  the majority shareholder of the Company  currently owning 55.66% of the share capital held 99% by Alessandro Giglio; (ii) Alessandro Giglio  Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company and (iii) Anna Maria Lezzi  member of the Board and Vice-Chairman of Giglio as well as sole director and majority shareholder of Luxury. The Transaction may also constitute (a transaction with related parties) ""of greater significance"" as described in paragraph 2.2 below. The Committee  called upon to express its opinion pursuant to Article 8.3 of the RPT Procedure  has been informed of the terms and conditions of the Transaction  has received a timely and adequate flow of information and has issued its favourable opinion  which is binding  on the Transaction  attached to this Information Document under Annex 1. In accordance with the rules and safeguards set out in the RPT Procedure: (i) the Committee  consisting exclusively of non-executive and independent directors  was involved in the negotiation and preliminary phase of the Transaction through the receipt of a complete  adequate  up-to-date and timely flow of information and documents relating to the Transaction; (ii) the Committee was able to request clarifications and make comments from the management in charge of conducting the negotiations; (iii) the Committee examined the documentation and the various aspects relating to the Transaction; (iv) at its meeting of 19 Oc- tober 2023  the Committee unanimously approved the Committee's Opinion  noting the interest in carrying out the Transaction itself as well as the convenience and substantial fairness of the related conditions; (v) the Board of Directors of Giglio  at its meeting of 22 October 2023  approved the proposed resolution submitted to the extraordinary shareholders' meeting of Giglio regarding the Trans- action  on the basis of the preliminary documentation received and the reasoned favourable and binding opinion of the Committee. Giglio believes that the Transaction does not present any particular risks associated with potential conflicts of interest other than those typically inherent in transactions between related parties. 52 TRANSACTION INFORMATION 2.1 Description of the characteristics  methods  terms and conditions of the Transaction 2.1.1 The Capital Increase On 17 November 2023  the extraordinary shareholders' meeting of Giglio (the ""Shareholders' Meeting"") is called to resolve (i) to increase the share capital for payment and in divisible form  with the exclusion of the pre-emption right pursuant to paragraphs 5 and 6 of art. 2441 of the Italian Civil Code  by the deadline of 31 December 2023 for an amount up to a total of Euro 5 000 000.00  including any share premium  through the issue of ordinary shares having the same characteristics as the Giglio ordinary shares in circulation and regular dividend rights  to be paid in cash  reserved for the Majority Shareholder and other qualified or institutional investors  as well as (ii) to confer on the Board of Directors a delegation pursuant to art. 2443 of the Italian Civil Code to increase the share capital  for payment and in divisible form with the exclusion of the pre-emption right pursuant to paragraphs 5 and 6 of art. 2441 of the Italian Civil Code  for the part of the Capital Increase not subscribed by the deadline of 31 December 2023  to be executed in one or more tranches  within five years from the date of the resolu- tion  through the issue of ordinary shares having the same characteristics as those in circulation and regular dividend rights  to be paid in cash  reserved for the Majority Shareholder and other qualified or institutional investors (the ""Proxy"").

The subscription by OPC Shareholders will take place at the price established through the aforementioned ABB 6procedure without any possibility for them to participate in any way in the negotiation of such price. For an amount of the Capital Increase equal to a maximum of 20% of the shares currently existing on the market (equal to 21 968 022 ordinary shares  20% of which is therefore equal to 4 393 604 ordinary shares)  the admission to listing of the relevant shares on the Euronext Milan segment will be requested immediately after execution. If the value of 20% of the shares currently existing on the market is exceeded by the sum of the sum between it and that subscribed by investors  admission to listing will not be requested immediately  and shares with a different ISIN will be issued  although it is not excluded that such admission may be requested subse- quently. 2.1.2 Meridiana and Luxury's binding expressions of interest On 11 May 2023  Meridiana presented the ""Binding Expression of Interest for Participation in a Capital Increase up to a maximum of Euro 700 000.00"" with which following the previous "" Binding Expression of Interest for Participation in a Capi- tal Increase up to a maximum of Euro 500 000.00"" - was willing to subscribe to a capital increase up to a maximum amount of Euro 700 000.00  taking into ac- count that Euro 472 000.00 is already present in the Company's coffers as a share- holder loan and can therefore be converted into a capital account. Meridiana has also committed to guarantee the Capital Increase in the minimum amount of Euro 3 million as already indicated in Giglio Group's Half-Year Financial Report as at 30 June 2023. On April 12  2023  Luxury submitted the ""Binding Expression of Interest for participation in a Capital Increase up to a maximum of Euro 700 000.00"" with which - subjecting the purchase to the accounting and management Due Diligence activity with a positive outcome necessary for the completion of the Transaction[Note to Giglio: to be confirmed whether it has been made or if the condition is exceeded] - was willing to subscribe to a capital increase up to a maximum of Euro 700 000.00. 2.2 An indication of the related parties with whom the Transaction is conducted  the nature of the correlation  and the nature and extent of such parties' in- terests in the Transaction The Transaction is a transaction between related parties  identified in accordance with the definitions set out in (i) the international accounting standards adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 referred to in Article 3 of the RPT Regulation and (i) in Articles 2 and 3 of the RPT Procedure. With specific reference to the nature of the correlation  it should be noted that 7the Transaction is carried out by the Company with (i) Meridiana  the majority shareholder of the Company  currently owning 55.66% of Giglio's shares - of which a total of 12 226 459 ordinary shares of Giglio with increased voting rights for a total of 24 452 918 voting rights  equal to 71.511% of the total voting rights - 99% of whose share capital (of Meridiana) is held by Mr. Meridiana). Alessandro Giglio; (ii) Alessandro Giglio  Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company and (iii) Anna Maria Lezzi  member of the Board and Vice-Chairman of Giglio as well as sole director and majority shareholder of Luxury. The Transaction  in particular  falls within the scope of application of the rules provided for by the RPT Procedure for transactions of greater significance  considering that a transaction with a related party of greater significance means  pursuant to art. 8.1 of the RPT Procedure and art. 3  paragraph 1  letter b) of the RPT Regulation  transactions in which at least one of the relevance indices indicated in Annex 3 of the RPT Regulation exceeds the threshold of 5%; the possible subscription by Meridiana of the Capital Increase  for a maximum amount of Euro 3 million  would in fact be considered a Transaction of Greater Significance  as the value of the transaction represented by the Majority Shareholder [Note for Giglio: insert value if it has been calculated]  would exceed the relevance ratio of the countervalue indicated in Annex 3 of the RPT Regulation (in particular with reference to market capitalization as at 30 June 2023). As for the possible subscription by Luxury of the Capital Increase  for a maximum amount of Euro 700 million  it would not be considered a Transaction of Greater Significance pursuant to art. 8.1 of the OPC Procedure and art. 3  paragraph 1  letter b) of the RPT Regulation  not resulting in the above-mentioned threshold of 5% being exceeded  in light of the value of the market capitalization as at 30 June 2023; however  it could still be a Transaction of Minor Significance pursuant to art. 8.2 of the RPT Procedure  again taking into account the market capitalization as at 30 June 2023. In any case  the Transaction  as a whole  is treated as a major OPC. 2.3 Indication of the economic reasons and convenience of the Operation for Giglio With regard to the economic reasons and the convenience of the Capital Increase for the Company  it should be noted that this decision is motivated by the need to strengthen the company's capital  connected to the existence of the condition of business continuity  as shown most recently by the Half-Year Financial Report as at 30 June 2023 (see in particular Par. 16 on ""business continu- ity"") and by the Report of the independent auditors containing the unqualified opinion on the condensed consolidated half-year financial statements as at 30 June 2023 (see in particular paragraph 4 of the ""disclosure notice"") taking into account (i) the need to quickly implement the Capital Increase  considering the Company's interest in strengthening the Group's shareholders' equity by the end of the 2023 financial year; (ii) the interest in directing the Capital Increase also 8to persons willing to support the Company in the medium to long term  taking into account the need to have both shareholders with the characteristics of institutional or professional investors and reference shareholders who guarantee a stable and lasting shareholding structure; (iii) the opportunity to consider the expressions of interest binding and the guarantee of the Majority Shareholder to subscribe to a capital increase  also through the use of receivables already transformed into shareholder loans on a capital account  as well as the expression of interest of the Luxury company headed by the executive director and vice-chairman Anna Maria Lezzi. With regard to Meridiana's expression of interest  the Board noted the importance for the Company of the presence and continuous support of the Majority Shareholder; in fact  it is convenient for the Company and for the Giglio Group for the subscription of the Capital Increase by the OPC Shareholders if the subscription of the Capital Increase takes place at the price established as part of the ABB procedure and in any case in compliance with the criterion of determination of the price approved by the Board of Directors. With the support of the entity that will act as arranger  identified in the company MIT SIM  the Board of Directors has also decided - in consideration of the status of a company listed on the Italian Stock Exchange's Mercato Telematico Italiano  the liquidity of the shares  and the base of institutional investors currently present to carry out the Capital Increase through the ABB procedure  considering that this procedure makes it possible to identify  according to market criteria  the sub- scription price for all the recipients of the Capital Increase. In this regard  during the committee meeting on October 19  2023  it was specified that MIT SIM will manage ABB's procedure in such a way as to ensure that Meridiana's and Luxury's offerings do not contribute to forming the issue price of the shares resulting from the Capital Increase. In light of the above considerations  it is considered convenient for the Company and the Giglio Group for the subscription of the Capital Increase by OPC Shareholders if the subscription of the Capital Increase takes place at the price established as part of the ABB procedure and in any case in compliance with the price determination criterion approved by the Board of Directors. 2.4 Methods for determining the fee and assessing its fairness 2.4.1. The activities carried out by the Council  also in the light of the comparison with similar transactions With regard to the issue price of the shares resulting from the Capital Increase  the sixth paragraph of Article 2441  fifth paragraph  of the Civil Code provides that  in such circumstances  the issue price of the shares must be determined on the basis of the value of the shareholders' equity  taking into account  for shares listed on regulated markets  also the price trend of the last six months.

I am particularly pleased that the Group’s leverage has now recovered to less than half of the peak of a year ago  and on track to meet our ambitions  on the back of the increase in EBITDA. Against this backdrop  we have accelerated our core market investment plans which are key to operational excellence  margin improvement and driving future growth.”[1] Reported P&L figures  represent continuing operations  i.e. Core Markets  only.

The LFL comparison is corrected for the scope reduction.[2] Balance sheet data are compared to start of the period  i.e. September 2023 versus December 2022.Q3 2023 business review of Core Markets (continuing operations)RevenueRevenue was €457 million  up 10% like for like versus the third quarter of 2022  driven by sustained pricing and volume growth. Adult care revenue was up 14% like for like  while in baby care and in feminine care 9% like-for-like growth was recorded. Forex had a significantly adverse effect  reducing total revenue growth to 6% year on year.Volume and mix had a 3% growth impact. In Europe market demand remained subdued overall  albeit better than in the first half of the year  while retail brand volumes were up year on year and thus continued to gain share. Volume growth was most pronounced in adult care  where retail brands had been underperforming the market in the year so far. This largely reflected Ontex’s own sales volumes in Europe with strong growth of adult care products in Southern Europe and of baby pants in Western and Central Europe. Sales volumes in feminine care remained lower. In North America volumes were back up by double digits thanks to customer gains and following the customer destocking affecting the first half of the year.Prices were up 8% on average compared to the third quarter of 2022  reflecting increases across categories. The price increases were largely implemented in 2022  and prices in the third quarter were sustained at the levels of the first half of the year.Forex fluctuations had an adverse impact of 5%. The strong year-on-year depreciation of the Russian ruble  and to a lesser extent the US dollar and the Australian dollar  more than offset the appreciation of the Polish zloty.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA was €44 million  up €20 million or 81% year on year  and slightly up versus the second quarter of 2023  thanks to relentless focus on delivering 5% operational efficiencies. Pricing helped to offset the year-on-year cost inflation and to manage the highly negative forex impact. The adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 9.5%  up 4.0pp year on year.Volume and mix growth had a slight €1 million positive impact on adjusted EBITDA.Cost transformation measures resulted in €20 million savings  leading to a reduction of the operational cost base by more than 5%. Procurement and supply chain initiatives  as well as operational efficiency were the main drivers behind the improvement.Cost inflation continued to weigh on the year-on-year comparison  albeit less than in the previous quarters. Raw material costs were up by €5 million. While all raw material indices are down compared to the third quarter of 2022  especially those for oil-based materials  the impact on the P&L comes with a lag. Other operating costs were up by €7 million year on year  and also higher quarter on quarter  due to wage inflation and rising energy costs. These also included temporary higher energy costs in Ontex’s retained plant in Tijuana  Mexico  following its carve-in triggered by the divestment of the main Mexican business in the second quarter. SG&A costs were up slightly with wage inflation as well  but remained at 9% of revenue.Pricing efforts contributed €33 million year on year. While this offset the adverse forex evolution and the additional input cost inflation versus the previous year  thanks to continued disciplined approach  it still does not cover the cumulative cost increase incurred since the start of the inflation wave in 2021 in all markets and categories. Thereby careful management of the pricing policy is required.Forex fluctuations had a €21 million net negative impact  reflecting the impact on the revenue  whereas the net impact on costs was largely neutral  with the appreciation of the Mexican peso offsetting the depreciation effect of the US dollar.Q3 2023 financial review of Total GroupP&LThe operating profit (of continuing operations) was €29 million  a significant increase versus €3 million in the third quarter of 2022  reflecting the strong increase in adjusted EBITDA. Depreciation was €16 million  slightly lower than in 2022 due to forex fluctuations. EBITDA adjustments were made for a €2 million income  consisting mostly of a reversal of impairment related to the re-activation of production equipment.Discontinued operations  consisting of the Emerging Markets division  generated a revenue of €111 million  up 8% like for like compared with last year  increasing across geographies. Strong pricing more than offset slightly lower volumes. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €15 million  with the largest contribution from the Brazilian business activities. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.3%  was up 8.0pp year on year. EBITDA adjustments were made for €2 million mostly divestment-related costs. The operating profit thereby was €12 million.Cash and balance sheetNet financial debt for the total Group was €652 million at the end of September 2023  a €6 million decrease compared to €658 million at the start of the quarter. The increase in working capital needs came to a halt. Active measures allowed to improve the cash conversion cycle  more than offsetting the impact of growing sales. As in the second quarter  capex grew to more than 4% of revenue. The investment intensity has been raised to support the transformation of the operations in Europe as well as the expansion in the US. The financing cash-out was in line with the previous year and included the semi-annual coupon payment on the fixed rate bond.The leverage ratio decreased further to 3.6 times from 4.5 times at the end of June 2023 and less than half of the peak of 7.7 times in September 2022. The strong improvement is mostly driven by the increase in adjusted EBITDA over the last quarters.During the quarter  an agreement was reached to divest Ontex’s business activities in Algeria and Pakistan to two different third parties. The finalization of these divestments is foreseen before the end of the year. There were no significant changes reported on the net asset value of these entities. In the second quarter of this year the divestment of Ontex’s Mexican business activities was closed. This deal is still subject to post-closing adjustments  as well as a deferred receivable of €39 million.Additional informationAlternative Performance MeasuresAlternative performance measures (non-GAAP) are used in this press release since management believes that they are widely used by certain investors  securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measure of performance and liquidity.

These results are ahead of the outlook issued at the beginning of the year  and have as background the active management of our balance sheet and of our portfolio in transformation  with particular attention paid to asset rotation  enhanced by the strengthening of our equity. Underpinned by conservative financial management  our focus is on executing our strategy and protecting our balance sheet and cash flows in a context where interest rates and macroeconomic factors dominate the debate  while the underlying fundamentals of the healthcare sector remain solid."" 2PRESS RELEASE REGULATED INFORMATION Brussels  27.10.2023  7:30 a.m. CET 1. Summary of activity Cofinimmo has been acquiring  developing and managing rental properties for almost 40 years. Attentive to societal changes  Cofinimmo's permanent objective is to offer high-quality care  living and working spaces ('Caring  Living and Working - Together in Real Estate'). Capitalising on its expertise  Cofinimmo consolidates its leadership in European healthcare real estate. The pandemic that the world has been experiencing in recent years has highlighted the importance of the healthcare segment for each and every one of us. Through its investments  Cofinimmo is actively participating in the operation  maintenance  expansion and renewal of the healthcare property portfolio in nine countries. During the first nine months  Cofinimmo made several investments (for 278 million EUR  i.e. 240 million EUR excluding contributions in kind  in line with the outlook1)  mainly in various healthcare real estate subsegments in Europe. Thanks to these operations  healthcare real estate assets (4.7 billion EUR) account for 74% of the group's consolidated portfolio as at 30.09.2023  which reaches 6.3 billion EUR. Cofinimmo constantly evaluates its assets portfolio based on the key points of its strategy and the available market opportunities. In this context  the group carried out disposals for 195 million EUR  in line with the outlook  contributing to the reduction by 1.6% of the debt-to-assets ratio. These are noticeable in the three sectors of activity. The cumulative amount of divestments carried out since 01.01.2023 and those already signed and expected to be closed by the end of the financial year amounts to approximately 255 million EUR. Cofinimmo has been adopting a proactive ESG policy for almost 15 years now. This is a real priority for the group  which once again distinguished itself in the 3rd quarter of 2023. First of all  several ESG labels previously granted were renewed and improved (GRESB Real Estate Assessment  Sustainalytics  and S&P Global CSA score). In addition  Cofinimmo was granted several new BREEAM certifications both in the office and healthcare real estate segments. Finally  Cofinimmo was granted a new EPRA Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations Gold Award for the tenth consecutive year. In terms of financing  Cofinimmo reinforced its financial resources and its balance sheet structure during the last two financial years (cumulative capital increases of 565 million EUR in 2021 and 114 million EUR in 2022)  and again during this financial year (non-budgeted capital increases through optional dividend in the 2nd quarter  contributions in kind in the 3rd quarter  and contribution in cash through accelerated bookbuilding - ""ABB"" - in the 4th quarter  totalling nearly 247 million EUR). The financing operations during this period enabled the group to improve the maturity timetable of its financial debts  to increase the amount of available financing  and to maintain an average cost of debt at particularly low levels. In this respect  Cofinimmo carried out in January the last early refinancing for 2023 (90 million EUR)  to bring its maturity to 2030; since then there are no further long-term debt maturities in 2023. The interest rate risk is hedged at 100% until 2026 and up to 95% in 2027. As at 30.09.2023  Cofinimmo had approximately 750 million EUR headroom on committed credit lines  after deduction of the backup of the commercial paper programme  or 915 million EUR pro forma taking into account the ABB carried out in October 2023. The group's momentum in terms of investments  divestments and financing (average cost of debt at 1.4%)  coupled with efficient management of the existing portfolio in transformation (occupancy rate of 98.5%  gross rental income up 5.8% on a like-for-like basis due to recent indexations  which usually take place on the anniversary date of the contract  operating margin at 82.5%)  enabled the company to realise a net result from core activities - group share of 177 million EUR as at 30.09.2023  ahead of the outlook (compared to the 169 million EUR that were made as at 30.09.2022  i.e. a 5% increase)  mainly due to the investments made  higher than the scope effect of disposals as well as the positive effect of contracts indexation. The net 1 i.e. the quarterly outlook derived from the annual outlook presented in the 2022 universal registration document  published on 06.04.2023  and confirmed in section 1.9.2. of the press release dated 28.07.2023. 4PRESS RELEASE REGULATED INFORMATION Brussels  27.10.2023  7:30 a.m. CET result from core activities - group share amounts to 5.33 EUR per share (ahead of the outlook  compared to 5.29 EUR as at 30.09.2022)  taking into account the issuance of shares in 2022 and 2023. The effect of disposals and capital increases on this indicator is -0.19 EUR per share and -0.23 EUR per share respectively  i.e. -0.42 EUR per share in total over the first nine months of 2023. The net result - group share amounted to 39 million EUR (i.e. 1.16 EUR per share) as at 30.09.2023  compared to 473 million EUR (i.e. 14.82 EUR per share) as at 30.09.2022. This change is due to the fact that the increase in the net result from core activities - group share is lower than the negative change in the fair value of hedging instruments and investment properties - non-cash items - between the first nine months of 2022 and the first nine months of 2023. With a debt-to-assets ratio of 47.0% as at 30.09.2023 (including the seasonal effect of the dividend payment at the end of the 1st half-year  to be compared with 45.6% as at 31.12.2022 and 47.6% as at 30.06.2023)  or 44.5% pro forma taking into account the ABB caried out in October 2023  Cofinimmo's consolidated balance sheet (whose BBB/Stable/A-2 rating was confirmed on 21.03.2023 and was the subject of a report published on 03.05.2023 and an update on 09.10.2023) shows a strong solvency (information on main risks and uncertainties are stated in section 13). Given the state of progress of ongoing projects  the net investment budget for 2023 published on 17.02.2023 and confirmed on 28.04.2023 (detailed in the annual financial report  i.e. gross investments of 300 million EUR and divestments of 300 million EUR  these net investments having a neutral effect on the debt-to-assets ratio) remains the objective  but do not take into account the investments carried out through contribution in kind (which have a favourable impact on the debt-to-assets ratio). Based on the information currently available  and barring major unforeseen events  Cofinimmo reviews its outlook with a net result from core activities - group share at 6.95 EUR per share for the 2023 financial year (vs 6.85 EUR per share previously1)  taking into account the prorata temporis dilutive effects of the 2022 and 2023 capital increases (approximately 0.39 EUR per share) and the disposals carried out in 2022 and budgeted in 2023 (approximately 0.28 EUR per share). The gross dividend outlook for the 2023 financial year  payable in 2024  can therefore be confirmed at 6.20 EUR per share. This outlook is provided subject to the main risks and uncertainties stated below (see section 13). 1 See press release dated 04.10.2033 relating to the ABB carried out in October 2023. 5PRESS RELEASE REGULATED INFORMATION Brussels  27.10.2023  7:30 a.m. CET 2.

The decline is due to SATO’s high rate of new housing construction and the intense competition prevailing in the rental housing market. On the other hand  the economic uncertainty and higher consumer prices and interest rates resulting from the war in Ukraine are also in part reflected in the rising demand for rental homes.There has been a significant decline in the volume of new housing construction projects commenced in the market  but there will still be a large number of new homes completed this year  maintaining intense competition for tenants. Due to the competitive situation  it has not been possible to transfer the higher maintenance and interest costs in full to apartment rents. The rising demand for housing  high living costs and significant decline in the volume of new housing construction may push rents up going forward.As the level of inflation and interest rates is projected to remain high  there may be upward pressure on the return requirement for real property. This may have a negative effect on the fair value of investment assets.The uncertainty in the financial markets and the higher interest rates are reflected in increased finance costs. Going forward  SATO’s large volume of unencumbered property assets enables the use of secured finance that is less expensive than unsecured finance. SATO is currently discussing with finance providers on secured loans to cover finance needs in 2024. The aim is to implement these arrangements before the turn of the year.During the period under review from 1 July to 30 September 2023  SATO completed 161 new rental homes in Raudikkokuja  Hakunila  Vantaa and  following full renovation  191 rental homes in Mechelininkatu  Etu-Töölö  Helsinki  and in Raiviosuonmäki  Martinlaakso  Vantaa.The industry-wide volume of new construction projects commenced is at a historically low level  and the supply of new rental homes will decrease over the years ahead. This year will see the completion of a total of 978 new SATO rental homes. In addition  the full renovation of a total of 545 SATO homes will be completed this year.We will still not be launching new construction projects and have adapted our operations to reflect the general market situation.Launched in the spring  the installation of solar power systems in 15 residential buildings around the Helsinki Metropolitan Area  Tampere and Turku has been completed. We will continue our work to reach the SATO target of being carbon neutral in terms of in-use energy consumption by 2030.SATO is strongly invested in increasing its presence close to customers and in digital services. We continued to build a consistent and seamless around-the-clock customer service experience.We participated for the ninth time in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) assessment and reached our aim of scoring three out of five stars.I would like to thank SATO employees for their great work to develop customer satisfaction and the housing comfort of our residents.Operating environmentOver the reporting period  a strong rate of new housing construction continued  particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area. The level of inflation still remained high  despite having declined in Finland since the winter months mainly owing to the decrease in energy prices. Core inflation has  however  persisted at a high level and clearly above the two per cent target of the central banks. The European Central Bank still continued to hike the rates in September  but the market expects the interest rate peak to be reached during late 2023  and inflation is projected to slow to below two per cent in late 2024.The high inflation has weakened consumers’ purchasing power and kept consumer confidence at a low level. According to the Bank of Finland’s September 2023 interim forecast  Finland’s GDP will contract by 0.2% in 2023. Recovery from the recession is projected to be slow  with the economy forecast to grow only by 0.2% in 2024. The improved employment rate is projected to dip slightly in 2024. As economic growth strengthens in 2025  the employment rate is also projected to take another upturn.The economic uncertainty  persistently high interest rate level and increases in living costs have a strong impact on the number of new housing construction projects commenced. The Confederation of Finnish Construction Industries RT forecast of 26 September estimates that the volume of new housing construction projects commenced this year will only be around 16 000  whereas the figure in 2022 was still more than 37 000. Projects started in 2022 will still maintain the supply of new homes at a high level throughout 2023  especially in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area. Rental housing providers are competing for good tenants  which results in rent increases remaining moderate. Inflation increases maintenance and finance costs and  going forward  these will be reflected in higher rent costs while the supply of rental housing decreases.Migration to large growth centres has continued and the Helsinki region’s migration gain in 2022 was 17 420 people. This is reflected in the demand for rental homes in growth centres. The economic uncertainty and the climbing home loan interest rates coupled with increasing energy and other costs may also contribute towards growth in demand for rental housing. Some of those looking for a home to buy are now also considering a rental home as a good option instead home ownership.The urbanisation trend continues and dense urban housing is becoming increasingly popular. There is demand for rental homes in growth centres close to good public transport connections and services. The Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA)  Tampere and Turku are large urban regions continuing to enjoy strong growth  while at the same time Statistics Finland forecasts a downturn in the nationwide population trend in 2031. The HMA is projected to grow by more than 200 000 new residents by 2040. Almost 80% of HMA residents already live in households with one to two members  and the number of small households continues to grow. The proportion of immigrants is projected to increase in the HMA from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. The ageing population is moving to growth centres providing access to services and expects more and more housing-related services. The demographic change and the price development create a stable foundation for rental housing demand  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku.REVIEW PERIOD 1 JANUARY–30 SEPTEMBER 2023 (1 JANUARY–30 SEPTEMBER 2022)Net sales and profitIn January–September 2023  SATO Corporation’s consolidated net sales totalled EUR 214.9 million (219.8).Operating profit was EUR -42.8 million (217.0).

The main risks of SATO’s business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.The war in Ukraine is a short-term risk affecting the operating environment  the duration and impacts of which on the Finnish economy are difficult to estimate. The war’s biggest impacts have been seen in the prices of energy  food and materials as well as in supply chains. The surge in prices has resulted in a rapid increase in the interest rate level. The increase in price level may slow economic growth  continue to considerably increase the interest rate level  and have a negative effect on the purchasing power of consumers as well as on their capacity to perform their obligations. Such a decline in the economy or economic activity may have an adverse effect on the financial performance  activities  finance costs or value of SATO-owned properties.The highest risks in apartment rental are to do with cyclical movements and changes in supply and demand. The market risk may push the supply of rental homes higher than their demand. This would result in idle rental housing stock and pressure for rents to level off or fall  especially as regards old housing stock.A decline in the housing market may have a negative effect on the market value of SATO’s housing stock. In line with its strategy  SATO has been focusing in its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing existing housing stock and  consequently  ensuring the rentability and value development of the apartments.Changes in regulation by the authorities and in legislation as well as related uncertainty may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and  consequently  on SATO’s business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group’s treasury policy. Our risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy adopted by SATO’s Board of Directors. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other financing commitments. The company has in place an EUR 2.0 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) Programme  under which SATO has issued bonds in the total amount of EUR 750.0 million.The means for managing liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  EUR 700.0 million in committed credit facilities and a EUR 400.0 million commercial paper programme. We increase the amount of reserves as the funding requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating-rate loans represent an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed- and floating-rate loans either by fixed-rate debt arrangements or interest rate derivatives. In accordance with our treasury policy  our aim is for fixed-rate loans  including interest rate derivatives  to account for more than 60% of our debt portfolio. At the end of the review period  the fixed-rate portion of the loan portfolio after hedging was 63.0% (excluding short-term loans).For a broader description of risks and risk management  see the Group’s website and Annual Report for 2022 at www.sato.fi/en.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO’s business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  competitive situation and interest rate level. Inflation has remained high regardless of having become more moderate after the winter months  especially thanks to lower energy prices. Core inflation has  however  persisted at a high level and clearly above the two per cent target of the central banks. The European Central Bank still hiked interest rates in September  but the market expects the interest rate peak to be reached during late 2023. Inflation is projected to slow to below two per cent in late 2024.Inflation has increased maintenance and finance costs and  due to the competitive situation  it has not been possible to transfer these costs in full to apartment rents. The uncertainty in the financial markets and the persistently high interest rates will be reflected in increased finance costs in the future  too. Going forward  SATO’s large volume of unencumbered property assets enables the use of less expensive secured finance.Due to the market situation and higher costs  SATO decided in October 2022 that the company will not launch new construction projects for the time being. In addition to the 169 apartments to be completed in 2023  another 349 newbuild apartments will still be completed in 2024.The persistently high inflation has weakened consumers’ purchasing power and kept consumer confidence at a low level. According to the Bank of Finland’s September 2023 interim forecast  Finland’s GDP will contract by 0.2% in 2023. Recovery from the recession will be slow  with the economy forecast to grow only by 0.2% in 2024. Having been growing for a long time  employment will dip slightly in 2024 but resume growth again in 2025 as economic growth strengthens.The economic uncertainty  persistently high interest rate level and increases in living costs have a strong impact particularly on the number of new housing construction projects commenced. The Confederation of Finnish Construction Industries RT forecast of 26 September estimates that the volume of new housing construction projects commenced in 2023 will only be around 16 000  whereas the figure in 2022 was more than 37 000. Projects started in 2022 will still maintain the supply of new homes at a high level particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan throughout 2023  which will mean competition for good tenants will be very intense and rent increases moderate. Going forward  maintenance and finance costs pushed up by inflation will be reflected in higher apartment rents as supply in the market declines.The urbanisation trend continues and dense urban housing is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. There is demand for rental homes in growth centres close to good public transport connections and services. The economic uncertainty and the climbing home loan interest rates coupled with increasing energy and other costs also contributes towards growth in demand for rental housing. Some of those looking for a home to buy are now also considering a rental home as an option.In line with its majority shareholder’s operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2023 earnings.

These decreases were partly offset by higher incentive compensation and third-party distribution fees.Operating expenses increased 10.7% from the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to higher stock-based compensation and headcount  fund management and administration costs  professional fees  third-party distribution fees  marketing expenses and sales and business development expenses. These increases were partly offset by the termination of our deferred consideration—gold payments obligation.Other Income/(Expenses)Interest expense decreased 13.9% from the second quarter of 2023 due to a lower average level of debt outstanding. Interest expense decreased 7.3% from the third quarter of 2022 due to a lower level of debt outstanding  partly offset by a higher effective interest rate.Interest income decreased 20.9% from the second quarter of 2023 due to lower average levels of financial instruments owned and was essentially unchanged from the third quarter of 2022.During the third quarter of 2023  we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $2.7 million  primarily on our investment in Securrency  Inc.  as we marked our investment to estimated realizable value in connection with Securrency entering into an agreement to be acquired by an unrelated third party.Other losses and gains  net was a loss of $2.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. This quarter includes losses on our financial instruments of $2.0 million and other losses on our investments of $0.4 million. Gains and losses also generally arise from the sale of gold earned from management fees paid by our physically-backed gold exchange-traded products (“ETPs”)  foreign exchange fluctuations and other miscellaneous items.Income TaxesOur effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was 31.0%  resulting in income tax expense of $5.8 million. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance on losses recognized on the Company’s investments and non-deductible executive compensation.Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 24.5%(1).NINE MONTH HIGHLIGHTSOperating revenues increased 13.2% as compared to 2022 due to higher average AUM and higher other income from large flows from some of our European products  partly offset by a lower average advisory fee.Operating expenses increased 9.5% as compared to 2022 primarily due to higher stock-based compensation and headcount  fund management and administration costs  professional fees  marketing expenses  sales and business development expenses  third-party distribution fees and other expenses. These increases were partly offset by the termination of our deferred consideration—gold payments obligation on May 10  2023.Significant items reported in other income/(expense) in 2023 include: a non-cash gain on revaluation/termination of deferred consideration of $62.0 million during the first and second quarter; loss on extinguishment of convertible notes of $9.7 million arising from the repurchase of $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes (the “2020 Notes”) in the first quarter; non-cash impairment charges totaling $7.6 million  primarily on our investments in Securrency  Inc.; losses on our financial instruments owned of $1.0 million and other losses on our investments of $1.2 million; and a non-cash charge of $1.4 million arising from the release of tax-related indemnification assets upon the expiration of the statute of limitations (an equal and offsetting benefit was recognized in income tax expense). Gains and losses also generally arise from the sale of gold earned on management fees paid by our physically-backed gold ETPs  foreign exchange fluctuations and other miscellaneous items.Our effective income tax rate for 2023 was 11.4%  resulting in income tax expense of $10.8 million. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to a non-taxable gain on revaluation/termination of deferred consideration  a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits associated with the release of the tax-related indemnification asset described above and a lower tax rate on foreign earnings. These items were partly offset by a non-deductible loss on extinguishment of the 2020 Notes during the first quarter of 2023  an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance on losses recognized on our investments and non-deductible executive compensation.CONFERENCE CALL DIAL-IN AND WEBCAST DETAILSWisdomTree will discuss its results and operational highlights during a live webcast on Friday  October 27  2023 at 11:00 a.m. ET  which can be accessed using the following link: https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=wtCKhqvm.Participants also can dial in using the following numbers: (877) 407-9210 or (201) 689-8049.

Our management reviews these non-GAAP financial measurements when evaluating our financial performance and results of operations; therefore  we believe it is useful to provide information with respect to these non-GAAP measurements so as to share this perspective of management. Non-GAAP measurements do not have any standardized meaning  do not replace nor are superior to GAAP financial measurements and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measurements should be considered in the context with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measurements contained in this press release include:Adjusted Operating Income  Operating Expenses  Income Before Income Taxes  Income Tax Expense  Net Income and Diluted Earnings per ShareWe disclose adjusted operating income  operating expenses  income before income taxes  income tax expense  net income and diluted earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measurements in order to report our results exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe presenting these non-GAAP financial measurements provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our performance. These non-GAAP financial measurements exclude the following:Unrealized gains or losses on revaluation/termination of deferred consideration—gold payments: Deferred consideration—gold payments was an obligation we assumed in connection with the ETFS acquisition that was carried at fair value. This item represented the present value of an obligation to pay fixed ounces of gold into perpetuity and is measured using forward-looking gold prices. Changes in the forward-looking price of gold and changes in the discount rate used to compute the present value of the annual payment obligations have had a material impact on the carrying value of the deferred consideration and our reported financial results. We exclude this item when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as it was not core to our operating business. The item was not adjusted for income taxes as the obligation was assumed by a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours that is based in Jersey  a jurisdiction where we are subject to a zero percent tax rate.During the second quarter of 2023  we terminated this obligation for aggregate consideration totaling approximately $137.0 million.Gains or losses on financial instruments owned: We account for our financial instruments owned as trading securities  which requires these instruments to be measured at fair value with gains and losses reported in net income. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gains and losses introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.Tax windfalls and shortfalls upon vesting and exercise of stock-based compensation awards: GAAP requires the recognition of tax windfalls and shortfalls within income tax expense. These items arise upon the vesting and exercise of stock-based compensation awards and the magnitude is directly correlated to the number of awards vesting/exercised as well as the difference between the price of our stock on the date the award was granted and the date the award vested or was exercised. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as they introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.Other items: Loss on extinguishment of our convertible notes  impairments  remeasurement of contingent consideration payable to us from the sale of our former Canadian ETF business  unrealized gains and losses recognized on our investments  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowance  expenses incurred in response to an activist campaign and litigation expenses associated with certain provisions of our Stockholder Rights Agreement dated as of March 17  2023  as amended with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company  as Rights Agent  are excluded when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements.Adjusted Effective Income Tax RateWe disclose our adjusted effective income tax rate as a non-GAAP financial measurement in order to report our effective income tax rate exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe reporting our adjusted effective income tax rate provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our income taxes. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing adjusted income tax expense by adjusted income before income taxes. See above for information regarding the items that are excluded.Gross Margin and Gross Margin PercentageWe disclose our gross margin and gross margin percentage as non-GAAP financial measurements because we believe they provide investors with a consistent way to analyze the amount we retain after paying third-party service providers to operate our ETPs. These measures also assist us in analyzing the profitability of our products. We define gross margin as total operating revenues less fund management and administration expenses. Gross margin percentage is calculated as gross margin divided by total operating revenues.WISDOMTREE  INC.

The failure of key vendors to adequately provide such services could materially affect our operating business and harm WisdomTree ETP investors; andactions of activist stockholders against us  which have been costly and may be disruptive and cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.Other factors  such as general economic conditions  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  also may have an effect on the results of our operations.
