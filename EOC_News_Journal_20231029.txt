The European Commission is set to present formal legislation regarding this by December.Since the outset of the Ukraine conflict over a year ago  $300 billion of Russia’s Central Bank reserves have been frozen due to Western sanctions. The world-renowned securities depository  Euroclear  is in the custody of a hefty €180 billion  as cited by the Belgian government.On Thursday  Euroclear stated it had accumulated a remarkable €3 billion from the seized Russian assets over the year's first three quarters. The figure is almost nine times the €347 million of the same period last year  a spike driven by an uptick in interest rates.Due to sanctions  Euroclear cannot disburse coupon payments and bond redemptions related to the frozen Russian assets to its clients. With rising interest rates  Euroclear regularly reinvesting cash balances has yielded higher earnings.While the EU mulls over channeling Russian Central Bank reserves’ financial proceeds to Ukraine  the European Central Bank has cautioned about the consequences for the euro. The bank fears it might incentivize other central banks to divest from their euro holdings  undermining the currency’s value.At Friday's summit  EU leaders gave their unanimous backing for the initiative  pressing the commission to expedite the pace of work to put forth proposals.According to two key figures deeply engaged in the groundwork  the commission is slated to unveil its proposal in early December  media reported  citing sources. Per the officials  communication channels between Brussels  London  and Washington remain active to ensure a unified approach.While nations like Germany initially expressed legal reservations about owning the funds  their uncertainties were laid to rest after US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen advocated for siphoning surplus earnings. The G7 aligns with this perspective.In December  the EU plans to detail the legal framework surrounding windfall profits at depositories like Euroclear. Only afterward  with legislation slated for the upcoming year  will measures to channel these earnings to Ukraine be introduced.https://sputnikglobe.com/20230907/not-legally-possible-for-us-to-transfer-seized-russian-assets-to-ukraine---intl-lawyer-1113184463.htmlukrainerussiabrusselsSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 602023Chimauchem Nwosu https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e7/09/01/1113046371_0:99:1536:1635_100x100_80_0_0_9c5c627283eca931c39fe4852bbb301c.jpgChimauchem Nwosu https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e7/09/01/1113046371_0:99:1536:1635_100x100_80_0_0_9c5c627283eca931c39fe4852bbb301c.jpgNewsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60Chimauchem Nwosu https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e7/09/01/1113046371_0:99:1536:1635_100x100_80_0_0_9c5c627283eca931c39fe4852bbb301c.jpgeuropean union  seized russian assets  ukraine aid  european commission  ukrainian conflict  $300 billion russia’s central bank reserves  western sanctions  securities depository euroclear  brussels  interest rates  sanctions  coupon payments  bond redemptions  european central bank  euro  central banks  euro holdings  eu leaders  proposal  brussels  london  washington  germany  us treasury secretary  janet yellen  surplus earnings  g7  legal framework.,neutral,0.09,0.8,0.1,negative,0.02,0.22,0.76,True,English,"['Russian Assets', 'Ukraine Aid', 'EU', 'Revenue', 'Russian Central Bank reserves’ financial proceeds', 'US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'brussels european commission european union', 'european central bank economy', 'European Union authorities', 'first three quarters', 'two key figures', 'other central banks', 'The European Commission', 'notable €3 billion uptick', 'world-renowned securities depository', 'rising interest rates', 'financial service', 'Russian Assets', 'The G7', 'Belgian government', 'same period', 'coupon payments', 'bond redemptions', 'cash balances', 'unanimous backing', 'communication channels', 'unified approach', 'legal reservations', 'legal framework', 'windfall profits', 'Sputnik International', 'Rosiya Segodnya', 'Chimauchem Nwosu', 'higher earnings', 'surplus earnings', 'formal legislation', 'Western sanctions', 'euro holdings', 'early December', 'upcoming year', 'Ukraine Aid', 'Ukraine conflict', 'ukraine russia', 'EU leaders', 'sputnikglobe', 'russian-assets', 'Revenue', 'Euroclear', 'accruals', 'meta', 'proposal', 'billions', 'outset', 'custody', 'Thursday', 'remarkable €', 'spike', 'clients', 'consequences', 'currency', 'value', 'Friday', 'summit', 'initiative', 'pace', 'groundwork', 'media', 'sources', 'officials', 'London', 'Washington', 'nations', 'Germany', 'funds', 'uncertainties', 'perspective', 'depositories', 'measures', 'lawyer', 'MIA', 'News', '1.']",2023-10-28,2023-10-29,sputnikglobe.com

Photograph: The Irish TimesGoodbody Stockbrokers has told staff not to expect bonuses for a second straight full year under AIB’s ownership  according to sources.It comes within weeks of the firm moving to cut 20 of the 100 jobs there were in its investment banking unit amid a global slowdown in deal-making and fundraisings and an expected acceleration of large companies leaving the Irish stock market.Goodbody  which has been led by chief executive Martin Tormey since it was bought by AIB two years ago  had about 350 employees before the job cuts were announced.The company also acquired Clearstream Solutions  an environmental  social and governance consultancy that has 15 employees  earlier this month for an undisclosed amount.READ MOREA Goodbody spokesman declined to comment on the plan not to pay out bonuses this year when contacted on Friday.AIB sold Goodbody in 2011 to Kerry-based financial services group Fexco and the firm’s management team as it was offloaded what were seen as non-core assets in the wake of the bank’s government bailout.Could a Supreme Court decision have huge implications for workers in the gig economy? Listen | 30:20It bought Goodbody in September 2021 for €138 million  after the stockbroking and wealth management firm was the subject of two abortive takeover deals by separate Chinese groups in 2019 and 2020  respectively. Goodbody forms part of AIB’s capital markets division  which is led Cathy Bryce.AIB got a concession from the Government at the time of the Goodbody purchase to allow the stockbroker to continue to pay bonuses  depending on the firm’s financial performance  even as variable pay continued to be banned at the bank itself as a result of its bailout.The Government decided last December to allow for bonuses across the banks of up to €20 000 per employee. However  AIB said on Thursday that it would cap cash awards at €12 700 as it returns to paying variable pay next year while at the same time introducing healthcare benefits for all employees.,negative,0.06,0.32,0.62,negative,0.01,0.25,0.73,True,English,"['Goodbody Stockbrokers’ staff', 'second full year', 'bonuses', 'AIB', 'second straight full year', 'chief executive Martin Tormey', 'two abortive takeover deals', 'Kerry-based financial services group', 'The Irish Times', 'investment banking unit', 'Irish stock market', 'Supreme Court decision', 'separate Chinese groups', 'capital markets division', 'A Goodbody spokesman', 'wealth management firm', 'financial performance', 'management team', 'global slowdown', 'large companies', 'job cuts', 'Clearstream Solutions', 'governance consultancy', 'undisclosed amount', 'core assets', 'huge implications', 'gig economy', 'Cathy Bryce', 'variable pay', 'cash awards', 'healthcare benefits', 'Goodbody Stockbrokers', 'Goodbody purchase', 'same time', 'government bailout', 'bonuses', 'banks', 'employee', 'Photograph', 'staff', 'AIB', 'ownership', 'sources', 'weeks', '100 jobs', 'deal-making', 'fundraisings', 'acceleration', 'company', 'social', 'READ', 'plan', 'Friday', 'Fexco', 'wake', 'workers', 'Listen', 'September', 'stockbroking', 'subject', 'part', 'concession', 'result', 'Thursday']",2023-10-28,2023-10-29,irishtimes.com
