The move  she stressed  aligns with a previous political decision to hold Moscow accountable for Ukraine’s reconstruction following Russian President Vladimir Putin all-out invasion of the country.Volodin  a Putin ally  made clear that if EU forges ahead with the proposal  Moscow’s reaction would inflict more economic pain on the EU than the other way round.“A number of European politicians  led by the president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen  have once again started talking about stealing our country’s frozen funds in order to continue the militarization of Kyiv ” Volodin said in a statement onTelegram.“Such a decision would require a symmetrical response from the Russian Federation. In that case  far more assets belonging to unfriendly countries will be confiscated than our frozen funds in Europe ” he said.According to von der Leyen  an “actual proposal” should be presented in early December. EU finance ministers are looking into the principles that will underpin such a mechanism.“We will present a proposal to find a way how to use the proceeds from those assets that are currently benefiting a limited number of financial institutions in the European Union ” she said. Most of the sanctioned assets are located in Belgium  with as much as €180 billion being held at Euroclear  the securities depository.But the idea faces technical challenges  with the European Central Bank warning that tapping into these earnings could encourage other central banks to quit their euro-denominated assets  ultimately weakening the euro itself  the Financial Times reported.The U.K.  the U.S. are the G7 group of the biggest economies have all expressed support for the EU’s idea.,negative,0.06,0.37,0.57,negative,0.03,0.26,0.71,True,English,"['Russia assets', 'Moscow', 'kind', 'EU', 'profits', 'frozen', 'Putin', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'European Central Bank', 'other central banks', 'high-level Russian official', 'The U.K.', 'previous political decision', 'EU finance ministers', 'other way round', 'unfriendly” EU nations', 'Russian state assets', 'European politicians', 'European Union', 'Putin ally', 'Russian holdings', 'Russian Federation', 'unfriendly countries', 'U.S.', 'lower house', 'economic pain', 'symmetrical response', 'early December', 'financial institutions', 'securities depository', 'technical challenges', 'Financial Times', 'G7 group', 'biggest economies', 'EU executive', 'limited number', 'euro-denominated assets', 'Vyacheslav Volodin', 'actual proposal', 'Moscow', 'retaliation', 'bloc', 'profits', 'Sunday', 'warning', 'head', 'parliament', 'Friday', 'move', 'Ukraine', 'reconstruction', 'invasion', 'country', 'reaction', 'funds', 'order', 'militarization', 'Kyiv', 'statement', 'case', 'principles', 'mechanism', 'proceeds', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'idea', 'earnings', 'support']",2023-10-29,2023-10-30,politico.eu

""As part of the UK-India FTA talks  the plan that is being discussed is that Euroclear UK will act as the clearing house for FPI bond settlement in Indian government bonds  but CCIL will have data on trade reporting at the back end on buyers and sellers.""If the plan were to fructify  potential inflows into the local bond market could be significant as settlement on Euroclear would lift geographic curbs  permitting foreign investors from anywhere to transact in Indian bonds without undergoing the process of registrations  sources said.""After an FPI sells securities  at the end of every quarter  CCIL would share the capital gains liability with Euroclear UK  which in turn will communicate the information to the FPI investor "" said the executive cited above. ""By the end of the financial year  the capital gains would be cleared.""Emails sent to Euroclear and the CCIL requesting their responses on the matter remained unanswered until the publication of this report.At present  the LTCG tax on foreign ownership is at 20%.Euroclear UK and International is the central securities depository for the UK and is regulated by the Bank of England. The other Euroclear providers are Euroclear Bank  Euroclear Belgium  Euroclear Finland  Euroclear France  Euroclear Nederland and Euroclear Sweden.ET had reported on October 25 that India and the UK are trying to find a middle ground to conclude a bilateral investment treaty along with the FTA.""The proposed plan on Euroclear settlement  if accepted  is seen as being beneficial to both parties as Euroclear UK would expand its settlement business  while more FPI investment could flow into Indian bonds "" a second source said.The deliberations on Euroclear UK come after JPMorgan last month included India in its emerging market bond index  paving the way for around $20-25 billion of foreign investment.

It addresses the urgent conservation needs in the Hoima and Masindi districts  which are home to over 300 wild chimpanzees living in diminishing forest fragments on agricultural land.The Project's community-centred approach collaborates with local communities to find sustainable solutions that benefit both the chimpanzees and the local populace. Initiatives include providing energy-saving stoves  seedlings for woodlots  forest enrichment planting  and training in conservation farming  among others.The overarching goal of the Project is to plant 4.5 million trees over the next six years and restore 8 290 hectares of degraded land. It's projected to generate approximately 4.3 million verified carbon credits over its 41-year lifespan  resulting in anticipated gross revenues of €63.4 million. Notably  25% of these proceeds will directly benefit local communities.The project sites will be featured in an upcoming episode of the documentary series  'Planet Earth III'. The episode highlighting the Bulindi chimps is scheduled for broadcast in the UK on Sunday  19 November  with subsequent airings expected across various regions in Europe shortly thereafter. This feature is a testament to the Project's substantial impact on conservation efforts and its role in fostering environmental sustainability.Contact detailsDGB GROUP NVpress@dgb.earth+31108080126About DGBDGB is a project developer of high-quality  large-scale carbon and biodiversity projects accredited by third parties.
