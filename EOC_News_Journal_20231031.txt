Ukrainian officials never acknowledge responsibility for attacks on Russian territory or the Crimean peninsula.In Ukraine  the country’s air force said Sunday it had shot down five Iranian-made Shahed exploding drones launched by Russia overnight.ADVERTISEMENTBar some exceptions  most strikes by Kyiv almost always cause no casualties or damage and are often intercepted by Russian air defences. So what then is the purpose of Ukraine’s drone war against Russia?

Spouses  children  friends  siblings  neighbours  and colleagues ran for someone they knew who either was killed  taken captive or injured during Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.The crowd cheered the runners  and many in the audience wept while waiting for participants at the finish line. Amid the lively backdrop of Ukrainian songs  joy and sorrow intermingled in the air as life carried on despite the war.The organisers of the run called it the “World’s Longest Marathon” — “because no race has lasted as long as Ukraine has been fighting for its freedom.”ADVERTISEMENTUkrainian veterans of the war participate in a one-kilometre race in Kyiv  Ukraine  Sunday  Oct. 29  2023. Alex Babenko/Copyright 2023 The AP. All rights reserved.Around 13 000 people across the world registered for the event. Those competing remotely could run any distance they wanted and were encouraged to post about it on social media.Volodymyr Rutkovskyi  a 31-year-old veteran  completed the course walking. In mid-June  he sustained a severe injury when a Russian projectile struck his right leg during Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the Zaporizhzhia region.After months of rehabilitation  he now uses a prosthetic limb and participated in the event to pay tribute to two fallen comrades  Zheka and Tykhyi  who were killed in eastern Ukraine.“They did a lot for our country  and sadly  they could have done much more if they were alive ” he said. “But their struggle continues. We will do everything for them and in their honour.”",negative,0.03,0.2,0.78,negative,0.04,0.29,0.67,True,English,"['EU assets', 'Ukraine war', 'drone strikes', 'Moscow', 'West', 'Asia', 'five Iranian-made Shahed exploding drones', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'Brussels-based financial services company', 'biggest military diplomacy event', 'Russia Russian air defences', 'two fallen comrades', 'European Union states', 'European Commission president', 'European Union leaders', 'Russian defence minister', 'Russian border regions', 'southern Krasnodar region', 'local media outlets', 'military drills', 'Ukrainian drones', 'Russian funds', 'Russian money', 'Russian parliament', 'Russian territory', 'Russian projectile', 'air force', 'state media', 'Local authorities', 'social media', 'European assets', 'Russian assets', 'latest developments', 'leading official', 'Vyacheslav Volodin', 'lower house', 'unfriendly countries', 'windfall taxes', 'Central Bank', 'foreign-exchange reserves', 'Xiangshan Forum', 'acute crisis', 'crisis potential', 'direct conflict', 'nuclear powers', 'catastrophic consequences', 'climate change', 'natural disasters', 'humanitarian interventions', 'post-conflict settlement', 'Western countries', 'strategic defeat', 'Black Sea', 'Crimean peninsula', 'Defense Ministry', 'oil refinery', 'early hours', 'Moscow-annexed Crimea', 'regular occurrence', 'Ukrainian officials', 'most strikes', 'finish line', 'lively backdrop', 'Ukrainian songs', 'Ukrainian veterans', 'Alex Babenko', 'The AP', 'Volodymyr Rutkovskyi', '31-year-old veteran', 'severe injury', 'right leg', 'Zaporizhzhia region', 'prosthetic limb', 'arms race', 'one-kilometre race', 'Drone strikes', 'Confiscated assets', 'one person', 'ongoing war', 'EU territory', 'Sergei Shoigu', 'The West', 'drone war', 'Ukraine war', 'Euronews', 'AFP/AP', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'country', 'bloc', 'Friday', 'proposal', 'Telegram', 'speaker', 'Kyiv', 'resources', 'billions', 'euros', 'February', 'raft', 'sanctions', 'ability', 'access', 'deposits', 'Euroclear', 'Asia', 'Washington', 'China', 'NATO', 'forces', 'scale', 'posture', 'risk', 'excuse', 'talks', 'existence', 'Flurry', 'fire', 'Sunday', 'cause', 'reasons', 'incident', 'statement', 'claims', 'shelling', 'responsibility', 'attacks', 'exceptions', 'casualties', 'damage', 'purpose', 'story', 'Thousands', 'Ukrainians', 'bibs', 'name', 'number', 'run', 'Spouses', 'children', 'friends', 'siblings', 'neighbours', 'colleagues', 'someone', 'crowd', 'audience', 'participants', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'life', 'organisers', 'World', 'freedom', 'Copyright', 'rights', '13,000 people', 'distance', 'course', 'mid-June', 'counteroffensive', 'months', 'rehabilitation', 'tribute', 'Zheka', 'Tykhyi', 'east']",2023-10-30,2023-10-31,euronews.com
32001,Euroclear,Bing API,https://euobserver.com/opinion/157633,Can G7 make Russia pay for reconstruction of Ukraine?,While seizing Russian assets for Ukraine's reconstruction seems a logical option  it presents legal challenges and potential risks to the monetary system. Alternative approaches  such as seizing the proceeds generated by frozen assets ,"A joint assessment by the government of Ukraine  the World Bank  the European Commission and the United Nations of March 2023 estimated that the cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine would amount to $411bn [€385bn]. This would be more than 2.5 times the 2022 Ukrainian GDP. Since nine months have gone by since the publication of the analysis  the figure is most likely higher now. Who will fund this huge amount?The answer seems to be pretty logical and straightforward: it should be the one inflicting the damage  i.e. Russia. This is indeed in line with the resolution passed by the UN on 14 November 2022  according to which under international law  Russia will owe Ukraine reparations for the unprovoked war.It is estimated that there are €125bn of Russian assets are held in Belgium-based Euroclear (Photo: Benoit)As part of the sanctions a group of countries has imposed on Russia  more than $300bn of Russian sovereign assets held abroad have been frozen. A vast majority of these assets consist of deposits made by the Russian Central Bank and more than €200bn are held in EU financial institutions  €125bn in Belgium-based Euroclear.A possible solution raised by some experts to fit the bill of the reconstruction costs in Ukraine would entail the outright confiscation and repurposing of Russian assets to Ukraine.Indeed  a report by a group of legal experts and commissioned by Garry Kasparov argues that such a proposal would be legally feasible and refers to a similar precedent  when President George H. Bush transferred Iraq's frozen assets in the US to the UN Compensation Commission for victims of Iraqi aggression.Although on this occasion the US has somehow already tested this avenue with privately-owned assets  by for instance transferring to Ukraine more than $5m of forfeited assets of Russian Oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev  further expanding such a possibility to sovereign assets would raise a number of legal doubts  as conveyed by the US treasury secretary  Janet Yellen.Moreover  since the assets to be seized belong to the Russian Central Bank  some experts indicate the stability of the monetary system could be put at risk and even the international role of the currencies of the sanctioning jurisdictions could be harmed.Besides  there has not been significant progress in approving legislation introduced in June 2023 by a group of bipartisan US senators and representatives to grant the president of the US the authority to confiscate Russian sovereign assets that have been frozen in the United States and transfer them to assist in Ukraine's reconstruction efforts.A similar bill is being discussed in Canadian parliament: while Canada can at present seize the assets of Russian citizens and companies by court order  it does not have the legal means to do so with sovereign assets of offending states  which benefit from immunity.Since seizing Russian sovereign assets seems to raise legal doubts  another idea has been put forward: seizing the proceeds generated by these frozen assets  leaving the underlying principal untouched.As an example  Euroclear has already generated €1.7bn in profits in the first half of this year from reinvesting Russian securities as they reach maturity. This proposal has been reflected in the G7 statement of ministers of finance and central bank governors of 12 October 2023  which states that G7 countries ""will explore how any extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from immobilised Russian sovereign assets  where those extraordinary revenues are not required to meet obligations towards Russia under applicable laws  could be directed to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction in compliance with applicable laws"".After pledging to fund a high proportion of the reconstruction costs of Ukraine  the EU is most interested in finding alternative funding sources. Otherwise  the EU budget could be severely strained and the financing of the green and digital transitions could be hindered.Sign up for EUobserver’s daily newsletter All the stories we publish  sent at 7.30 AM. By signing up  you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.This is why last week's statement by the European Council points out that ""decisive progress is needed  in coordination with partners  on how any extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from Russia's immobilised assets could be directed to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction  consistent with applicable contractual obligations  and in accordance with EU and international law. The European Council calls on the high representative and the commission to accelerate work with a view to submitting proposals"".By the time of writing this piece  a proposal has not been tabled yet and technical work is still ongoing.Western allies should proceed with a very prudent approach. While seizing Russian assets and using them for the reconstruction of Ukraine seems to be a logical and even ethical avenue to follow  it also needs to fully abide by all international and national legal standards. Replying to an unlawful physical aggression with potentially unlawful financial actions does not seem advisable for democratic societies.Thus  all the precautions and deep legal analyses currently undertaken by G7 members seem the right way forward. If a legal solution is found for the confiscation and rechanneling of assets' proceeds  even if the amounts will probably be far from substantially contributing to fitting the bill of the reconstruction  a staggered approach before possibly moving to the confiscation of underlying assets is adequate.",neutral,0.04,0.77,0.18,negative,0.05,0.2,0.75,True,English,"['G7', 'Russia', 'reconstruction', 'Ukraine', 'Russian Oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev', 'President George H.

The aim is to offer a therapeutic alternative to prevent death of these patients.While the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is currently rising sharply in Brazil and around the world  there are still very few options available for treating severe forms of the disease.ANVISA's approval of an EAP is based primarily on the following criteria:The product is intended for patients suffering from a serious disabling and/or life-threatening disease.There is no satisfactory therapeutic alternative in the treatments already registered in Brazil.Authorization to use the product is granted on request  and only under the responsibility of the prescribing practitioner  as it is likely to be of significant benefit to the patient.Stanislas Veillet  Chief Executive Officer of Biophytis  stated: ""Making Sarconeos (BIO101) available to Brazilian patients hospitalized in intensive care due to Covid-19 represents a key step towards bringing our treatment to market. This program will enable us to treat critical patients and generate important new information on the safety and efficacy of our treatment in real-life conditions.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today announces that VEON Ltd. and VEON Holdings B.V. have filed two motions with the relevant Kyiv district court  challenging the freezing of the corporate rights in Kyivstar  which was initially announced on the website of the Security Services of Ukraine (SSU) on 6 October 2023.Noting that corporate rights in Kyivstar belong exclusively to VEON  and that their full or partial seizure directly violates the rights of VEON and its international debt and equity investors  VEON requested the lifting of the freezing of its corporate rights in Kyivstar.In its filings  the Company also reiterated that any action aimed at the rights  benefits or funds of sanctioned individuals - the alleged reason for seizure of corporate rights as per the SSU statement - cannot legitimately be directed toward Kyivstar or VEON. Sanctioned individuals do not own any shares in VEON or Kyivstar; they cannot exercise any rights regarding VEON or Kyivstar; are not a part of either company’s governance mechanisms  including boards; do not have the ability to control or influence decisions made by VEON or Kyivstar; and do not derive any economic benefits from VEON or any of its operating companies.“VEON is taking all the necessary steps to protect the rights of our company  our wholly owned subsidiary Kyivstar and our international investors. The impeccable track record of VEON and Kyivstar in serving Ukraine  the dialogue we established last week in Ukraine during our Board delegation’s visit and the continued availability of appeal mechanisms and procedures give me confidence that that we will achieve our dual goal of addressing the concerns of Ukrainian authorities while protecting our rights ” said Kaan Terzioglu  VEON Group CEO.As of the time of publication  neither VEON nor Kyivstar have officially been served the initial court order seizing corporate rights in Kyivstar  or the amended court order dated 13 October 2023  reducing the percentage of seized corporate rights to 47.85% of the shares. If the motions are rejected  or if the court does not otherwise voluntarily rescind its order  further steps remain available to VEON within the framework of Ukrainian law  including filing an appeal to a higher court.As clarified in VEON’s 12 October 2023 statement  a corporate rights freeze does not amount to asset seizure. The measure prevents changes to ownership and was introduced to protect material evidence while criminal proceedings  unrelated to Kyivstar or VEON  are in progress. As confirmed in the SSU announcement  “The seizure of corporate rights of Ukrainian companies does not affect the protection of the interests of foreign investors and owners of shares of corporate rights  does not hinder their economic activity and the possibility of receiving dividends.”With no significant impact on its operations  Kyivstar continues to serve its 25 million customers and keep Ukraine connected with 94% network availability  continuing its services with full operational integrity in line with the national security priorities of Ukraine.About VEONVEON is a digital operator that provides converged connectivity and digital services to nearly 160 million customers.

(""DGB"" or ""the Group"") (Euronext: DGB: NL0009169515)  a leading carbon project developer and ecosystem restoration company  signs an option agreement with a leading car manufacturing company (the ""Client""). The option agreement grants the Client the option to purchase Gold Standard Verified Emission Reductions (""VERs"").Under the agreement  the Client secures the option to purchase VERs from DGB's esteemed Bulindi Chimpanzee Habitat Restoration Project under the Gold Standard verification number GS 12226 (the ""Project""). This exclusivity ensures that the Client has a unique opportunity to contribute to and benefit from the significant environmental impact and carbon emissions reductions achieved by the project.DGB holds all VERs  receiving €40 000 as a reservation fee  which will be deducted from the final purchase. The exact volume for purchase must be confirmed by 31 December 2023  with the entire transaction and payment finalised by 1 April 2024.Selwyn Duijvestijn  CEO of DGB  commented  'This underscores the intrinsic value and practical impact of our projects  as evidenced by the 44.9 million carbon credits currently held on our balance sheet. It exemplifies our capacity to transform the projects we've meticulously crafted and nurtured over the years into generating cash flow and prospective revenue. After more than three years of dedicated development  we are poised to transition into a phase of revenue generation  marking a significant milestone in our journey.'The Bulindi Chimpanzee Habitat Restoration Project is a groundbreaking afforestation initiative located in western Uganda. It addresses the urgent conservation needs in the Hoima and Masindi districts  which are home to over 300 wild chimpanzees living in diminishing forest fragments on agricultural land.The Project's community-centred approach collaborates with local communities to find sustainable solutions that benefit both the chimpanzees and the local populace. Initiatives include providing energy-saving stoves  seedlings for woodlots  forest enrichment planting  and training in conservation farming  among others.The overarching goal of the Project is to plant 4.5 million trees over the next six years and restore 8 290 hectares of degraded land. It's projected to generate approximately 4.3 million verified carbon credits over its 41-year lifespan  resulting in anticipated gross revenues of €63.4 million. Notably  25% of these proceeds will directly benefit local communities.The project sites will be featured in an upcoming episode of the documentary series  'Planet Earth III'. The episode highlighting the Bulindi chimps is scheduled for broadcast in the UK on Sunday  19 November  with subsequent airings expected across various regions in Europe shortly thereafter. This feature is a testament to the Project's substantial impact on conservation efforts and its role in fostering environmental sustainability.DGB GROUP NVpress@dgb.earth+31108080126DGB is a project developer of high-quality  large-scale carbon and biodiversity projects accredited by third parties.

As a reminder  H1 2023/24 benefited from the contributions of PEN Partnership  consolidated since August 1  2022  and Coeus Consulting  consolidated since October 1  2022.The solid progression in revenue at constant scope is the result of the intensification of business development activity over the last few quarters  and of the headcount growth at the end of the 2022/23 fiscal year.Stabilization of the staff turnover rate at 14%  recruitment activity still moderateAt September 30  2023  staff turnover was continuing to decline and is now stabilized at 14% on arolling-12-month basis; this compares with 15% at June 30  2023 and 16% for the whole of the previous fiscal year.At mid-year  given the uncertain economic environment and reduced staff turnover  Wavestone is maintaining a moderate rate of recruitment compared with the previous year.At September 30  2023  Wavestone had 4 305 employees  compared with 4 406 at the end of March – the end of the 2022/23 fiscal year. Despite more moderate recruitment activity  the firm is targeting an increase in the workforce over the entire 2023/24 fiscal year.Consultant utilization rate of 73% in H1 2023/24 and an increase in sales price of +1.1%In Q2  the firm consolidated the recovery in its consultant utilization rate  after the significant drop at the end of the 2022/23 fiscal year (71% in Q4 2022/23). Consultant utilization rate stood at 73% in Q2  as well as over H1 as a whole.The average daily rate reached €900 in H1 of the 2023/24 fiscal year – an increase of +1.1% compared with the average sales price for the whole of the previous fiscal year (€890). At constant exchange rates  the average daily rate was €902  up +1.3%.Strong first half of 2023/24  but caution maintained for the second halfThe first half of the 2023/24 fiscal year was marked by a solid growth in Wavestone's revenue  as a result of intense business development activity. H1 also saw a slowdown in staff turnover and a progressive recovery in the consultant utilization rate. Sales prices remained solid  up slightly compared with the previous fiscal year.The last few months have  however  seen a deterioration in the economic environment  which is characterized by increased volatility and a more marked wait-and-see attitude from decision makers to committing expenditure. Although this deterioration in the economic environment is significantly impacting demand in some business sectors (banking  retail  services and the public sector)  others  such as energy  insurance  luxury goods  and transport remain better oriented. Moreover  the firm has seen strong resilience on technological projects (cybersecurity  IT infrastructures  AI & Data).The order book fell back to 3.6 months of work at September 30  2023  compared with 4.0 months at March 31  2023 and 4.2 months at June 30  reflecting the traditional slowdown in order intake during the summer  as well as the downturn in the market environment.In other geographies  the buoyant activity in the UK is being maintained  reinforced by the successful integration of PEN Partnership and Coeus Consulting. In the US  on the other hand  Wavestone is operating in a difficult market environment  which  in recent months  has led the firm to slow down its recruitment activity in this region.Confirmation of the 2023/24 annual objectivesAt the end of the first half of the fiscal year  despite deteriorating market conditions  Wavestone confirms its financial objectives for 2023/24: to achieve organic growth at least equal to that of the 2022/23 fiscal year (+7%)  despite an unfavorable working day impact (-1.6% over the whole of the fiscal year).At full scope  integrating the effect of the full-year consolidation of PEN Partnership and Coeus Consulting  Wavestone is targeting revenue of over €580m  which represents total growth of +9% for an annual EBIT margin of about 15%.As a reminder  it should be noted that profitability over H1 of the fiscal year will be penalized by an unfavorable working day impact of -2.2%  compared with H1 of the 2022/23 fiscal year.These objectives are calculated on a constant forex basis and exclude Q_PERIOR or any other new acquisition.Progress update on the combination project between Wavestone and Q_ PERIORFollowing the announcement  on July 25  2023  of the proposed combination between Wavestone and Q_PERIOR  to create a European consulting champion[2]  the stages preceding the operation are being followed in line with the announced schedule.The contribution agreement for the contribution of Q_PERIOR shares to Wavestone was signed on October 26.The Combined General Meeting  which must decide on the operation and  in particular  on the contribution of Q_PERIOR shares and its remuneration in newly issued Wavestone shares  is convened for Tuesday  December 5  2023 at 10:00 am (CET) at Pavillon Gabriel  5 avenue Gabriel  75008 Paris.

For Accor  this is the 6th consecutive quarter of growth since the return to post-pandemic business levels. These positive trends and our strict financial and operational discipline enable us  once again  to raise our RevPAR and EBITDA guidance for the year. Sébastien Bazin  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AccorHotel demand remained very strong throughout Q3 with RevPAR up 15% compared with prior year despite a very high comparable basis (RevPAR in Q3 2022 was up 14% compared with Q3 2019).The underlying dynamics observed in previous quarters remained constant  with average price still high and a marked improvement in the occupancy rate which slightly lags the level of 2019.All regions and segments contributed through solid operating performances  even if the first signs of normalization of activity growth are materializing after several quarters of intense recovery.In third-quarter 2023  Accor opened 73 hotels  for around 9 200 rooms  and has thus achieved net unit growth of 3% over the last 12 months. At end-September 2023  the Group had a hotel portfolio of 812 425 rooms (5 537 hotels) and a pipeline of around 219 000 rooms (1 273 hotels).For 2023  the Group is confirming its forecast of net unit growth in the network between 2% and 3%.Consolidated revenueThe Group reported third-quarter 2023 revenue of €1 286 million  up 13% like-for-like (LFL) versus Q3 2022. This growth breaks down into a 13% increase for the Premium  Midscale and Economy Division and 17% for the Luxury & Lifestyle Division.Changes in the scope of consolidation  mainly due to the consolidation of Paris Society in the Luxury & Lifestyle Division (Hotel Assets & Other segment)  contributed positively by €85 million.Currency effects had a negative impact of €98 million  stemming mainly from the Australian Dollar (-11%)  the US dollar (-7%) and the Turkish Lira (-38%).— Source: AccorPremium  Midscale and Economy revenuePremium  Midscale and Economy  which includes fees from Management & Franchise (M&F)  Services to Owners and Hotel Assets & Other activities of the Group's Premium  Midscale and Economy brands  generated a revenue of €767 million  up 13% LFL versus Q3 2022. This increase is in line with the activity recovery over the period.Management & Franchise (M&F) revenue stood at €225 million  up 17% LFL versus Q3 2022 and in line with the increase in RevPAR over the period (+15%). The regional performance of Management & Franchise is detailed in the pages hereafter.Services to Owners revenue which includes the Sales  Marketing  Distribution and Loyalty activities  as well as shared services and the reimbursement of hotel staff costs  came to €279 million in Q3 2023  up 11% LFL year on year. Reimbursements of hotel personnel costs were lower than in the third quarter of 2022  which included the re-invoicing of costs incurred under the accommodation management agreement for the Football World Cup in Qatar in 2022. Services to Owners revenue excluding the reimbursements of hotel personnel costs grew at a higher pace than RevPAR growth.Hotel Assets & Other revenue was up 10% LFL relative to Q3 2022. This segment  closely linked to business in Australia  was impacted by a less favorable base effect owing to the recovery in leisure tourism which materialized earlier than in the rest of the Group.Luxury & Lifestyle revenueLuxury & Lifestyle  which includes fees from Management & Franchise (M&F)  Services to Owners and Hotel Assets & Other activities of the Group's Luxury & Lifestyle brands  generated revenue of €539 million  up 17% LFL versus Q3 2022.Management & Franchise (M&F) revenue stood at €108 million  up 11% LFL versus Q3 2022  driven by RevPAR growth. Based on the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  the Group has decided to adopt a cautious approach to the recognition of incentive fees for hotels under management contracts.Services to Owners revenue which includes the Sales  Marketing  Distribution and Loyalty activities  as well as shared services and the reimbursement of hotel staff costs  came to €343 million in Q3 2023  up 18% LFL compared with Q3 2022. The increase in revenue  higher than the RevPAR variation  reflects the greater contribution from distribution channels (notably direct and indirect web channels) on which Accor collects fees.Hotel Assets & Other revenue was up 20% LFL relative to Q3 2022.

Pharnext will communicate on the progress of this final stage as soon as possible.The signature of such agreements could cover Pharnext's financing needs  and thus terminate the OCEANE-BSA financing line subscribed by Global Tech Opportunities 13.In order to give the company the financial comfort needed to negotiate such an agreement  Pharnext's two financial partners  Néovacs and Global Tech Opportunities 13  each agreed to postpone the deadline of their respective financing agreements to December 2024. The other terms of the financing agreements remain unchanged  and Pharnext will not incur any financial penalties as a result of the extension.Hugo Brugière  Manager of Pharnext  said: ""This is a spectacular change in the paradigm that we have been cautiously hoping for. Not only does the new offer come from a pharmaceutical with a world-renowned reputation in neurology and immunology  it's also doubly worthwhile. In the short term  with potential payments as early as 2023 of €80m. In the medium term  with an overall valuation of over €500m  which is way higher than previous offers.It is therefore with serenity  and thanks to the unwavering support of Neovacs and GTO13  that we enter this final stretch of discussions to finalize an agreement and focus on our mission: to bring to market as quickly as possible a medical solution for millions of suffering patients and families.""About Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A ('CMT1A')Charcot-Marie-Tooth ('CMT') disease encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited  severe  debilitating  progressive and chronic peripheral neuropathies. CMT1A  the most common type of CMT  is an orphan disease with a prevalence of 1/5000 people affecting about 150 000 people in Europe and the U.S. and about 1 500 000 people worldwide. The genetic mutation responsible for CMT1A is a duplication of the PMP22 gene coding for a peripheral myelin protein. The duplication of this gene results in overexpression of the PMP22 protein and failure of Schwann cells to produce normal myelin (neuronal sheath). The lack of a normal myelin structure and function leads to abnormal peripheral nerve conduction and axonal loss. As a result of peripheral nerve degradation  patients suffer from progressive muscle atrophy in both the legs and arms causing problems with walking  running and balance as well as abnormal hand functioning. They might also suffer from mild to moderate sensory disorders. First symptoms usually appear during adolescence and will progressively evolve throughout life. Patients with the most severe form of CMT1A end up in wheelchairs  representing at least 5% of cases. To date  no curative or symptomatic medications have been approved and treatment consists of supportive care such as orthotics  leg braces  physical and occupational therapy or surgery. More information can be found at https://pharnext.com/en/disease/charcot-marie-tooth.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions. Pharnext has a first-in-class drug candidate  PXT3003  in development for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)  a rare  debilitating  inherited peripheral neuropathy. PXT3003 benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. In 2018  PXT3003 completed a Phase III clinical trial  the PLEO-CMT trial  with encouraging topline results. This trial was followed by an open-label extension study  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial  with 120 patients continuing treatment with PXT3003. Long-term data suggest a sustained benefit  safety  and efficacy  after 6 years of total trial time. An international pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003  the PREMIER trial  enrolling 387 CMT1A patients was completed in August 2023. PREMIER topline results are expected in Q4 2023. PXT3003 originated from the Pleotherapy™ R&D approach. Pharnext draws the attention of investors to the financial and other risk factors detailed in its financial reports.

Pharnext will communicate on the progress of this final stage as soon as possible.The signature of such agreements could cover Pharnext's financing needs  and thus terminate the OCEANE-BSA financing line subscribed by Global Tech Opportunities 13.In order to give the company the financial comfort needed to negotiate such an agreement  Pharnext's two financial partners  Néovacs and Global Tech Opportunities 13  each agreed to postpone the deadline of their respective financing agreements to December 2024. The other terms of the financing agreements remain unchanged  and Pharnext will not incur any financial penalties as a result of the extension.Hugo Brugière  Manager of Pharnext  said: “This is a spectacular turn that we've just dreamed of. Not only does the new offer come from a laboratory with a world-renowned reputation in neurology and immunology  it's also doubly worthwhile. In the short term  with potential payments as early as 2023 of €80m. In the medium term  with an overall valuation of over €500m  compared with  dare I say it  just over €250m for the previous offers.It is therefore with serenity  and thanks to the unwavering support of Neovacs and GTO13  that we enter this final stretch of discussions to finalize an agreement and focus on our mission: to bring to market as quickly as possible a medical solution for millions of suffering patients and families.”About Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A (‘CMT1A')Charcot-Marie-Tooth (‘CMT') disease encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited  severe  debilitating  progressive and chronic peripheral neuropathies. CMT1A  the most common type of CMT  is an orphan disease with a prevalence of 1/5000 people affecting about 150 000 people in Europe and the U.S. and about 1 500 000 people worldwide. The genetic mutation responsible for CMT1A is a duplication of the PMP22 gene coding for a peripheral myelin protein. The duplication of this gene results in overexpression of the PMP22 protein and failure of Schwann cells to produce normal myelin (neuronal sheath). The lack of a normal myelin structure and function leads to abnormal peripheral nerve conduction and axonal loss. As a result of peripheral nerve degradation  patients suffer from progressive muscle atrophy in both the legs and arms causing problems with walking  running and balance as well as abnormal hand functioning. They might also suffer from mild to moderate sensory disorders. First symptoms usually appear during adolescence and will progressively evolve throughout life. Patients with the most severe form of CMT1A end up in wheelchairs  representing at least 5% of cases. To date  no curative or symptomatic medications have been approved and treatment consists of supportive care such as orthotics  leg braces  physical and occupational therapy or surgery.

Pharnext has a first-in-class drug candidate  PXT3003  in development for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)  a rare  debilitating  inherited peripheral neuropathy. PXT3003 benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. In 2018  PXT3003 completed a Phase III clinical trial  the PLEO-CMT trial  with encouraging topline results. This trial was followed by an open-label extension study  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial  with 120 patients continuing treatment with PXT3003. Long-term data suggest a sustained benefit  safety  and efficacy  after 6 years of total trial time. An international pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003  the PREMIER trial  enrolling 387 CMT1A patients was completed in August 2023. PREMIER topline results are expected in Q4 2023.

As demonstrated by the recent sales of the Ikoniscope20max  our ability to transform R&D investments into concrete commercial advances is well proven and we will continue to work hard in order to anticipate future needs in cancer diagnostics and continue to provide best-in-class solutions to laboratories and through them to all the people that in the years have been tested using one of our instruments.""Mario Crovetto  CEO of Ikonisys  said: ""The first half of 2023 and the following months have been characterized by working on the company's market penetration strategy. The final development of the Ikoniscope20max in late 2022 and the following installations in the USA have been an important milestone to start substituting the existing ""generation 1"" Ikoniscopes and initiate discussions with prospects that needed a high-volume instrument. In July we had the confirmation of the excellence of the Ikoniscope20max solution  that was flawlessly integrated in the workflows of the laboratories where it was installed. Moreover  in order to be able to provide our customers with a complete solution from processing to analysis (including reagents) we are in advanced discussion with industry players with presence both in USA and in Europe. We believe providing an end-to-end platform will be very beneficial for Ikonisys and could significantly boost our sales and our market presence in the main markets.Details of the main changes in the financial statementsOn a year-over-year basis  total revenues increased by 32%  mainly because of an increase in ""other income"" (items not directly related to the sale of Ikoniscope20) compared to H1 2022. The net sales slightly decreased because of the sales cycle of the Ikoniscope20max  that started being installed in Q2 2023.While General & Administrative Expenses decreased from €501k in H1 2022 to €405k in H1 2023  the total amount of the Operating Expenses slightly increased from €1 149k in H1 2022 to €1 159k in H1 2023. This is due to an increase in depreciation and amortization. In fact  starting from the beginning of 2023  capitalized R&D costs for the Ikoniscope20max started being amortized. We remind that capitalized R&D costs for the Ikoniscope20 started being amortized in 2022.The increase in total revenues and the very limited increase of operating expenses led to a slightly improved net loss equivalent to €968k  a 5% decrease with respect to a net loss of €1 021k over the same period in 2022.The consolidated cash position as of June 30  2023 amounts to €66k  compared to €93k as of December 31  2022. It should be noted that this position does not include the €0.5m financing by LPEfund of Columbia Threadneedle Investment announced on August 2  2023 and the financing facility for a total amount of €5.1m established with Atlas Capital Markets on October 5  2022.Strategy and outlookBuilding on the successes achieved in the past 2 years  Ikonisys plans to continue to ramp up its global marketing strategy  following also the way of strategic partnerships.The successful beginning of the commercialization of the high-volume Ikoniscope20max solution in reference laboratories is the first step to reach high-volume  national customers  that could easily see the importance of adding full automation to their workflow. In this context Ikonisys aims to prove a full solution to its customer  positioning itself as a turnkey solution provider to the many oncology diagnostics laboratories in Europe and USA.The support by renowned partners such as the University of Connecticut in the United States (immune-oncology)  the Sheba Medical Center in Israel (Circulating Tumor Cells)  and Polytechnic of Milan in Italy (AI) has helped the company in pushing forward its cutting-edge technology. This strong network is allowing the company to enhance its development activities and will serve as a catalyst to address future markets. The aim of the company is moving even more into the personalized medicine  thanks to its advancements in artificial intelligence and in the ability to find rare cells such as CTC circulating in patients' blood (or  possibly  other bio fluids).The clear lack of fully automated systems and the ongoing trend that is seeing a decrease in the number of active pathologists continue to show that Ikonisys is perfectly positioned to meet the needs of users and become an important player in the oncology arena.The half-year financial report for 2023 will be available  on Monday October 30  in the Investors section of the Ikonisys website.3/4",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.66,0.19,0.15,True,English,"['Ikonisys S A', 'Inside Information', 'News release', 'accounts', 'results', 'October', '04', 'Integrated Gulf Biosystems Group', 'unique fully automated solution', 'routine clinical testing', 'international shareholders base', 'R&D side', 'R&D investments', 'R&D costs', 'Columbia Threadneedle Investment', 'Middle East Markets', 'Atlas Capital Markets', 'Neag Cancer Center', 'Circulating Tumor Cells', 'existing ""generation 1"" Ikoniscopes', 'concrete commercial advances', 'global marketing strategy', 'Euronext Growth Paris', '€0.5m private Note', 'market penetration strategy', 'LPE II fund', 'medical analysis laboratories', 'main markets', 'rare cells', 'private placement', 'existing application', 'cancer diagnostics', '€0.5m financing', 'commercial strategy', 'complete solution', 'commercial development', 'development strategy', 'financial results', 'first half', 'net loss', 'important developments', 'recent past', 'UConn School', 'new financing', 'Successful deployment', 'internal validation', 'first instrument', 'deep learning', 'first outcome', 'new applications', 'advanced projects', 'future needs', 'class solutions', 'Mario Crovetto', 'following months', 'final development', 'following installations', 'important milestone', 'high-volume instrument', 'advanced discussion', 'industry players', 'main changes', 'financial statements', 'other income', 'Administrative Expenses', 'total amount', 'Operating Expenses', 'same period', 'financing facility', 'Ikoniscope20max solution', 'First sales', 'Ikoniscope20 solutions', 'recent sales', 'total revenues', 'net sales', 'sales cycle', 'accurate detection', 'Ikoniscope platform', 'second sale', 'end platform', 'market presence', 'year basis', 'cash position', 'past 2 years', 'Successful completion', 'Ikonisys SA', 'limited increase', 'Distribution Collaboration', 'October', '07:30 a', 'CET', 'ALIKO', 'company', 'early', 'cancers', 'June', 'Board', 'Directors', 'update', 'business', 'respect', 'H1', 'study', 'Medicine', 'power', 'extremely', 'field', 'issuance', 'Signing', 'India', 'Expansion', 'Europe', 'beginning', 'commercialization', 'addition', 'fine-tuning', 'Polytechnic', 'Milano', 'creation', 'CTC', 'immuno-oncology', 'ability', 'order', 'people', 'instruments', 'CEO', 'late', 'USA', 'discussions', 'prospects', 'July', 'confirmation', 'excellence', 'workflows', 'customers', 'processing', 'reagents', 'Details', 'items', 'Q2', 'General', 'depreciation', 'amortization', 'fact', '5% decrease', 'December', 'August', 'successes']",2023-10-30,2023-10-31,marketscreener.com

Faced with the anticipated increase in losses  the support of the shareholders will enable the Group to continue as a going concern.14% of revenue growth in H1Revenues for the first half of the year came to €2 744k  up 14% compared with the first half of 2022 (€2 397k).Staff costs rose from €2 117k to €2 462k (+16%)  reflecting both inflation and the mobilisation of resources to win new key account customers. The average number of employees rose from 47 to 51 between H1 2022 and H1 2023.After a slight increase in external expenses (€1 011k vs. €951k)  mainly in the Medtech division  EBITDA came to €(1 561)k  compared with €(955)k in the first half of 2022.R&D efforts are continuing  and the corresponding personnel costs and external expenses rose by 15% over the first half  to €1 311k  split roughly between Foodtech (40%) and Medtech (60%).Operating income for the first half was €(1 531)k  compared with €(1 244)k  with stable depreciation charges and other operating income linked to the partial capitalisation of the European subsidy obtained in 2022 for the Medtech segment.As net financial expenses were higher than last year  given the increase in financial debt  net profit came to €(2 010)k  compared with €(1 295)k in the first half of 2022.Foodtech: substantial advances with key accountsThe Foodtech business supplies the food  beverage and packaging industries with solutions for measuring smell  taste and vision.In the first half of 2023  substantial advances were made in this business  notably:A return to growth   after a 2022 slowdown caused by a lacklustre economic environment and the components crisis.  after a 2022 slowdown caused by a lacklustre economic environment and the components crisis.

This enables Alpha MOS to offer manufacturers in the sector a combined range of equipment  associated services and team support  and to meet the need for technological developments in equipment  processes and staff. Continued growth in recurring revenues  based on a very broad mix of offerings: TAAS (Testing as a Service)  support contracts  consumables linked to large-scale rollouts  and research. Recurring revenues accounted for 30% of sales in the first half  compared with 26% for the full year 2022 and 21% in 2021.Foodtech (€'000) H1 2023 H1 2022 Revenues 2 744 2 397 Other income from ordinary activities 241 160 Changes in inventories and finished goods 12 129 Purchases -1 176 -736 Staff costs -2 089 -1 765 External expenses -752 -743 Tax and duties -28 -25 Other current operating expenses 4 -49 EBITDA -1 044 -632Geographically  the USA's share of sales remains stable compared with 2022  at 24%. The EMEA region is slightly down  at 29% compared with 31% in 2022  to the benefit of the Asia region.Despite the 14% rise in sales  the gross margin for the business did not increase  coming in at €1 821k  giving a margin rate of 66%  compared with €1 950k a year earlier. This temporary fall in the margin rate was due to unfavourable effects on exchange rate and inventories of finished products from one year to the next.After higher staff costs (see above) and stable external costs  EBITDA came to €(1 044)k  compared with €(632)k in the first half of 2022.Medtech: conclusion of the 2nd clinical studyDuring the first half of this year  BOYDSense completed the 2nd clinical trial of its non-invasive breath glucose monitoring device on schedule. The study  promoted by Toulouse University Hospital (CHU) and launched in late 2021 by the Diabetology  Metabolic Diseases and Nutrition research team  involved 130 patients with type 2 diabetes. The results will be the subject of scientific publications by the CHU and BOYDSense researchers in the coming months.Pending publication of more detailed results  BOYDSense can already announce that the clinical study has met its objectives  namely to:Establish successful system with functional testing;Confirm patients' interest in this new device  as illustrated by the number and enthusiasm of study participants;Validate previous developments;Gather new data that has helped improve the algorithms since the beginning of the test phase.BOYDSense has also been selected to present its work at the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes conference in Berlin in February 2023.Medtech (€'000) H1 2023 H1 2022 Revenues Other income from ordinary activities 234 389 Changes in inventories and finished goods Purchases -25 -150 Staff costs -373 -352 External expenses -259 -208 Tax and duties -2 -2 Other current operating expenses -92 EBITDA -517 -323EBITDA for the Medtech business was slightly down in the first half of 2023  at €(517) k compared with €(323) k a year earlier  due to the increase in external expenses and other current expenses associated with the clinical study.Financial positionWith net profit of €(2 010)k for the first half  shareholders' equity stood at €(5 678)k at the end of June.The change in cash and cash equivalents over the period was €(2 396)k  due to the impact of the net profit and a €0.8m increase in working capital requirements  mainly relating to trade receivables  which has since been cleared. Financial debt net of cash was €5 190k at 30 June  comprising €5 974k in financial debt (excluding lease obligations  €752k) and €784k in cash.This level of cash is not sufficient to finance the Company's operational development plan over the next twelve months  and in particular the needs associated with the continued development of the MedTech project. The Company is considering various options to strengthen its financial structure  with particular emphasis on obtaining external financing to fund this plan.The Company has drawn up a scenario in the event that these operations do not materialise. Management has examined the cash flow forecasts arising from this scenario  taking into account the support  limited in amount  to which the Jolt Targeted Opportunities FPCI managed by Jolt Capital and Ambrosia Investments AM have committed  as well as their undertaking not to request the repayment of oustanding current-accounts.On this basis  management has adopted the going concern assumption for the financial statements to 30 June 2023.OutlookAlpha MOS confirms the success of discussions with a number of major accounts in China  North America and Europe. This could enable the Company to roll out its solutions more rapidly over the coming years.The product mix continues to evolve favourably  with the ongoing development of the range of services and consumables  which amount to recurring sales  and the launch of new offerings. The agreement with Australia's Agrigate  for the creation of new sensory sensors for long-distance milk transport  illustrates the Group's capacity for innovation and increased visibility in various growth sectors of the agri-food industry.The objective of organic sales growth has therefore been reaffirmed for the current year.As regards the Medtech division and the BOYDSense subsidiary  the conclusion this year of the clinical study and the nature of the preliminary results should make it easier to obtain the funding needed to continue work on marketing the glucose monitoring device for people with diabetes.Availability of the Interim Financial ReportThe Interim Financial Report is being made available to the public today and has been filed with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF).
