32065,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://euobserver.com/opinion/157633,[Opinion] Can G7 make Russia pay for reconstruction of Ukraine?,While seizing Russian assets for Ukraine's reconstruction seems a logical option  it presents legal challenges and potential risks to the monetary system. Alternative approaches  such as seizing the proceeds generated by frozen assets  are being considered by…,"A joint assessment by the government of Ukraine  the World Bank  the European Commission and the United Nations of March 2023 estimated that the cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine would amount to $411bn [€385bn]. This would be more than 2.5 times the 2022 Ukrainian GDP. Since nine months have gone by since the publication of the analysis  the figure is most likely higher now. Who will fund this huge amount?The answer seems to be pretty logical and straightforward: it should be the one inflicting the damage  i.e. Russia. This is indeed in line with the resolution passed by the UN on 14 November 2022  according to which under international law  Russia will owe Ukraine reparations for the unprovoked war.It is estimated that there are €125bn of Russian assets are held in Belgium-based Euroclear (Photo: Benoit)As part of the sanctions a group of countries has imposed on Russia  more than $300bn of Russian sovereign assets held abroad have been frozen. A vast majority of these assets consist of deposits made by the Russian Central Bank and more than €200bn are held in EU financial institutions  €125bn in Belgium-based Euroclear.A possible solution raised by some experts to fit the bill of the reconstruction costs in Ukraine would entail the outright confiscation and repurposing of Russian assets to Ukraine.Indeed  a report by a group of legal experts and commissioned by Garry Kasparov argues that such a proposal would be legally feasible and refers to a similar precedent  when President George H. Bush transferred Iraq's frozen assets in the US to the UN Compensation Commission for victims of Iraqi aggression.Although on this occasion the US has somehow already tested this avenue with privately-owned assets  by for instance transferring to Ukraine more than $5m of forfeited assets of Russian Oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev  further expanding such a possibility to sovereign assets would raise a number of legal doubts  as conveyed by the US treasury secretary  Janet Yellen.Moreover  since the assets to be seized belong to the Russian Central Bank  some experts indicate the stability of the monetary system could be put at risk and even the international role of the currencies of the sanctioning jurisdictions could be harmed.Besides  there has not been significant progress in approving legislation introduced in June 2023 by a group of bipartisan US senators and representatives to grant the president of the US the authority to confiscate Russian sovereign assets that have been frozen in the United States and transfer them to assist in Ukraine's reconstruction efforts.A similar bill is being discussed in Canadian parliament: while Canada can at present seize the assets of Russian citizens and companies by court order  it does not have the legal means to do so with sovereign assets of offending states  which benefit from immunity.Since seizing Russian sovereign assets seems to raise legal doubts  another idea has been put forward: seizing the proceeds generated by these frozen assets  leaving the underlying principal untouched.As an example  Euroclear has already generated €1.7bn in profits in the first half of this year from reinvesting Russian securities as they reach maturity. This proposal has been reflected in the G7 statement of ministers of finance and central bank governors of 12 October 2023  which states that G7 countries ""will explore how any extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from immobilised Russian sovereign assets  where those extraordinary revenues are not required to meet obligations towards Russia under applicable laws  could be directed to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction in compliance with applicable laws"".After pledging to fund a high proportion of the reconstruction costs of Ukraine  the EU is most interested in finding alternative funding sources. Otherwise  the EU budget could be severely strained and the financing of the green and digital transitions could be hindered.Sign up for EUobserver’s daily newsletter All the stories we publish  sent at 7.30 AM.

The European Council calls on the high representative and the commission to accelerate work with a view to submitting proposals"".By the time of writing this piece  a proposal has not been tabled yet and technical work is still ongoing.Western allies should proceed with a very prudent approach. While seizing Russian assets and using them for the reconstruction of Ukraine seems to be a logical and even ethical avenue to follow  it also needs to fully abide by all international and national legal standards. Replying to an unlawful physical aggression with potentially unlawful financial actions does not seem advisable for democratic societies.Thus  all the precautions and deep legal analyses currently undertaken by G7 members seem the right way forward. If a legal solution is found for the confiscation and rechanneling of assets' proceeds  even if the amounts will probably be far from substantially contributing to fitting the bill of the reconstruction  a staggered approach before possibly moving to the confiscation of underlying assets is adequate.",neutral,0.03,0.94,0.03,negative,0.05,0.2,0.75,True,English,"['Opinion', 'G7', 'Russia', 'reconstruction', 'Ukraine', 'Russian Oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev', 'President George H.

If Holders validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Time but at or prior to the applicable Expiration Time  Holders will only be eligible to receive the applicable Tender Offer Consideration plus accrued interest. ab-inbev.com Press release - 31 October 2023 - 4Notes tendered may be withdrawn at or prior to  but not after  5:00 p.m. New York City time  on 14 November 2023 (such date and time  as it may be extended with respect to a series of Notes  the ""Withdrawal Deadline""). The Tender Offers are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  as set forth in the Offer to Purchase. The Companies will only accept for purchase Notes up to a combined aggregate purchase price (excluding accrued and unpaid interest) that will not exceed the Aggregate Offer Cap and each of the Pool Offer Caps. The Pool 2 Offer Cap will initially be calculated on the basis of the Pool 1 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or before the Early Tender Time  subject to the Pool 1 Offer Cap; provided however that if neither the Aggregate Offer Cap nor the Pool 1 Offer Cap have been reached as at the Early Tender Time  the Pool 2 Offer Cap will then be calculated again following the Expiration Time on the basis of all Pool 1 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Pool 1 Tender Offers  subject to the Pool 1 Offer Cap (but without prejudice to the fact that Notes tendered at or before the Early Tender Time will have priority over Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time  regardless of the Acceptance Priority Levels and whether such Notes are Pool 1 Notes or Pool 2 Notes). Subject to applicable law  the Companies reserve the right  but are under no obligation  to increase or decrease the Aggregate Offer Cap  the Pool 1 Offer Cap and/or the Pool 2 Offer Cap in respect of the Tender Offers at any time (without extending the Withdrawal Deadline or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights of Holders)  which could result in the Companies purchasing a greater aggregate principal amount of Notes in the Tender Offers. The purchase of any series of Notes is not conditioned upon the purchase of any other series of Notes. Any Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Tender Offers and accepted for purchase will be purchased by the Companies based on the applicable Pool Offer Cap and the Aggregate Offer Cap and the acceptance priority levels within each of the Pool 1 Tender Offers and the Pool 2 Tender Offers noted above (the ""Acceptance Priority Levels"")  each as more fully described in the Offer to Purchase. With respect to each of the Tender Offers  if the purchase of all validly tendered Notes would result in an aggregate purchase price greater than the applicable Pool Offer Cap  then such Tender Offer will be oversubscribed and if the Companies accept Notes in such Tender Offer  any Notes accepted for purchase in the lowest Acceptance Priority Level in which Notes are accepted for purchase will be accepted for tender on a prorated basis.

The purchase of any series of Notes is not conditioned upon the purchase of any other series of Notes. Any Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Tender Offers and accepted for purchase will be purchased by the Companies based on the applicable Pool Offer Cap and the Aggregate Offer Cap and the acceptance priority levels within each of the Pool 1 Tender Offers and the Pool 2 Tender Offers noted above (the ""Acceptance Priority Levels"")  each as more fully described in the Offer to Purchase. With respect to each of the Tender Offers  if the purchase of all validly tendered Notes would result in an aggregate purchase price greater than the applicable Pool Offer Cap  then such Tender Offer will be oversubscribed and if the Companies accept Notes in such Tender Offer  any Notes accepted for purchase in the lowest Acceptance Priority Level in which Notes are accepted for purchase will be accepted for tender on a prorated basis. For the avoidance of doubt  Notes tendered at or before the Early Tender Time will have priority over Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time  regardless of the Acceptance Priority Levels of such Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time and whether such Notes are Pool 1 Notes or Pool 2 Notes. If any of the applicable Pool Offer Caps are reached at the Early Tender Time  then no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time in such Tender Offer will be purchased unless the Companies increase the applicable Pool Offer Cap. If the Aggregate Offer Cap is reached at the Early Tender Time  then no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time will be purchased unless the Companies increase the Aggregate Offer Cap and the applicable Pool Offer Cap. ab-inbev.com Press release - 31 October 2023 - 5Holders of Notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Time and that are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable ""Total Consideration""  which includes the Early Tender Payment for the applicable series of Notes set forth in the table above. Holders of any Notes that are validly tendered after the Early Tender Time but at or before the Expiration Time and that are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Payment. The Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Payment is referred to as the ""Tender Offer Consideration"". Holders are advised to check with any bank  securities broker or other intermediary through which they hold their Notes as to when such intermediary needs to receive instructions from a holder in order for that holder to be able to participate in the Tender Offers before the deadlines specified herein and in the Offer to Purchase. The deadlines set by the clearing system for the submission and withdrawal of tender instructions will also be earlier than the relevant deadlines specified herein and in the Offer to Purchase. Holders holding GBP Notes or EUR Notes directly in the NBB-SSS or through a direct participant of the NBB-SSS (other than Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg) must  in order to be eligible to participate in the Tender Offers in the manner specified in the Offer to Purchase  (i) arrange for the GBP Notes or EUR Notes which they wish to tender to be transferred to an account in either Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  and (ii) maintain  or where relevant  procure  access to an account in either Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg through which such GBP Notes or EUR Notes can be traded  and to which the Total Consideration or the Tender Offer Consideration (as applicable) and the applicable accrued interest payment may be credited by AB InBev. Holders of GBP Notes or EUR Notes who do not have access to an account  as described above  in either Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg (either directly or through a direct participant or other intermediary)  or who do not transfer the GBP Notes or EUR Notes which they wish to tender to a direct participant in either clearing system  will not be able to submit a GBP/EUR Tender Instruction (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) to the Tender and Information Agent and will not be eligible to participate in the Tender Offers in the manner specified in the Offer to Purchase. Any Holder of GBP Notes or EUR Notes who (i) holds its GBP Notes or EUR Notes directly  or through a direct participant of the NBB-SSS  in an ""N account"" within the NBB-SSS  (ii) is not eligible  in accordance with Article 4 of the Belgian Royal Decree of 26 May 1994  to hold its Notes (directly or indirectly) in an ""X account"" within the NBB-SSS  and who is therefore unable to transfer the relevant Notes to an account in either Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg and (iii) who is eligible to view the Offer to Purchase and make an investment decision with respect to the Tender Offers  may contact the Tender and Information Agent for further information  using the contact details set out below. ab-inbev.com Press release - 31 October 2023 - 6English  Dutch and French versions of this press release will be available on www.ab- inbev.com.

If Holders validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Time but at or prior to the applicable Expiration Time  Holders will only be eligible to receive the applicable Tender Offer Consideration plus accrued interest. ab-inbev.com Press release - 31 October 2023 - 4Notes tendered may be withdrawn at or prior to  but not after  5:00 p.m. New York City time  on 14 November 2023 (such date and time  as it may be extended with respect to a series of Notes  the ""Withdrawal Deadline""). The Tender Offers are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  as set forth in the Offer to Purchase. The Companies will only accept for purchase Notes up to a combined aggregate purchase price (excluding accrued and unpaid interest) that will not exceed the Aggregate Offer Cap and each of the Pool Offer Caps. The Pool 2 Offer Cap will initially be calculated on the basis of the Pool 1 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or before the Early Tender Time  subject to the Pool 1 Offer Cap; provided however that if neither the Aggregate Offer Cap nor the Pool 1 Offer Cap have been reached as at the Early Tender Time  the Pool 2 Offer Cap will then be calculated again following the Expiration Time on the basis of all Pool 1 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Pool 1 Tender Offers  subject to the Pool 1 Offer Cap (but without prejudice to the fact that Notes tendered at or before the Early Tender Time will have priority over Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time  regardless of the Acceptance Priority Levels and whether such Notes are Pool 1 Notes or Pool 2 Notes). Subject to applicable law  the Companies reserve the right  but are under no obligation  to increase or decrease the Aggregate Offer Cap  the Pool 1 Offer Cap and/or the Pool 2 Offer Cap in respect of the Tender Offers at any time (without extending the Withdrawal Deadline or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights of Holders)  which could result in the Companies purchasing a greater aggregate principal amount of Notes in the Tender Offers. The purchase of any series of Notes is not conditioned upon the purchase of any other series of Notes. Any Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Tender Offers and accepted for purchase will be purchased by the Companies based on the applicable Pool Offer Cap and the Aggregate Offer Cap and the acceptance priority levels within each of the Pool 1 Tender Offers and the Pool 2 Tender Offers noted above (the ""Acceptance Priority Levels"")  each as more fully described in the Offer to Purchase. With respect to each of the Tender Offers  if the purchase of all validly tendered Notes would result in an aggregate purchase price greater than the applicable Pool Offer Cap  then such Tender Offer will be oversubscribed and if the Companies accept Notes in such Tender Offer  any Notes accepted for purchase in the lowest Acceptance Priority Level in which Notes are accepted for purchase will be accepted for tender on a prorated basis. For the avoidance of doubt  Notes tendered at or before the Early Tender Time will have priority over Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time  regardless of the Acceptance Priority Levels of such Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time and whether such Notes are Pool 1 Notes or Pool 2 Notes. If any of the applicable Pool Offer Caps are reached at the Early Tender Time  then no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time in such Tender Offer will be purchased unless the Companies increase the applicable Pool Offer Cap. If the Aggregate Offer Cap is reached at the Early Tender Time  then no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time will be purchased unless the Companies increase the Aggregate Offer Cap and the applicable Pool Offer Cap. ab-inbev.com Press release - 31 October 2023 - 5Holders of Notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Time and that are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable ""Total Consideration""  which includes the Early Tender Payment for the applicable series of Notes set forth in the table above. Holders of any Notes that are validly tendered after the Early Tender Time but at or before the Expiration Time and that are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Payment. The Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Payment is referred to as the ""Tender Offer Consideration"". Holders are advised to check with any bank  securities broker or other intermediary through which they hold their Notes as to when such intermediary needs to receive instructions from a holder in order for that holder to be able to participate in the Tender Offers before the deadlines specified herein and in the Offer to Purchase. The deadlines set by the clearing system for the submission and withdrawal of tender instructions will also be earlier than the relevant deadlines specified herein and in the Offer to Purchase. Holders holding GBP Notes or EUR Notes directly in the NBB-SSS or through a direct participant of the NBB-SSS (other than Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg) must  in order to be eligible to participate in the Tender Offers in the manner specified in the Offer to Purchase  (i) arrange for the GBP Notes or EUR Notes which they wish to tender to be transferred to an account in either Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  and (ii) maintain  or where relevant  procure  access to an account in either Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg through which such GBP Notes or EUR Notes can be traded  and to which the Total Consideration or the Tender Offer Consideration (as applicable) and the applicable accrued interest payment may be credited by AB InBev. Holders of GBP Notes or EUR Notes who do not have access to an account  as described above  in either Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg (either directly or through a direct participant or other intermediary)  or who do not transfer the GBP Notes or EUR Notes which they wish to tender to a direct participant in either clearing system  will not be able to submit a GBP/EUR Tender Instruction (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) to the Tender and Information Agent and will not be eligible to participate in the Tender Offers in the manner specified in the Offer to Purchase.

Holders must validly tender their Notes prior to 5:00 p.m.  New York City time  on 14 November 2023 (such date and time  as it may be extended with respect to a series of Notes  the ""Early Tender Time"")  to be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration (as defined below) which includes an amount in cash (the ""Early Tender Payment"") equal to the applicable amount set forth in the table above under the heading ""Early Tender Payment "" plus accrued interest. If Holders validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Time but at or prior to the applicable Expiration Time  Holders will only be eligible to receive the applicable Tender Offer Consideration plus accrued interest. ab-inbev.com Press release - 31 October 2023 - 4Notes tendered may be withdrawn at or prior to  but not after  5:00 p.m. New York City time  on 14 November 2023 (such date and time  as it may be extended with respect to a series of Notes  the ""Withdrawal Deadline""). The Tender Offers are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  as set forth in the Offer to Purchase. The Companies will only accept for purchase Notes up to a combined aggregate purchase price (excluding accrued and unpaid interest) that will not exceed the Aggregate Offer Cap and each of the Pool Offer Caps. The Pool 2 Offer Cap will initially be calculated on the basis of the Pool 1 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or before the Early Tender Time  subject to the Pool 1 Offer Cap; provided however that if neither the Aggregate Offer Cap nor the Pool 1 Offer Cap have been reached as at the Early Tender Time  the Pool 2 Offer Cap will then be calculated again following the Expiration Time on the basis of all Pool 1 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Pool 1 Tender Offers  subject to the Pool 1 Offer Cap (but without prejudice to the fact that Notes tendered at or before the Early Tender Time will have priority over Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time  regardless of the Acceptance Priority Levels and whether such Notes are Pool 1 Notes or Pool 2 Notes). Subject to applicable law  the Companies reserve the right  but are under no obligation  to increase or decrease the Aggregate Offer Cap  the Pool 1 Offer Cap and/or the Pool 2 Offer Cap in respect of the Tender Offers at any time (without extending the Withdrawal Deadline or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights of Holders)  which could result in the Companies purchasing a greater aggregate principal amount of Notes in the Tender Offers. The purchase of any series of Notes is not conditioned upon the purchase of any other series of Notes. Any Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Tender Offers and accepted for purchase will be purchased by the Companies based on the applicable Pool Offer Cap and the Aggregate Offer Cap and the acceptance priority levels within each of the Pool 1 Tender Offers and the Pool 2 Tender Offers noted above (the ""Acceptance Priority Levels"")  each as more fully described in the Offer to Purchase. With respect to each of the Tender Offers  if the purchase of all validly tendered Notes would result in an aggregate purchase price greater than the applicable Pool Offer Cap  then such Tender Offer will be oversubscribed and if the Companies accept Notes in such Tender Offer  any Notes accepted for purchase in the lowest Acceptance Priority Level in which Notes are accepted for purchase will be accepted for tender on a prorated basis. For the avoidance of doubt  Notes tendered at or before the Early Tender Time will have priority over Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time  regardless of the Acceptance Priority Levels of such Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time and whether such Notes are Pool 1 Notes or Pool 2 Notes. If any of the applicable Pool Offer Caps are reached at the Early Tender Time  then no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time in such Tender Offer will be purchased unless the Companies increase the applicable Pool Offer Cap. If the Aggregate Offer Cap is reached at the Early Tender Time  then no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time will be purchased unless the Companies increase the Aggregate Offer Cap and the applicable Pool Offer Cap. ab-inbev.com Press release - 31 October 2023 - 5Holders of Notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Time and that are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable ""Total Consideration""  which includes the Early Tender Payment for the applicable series of Notes set forth in the table above. Holders of any Notes that are validly tendered after the Early Tender Time but at or before the Expiration Time and that are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Payment. The Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Payment is referred to as the ""Tender Offer Consideration"".

It brings together a range of important themes showing the breadth of contemporary practice  such as feminist histories and performance  de-colonial histories  contemporary conflict and displacement and indigenous rights. We are looking forward to seeing this work at The Photographers’ Gallery in 2024. Shoair Mavlian  Director of The Photographers’ Gallery This long-standing annual Prize  originally established in 1996  identifies and rewards artists for their projects that have made a significant contribution to photography over the previous 12 months.Over its 27-year history  the Prize has become renowned as one of the most important international awards for photographers  spotlighting outstanding  innovative and thought provoking work. The 2024 shortlisted projects all critically engage with urgent concerns  from the remnants of war and conflict  experiences of diasporic communities and decolonisation  to contested land  heritage  equality and gender. Together these artists demonstrate photography’s unique capacity to reveal what is invisible  forgotten or marginalised and imagine a path to redress.The annual exhibition of shortlisted projects will be on show at The Photographers’ Gallery  London from 23rd February to 2nd June 2024. The exhibition will then be on display from 15th June to 15th September 2024 at the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation in Eschborn/Frankfurt.The winner of the £30 000 prize will be announced at an award ceremony at The Photographers’ Gallery on 16th May 2024  with the other finalists each receiving £5 000. Full details of the Prize exhibition and award evening will be announced in early 2024.The 2024 shortlisted artists and projects are:VALIE EXPORT is shortlisted for the exhibition VALIE EXPORT – The Photographs at Fotomuseum Winterthur  Switzerland (25 February – 29 May 2023) and originated at the Albertina in Vienna.The Birth Madonna  after: Michelangelo Buonarroti  “Pietà” “Madonna della Febre” 1498–1501  Body position: reenact- ment  C-Print © VALIE EXPORT  Bildrecht Wien  2023VALIE EXPORT (b. 1940  Austria) became notorious from the late 1960s for her radical performances and critical examination of women’s role in society and the arts. Pointing out entrenched patriarchal structures in mass media image culture  her fearless artistic practice exposes the role representation plays in the construction of gender  sexuality and social norms.Through photographs  filmic works and installations  EXPORT deals with key issues including the body and the gaze  performance and the image  and subject and environment. Photography has played a pivotal role in her work  from documentation to multimedia installations and single works. EXPORT also often staged performances for the camera  with the intention of deconstructing the photographic gaze and its implicit power structures.For over 50 years  VALIE EXPORT has influenced generations of female artists. In groundbreaking works such as Aktionshose: Genitalpanik (Action Pants: Genital Panic  1969)  TAPP und TASTKINO (TOUCH CINEMA  1968) and Hyperbulie (Hyperbulia  1973)  EXPORT contorts  cuts and deforms her body to expose the profound social oppression of women – a theme that continues to resonate today.Gauri Gill and Rajesh Vangad are shortlisted for the book Fields of Sight (2023)  publishedby Edition Patrick Frey.Gauri Gill and Rajesh Vangad  ‘Mountains and Trees’  2014  from the series ’Fields of Sight’  2013-ongoing. © Gauri Gill and Rajesh Vangad.Through fusing photography and Warli painting  photographer Gauri Gill (b. 1970  India) and painter Rajesh Vangad (b. 1975  India) collaboratively reinvent the practice of painted photography  interweaving historical and generational painting practices into the photographic object. Their complex image dialogue addresses the politics of aesthetics  environmental destruction  memory and decolonisation.The project began in 2013 in the Adivasi village of Ganjad  Dahanu. Vangad  who grew up in this landscape  served as Gill’s knowledgeable guide. While Gill’s photographs captured the ever-changing qualities of the land  they fell short of revealing the hidden but essential elements beyond the visible. Vangad bridged this gap by embellishing Gill’s images with intricate drawings. His vivid narratives depict the multifaceted realities of Warli life in the region  from floods and droughts to family and village life  unrest and terror  spirits and myths  light and shadow. The result is a new visual record that encapsulates multiple truths and systems of knowledge.In this encyclopaedic publication  the artists challenge contemporary perspectives. They explore how viewers ascribe meaning to a place and how the act of viewing itself creates complicity. Through their creative and experimental partnership  they encourage viewers to explore the hidden  elusive layers that exist beneath the surface.Lebohang Kganye is shortlisted for the exhibition Haufi nyana? I’ve come to take you home at Foam  Amsterdam  The Netherlands (17 February – 21 May 2023).Still from Shadows of Re-memory © Lebohang KganyeCourtesy the artistLebohang Kganye’s (b. 1990  South Africa) photographic projects cross personal and collective histories. She draws from shared oral narratives and fictional texts  exploring South Africa’s layered history before  during and after apartheid and colonialism. In her vast  experimental installations  Kganye creates a space that resides between memory and fantasy. Here she collects stories from her family with excerpts from South African literature and rewrites them into theatrical scripts. Silhouettes  cut-outs  puppets  shadows and ghosts  fashioned from material found in photo albums as well as her own compositions  (re-)enact these scripts and bring them to life. The exhibition features four projects which use a complex array of media – from photographic montages in Ke Lefa Laka: Her-Story (It’s my inheritance: Her-Story  2013) to spatial installation in Mohlokomediwa Tora (Lighthouse Keeper  2018)  and film animation in Shadows of ReMemory (2021) to patchwork in Mosebetsi wa Dirithi (The Work of Shadows  2022).The exhibition’s title  “Haufi nyana?” meaning “too close?” in Sesotho  one of South Africa’s official languages  reflects the dialogue between the viewer and the artist. It touches on notions of home as heritage and identity  as well as physical and mental spaces. Her skillful blending of images and words allows her to navigate the complexity of the South African experience  opening new ways of understanding and contributing to the process of decolonisation.Hrair Sarkissian is shortlisted for the exhibition The Other Side of Silence at BonnefantenMuseum  Maastricht  The Netherlands (29 November 2022 – 14 May 2023).Hrair Sarkissian’s (b. 1973  Syria) conceptual photography focuses on deeply personal narratives that reflect the complexity of larger historical and social issues. In The Other Side of Silence  ostensibly serene landscapes and calm urban environments become stages for accounts of trauma and the expression of underlying socio-political realities. Born and raised in Syria  the grandson of Armenian genocide refugees  much of Sarkissian’s work can be seen as an exploration of the hidden emotional nuances that permeate the lives of diverse diasporic communities.Sarkissian’s practice  characterised by his austere  large-scale photographs  moving image works  sculptures  sound works and installations  oscillates between the creation of meditative dreamscapes and haunting deathscapes. In these spaces  the originally excluded muted voice is briefly offered room. Drawing from personal memories and interactions  and extensive research  Sarkissian aims to evoke emotional experiences among audiences  fostering awareness and a sense of solidarity.This mid-career overview  spanning two decades  moves through the public squares of Aleppo  Latakia and Damascus  the skies of Palmyra over modern Syria and the postindustrial landscapes of Armenia. Despite employing analogue photographic practices  Sarkissian’s images play with the vernacular possibilities of photography as a mass medium  offering the opportunity to consider what official history conceals  and the potential for re-writing it.The 2024 JuryThis year’s Jury are: Rahaab Allana  Curator/Publisher  at Alkazi Foundation for the Arts  New Delhi  India; Quentin Bajac  Director of the Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume  Paris  France; Anne-Marie Beckmann  Director of the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation  Frankfurt/Main  Germany; Laura El-Tantawy  documentary photographer; and Shoair Mavlian  Director of The Photographers’ Gallery  London  as voting Chair.Unexposed  2012 © Hrair Sarkissian Courtesy the artistThis year’s submissions for the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize once again show the power of photography to explore  investigate and interrogate our world. 2024 marks the 20th anniversary of Deutsche Börse’s partnership with The Photographers’ Gallery and the 25th anniversary of the Deutsche Börse Art Collection.

These cells also show strong anti-tumor activity against distal tumors when infused intratumorally”  said Laurent Poirot  Ph.D.  SVP Immunology at Cellectis.These pre-clinical data highlight the capability of multi-armored allogeneic CAR T-cells to preserve their activity despite the immunosuppressive microenvironment  while mitigating potential safety concerns.About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

He sees an immediat…,"Shares of BSE have rallied nearly 30% and remained unbeaten in the last eight trading sessions  helping the stock trade above all its simple moving averages (SMA). While the uptick has taken the multibagger stock into the overbought zone and a near-term correction cannot be ruled out  the stock may find a fresh impetus with the new higher transaction regime kicking in from Wednesday  November 1.BSE hit its fresh all-time high of Rs 1 912.80 on Monday. The multibagger stock has returned over 220% in the last 12 months but the rally has been more pronounced at a whopping 370% since the stock hit its 52-week low on March 28  2023. In contrast  Nifty has given returns of just over 6% on a 12-month basis while yielding 5.32% in the last six months.BSE is in a strong uptrend and still looks positive for Rs 2 000 levels and investors can look to buy it in a staggered manner  Nilesh Jain  Assistant Vice President (AVP)  Equity Research Technical and Derivatives at Centrum Broking said. He sees an immediate support at Rs 1 660.The rally in stock is accompanied by strong volumes and the current chart structure reflects a strong momentum  said VLA Ambala  a SEBI-registered Research Analyst at Stock Market Today. She is of the view that the stock may press the gas paddle once market sentiments improve. She does not rule out some correction as the recent rally has taken the stock's RSI into the overbought zone. Ambala recommends investments in the stock in a staggered way.""This stock has almost no competition as of now. Those who are convinced with its business model and demand  can surely take a chance to invest in more and if one is already in  just hold it "" Ambala said.A comparative analysis of the stocks suggests that BSE stock has outperformed stocks of several global equity exchanges  Ambala informed.Japan Exchange Group's share price returns are to the tune of 48% one a one-year basis while Germany's Deutsche Borse has experienced a 6% decline. Meanwhile  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited  Euronext NV and Nasdaq Inc have given returns of 33.21%  1.63% and 23%  respectively.""The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for BSE now stands at 48.31 times its expected earnings for the next year which is higher than MCX (44.2X)  Japan Exchange (27.8X) and the London Stock Exchange (22.9X) "" Ambala said.""BSE has performed exceptionally well YTD  with the stock up about 250% in the current year on the basis of growth prospects. From its March 2023 low of Rs 406  the stock price has more than quadrupled to approximately 1 900 levels "" Aamar Deo Singh  Senior Vice President-Equity  Commodity & Currency at Angel One said. He recommends a hold on the stock with a stop loss of Rs 1 570.Despite its strong upward trend over the past 1 year  the stock has had a steady move and traded with a 1-year beta of 1  according to Trendlyne.The recent rally in BSE shares began after the stock exchange announced an increase in transaction charges for equity derivatives  effective from November 1.""The increase in stock option tariffs ranging from 3-6.5 times of the previous charges is expected to boost the company's earnings per share by 23-30% in the fiscal years 2025-26  which is a huge leap. Furthermore  since these tariffs are still 25-40% lower than those of the NSE  there is room for further increases without the likelihood of a decrease in its business volumes "" Ambala opined.Throwing light on the current trading volumes  this analyst said that BSE accounts for 10% of the country's option turnover and 3.6% of premium turnover  and this is expected to grow as Bankex volumes improve. Currently  Bankex volumes make up less than 1% of Sensex volumes  she informed  adding that Nifty Bank futures had an edge.BSE's June quarter profit dipped 18% year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 44 crore but the quarterly revenue jumped 19% to Rs 186.9 crore. The exchange's EBITDA margin improved to 27% in the said quarter from 26% in Q1 FY22. BSE said that its average daily turnover in the equity segment decreased by 28% to Rs 4 057 crore as compared to the corresponding period last year while the equity derivatives segment decreased by 62% YoY to Rs 1.2 lakh crore.Citing reports on BSE's projected net profit of Rs 567 crore in the fiscal year 2024  Ambala said that it will be a significant increase over the previous financial year's net profit of Rs 221 crore if that happens.She puts the price target of Rs 2 420 with a view of 18 months  estimating a 27% upside  though the near-term returns could be mediocre as she places the target at Rs 1 955.The price history for BSE remains chequered though  in her view. ""With the exception of 2020 and 2021  BSE's stock has been in the negative territory every year since its listing in 2017 "" Ambala said.With a PE ratio of nearly 40 which is 3X of its sector  Ambala finds the BSE stock expensive.Another expert Reema Sonkar  Founder & Director of Minters heaps praise for BSE's resilient business model and ongoing innovations. She said that BSE emerges as a ""compelling investment opportunity"".(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel (Disclaimer: Recommendations  suggestions  views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The trust that Atari showed our team  and our clear mutual love and respect for the content  positioned us to produce something truly remarkable. I know Atari will continue to champion our approach and that we will be bringing fans exciting new projects for years to come.”TERMS AND TIMING OF THE ACQUISITIONThe purchase price of Digital Eclipse will consist of an initial consideration of US$6.5 million payable at the closing of the acquisition  of which (i) US$4.0 million in cash1 and (ii) US$2.5 million in newly issued Atari ordinary shares2  as well as a remaining earn-out of up to $13.5 million  payable in cash over the next ten years based on future performance of Digital Eclipse.It is expected that the acquisition of Digital Eclipse will be completed in the coming days.FINANCING OF THE ACQUISITIONIn addition to the cash consideration  Atari will also acquire a portion of the shares in Digital Eclipse directly and the purchase price of such shares corresponding to US$2.5 million (€2.4 million) will be paid by way of set-off against the issuance of newly issued Atari SA shares3.The reserved capital increase will result in the issuance of 20 165 794 new Atari shares. As a result  Digital Eclipse shareholders will together hold upon completion of the capital increase 4.6% of Atari’s share capital4. The determination of the number of Atari shares to be issued is based on the 20-day volume weighted average price of Atari shares on Euronext Growth Paris until the signing date of the purchase agreement of €0.1169  in accordance with the terms of the delegation to the board of directors.The majority of Digital Eclipse shareholders  holding in aggregate approximately 95% of Digital Eclipse capital  have agreed to a 1-year lock-up on their Atari shares as from the Closing of the acquisition.About ATARIAtari is an interactive entertainment company and an iconic gaming industry brand that transcends generations and audiences.

Reaching the number of progressing patients required for readout may take several months or even years  which has justified an amendment of th…,Patients in the INITIUM study are taking longer than expected to experience cancer progression. Reaching the number of progressing patients required for readout may take several months or even years  which has justified an amendment of the study protocol.The amended protocol in INITIUM enables the data analysis to start mid-January 2024 after the last enrolled patient has been followed up for 18 months. The topline results from the randomized Phase II study are expected to be announced approximately two to three months later.INITIUM completed enrollment of 156 patients in July 2022. The results from the randomized trial will provide comparative data on efficacy and safety for UV1 treatment in malignant melanoma added to standard-of-care immunotherapy  ipilimumab and nivolumab.Oslo  October 31  2023: Ultimovacs ASA (“Ultimovacs”) (OSE ULTI)  a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines  today announced that the analysis of the INITIUM data will be initiated in mid-January 2024  following an amendment of the clinical trial protocol. The INITIUM protocol has been amended to allow data readout based on a minimum of 18-month follow-up of all evaluable patients  at which time the patients have a mean follow-up time of 24 months. The amendment will maintain the integrity of the study statistics.The protocol amendment was submitted to the regulatory authorities in the countries where the INITIUM trial is conducted: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and regulatory bodies in Belgium  Norway  and the U.K. The FDA has not issued any objections to the amendment and the Regulatory Authorities in two European countries have approved the amendment with one pending.The INITIUM study ( NCT04382664 ) evaluates Ultimovacs’ universal cancer vaccine  UV1  as first-line treatment in unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma in combination with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab and CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab. The first patient was enrolled in June 2020  and the trial completed enrollment of 156 patients in July 2022. Per the original trial protocol  data analysis would be conducted after cancer progression or death has been verified in 70 patients.Based on published historical references  progression was estimated to occur in 70 patients by the first half of 2023. With the current development in patient progression  reaching these 70 events could take many months or even years  justifying the decision to implement the protocol amendment. Based on the recent acceptance from the regulators  the data can now be analyzed in early 2024  enabling Ultimovacs to maintain its guidance on reporting the outcome of the study two to three months later in the first half of 2024.“We are pleased for the patients in the INITIUM study that it takes longer than anticipated to experience progression of the disease. With positive survival results from the first randomized Phase II study in malignant mesothelioma  a very hard-to-treat cancer  we are increasingly optimistic about UV1’s potential to benefit cancer patients. As we seek to bring UV1 to the patients as quickly as possible  it is important to advance the INITIUM trial towards a data readout ” said Carlos de Sousa  CEO of Ultimovacs. “We appreciate the support from regulatory authorities  and we now look forward to sharing the results in the first half of 2024.”The primary endpoint of the Phase II study INITIUM is progression-free survival (PFS) as per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS)  objective response rate (ORR)  duration of response (DOR)  and safety of UV1 vaccination in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab.Ultimovacs has received a dual Fast Track designation from the FDA  granted in October 2021   for UV1 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma – either as add-on therapy to pembrolizumab or as add-on therapy to ipilimumab. In December 2021   UV1 was granted Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for treatment of stage IIB-IV melanoma.UV1 is a therapeutic cancer vaccine used to generate an immune response against the enzyme human telomerase (hTERT). The enzyme is essential for the ability of cancer cells to proliferate. Telomerase is present in 85-90% of all cancers  across the stages of the disease. The vaccine is manufactured as an off-the-shelf product with a long shelf life. UV1 is easy to use and does not require sophisticated hospital infrastructure  enabling patient access to therapy also in community centers  and rural and underserved communities.Ultimovacs is evaluating the universal cancer vaccine UV1 in a broad clinical development program across various cancer indications with different biology and disease stages  combined with different checkpoint inhibitors. The topline data from INITIUM will be the second readout among the five randomized trials in the UV1 Phase II clinical program. In October 2023  the UV1 Phase II trial NIPU in malignant mesothelioma reported a clinically meaningful overall survival benefit in the patients receiving UV1 vaccination  with no added toxicities. Per protocol  the overall survival results were statistically significant. In addition to the studies in malignant melanoma and malignant mesothelioma  Phase II studies are ongoing in patients with head and neck cancer (FOCUS)  ovarian cancer (DOVACC)  and non-small cell lung cancer (LUNGVAC). The data from the FOCUS trial is expected in the second half of 2024.==ENDS==About INITIUMINITIUM is an Ultimovacs-sponsored randomized  comparative  multicenter Phase II trial in which the universal cancer vaccine UV1 will be evaluated in combination with the checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab and nivolumab for first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma. The first patient received treatment in the INITIUM trial in June 2020  and the last patient was enrolled in July 2022. The study was conducted at 39 hospitals across the U.S.  U.K.  Belgium  and Norway. The initial study design called for enrollment of 154 patients. Two additional patients were enrolled bringing the total number of patients in the study to 156.About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines with broad applicability. Ultimovacs’ lead cancer vaccine candidate UV1 is directed against human telomerase (hTERT)  an antigen present in 85-90% of cancers in all stages of tumor growth. A broad clinical program  with Phase II trials in five cancer indications enrolling more than 670 patients  aims to demonstrate UV1’s impact in combination with other immunotherapies in multiple cancer types expressing telomerase and where patients have unmet medical needs. UV1 is universal  off-the-shelf  and easy to use  and is a patented technology owned by Ultimovacs.In addition  Ultimovacs’ adjuvant platform  based on the proprietary Tetanus-Epitope-Targeting (TET) technology  combines tumor-specific antigens and adjuvant in the same molecule and is in Phase I clinical development.The Company is listed on the Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange (ULTI.OL).About the UV1 Phase II programThe immunotherapeutic cancer vaccine UV1 is investigated in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in patients with various cancer indications with diverse tumor biology. The diversity of the UV1 Phase II program places Ultimovacs in a favorable position to capture the cancer vaccine’s potential broad applicability when combined with checkpoint inhibitors:INITIUM : Evaluating UV1 in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab as first-line treatment for patients with malignant melanoma.

The investigator-initiated study is led by Vestre Viken (Drammen Hospital) and supported by Ultimovacs.About UV1UV1 is a universal cancer vaccine designed to induce a specific T-cell response against telomerase. UV1 consists of long  synthetic peptides representing a sequence in the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase (hTERT)  shown to induce CD4+ T-cells. These CD4+ T-cells have the potential to provide inflammatory signals  and T-cell support is believed to be critical for triggering a strong anti-tumor immune response. Following intradermal injection  antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin are exposed to the vaccine peptides. These APCs will process the peptides and present vaccine epitopes on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules to naïve T-cells in the lymph nodes. Activated vaccine-specific T-cells will then enter the circulation and search for cells displaying their cognate antigen in the context of HLA molecules.The UV1 peptides contain several epitopes  shown to be non-restrictive in terms of (HLA) alleles for presentation. It is  therefore not required to perform HLA pre-screening of patients  which potentially enables broad population utilization of the vaccine. UV1 is administered over three months as eight intradermal injections together with the immune-modulator GM-CSF.For further information  please contact:Carlos de Sousa  CEOEmail: carlos.desousa@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 908 92507Anne Worsøe  Head of Investor RelationsEmail: anne.worsoe@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 90686815This information is considered inside information pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 in the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.

Like all industrial sectors  the Company's activities were heavily impacted by these difficult macroeconomic conditions.During the period  tolling activities (79% of 2023 half-year sales) were adversely affected by i) metal distributors' conservative expectations of market trends  based on a sharp fall in the LME aluminium price  which led them to keep their inventories at minimum levels  and ii) the emergence of a competitor in the European continuous anodising market. Against this backdrop  tolling sales declined by -20.6% compared with an unfavourable basis of comparison in the first half of 2022  which had grown by +18.5% driven by the post-COVID19 economic recovery.Package sales  which include metal  (21% of first-half 2023 sales) recorded solid growth of +11.1%  driven mainly by the development of sales in Europe  with major deliveries made during the period for top-of-the-range architectural projects. Meanwhile  the Company strengthened its pipeline of prospects in Asia  which will lead to new orders in 2024.The Company has done its utmost to limit the impact of the slowdown in tolling activities  by raising its prices in line with inflation and by adapting its investments and production capacity to the lower level of demand. Nevertheless  the impact of a sharp fall in sales on the Company's results was significant since variable costs represent only around 36% of sales.On the positive side  half-year results were positively impacted by €1.5M of exceptional items (exceptional write-back of depreciation on investment subsidies in Germany and write-back of provisions for interest due in the event of repayment of these subsidies). These items follow the audit carried out this summer by the German authorities (Landesförderinstitut Sachsen-Anhalt) in connection with the subsidies paid for the construction of the Bernburg plant -the examination of the award certificates having revealed that the requirements of the award notice dated 2 May 2012 had been met.Overall  in a difficult economic climate  the Company managed to record a net income close to breakeven  while continuing to post a solid balance sheet at 30 June 2023.ResultsSales for the first half of 2023 came to €11.8M  down €2.2M on the high basis of comparison in the first half of 2022.EBITDA fell by €2.5M to break even. This was mainly due to (i) a lower gross margin  reflecting lower sales  changes in the product mix and higher variable production costs  and (ii) higher operating expenses in an inflationary environment.The contraction in volumes in tolling activities weighed significantly on recurring operating income  which fell by €2.4M to a loss of €(1.4)M  compared with a profit of €1.1M in the first half of 2022.Operating profit was €0.7M  including €0.7M of non-recurring items relating to an exceptional write-back of depreciation on investment subsidies in Germany  which had no impact on the Company's cash position.Net income fell by €0.1M. It includes exceptional financial income of €0.7M  relating to a reversal of provisions for interest due in the event of repayment of the subsidies in Germany.Simplified income statement(€M) 2023 H1(6 months) 2022 H1(6 months) Variation 2022(12 months) Sales 11.79 13.95 - 15.4 % 26.7 Tolling sales 9.28 11.68 - 20.6 % 20.6 Package sales1 2.52 2.27 + 11.1 % 5.9 EBITDA 0.01 2.52 - 2.5 M€ 2.9 % of sales 0.1% 18.1% 10.9% Recurring operating profit (1.40) 1.01 - 2.4 M€ (0.1) % of sales (11.9)% 7.2% (0.4)% Operating profit (0.66) 1.01 - 1.7 M€ (2.6) % of sales (5.6)% 7.2% (9.9)% Income before tax (0.10) 0.85 - 1.0 M€ (2.9) Net income (0.11) 0.80 - 0.9 M€ (3.0) % of sales (0.9)% 5.7% (11.2)%ReviewAfter taking into account profit for the half-year  shareholders' equity at 30 June 2023 was €23.5M  down €0.1M on 31 December 2022. Net financial debt at 30 June 2023 was €6.3M (up €0.1M on the end of 2022) and remained at a reasonable level  representing 27% of equity  compared with 26% at 31 December 2022.2023 third quarter salesSales for the third quarter of 2023 came to €5.3M  down 21.5% year-on-year. Over the first 9 months of the year  sales came to €17.1M  down by -17.4% on the same period last year  with tolling sales (€13.5M) down 18.8% and package sales (€3.6M) down 11.7%.OutlookIn a difficult economic climate  the Company is maintaining a cautious approach and does not anticipate a recovery in demand for tolling services before the end of the financial year. The Company is taking steps to limit the impact of this slowdown on its results by supporting the commercial development of its package sales and by maximising the flexibility of its industrial facilities.The Company is confident in its long-term development prospects  and is capitalising on its broad portfolio of premium  sustainable products with a lower carbon footprint to prepare for the expected upturn in its markets from 2024 onwards.Additional informationThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 31 October 2023.

Like all industrial sectors  the Company's activities were heavily impacted by these difficult macroeconomic conditions.During the period  tolling activities (79% of 2023 half-year sales) were adversely affected by i) metal distributors' conservative expectations of market trends  based on a sharp fall in the LME aluminium price  which led them to keep their inventories at minimum levels  and ii) the emergence of a competitor in the European continuous anodising market. Against this backdrop  tolling sales declined by -20.6% compared with an unfavourable basis of comparison in the first half of 2022  which had grown by +18.5% driven by the post-COVID19 economic recovery.Package sales  which include metal  (21% of first-half 2023 sales) recorded solid growth of +11.1%  driven mainly by the development of sales in Europe  with major deliveries made during the period for top-of-the-range architectural projects. Meanwhile  the Company strengthened its pipeline of prospects in Asia  which will lead to new orders in 2024.The Company has done its utmost to limit the impact of the slowdown in tolling activities  by raising its prices in line with inflation and by adapting its investments and production capacity to the lower level of demand. Nevertheless  the impact of a sharp fall in sales on the Company's results was significant since variable costs represent only around 36% of sales.On the positive side  half-year results were positively impacted by €1.5M of exceptional items (exceptional write-back of depreciation on investment subsidies in Germany and write-back of provisions for interest due in the event of repayment of these subsidies). These items follow the audit carried out this summer by the German authorities (Landesförderinstitut Sachsen-Anhalt) in connection with the subsidies paid for the construction of the Bernburg plant -the examination of the award certificates having revealed that the requirements of the award notice dated 2 May 2012 had been met.Overall  in a difficult economic climate  the Company managed to record a net income close to breakeven  while continuing to post a solid balance sheet at 30 June 2023.ResultsSales for the first half of 2023 came to €11.8M  down €2.2M on the high basis of comparison in the first half of 2022.EBITDA fell by €2.5M to break even. This was mainly due to (i) a lower gross margin  reflecting lower sales  changes in the product mix and higher variable production costs  and (ii) higher operating expenses in an inflationary environment.The contraction in volumes in tolling activities weighed significantly on recurring operating income  which fell by €2.4M to a loss of €(1.4)M  compared with a profit of €1.1M in the first half of 2022.Operating profit was €0.7M  including €0.7M of non-recurring items relating to an exceptional write-back of depreciation on investment subsidies in Germany  which had no impact on the Company's cash position.Net income fell by €0.1M. It includes exceptional financial income of €0.7M  relating to a reversal of provisions for interest due in the event of repayment of the subsidies in Germany.Simplified income statement(€M) 2023 H1(6 months) 2022 H1(6 months) Variation 2022(12 months) Sales 11.79 13.95 - 15.4 % 26.7 Tolling sales 9.28 11.68 - 20.6 % 20.6 Package sales1 2.52 2.27 + 11.1 % 5.9 EBITDA 0.01 2.52 - 2.5 M€ 2.9 % of sales 0.1% 18.1% 10.9% Recurring operating profit (1.40) 1.01 - 2.4 M€ (0.1) % of sales (11.9)% 7.2% (0.4)% Operating profit (0.66) 1.01 - 1.7 M€ (2.6) % of sales (5.6)% 7.2% (9.9)% Income before tax (0.10) 0.85 - 1.0 M€ (2.9) Net income (0.11) 0.80 - 0.9 M€ (3.0) % of sales (0.9)% 5.7% (11.2)%ReviewAfter taking into account profit for the half-year  shareholders' equity at 30 June 2023 was €23.5M  down €0.1M on 31 December 2022. Net financial debt at 30 June 2023 was €6.3M (up €0.1M on the end of 2022) and remained at a reasonable level  representing 27% of equity  compared with 26% at 31 December 2022.2023 third quarter salesSales for the third quarter of 2023 came to €5.3M  down 21.5% year-on-year. Over the first 9 months of the year  sales came to €17.1M  down by -17.4% on the same period last year  with tolling sales (€13.5M) down 18.8% and package sales (€3.6M) down 11.7%.OutlookIn a difficult economic climate  the Company is maintaining a cautious approach and does not anticipate a recovery in demand for tolling services before the end of the financial year. The Company is taking steps to limit the impact of this slowdown on its results by supporting the commercial development of its package sales and by maximising the flexibility of its industrial facilities.The Company is confident in its long-term development prospects  and is capitalising on its broad portfolio of premium  sustainable products with a lower carbon footprint to prepare for the expected upturn in its markets from 2024 onwards.Additional informationThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 31 October 2023.

The Company also reported financial results for the third quarter of 2023. The quarterly financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on October 31  2023.Recent Business DevelopmentsFollowing DBV’s request for clarification after receipt of Type C Meeting feedback in July 2023  the FDA provided Written Responses on protocol design elements for the COMFORT supplemental safety studies. Both COMFORT Toddlers and COMFORT Children protocol will have harmonized language guiding how the product will be used in the trials  such as  “Each DBV712 250 μg epicutaneous system is intended to be worn for a full day (24 hours).” These instructions are simpler and more concise relative to previously used protocol language.Further to this approach  both supplemental safety studies will seek to enroll populations that are closely aligned with their respective Phase 3 efficacy studies  as is feasible. For COMFORT Toddlers  eligibility criteria will be the same as in EPITOPE (Phase 3 efficacy study in 1-3-year-olds) as reliance on peanut specific-IgE and skin prick test alone does not ensure a Regulatory-level of assurance of peanut allergy or a similar peanut allergic patient population relative to EPITOPE. Thus  COMFORT Toddlers will include a double-blind  placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) as part of the Inclusion criteria.For COMFORT Children  key inclusion criteria will remain peanut specific-IgE and skin prick test as these criteria are well established from previously conducted DBV studies (PEPITES and REALISE)  as well as from the medical literature  and are expected to support enrollment of a similar study population relative to VITESSE (Phase 3 efficacy study in 4-7-year-olds). Therefore  a DBPCFC will not be required for COMFORT Children.The size and duration of both supplemental safety studies remains unchanged from previous communications. These protocol design elements ensure closer alignment between the supplemental safety studies and their respective efficacy studies  which should ultimately support a more robust future BLA submission package for each indication.“We are very pleased with the engagement and clarity of the feedback received from the FDA ” stated Pharis Mohideen  Chief Medical Officer of DBV Technologies. “With a clear regulatory path forward  we will submit to FDA the final protocols for the COMFORT studies. We remain confident that this work will support a Biologics License Application (BLA) in both age groups and potentially bring this novel  much needed therapy to a vulnerable patient population.”DBV will implement the FDA’s feedback and expects to submit the final COMFORT Toddlers protocol design to the Agency in the coming weeks. DBV anticipates the first subject will be enrolled in Q1 2024. The initiation of COMFORT Children is expected after the start of COMFORT Toddlers and in alignment with VITESSE recruitment.Financial Highlights for the Third Quarter and the Nine Months Ended September 30  2023The Company’s interim consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30  2023  are prepared in accordance with accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).

These results were shared today with the directors of DOLFINES SA.The presentation of the half-year results of the DOLFINES group is based on the financial statements of DOLFINES SA  whose statutory auditors have carried out a limited review  as well as the main financial data of its three active operating subsidiaries  each 100% owned by DOLFINES SA: Aegide International  8.2 France and DOLFINES do Brasil.The activity report and the financial report as of June 30  2023 are available on the www.dolfines.com website  in the Investors section.In the absence of the presentation of the consolidated financial statements due to a change of accounting firm during the 1st half of the year and the time required to harmonize the accounts of the various companies of the group and in order to give an overall economic vision of the main financial aggregates of the DOLFINES Group  the table below offers an analytical vision  not reviewed by the statutory auditors. Intercompany operations have been eliminated and data from Aegide International  acquired at the beginning of May 2023 by DOLFINES SA  are included for the months of May and June in the 1st half of 2023:€ million H1 2023 H1 2022 Turnover 3.25 4.39 EBITDA(1) (0.98) (0.35) Net income (2.74) (2.98) Net income excluding exceptional items (1.16)(2) (0.93)(3) € million As of June 30  2023 As of December 31  2022 Gross cash(4) 0.75 1.63 Net financial debt from cash(4) 3.57 2.76(1) EBITDA: Operating income before depreciation and amortization and provisions(2) excluding the €1.59 million in financial expenses recorded in the first half of the year(3) excluding the €2 million in fees for issuing bonds convertible into shares(4) As of September 30  2023  Group Gross Cash stood at €0.9 million and net financial debt of €3.45 millionCommenting on these results  Adrien Bourdon-Feniou  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of DOLFINES  said: ""The revenue generated by all the companies of the DOLFINES group amounted to €3.25 million during the 1st half of 2023. Apart from Aegide International  a profitable company acquired in May 2023  the other companies in the group are experiencing high recurring losses. This is partly due to the complex situation of the group during the first six months of the year  leading to significant declines in activities at Dolfines SA and an unacceptable drift in expenses on 8.2 France. This situation has led to a significant drop in cash  with a very tight outlook in the short term.When I took up my position as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Dolfines Group at the end of June  I took the first drastic measures in terms of in-depth reorganization of the teams and activities. These actions  which take place over a period of 12 to 18 months  have shown encouraging initial results in the 3rd quarter of 2023. At the same time  work has begun on the restructuring of financial debt and the search for new money in the form of capital or debt  possibly dilutive  to meet the significant short-term cash needs and finance the working capital that the current growth will generate.The quality of the outlook offered by our markets  the solidity of our expertise and the remobilization of our teams are important assets in our desire to return to the path of profitable growth. »I – DOLFINES SACorporate accounts in accordance with French standards  million eurosIncome statement items H1 2023 H1 2022 Turnover Of which Conventional Energies Of which Renewable Energies Of which Engineering & Technologies 1.171.120.030.02 2.412.29-0.12 EBITDA(1) (0.80) (0.48) Net income (2.36) (3.04) Balance sheet items June 30  2023 December 31  2022 Equity(2) 6.31 5.13 Gross cash and cash equivalents 0.32 2.29 Financial debt net of cash 3.13 2.35(1) EBITDA: Operating income before depreciation and amortization and provisions(2) Including conditional advances of €1.8 million at the end of June 2023 and €1.8 million at the end of December 2022ActivityDOLFINES SA's revenue amounted to €1.17 million in H1 2023  compared with €2.41 million in H1 2022  a decline of nearly 50%.Conventional EnergiesConventional Energies revenue in H1 2023 was €1.12 million  down nearly 50% compared to H1 2022.This decline is due to:a shortening of the duration of inspection contracts in H1 2023 vs. H1 2022  although their number remained stable from one period to the next;delays and cancellations of inspection contracts awarded to Kuwait and India  as well as structural weakness in demand from our traditional customers in the drilling business for technical assistance;with the departure of several members of the team at the beginning of the year.However  DOLFINES continues to enjoy an excellent reputation among many major international accounts that use its services on a regular basis. Thus  our long experience in a niche technical field and a strategic geographical positioning in the Middle East via a branch in Abu Dhabi and in Latin America via a subsidiary in Brazil have enabled us to win new firm contracts that will have an impact on turnover in the twelve to eighteen months following their signature:in the deep offshore sector  three contracts with renowned international oil companies in Brazil  the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia;a multi-year framework agreement with a major operator in Egypt  expanding our presence in the MENA region;new contracts with international oil companies in West Africa and the Middle East.RenewableThe revenue of the Offshore Wind division managed within DOLFINES amounted to €0.03 million in H1 2023. This activity of providing services in the field of renewable energies is in its infancy. It has benefited from the signing of a first service contract in the French offshore wind sector with a major player in the sector in France. This one-year renewable contract began on April 15  2023. It marks the first step in our entry into this market.Engineering & TechnologiesDuring H1 2023  the design office's activity was mainly focused on the OHMe project  a telescopic tool with associated services for the heavy in-situ maintenance of fixed and floating offshore wind turbines. The tool has the potential to significantly reduce the costs of heavy maintenance  on blades and nacelles  and the associated risks and will thus contribute to a reduction in the LCOE of offshore wind.In order to develop the detailed engineering of the solution  DOLFINES has obtained funding from ADEME of €2.1 million (€1.6 million in the form of grants and €0.5 million in the form of repayable advances in the event of commercial success) which will be paid out as work on OHMe progresses.To date  the FEED has been fully implemented. This study made it possible to define the needs of offshore wind players and to carry out a pre-sizing of the tool in static and dynamic versions. In addition  detailed studies for the static version of the OHMe on a jack-up platform have begun.In addition  three pre-studies have been conducted for major flotation builders for the use of OHMe on their floats.ResultsThe low level of activity  the excessively high personnel costs and the significant financial costs related to the financing methods applied explain the negative performance of DOLFINES SA in the 1st half of 2023  with an EBITDA (Operating income before depreciation and amortization) of €(0.80) million  a net income of €(2.36) million including an exceptional negative financial result of €(1.59) million  mainly due to the taking into account of the payment of a balance to NEGMA at the time of the conversions of OCABSAs  where the share price is lower than par value.Noting these results  the new management of DOLFINES implemented during the summer an in-depth organizational restructuring of the company  which resulted in the following:the departure of several executives from the company;the reorganization of the Abu Dhabi office;the drastic reduction of all fixed costs.Financial structureAs of June 30  2023  DOLFINES SA's shareholders' equity amounted to €6.31 million  up 23% compared to the end of December 2022.At the end of June  gross cash stood at €0.32 million and net financial debt at €3.13 million  compared with €2.35 million at the end of December 2022.Several capital increases were carried out during the 1st half of 2023:On January 13  2023  in response to a supplier's wish to be offset of its claim by the issuance of new shares  and using the Board's delegation of September 8  2022 implementing the 6th resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting of July 19  2022  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer decided to increase the Company's share capital by an amount of €187 920 through the issuance of 18 792 000 new shares with a nominal value of €0.01  the subscription of which  to be paid up by set-off against a liquid and payable debt  is entirely reserved for this supplier;On May 9  2023  as part of the acquisition of Aegide International authorized by the Board of Directors on April 25  2023  110 309 477 new shares were issued  reserved for THESIGER International  representing a capital increase of €1 103 094.77;Over the period from February 20 to June 30  2023  as part of the contract and amendments signed with NEGMA GROUP Ltd:the Company issued a €2 million drawdown on February 17  2023 corresponding to the issuance of 800 convertible bonds to which 100 000 000 share subscription warrants are attached;11 conversion requests for 800 convertible bonds were made by NEGMA between February 20 and March 20  2023  resulting in the issuance of 200 000 000 new shares  representing a capital increase of €2 000 000;As those 11 conversion requests were made on the basis of a share price below the nominal value  they gave rise to a contractual payment of balances paid by the issue of 634 bonds convertible into shares.Between 24 February and 20 March 2023  740 OC issued in the draw of 17/02/2023 were converted at a below-nominal rate leading to the payment of the balance paid by the issuance of 634 convertible bonds.5 conversion requests for 142 convertible bonds were made by NEGMA between June 19 and 30  2023  resulting in the issuance of 147 500 000 new shares  representing a capital increase of €1 475 000.In total in the first half of 2023  following the capital increase decisions  476 601 477 new shares were created  representing a capital increase of €4 766 014.77.As of June 30  2023  these new share issues bring the number of shares comprising the share capital as of December 31  2022 from 265 056 262 shares to 741 657 739 shares with a nominal value of €0.01  and the share capital from €2 650 562.62 to €7 416 577.39.Significant events since the end of the periodSince the closing date of June 30  2023  several important events have occurred:ADEME paid €0.82 million to DOLFINES in the form of grants/advances for the OHMe project;Over the period from July 1 to July 28  2023  the financing carried out from bonds convertible into shares with warrants led to the creation of 2 218 055 555 new shares and an increase in shareholders' equity by €22 million.As of September 30  2023  the number of shares comprising the Company's share capital was 2 959 713 293 shares with a nominal value of €0.01 and the share capital of €29 597 132.93.To date  there are 320 bonds issued and not converted for a nominal value of €800 000.Taken together  these operations brought the company's gross cash to €0.44 million as of September 30  2023 and net financial debt to €3.07 million.II - 8.2 FranceActivityIn H1 2023  the subsidiary 8.2 France generated revenue of €1.58 million  stable compared to H1 2022.In the Inspection business (technical audit of wind and solar farms)  revenue generated in the solar sector increased by 62% year-on-year.The Consulting business generated revenue of €183K in H1 2023. This embryonic activity is an important lever for future growth.On the Technical Due Diligence part  8.2 France was selected on the closing of a bond financing to support the development of a company recognized in the renewable energy sector.In addition  technical training has been ordered by major players in the energy sector  an activity that is considered one of the growth drivers for this Business Unit for the year 2024.The Technical Assistance business  developed since the beginning of the year in collaboration with Dolfines  generated revenue of €327K in H1 2023.8.2 France has made a significant contribution to the completion of the first offshore project in France  Banc de Guérande  and continues its activities with EDF and GE on the many offshore projects underway  including Fécamp.Results and financial structureThe significant increase in payroll expenses since the second half of 2022  combined with a stagnation in revenue  resulted in EBITDA (Operating income before depreciation  amortization and provisions) of €(0.18) million at the end of June 2023.Following the change in governance decided by the new management of Dolfines  it is now the Chairman and CEO of Dolfines who heads 8.2 France. A plan to reduce expenses and reorganize the company has been implemented. In particular  it is reflected in a reduction in the number of employees in support functions  leading to a reduction in personnel costs  on a like-for-like basis  of more than 20%. In addition  8.2 France has been reorganized around two areas of activity: inspection and consulting  with the appointment of two new business managers.A debt clearance plan and repayment of DOLFINES SA's current account has also been implemented. The increase in activity in the second half of 2023  the reduction in expenses and the implementation of a factoring contract have strengthened the company's cash position.As of June 30  2023  8.2 France's shareholders' equity stood at €0.31 million. Gross cash amounted to €0.04 million  and net financial debt to cash amounted to €0.81 million.III - Aegide InternationalActivityAegide International is a QHSE expertise company acquired by Dolfines on May 9  2023.Aegide International's revenue was €1.46 million in H1 2023  stable compared to H1 2022.The order book (firm orders) stood at €1.4 million at the end of October 2023. In addition  as of the same date  €2.2 million in commercial offers were in progress.Audit revenue amounted to €0.42 million in H1 2023   compared to €0.27 million in H1 2022.The activities related to the MASE standard (certification audits  mock audits and support) are expanding strongly in H1 2023 thanks to the increase in the number of auditors in our network and the improvement of our visibility and reputation in this segment.In the third-party audit business  there is a recovery in activity after the COVID period. Several contracts have been signed with major accounts in the mining sector  in the electric vehicle charging market and in the energy sector with the award of a framework contract for an electricity transmission system operator involved in the interconnection projects of French offshore wind farms.Revenue generated by the Consulting business was €0.59 million in H1 2023  compared to €0.66 million in H1 2022. It has been carried out in France on the construction projects of the Grand Paris  on the offshore wind projects of Dieppe  with the electricity transmission system operator  or by supporting the industrial projects of a major industrial player in hydrogen. Abroad  we have worked in Gabon and Guinea-Conakry with port operators and mining projects.Finally  the Training business generated revenue of €0.45 million  compared with €0.51 million in H1 2022.We have continued to develop our strategic partnerships with internationally recognized certification bodies  which contribute to the good influence of our products and allow us to reach new targets to whom we can sell other Aegide products through a rebound effectResults and financial structureEBITDA (Operating income before depreciation  amortization and provisions) of €0.085 million represented 6% of revenue (vs. 8% in H1 2022). This decrease is mainly due to an increase in subcontracting to deal with temporary peaks in demand that we could not meet with our internal resources.As of June 30  2023  Aegide International's shareholders' equity amounted to €0.79 million. Gross cash amounted to €0.38 million and net financial debt to cash amounted to €0.2 million.IV - Dietswell do BrasilThe subsidiary in Brazil did not record any activity in H1 2023  as priority was given to cost reduction over commercial activity.Commercial activity resumed during the summer with the signing of several inspection and technical assistance contracts that are expected to generate revenue in Q4 2023 and H1 2024.Our subsidiary in Brazil has historically focused its activity around the conventional energy sector  however renewable energy projects – onshore  offshore wind and solar – are growing rapidly in Brazil. We have started to organize ourselves in order to exploit the commercial and operational synergies between 8.2 France  a specialist in renewable energies  and Dietswell do Brasil.V - PerspectivesDespite the intense restructuring underway  the company's chronic and persistent losses have a negative impact on its cash flow  which is already weakened by its high level of debt.The short-term sustainability of the company thus requires:an in-depth operational restructuring  which began in July 2023;rapid monetization of unused assets (Rig SEDLAR) and/or intellectual property developed over the last 10 years;a reduction or restructuring of financial debt that reaches levels too high for the size of the company;an investment by subsidiaries generating excess cash to finance the restructuring of the Group;the provision of new money in the form of capital or debt  possibly dilutive  to meet significant short-term cash flow needs  finance the working capital that the current growth will generate and stabilize the company's shareholder structure and governance.Based on this observation  the main axes of the operational restructuring launched last July by the new management in order to guarantee the sustainability of the company are:increasing revenue  which involves revitalizing commercial activity  redirecting available resources to services with high growth potential and maximizing the occupancy rate of operational staff;the improvement of margins on all service lines in order to minimize the increase in working capital that accompanies this growth;the reduction of personnel costs on support functions that are not directly billable to customers  coupled with a redefinition of roles and responsibilities to maximize the productivity of existing teams;the valorization of R&D work through a spin-off of the design office and its assets  which would make it possible on the one hand to manufacture and market our inventions and on the other hand to make the investment made by the company on these projects profitable;obtaining financing to strengthen the Group's cash position on terms that are less onerous for all the company's stakeholders  if possible.About Dolfines: www.dolfines.comFounded in 2000  DOLFINES is an independent specialist in engineering and services in the renewable and conventional energy industry.

Effective from January 1  2023  our Adjusted operating income/(loss) includes Share of the profit/(loss) of equity method investees. The comparatives for the respective periods for 2022 have been adjusted accordingly.This change was implemented as management believes these results are becoming increasingly relevant due to the number of partnerships Stellantis has recently engaged in  and will continue to engage in in the future  around electrification and other areas critical to the future of mobility.Unusual operating income/(expense) are impacts from strategic decisions  as well as events considered rare or discrete and infrequent in nature  as inclusion of such items is not considered to be indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance. Unusual operating income/(expense) includes  but may not be limited to: impacts from strategic decisions to rationalize Stellantis' core operations; facility-related costs stemming from Stellantis' plans to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand  and convergence and integration costs directly related to significant acquisitions or mergers.(3) Industrial free cash flows is calculated as Cash flows from operating activities less: cash flows from operating activities from discontinued operations; cash flows from operating activities related to financial services  net of eliminations; investments in property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for industrial activities; contributions of equity to joint ventures and minor acquisitions of consolidated subsidiaries and equity method and other investments; and adjusted for: net intercompany payments between continuing operations and discontinued operations; proceeds from disposal of assets and contributions to defined benefit pension plans  net of tax. The timing of Industrial free cash flows may be affected by the timing of monetization of receivables  factoring and the payment of accounts payables  as well as changes in other components of working capital  which can vary from period to period due to  among other things  cash management initiatives and other factors  some of which may be outside of the Company’s control.(4) Source: IHS Global Insight  Wards  China Passenger Car Association and Company estimates(5) Refers to the aggregation of the South America  Middle East & Africa and China and India & Asia Pacific segments for presentation purposes only(6) Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test CycleRankings  market share and other industry information are derived from third-party industry sources (e.g. Agence Nationale des Titres Sécurisés (ANTS)  Associação Nacional dos Fabricantes de Veículos Automotores (ANFAVEA)  Ministry of Infrastructure and Sustainable Mobility (MIMS)  Ward’s Automotive) and internal information unless otherwise stated.For purposes of this document  and unless otherwise stated industry and market share information are for passenger cars (PC) plus light commercial vehicles (LCV)  except as noted below:Middle East & Africa exclude Iran  Sudan and Syria;South America excludes Cuba;India & Asia Pacific reflects aggregate for major markets where Stellantis competes (Japan (PC)  India (PC)  South Korea (PC + Pickups)  Australia  New Zealand and South East Asia);China represents PC only; andMaserati reflects aggregate for 17 major markets where Maserati competes and is derived from S&P Global data  Maserati competitive segment and internal information.Prior period figures have been updated to reflect current information provided by third-party industry sources.Commercial Vehicles include vans  light and heavy-duty trucks and passenger vehicles registered or converted for commercial use.EU30 = EU 27 (excluding Malta)  Iceland  Norway  Switzerland and UK.Low emission vehicles (LEV) = battery electric (BEV)  plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and fuel cell electric (FCEV) vehicles.All Stellantis reported BEV and LEV sales include Citroën Ami and Opel Rocks-e; in countries where these vehicles are classified as quadricycles  they are excluded from Stellantis reported combined sales  industry sales and market share figures.SAFE HARBOR STATEMENTThis document  in particular references to “FY 2023 Guidance”  contains forward looking statements.

AMA CORPORATION PLC (""AMA"") (ISIN GB00BNKGC5 - mnemonic ALAMA)  publisher and integrator of secure productivity applications designed for connected mobile workers  announces its consolidated half-year earnings at June 30  2023  approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting on October 30  2023. Unaudited consolidated earnings - IFRS (€'000) First half of 2023 First half of 2022 Change Revenues 1 664 2 125 -22% Adjusted gross margin1 1 020 1 473 -30% % of revenues 61 3% 69 3% -8 pts Staff costs (3 407) (6 045) -44% Adjusted EBITDA2 (3 320) (4 351) +24% EBIT (4 061) (6 883) +41% Non-current operating losses 0 (1 013) Financial income (expense) (40) (18) Income from ordinary operations before tax (4 101) (7 914) +48% Consolidated net income (4 114) (8 558) +52% Results for the 1st half of 2023: effective adaptation plan in a market context that remains slow At the end of the 1st half of 2023  the AMA Group recorded revenues (IFRS  at current exchange rates) of €1.7m  compared with €2.1m in the 1st half of 2022. In the current economic context  customers are showing caution in their digital transformation investments. The decrease in the adjusted gross margin rate is temporary  as it is linked to actions to clear inventories (sale of obsolete hardware to brokers)  while the product mix between software and hardware remains similar to the previous year. 1 The adjusted gross margin corresponds to the margin on purchases consumed excluding the depreciation of inventory. 2 Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to EBIT + depreciation of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets + share-based payments in accordance with IFRS 2. 1AMA reacted proactively to market slowdown by initiating a vast cost-cutting plan over the 2nd half of 2022. This resulted in a €2.6m (-44%) reduction in personnel costs between the 2nd half of 2022 and the 1st half of 2023. This significantly reduced the current operating loss from €(6.9)m in the 1st half 2022 to €(4.1)m in the 1st half 2023. After taking into account the financial result of €(40)k and a tax charge of €(13)k  the AMA Group's consolidated net income is €(4.1)m for the 1st half 2023 compared with €(8.6)m for the same period last year. 3rd quarter 2023 revenues: a loyal customer base AMA posted revenues of €0.7m in Q3 2023  compared with €1.0m in Q3 2022. Despite this decline  AMA has retained its customer base of over 425 accounts at the end of September  including some of the world's largest groups (Air Liquide  Alstom  Boehringer  Enedis  KPMG  Millipore Sigma)  with the churn rate remaining limited to 7% of 2022 revenues. AMA's Sales & Marketing strategy continues to prioritize the broader adoption of its solutions. Specifically  in the 1st half of 2023  AMA introduced a new commercial offer called the ""Enterprise Model"" to accelerate the deployment and usage of XpertEye. This includes offering license packages and volume discounts. Each month  more customers and prospects are adopting this new offer  enabling them to progressively implement XpertEye across their organizations. In the rapidly advancing healthcare sector  where digital transformation is gaining momentum  AMA continues to roll out its XpertEye solution within SAMU (French Medical Emergency Services) and SDIS (French Firefighters Departments). An increasing number of them are using AMA's solution to enhance their ability to evaluate and respond more efficiently to emergency situations. The SAMU 75 (Paris) has just joined the 3 other SAMUs (92  93  94) of the APHP (Paris public health and hospital system) in adopting AMA's visio-regulation solution. This adoption aims to streamline care coordination and optimize the allocation of response resources. Technological advances: Interoperability and Artificial Intelligence AMA continues to innovate  with four major new versions of XpertEye deployed each year. The autumn release of XpertEye will be released in November. AMA is working closely with ARIANN  a sister company of the Guillemot Group  to integrate new AI- powered features designed to boost the productivity of XpertEye users. This involves leveraging the data generated during calls or work sessions with XpertEye  including audio  video  images  and text within a highly secure environment. AMA also plans to develop connectors to its customers' Artificial Intelligence tools or other third-party applications. This will enable them to securely exploit the data generated when using XpertEye. Cash position On June 28  2023  AMA Corporation Plc carried out a capital increase of €7.99m  giving it a solid financial position  with increased equity and cash. On June 30  2023  the Group's cash position stood at €12.6m (€(9.5)m net debt)  compared with €8.6 m (€(5.1)m net debt) on December 31  2022  ensuring a cash horizon in excess of 12 months. The financing lines already granted  amounting to €12m at the date of this release  have not been activated. 2This solid financial situation  together with the support of its majority shareholder and banking partners  will enable AMA to uphold its R&D investments to continuously improve the interoperability of its solution and seamlessly integrate artificial intelligence. Outlook The release of new functionalities brought by V8 to customers in Q4 2023 and the integration of AI will enable AMA to expect significant growth in the use of its solutions in 2024.

Lyngby  Havneholmen and Vesterbrogade will be gathered at Kalvebod Brygge in Copenhagen as from mid-2025Lars Stensgaard Mørch will take over as CEO and Managing Director from Anders Dam on 1 November 2023.Summary”Jyske Bank’s earnings per share rose by 94% to DKK 62 in the first nine months of 2023 and have already now exceeded the record-setting year 2022. The increase was due to the acquisition of Handelsbanken Denmark  a higher interest-rate level and a favourable development in the financial markets. The integration of the former Handelsbanken Denmark is still on track. The last of the 30 branch mergers were implemented in October  and the migration from BEC to Bankdata will take place on 11 November 2023. On 1 October  we welcomed new colleagues and clients following the acquisition of PFA Bank which contributed to a further strengthening of the business volume within asset management and wealth management advice. On the basis of the positive trend in 2023  we now expect to report results at the upper end of the range of DKK 70-80 per share  and consequently  the Supervisory Board recommend a dividend at DKK 500m at an extraordinary general meeting on 1 December 2023 ” says Anders Dam  CEO and Managing Director.Earnings per share amounted to DKK 62.0 in the first nine months of 2023 against DKK 31.9 in the same period in 2022. The improved performance was driven by 75% higher net interest income due to the acquisition of Handelsbanken Denmark and the higher interest-rate level. The Danish central bank’s rate of interest on certificates of deposit rose from -0.6% at mid-2022 to 3.6% p.a. Net fee and commission income showed a minor setback due to lower activity in the property market and lower lending activity. The lower activity level mirrors that large parts of the Danish economy were dominated by a slowdown in growth in the first nine months of 2023 despite a continued resilient labour market. The slowdown in growth can primarily be attributed to the solid increase in interest rates. As expected  core expenses were up due to the acquisition of Handelsbanken Denmark whereas the cost/income ratio was reduced to 44% in the first nine months of 2023 from 59% in 2022. Credit quality remained solid and offers a good basis for countering macro-economic uncertainty and moderate growth prospects for the Danish economy with a management's estimate at DKK 1 415m. Based on the development in the first nine months of 2023  earnings expectations for 2023 were raised three times from originally DKK 55-65 per share and most recently narrowed to the upper end of the range of DKK 70-80 per share.After almost 34 years with Jyske Bank - of these the past 28 years on the Group Executive Board - Anders Dam has decided to retire at end-October 2023  cf. Corporate Announcement No. 15/2023. Jyske Bank’s balance sheet has increased more than tenfold since Anders Dam took over as CEO and Managing Director in 1997  and earnings per share have risen from DKK 9.7 in 1997 to expectedly up to DKK 80 in 2023. With effect as from 1 November 2023  Jyske Bank’s Supervisory Board has employed Lars Stensgaard Mørch as new CEO and Managing Director. In addition  Managing Director  Per Skovhus  has announced his wish to retire in the course of the first half of 2024.On 21 July 2023  Standard & Poor’s upgraded Jyske Bank’s issuer rating to ’A+’ from ’A’. The higher rating was due to a higher level of eligible liabilities  improved profitability  and a solid capital base. Outlook is considered stable. No Danish financial institutions have a higher issuer rating at Standard & Poor’s.On 13 June 2023  Jyske Bank announced the acquisition of PFA Bank and an agreement with PFA Invest on the administration and portfolio management of the clients’ funds. The price totalled DKK 247m inclusive of equity of DKK 120m and the acquisition was implemented on 1 October 2023 following approval by the Danish Competition and Consumer Authority. Jyske Bank took over approx. 10 000 personal clients and private banking clients  deposits of DKK 0.7bn  assets under management of DKK 16.1bn and 40 full-time employees. Non-recurring costs are expected to amount to approx. DKK 50m in 2024  inclusive of IT integration in H1 2024. The deal is expected to give a positive contribution to the net profit before non-recurring costs in 2024 and to have its full financial impact as from 2025. Jyske Bank has a good value proposition within asset management and wealth management advice  and the Group’s private banking clients have according to the research company Voxmeter been Denmark’s most satisfied clients for the past eight years running.The acquisitions of Handelsbanken Denmark in 2022 and PFA Bank in 2023 mirror Jyske Bank’s ambitions of high-quality growth and underline the Group’s desired role in market consolidation. The larger scale supports the possibilities of developing and offering attractive products and services to Jyske Bank's existing and future clients. The acquisitions also offer the possibility of realising economies of scale based on a common IT platform starting with Handelsbanken Denmark as of November 2023.The integration of the former Handelsbanken Denmark is proceeding according to plan as regards financial  business and organisational issues. The future tasks of all employees were clarified in Q1 2023  when also business analyses  forming the basis of the migration of data to Bankdata from BEC  were finalised. Branch mergers in cities where both the former Handelsbanken Denmark and Jyske Bank were present have reduced the total number of branches by 1/4 after the last planned mergers were implemented in October 2023. The preparations for the migration data to Bankdata from BEC are proceeding according to plan following a successful trial run conducted in October 2023 with more than 200 employees involved. The acquisition of Handelsbanken Denmark is already now estimated to have attained the 2025 target of a contribution to the Group’s pre-tax profit at DKK 1.0bn p.a.  and the potential for the pre-tax profit is estimated to be approx. DKK 0.3bn above the original expectations.Jyske Bank will gather activities from Jyske Realkredit’s head office at Kgs. Lyngby  the head office of the former Handelsbanken Denmark at Havneholmen as well as existing business activities at Vesterbrogade at Kalvebod Brygge in Copenhagen as from mid-2025. The re-location is expected to create a good physical working environment for the employees  a strong professional environment and will also result in cost synergies.In the first nine months of 2023  the corporate client area realised continued advance in business volume. In July 2023  The European Investment Bank (EIB) and Jyske Bank signed a loan agreement of DKK 1.5bn to support small and medium-sized enterprises in Denmark with particular focus on climate-relevant business models or investment plans. Jyske Forsikring has developed insurance concepts targeted at specific sectors to the benefit of corporate clients. The personal client area launched new strategic initiatives in order to implement best practice in connection with the acquisition of Handelsbanken Denmark and on a further strengthening of the local mandata as well as initiatives to obtain even better client experiences. The first nine months of 2023 were dominated by branch mergers  organisational changes  client satisfaction analyses and a more client-oriented adviser model with easier access to personal advisers and specialised advisory services when required. According to Voxmeter’s image survey Jyske Bank reported the most significant improvement among Danish banks.Jyske Bank’s product range was also supported by the recent introduction of the bank mortgage loan “Prioritetslån+”. The loan is designed for personal clients who want flexibility in their financial affairs and makes it possible to link a deposit account on attractive terms and conditions. Moreover  Jyske Bank announced positive deposit rates on transaction accounts for both personal clients and corporate clients. The offering of savings products and fixed-term deposits was also improved  including a recently launched interest-rate guarantee of 3% p.a.Running a sustainable and responsible business is one of Jyske Bank’s targets  and climate is the most important impact area for the Group. Jyske Bank’s target is net zero CO 2 emission across business-oriented activities in the form of loans and investments not later than in 2045 and 2050  respectively. In addition  Jyske Bank aims at lending growth contributing to mitigate climate changes  and for the CO 2 emission from Jyske Bank’s own activities the target is a reduction of 65% from 2020 to 2030.In the first nine months of 2023  Jyske Bank established two additional solar cell systems with respect to meeting the intermediate target for 2030. Sustainability was promoted through webinars about energy renovation of properties  climate project days for agricultural clients and the possibility of sustainability-linked financing. Jyske Realkredit was awarded the Euronext prize for issuing the highest amount of green mortgage bonds in terms of volume in 2023. The resources of the special branch  Green Energy  was expanded considerably  supporting the ambition to increase the financing of renewable energy production even further. Jyske Bank also introduced Jyske Billån offering a favourable loan rate for cars with low emission intensity and a ”Fyr dit fyr” loan targeting the change of sources of heating. The latter complements the sustainable value proposition to homeowners of energy loans and partnerships targeted at the change of sources of heating.Earnings per share DKK 62.0 in Q1-Q3 2023Earnings per share rose to DKK 62.0 from DKK 31.9  corresponding to a net profit of DKK 4 106m and a return of 13.5% p.a. on equity against DKK 2 194m and 7.9% p.a.  respectively in the first nine months of 2022.Jyske Bank’s loans and advances were roughly unchanged at the end of the third quarter of 2023 relative to the end of 2022. Loans and advances under banking activities declined by 4%  which can partly be attributed to deferred tax and VAT payments. Bank deposits were up by 3% due to a higher amount of time deposits from corporate clients whereas personal clients selected savings products with higher interest rates. Leasing and car financing realised an increase of 4% driven by corporate clients. Nominal mortgage loans rose by 1% since higher loans and advances to corporate clients more than offset a lower amount of loans and advances to personal clients.Core income rose by 70% relative to the first nine months of 2022 due to markedly higher net interest income and value adjustments. Net interest income was up by 75% and was supported by a higher interest-rate level as well as higher loans and advances to corporate clients and the acquisition of Handelsbanken Denmark. Net fee and commission income declined from a record-high level due to slower loan and refinancing activity compared with the first nine months of 2022. Value adjustments showed a historically significant increase due to more favourable financial markets. Other income declined from an very high level whereas favourable sales conditions in the used car market contributed to sustained high income from operating lease (net).Core expenses rose by 27% compared to the first nine months of 2022. The increase can primarily be attributed to the acquisition of Handelsbanken Denmark which contributed  among other things  to an increase in the number of full-time employees as well as higher expenses for data processing centres and write-offs on acquired client relations. Underlying core expenses rose by 3%  among other things  as a result of an increased number of full-time employees allocated to prevention of financial crime as wel as wage increases relating to the collective agreement of 4.5%. In addition  non-recurring expenses of DKK 156m relating to the acquisition of Handelsbanken Denmark against DKK 78m the year before.Loan impairment charges amounted to an expense of DKK 96m against an income of DKK 447m in the first nine months of 2022. Credit quality is still solid with a low level of non-performing loans and the level of post-model adjustments relating to loan impairment charges was DKK 1 415m.At the end of the third quarter of 2023  Jyske Bank's common equity tier 1 capital ratio was computed at 16.7%  which is within the targeted range of 15%-17%. The capital position has been deducted the expected dividend due to the Supervisory Board’s recommendation for an extraordinary dividend at DKK 500m  equivalent to DKK 7.78 per share  based on the solid earnings in the first nine months of 2023. Due to the higher earnings capacity the aim of the Supervisory Board is that capital distribution will consist of both dividends and share buy-backs going forward.2023 outlookJyske Bank anticipates earnings per share at the upper end of the range of DKK 70-80 for 2023. This corresponds to a net profit at the upper end of the range of DKK 4.7bn-5.3bn. Jyske Bank upgraded its earnings expectations on 8 February  18 April and 11 July. Originally announced expectations pointed to earnings per share of DKK 55-65  corresponding to a net profit of DKK 3.7bn-4.3bn.Core income is expected to surge in 2023  especially due to the acquisition of Handelsbanken Denmark and the effect from a higher level of interest rates.Likewise  core expenses are expected to rise significantly in 2023. The increase can primarily be attributed to the acquisition of Handelsbanken Denmark. To this must be added derived integration and restructuring costs of about DKK 0.3bn.Loan impairment charges are expected to amount to a minor expense in 2023.The expectations involve uncertainty and depend  for instance  on macroeconomic circumstances and the development in the financial markets.Webcast and conference callJyske Bank will host a conference call in English targeting investors and analysts today at 1.30 p.m. CET ( link ).

The Tender Offers are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  as set forth in the Offer to Purchase. The Companies will only accept for purchase Notes up to a combined aggregate purchase price (excluding accrued and unpaid interest) that will not exceed the Aggregate Offer Cap and each of the Pool Offer Caps. The Pool 2 Offer Cap will initially be calculated on the basis of the Pool 1 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or before the Early Tender Time  subject to the Pool 1 Offer Cap; provided however that if neither the Aggregate Offer Cap nor the Pool 1 Offer Cap have been reached as at the Early Tender Time  the Pool 2 Offer Cap will then be calculated again following the Expiration Time on the basis of all Pool 1 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Pool 1 Tender Offers  subject to the Pool 1 Offer Cap (but without prejudice to the fact that Notes tendered at or before the Early Tender Time will have priority over Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time  regardless of the Acceptance Priority Levels and whether such Notes are Pool 1 Notes or Pool 2 Notes). Subject to applicable law  the Companies reserve the right  but are under no obligation  to increase or decrease the Aggregate Offer Cap  the Pool 1 Offer Cap and/or the Pool 2 Offer Cap in respect of the Tender Offers at any time (without extending the Withdrawal Deadline or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights of Holders)  which could result in the Companies purchasing a greater aggregate principal amount of Notes in the Tender Offers. The purchase of any series of Notes is not conditioned upon the purchase of any other series of Notes. Any Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Tender Offers and accepted for purchase will be purchased by the Companies based on the applicable Pool Offer Cap and the Aggregate Offer Cap and the acceptance priority levels within each of the Pool 1 Tender Offers and the Pool 2 Tender Offers noted above (the ""Acceptance Priority Levels"")  each as more fully described in the Offer to Purchase.

For the avoidance of doubt  Notes tendered at or before the Early Tender Time will have priority over Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time  regardless of the Acceptance Priority Levels of such Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time and whether such Notes are Pool 1 Notes or Pool 2 Notes. If any of the applicable Pool Offer Caps are reached at the Early Tender Time  then no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time in such Tender Offer will be purchased unless the Companies increase the applicable Pool Offer Cap.

Subject to applicable law  the Companies reserve the right  but are under no obligation  to increase or decrease the Aggregate Offer Cap  the Pool 1 Offer Cap and/or the Pool 2 Offer Cap in respect of the Tender Offers at any time (without extending the Withdrawal Deadline or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights of Holders)  which could result in the Companies purchasing a greater aggregate principal amount of Notes in the Tender Offers. The purchase of any series of Notes is not conditioned upon the purchase of any other series of Notes. Any Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Tender Offers and accepted for purchase will be purchased by the Companies based on the applicable Pool Offer Cap and the Aggregate Offer Cap and the acceptance priority levels within each of the Pool 1 Tender Offers and the Pool 2 Tender Offers noted above (the ""Acceptance Priority Levels"")  each as more fully described in the Offer to Purchase. With respect to each of the Tender Offers  if the purchase of all validly tendered Notes would result in an aggregate purchase price greater than the applicable Pool Offer Cap  then such Tender Offer will be oversubscribed and if the Companies accept Notes in such Tender Offer  any Notes accepted for purchase in the lowest Acceptance Priority Level in which Notes are accepted for purchase will be accepted for tender on a prorated basis. For the avoidance of doubt  Notes tendered at or before the Early Tender Time will have priority over Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time  regardless of the Acceptance Priority Levels of such Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time and whether such Notes are Pool 1 Notes or Pool 2 Notes. If any of the applicable Pool Offer Caps are reached at the Early Tender Time  then no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time in such Tender Offer will be purchased unless the Companies increase the applicable Pool Offer Cap. If the Aggregate Offer Cap is reached at the Early Tender Time  then no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time will be purchased unless the Companies increase the Aggregate Offer Cap and the applicable Pool Offer Cap. ab-inbev.com Press release - 31 October 2023 - 5Holders of Notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Time and that are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable ""Total Consideration""  which includes the Early Tender Payment for the applicable series of Notes set forth in the table above. Holders of any Notes that are validly tendered after the Early Tender Time but at or before the Expiration Time and that are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Payment. The Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Payment is referred to as the ""Tender Offer Consideration"". Holders are advised to check with any bank  securities broker or other intermediary through which they hold their Notes as to when such intermediary needs to receive instructions from a holder in order for that holder to be able to participate in the Tender Offers before the deadlines specified herein and in the Offer to Purchase. The deadlines set by the clearing system for the submission and withdrawal of tender instructions will also be earlier than the relevant deadlines specified herein and in the Offer to Purchase. Holders holding GBP Notes or EUR Notes directly in the NBB-SSS or through a direct participant of the NBB-SSS (other than Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg) must  in order to be eligible to participate in the Tender Offers in the manner specified in the Offer to Purchase  (i) arrange for the GBP Notes or EUR Notes which they wish to tender to be transferred to an account in either Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  and (ii) maintain  or where relevant  procure  access to an account in either Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg through which such GBP Notes or EUR Notes can be traded  and to which the Total Consideration or the Tender Offer Consideration (as applicable) and the applicable accrued interest payment may be credited by AB InBev. Holders of GBP Notes or EUR Notes who do not have access to an account  as described above  in either Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg (either directly or through a direct participant or other intermediary)  or who do not transfer the GBP Notes or EUR Notes which they wish to tender to a direct participant in either clearing system  will not be able to submit a GBP/EUR Tender Instruction (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) to the Tender and Information Agent and will not be eligible to participate in the Tender Offers in the manner specified in the Offer to Purchase.

Additional details will be provided in the press release section of our website at https://www.ab-inbev.com/news-media/press-releases/.Announcement of 1 Billion USD share buyback program to be executed within the next 12 monthsOn 30th October 2023  the AB InBev Board of Directors approved a 1 billion USD share buyback program to be executed within the next 12 months. The share buyback program will be implemented in accordance with industry best practices and in compliance with the applicable buyback rules and regulations. To this end  an independent financial intermediary will be appointed to repurchase on the basis of a discretionary mandate. The precise timing of the repurchase of shares pursuant to the program will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions. During the share buyback program  the company will regularly publish press releases with updates on the progress made (if any) as required by law. This information will also be available on the investor relations pages of our website under the payouts section (https://www.ab-inbev.com/investors/payouts/). Our current intention is to hold the shares acquired as treasury shares to fulfil future share delivery commitments under the stock ownership plans. The program will be executed under the powers granted at the General Meeting of Shareholders on 28 April 2021.NotesTo facilitate the understanding of AB InBev’s underlying performance  the analyses of growth  including all comments in this press release  unless otherwise indicated  are based on organic growth and normalized numbers. In other words  financials are analyzed eliminating the impact of changes in currencies on translation of foreign operations  and scope changes. Scope changes represent the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  the start or termination of activities or the transfer of activities between segments  curtailment gains and losses and year over year changes in accounting estimates and other assumptions that management does not consider as part of the underlying performance of the business. The organic growth of our global brands  Budweiser  Stella Artois  Corona and Michelob Ultra  excludes exports to Australia for which a perpetual license was granted to a third party upon disposal of the Australia operations in 2020. All references per hectoliter (per hl) exclude US non-beer activities. Whenever presented in this document  all performance measures (EBITDA  EBIT  profit  tax rate  EPS) are presented on a “normalized” basis  which means they are presented before non-underlying items. Non-underlying items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the Company. They are presented separately because they are important for the understanding of the underlying sustainable performance of the Company due to their size or nature. Normalized measures are additional measures used by management and should not replace the measures determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company’s performance. As from 1 January 2023  mark-to-market gains/(losses) on derivatives related to the hedging of our share-based payment programs are reported in the non-underlying net finance income/(cost). The 2022 presentation was amended to conform to the 2023 presentation. We are reporting the results from Argentina applying hyperinflation accounting since 3Q18. The IFRS rules (IAS 29) require us to restate the year-to-date results for the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency  using official indices before converting the local amounts at the closing rate of the period. These impacts are excluded from organic calculations. In 9M23  we reported a negative impact on the profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev of 74 million USD. The impact in 9M23 underlying EPS was -0.04 USD. Values in the figures and annexes may not add up  due to rounding. 3Q23 and 9M23 EPS is based upon a weighted average of 2 016 million shares compared to a weighted average of 2 012 million shares for 3Q22 and 9M22.Legal disclaimerThis release contains “forward-looking statements”.

The organic growth of our global brands  Budweiser  Stella Artois  Corona and Michelob Ultra  excludes exports to Australia for which a perpetual license was granted to a third party upon disposal of the Australia operations in 2020. All references per hectoliter (per hl) exclude US non-beer activities. Whenever presented in this document  all performance measures (EBITDA  EBIT  profit  tax rate  EPS) are presented on a “normalized” basis  which means they are presented before non-underlying items. Non-underlying items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the Company. They are presented separately because they are important for the understanding of the underlying sustainable performance of the Company due to their size or nature. Normalized measures are additional measures used by management and should not replace the measures determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company’s performance. As from 1 January 2023  mark-to-market gains/(losses) on derivatives related to the hedging of our share-based payment programs are reported in the non-underlying net finance income/(cost). The 2022 presentation was amended to conform to the 2023 presentation. We are reporting the results from Argentina applying hyperinflation accounting since 3Q18. The IFRS rules (IAS 29) require us to restate the year-to-date results for the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency  using official indices before converting the local amounts at the closing rate of the period. These impacts are excluded from organic calculations. In 9M23  we reported a negative impact on the profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev of 74 million USD. The impact in 9M23 underlying EPS was -0.04 USD. Values in the figures and annexes may not add up  due to rounding. 3Q23 and 9M23 EPS is based upon a weighted average of 2 016 million shares compared to a weighted average of 2 012 million shares for 3Q22 and 9M22.Legal disclaimerThis release contains “forward-looking statements”.
