As a result  our turnover for the 3rd quarter of 2023 has posted a 75% increase versus the year-earlier period. In the current “all-digital” era  this increase is the perfect reward for the tremendous work conducted by our teams”.The launch of our new online version was a major project involving all of Artprice's databases and services  and which took two years to plan and develop (prolonged by the Covid-19 crisis).After a call for tenders  Artprice by Artmarket selected the company Vahumana of the TRSb Group and its team of highly talented top-level external consultants for the audit and development of the complete overhaul of Artprice.com. The entire project was conducted with a ‘user-centric' approach that prioritizes the intuitivity of the user experience (UX) and optimizes the fluidity and ergonomics of the user interface (UI).From early September 2023  the final online version of Artprice.com by Artmarket  World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years  has become the Art Market benchmark in terms of customer experience and ergonomics.After this brilliantly successful launch  our initial data shows excellent uptake of the new Artprice.com by Artmarket among existing and new customers as well as a massive 441% increase in online traffic (activity logs) on a 50MM traffic moving average. In the long term  we can therefore expect significant turnover growth (due to higher traffic) and this has already been confirmed by our Q3 2023 figures which show a 75% turnover increase vs. Q3 2022.Our new intuitive and user-friendly online presence  with its simplified access  has unified all the high value-added databanks built by Artprice.com  its subsidiaries and its various departments  thus allowing easy access to the most relevant and exhaustive information on the art market. This has led to a very significant increase in the number (and duration) of professional & high-end annual subscriptions  clearly confirming customers' strong confidence in Artprice.We've made a deliberate effort to elevate our users' mobile experience by implementing responsive web design (RWD) for the entire Artprice database. This approach ensures a seamless experience without resorting to a limiting 'App' solution. Unlike mobile apps that often require frequent updates and fixes  our RWD solution delivers the full richness of the desktop/laptop experience.The feedback from customers and members is unanimous: “The new Artprice site is so much more pleasant to use and allows you to navigate through rich and varied content.”Now our customers and users are discovering information they never knew existed. Some even think that Artprice must have acquired some new companies to have changed so much… For its financial partners and shareholders  this version is a real “game changer”.The new centrally-positioned and intuitive search bar offers instant access to an exhaustive tree structure around the subject of the search  which ultimately generates an increase in the time spent on Artprice.com.Our search engine links instantly to Artprice databases with art market information from the 4th century to the present day and data concerning 825 800 artists  16 448 000 sales prices and indices  and 1 087 500 auction lots hammered over the last 12 months from 7 200 auction houses around the world.Artprice by Artmarket provides the most elaborate and exhaustive Art Market information and the most useful research tool for accessing that information in the world  confirming its position as the World leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.The universal search bar immediately draws up a wealth of information around the element sought: whether it is an artist  biography  artist email alerts  artworks in future and/or past auctions  art market indices  Artpricing® estimations  works available on our standardized Artprice.com Marketplace  art market news and articles in our archive of ArtMarketInsight® articles  or Artprice reports on the Art Market. It will also immediately connect your search to our databases to extract signatures and monograms  catalog raisonnés  archived historical data  etc. that Artprice has digitalized from the key historical art market archives acquired around the world over the past 25 years (cf. Artmarket.com's universal registration document (URD) filed with France's Financial Market Authority(AMF)).Artprice.com by Artmarket uses algorithmic artificial intelligence in its proprietary AI Intuitive Artmarket® allowing customers access to relevant and personalized recommendations regarding  artists  artworks and auction sales  thereby automatically enhancing their knowledge and understanding of the art market.Artprice Images® allows unlimited access to the largest collection of digital art and art market-related images in the world based on Artmarket.com's collection of manuscripts and sales catalogs which now form a vast physical and digital library containing 180 million photos and engravings of artworks from 1700 to the present day  all commented by our historians.In this very specific economic sector  Artmarket.com owns by far the largest volume of high-quality objective and proprietary (value-added) art market data. The original documentary archives  codex manuscripts  annotated books and auction catalogs acquired over the years are a key asset as they represent an almost impregnable barrier to entry.In addition  Artprice's new online architecture integrates new communication spaces for advertisers  supported by a new Back Office for the completely autonomous management of their advertisements. With the new advertising revenue  Artprice by Artmarket expects to double its turnover in 2023/2024 versus the previous financial year.Despite the current geopolitical and economic context  the art market is showing dynamic health with regular auction records hammered across all artistic periods in all countries during recent sales. There have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for the end of 2023 and 2024  these sales being the main indicators of the market's condition.The major auction houses and investors know full well that the art market is a safe haven and a good investment  as illustrated by the Artprice100© index. The current period of uncertainty is also prompting new investments in the art market.The war on European soil  the conflict in the Middle East  the dizzying rise in interest rates and the fears of recession have not got the better of the art market at the end of 2023.Don't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionThe information and econometric studies produced by Artmarket.com are presented uniquely for the purpose of analyzing and understanding the statistical realities of the art market.

That's what I'm worried about.""Forex:The dollar strengthened early Tuesday amid risk-off sentiment spurred by overnight gains in Treasury yields and hawkish comments from a Fed official overnight.The remarks from Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari showed a continued lean to the hawkish side  Maybank analysts said.With Treasury yields continuing to bounce back on Monday  foreign-exchange markets have slightly readjusted to the higher yields  ING economists said  noting weakness in the GBP.""European economies are slowing given the respective central banks' rate hikes  which does not justify a sustained rally by sterling and the euro  "" said Paul Mackel  global head of FX research at HSBC.This contrasts with how European economies were healing when heading into 2023.China's economy is also struggling and ""a lot more optimism"" is needed for the dollar to keep weakening  especially against European currencies and the Chinese yuan  he said.Bonds:Treasury yields were mixed as traders considered a slight chance of another Federal Reserve rate hike by January.Economists at U.K. bank Barclays  one of the primary dealers for U.S. Treasurys  pushed back their call for a Fed rate hike to January.Meanwhile  fed funds futures traders put a 17.1% chance on either a quarter-point or half-point hike occurring by the first month of next year.If financial conditions continue to loosen  Fed officials ""would need to be on the front foot to raise rates "" said Rob Daly  director of fixed income for Glenmede Investment Management.""They could raise rates in December if conditions look loose and it's the right thing to do  but I think it's more of a January scenario.""Energy:Oil futures headed lower on concerns over weaker demand.""Weaker economic expectations have weighed on crude prices recently  which has contributed to prices pulling off their highs and  arguably  once again justified the positions of OPEC+ nations in cutting supply "" Craig Erlam  senior market analyst at Oanda said.Russia and Saudi Arabia  two major oil producers  have confirmed they will extend production cuts through the end of December.However  he added  ""it's not a question of whether the two countries keep to end-of-year targets  but whether they extend them"" beyond that time frame.""Our oil balance shows that the market will be in surplus in [the first quarter of 2024]  which may be enough to convince the Saudis and Russians to continue with cuts through the seasonally weaker demand period of [the first quarter] "" ING commodity strategists said.Meanwhile  investors continue to monitor the Israel-Hamas war for potential spillovers that could affect crude supplies.Metals:Gold edged down in the Asia session amid rising U.S. Treasury yields.Oanda analyst Craig Erlam reckoned that the yellow metal hovering around $2 000 for a while without staying above the key level suggests its rally over the last month was running on fumes  and it may need a bullish catalyst to rise above that mark.Gold would likely get some support near term as a haven bet due to the impact of the Israel-Hamas conflict and a weakening U.S. job market  Huatai Securities analysts said.In the medium to long term  it may be tough to keep real U.S. interest rates high for an extended period  potentially giving gold room to rise  the Huatai analysts added.--Copper fell in Asia amid continued demand headwinds.Inflationary pressures  geopolitical tensions  and a high-rate environment remain cyclical headwinds for demand for base metals  Citi Research analysts said.However  copper consumption still seems resilient for now and investors have net short positions in the metal  suggesting that a deteriorating physical balance is already being priced in somewhat and so pricing downside appears limited  the analysts added.--Iron ore prices were flat in early Asian trade after earlier gains on the back of stronger demand.However  market sentiment was still positive toward iron ore after the Chinese government approved an additional $1 trillion in sovereign bonds to support infrastructure investment  Huatai Futures analysts said.Low steel inventories and the shortage of scrap steel supply were also supporting iron ore prices  the analysts added.Steel inventories at major Chinese steel mills fell to 13.8 million tons in late October  down 16.6% from mid-October  according to the China Iron and Steel Association.TODAY'S TOP HEADLINESChina Exports Drop More Than Expected  Signaling Continued HeadwindsChina's exports fell by more than expected in October  pointing to continued economic headwinds and shrinking global appetite for the country's goods.Exports  a key driver of the world's second-largest economy  dropped 6.4% in October compared with the same period a year earlier  the General Administration of Customs said Tuesday. In September  exports had declined 6.2% on the year.Fed's Neel Kashkari Not Convinced Rate Hikes Are OverA top Federal Reserve official said he would err on the side of overtightening monetary policy rather than not doing enough to bring inflation down to the central bank's 2% target.""Undertightening will not get us back to 2% in a reasonable time "" Neel Kashkari  the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis  said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Monday.Credit is getting tighter  and it's only a matter of time before it chokes growth  economist saysThe numbers: Banks continued to tighten standards for business loans in the third quarter  according to a survey of loan officers conducted by the Federal Reserve.In addition  a ""significant"" number of banks tightened lending standards for credit-card  automobile and other consumer loans.Fed's Cook says debt not a big threat yet to U.S. economyHouseholds  businesses and banks are in pretty good financial health and don't appear to pose a big threat to the U.S. economy  a senior Federal Reserve official said Monday.""In my view  our financial system is substantially more resilient than it was in the mid-2000s "" said Fed governor Lisa Cook in a speech at Duke University.Fed likely to cut rates below 3%  making bonds attractive now  Guggenheim saysGuggenheim Investments thinks investors should look past the carnage in bonds and gear up for the Federal Reserve to pivot to rate cuts.While the investment team expects the Fed to leave its policy rate unchanged at a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% over the next several meetings  they also see a recession as likely in the first half of 2024.Couche-Tard Gets Regulatory OK For TotalEnergies DealAlimentation Couche-Tard can complete its purchase of TotalEnergies' European retail assets after the company received a decision from the European Commission not to oppose the deal.The Canadian convenience-store operator said it expects the deal to close in December.Israel Deepens Push Into Gaza CityTEL AVIV-Israel pushed further into Gaza City  sending troops into an urban Hamas stronghold that is still packed with civilians after one of the most intense bombing barrages of the monthlong war.Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that Israeli forces ""are continuing to deepen the pressure into the depths of Gaza City."" He didn't say during a briefing Monday where Israeli soldiers are operating  and Israeli officials have been careful not to disclose the location of their ground forces in Gaza.Flights to Europe Are Becoming Cheap AgainFlying to Europe in 2024 without spending a fortune is in the cards after a long stretch of sky-high prices.(MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires11-07-23 0015ET",neutral,0.02,0.9,0.08,mixed,0.16,0.3,0.53,True,English,"['EMEA Morning Briefing', 'Risk-Off Sentiment', 'Stocks', 'November', '12', '16', 'U.K. BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor', ""respective central banks' rate hikes"", 'rising U.S. Treasury yields', 'U.K. bank Barclays', 'Halifax house price index', 'The Wall Street Journal', 'Germany industrial production Index', 'Direct Line Insurance Group', 'Federal Reserve rate hike', 'U.S. stock futures', 'two major oil producers', 'U.S. stocks', 'U.S. Treasurys', 'rising borrowing costs', 'Federal Reserve Bank', 'Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari', 'Fed rate hike', 'France OECD CPI', 'Daimler Truck Holding', 'Associated British Foods', 'Atlanta-based Constrained Capital', 'Glenmede Investment Management', 'sixth straight session', 'Fed Chairman Powell', 'ING commodity strategists', 'weaker demand period', 'Asian equity markets', 'Weaker economic expectations', 'European stock futures', 'funds futures traders', 'senior market analyst', 'China trade data', 'oil futures', 'half-point hike', 'two countries', 'economic data', 'RS Group', 'MTN Group', 'Fed official', 'higher yields', 'production cuts', 'oil balance', 'Asia session', 'economic headwinds', 'Neel Kashkari', 'European economies', 'European currencies', 'EU PPI', 'trading updates', 'Deutsche Post', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Finnair Oyj', 'risk-off sentiment', 'shrinking appetite', 'monetary policy', 'reasonable time', 'hawkish comments', 'continued lean', 'Maybank analysts', 'foreign-exchange markets', 'Paul Mackel', 'global head', 'FX research', 'Chinese yuan', 'primary dealers', 'first month', 'front foot', 'Rob Daly', 'fixed income', 'right thing', 'OPEC+ nations', 'Craig Erlam', 'Saudi Arabia', 'time frame', 'first quarter', 'Israel-Hamas war', 'potential spillovers', 'crude supplies', 'Oanda analyst', 'yellow metal', 'key level', 'last month', 'bullish catalyst', 'haven bet', 'ING economists', 'MARKET WRAPS', 'one side', 'seasonal rally', 'best week', 'last week', 'hawkish side', 'sustained rally', 'next year', 'year targets', 'Opening Call', 'Mark Neuman', 'overnight gains', 'slight chance', 'financial conditions', 'crude prices', 'January scenario', 'largest economy', '17.1% chance', 'UBS', 'Renault', 'SAS', 'ENGIE', 'Enel', 'Capgemini', 'Persimmon', 'declines', 'dollar', 'gold', 'Equities', 'world', 'second', 'country', 'goods', 'exports', 'October', '3.5% fall', 'people', 'signs', 'founder', 'Monday', 'conference', 'confirmation', 'message', 'part', 'job', 'inflation', '2% target', 'Undertightening', 'interview', 'concerns', 'Forex', 'remarks', 'weakness', 'GBP', 'sterling', 'HSBC', 'optimism', 'Bonds', 'quarter-point', 'rates', 'director', 'December', 'Energy', 'highs', 'positions', 'supply', 'Russia', 'end', 'question', 'surplus', 'Saudis', 'investors', 'Metals', 'fumes', 'support', 'term', 'impact', '2023']",2023-11-07,2023-11-08,marketscreener.com

32360,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dax-index%3A-euro-area-stats-earnings-and-fed-chair-powell%3A-the-midweek-challenges,DAX Index: Euro Area Stats  Earnings  and Fed Chair Powell: The Midweek Challenges,The DAX remains above the 50-day EMA while sitting below the 200-day EMA  reaffirming bullish near-term but bearish longer-term price signals. A DAX move through the 15 247 resistance level would bring the 200-day EMA into play.,FXEmpire.com -HighlightsThe DAX gained by 0.11% on Tuesday  ending the session at 15 153.On Wednesday  German corporate earnings  ECB speeches  and euro area economic indicators will draw interest.However  Fed Chair Powell will be the focal point of the Wednesday session.Tuesday DAX OverviewThe DAX gained 0.11% on Tuesday. After a 0.35% loss on Monday  the DAX ended the day at 15 153.German Industrial Production and Euro Area Stats ImpactOn Tuesday  German industrial production figures for September aligned with recent manufacturing PMI surveys. Industrial production tumbled by 1.4%  following a 0.1% decline in August. Economists forecast a modest 0.1% fall. The sharp fall in production reflected the lackluster demand environment. Macroeconomic conditions continue to affect demand.Eurozone producer prices sent a similar message  with a continued year-over-year downward trend. However  the trends varied across the sectors  with prices increasing for capital goods and durable and non-durable consumer goods.While economic indicators sent mixed signals  corporate earnings impacted investor sentiment. Daimler Truck Holding released disappointing Q3 earnings  sending the auto sector into negative territory. Supply chain issues affected vehicle sales.However  Deutsche Boerse delivered impressive forecasts to counter auto sector woes.The DAX moved within a relatively tight range on Tuesday. Investors were cautious ahead of central bank speeches that could redefine what to expect from the ECB and the Fed.The Tuesday Market MoversDeutsche Boerse rallied 3.52% on the earnings forecasts.However  auto stocks led the way down. Daimler Truck Holding slid by 4.62%  with BMW declining by 1.64%. Porsche and Mercedes Benz Group ended the day down 1.23% and 1.15%. Volkswagen and Continental fell by 0.82% and 0.96%  respectively.German Inflation and Eurozone Retail Sales in FocusOn Wednesday  the German economy will be in the spotlight for the third consecutive session. Finalized inflation figures for October will need consideration. Softer inflation numbers could ease pressure on the ECB to keep rates higher for longer. According to preliminary numbers  the German inflation rate softened from 4.5% to 3.8% in October.Later in the session  Eurozone retail sales will warrant consideration. A larger-than-expected fall in retail sales could impact consumer sector-listed stocks. Economists forecast euro area retail sales to decline by 0.2% in September. In August  retail sales tumbled 1.2%.ECB and Corporate Earnings May Have More Influence on the DAXWith inflation and consumption in focus  investors should monitor ECB commentary throughout the session. ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane and Executive Board member Andrea Enria are on the calendar to speak. Philip Lane would have more impact on risk appetite. ECB President Lagarde will attend the Eurogroup meetings in Brussels.References to the economic outlook  inflation  and monetary policy will influence the DAX.Away from theeconomic calendar corporate earnings will continue to provide direction to the DAX. Siemens Healthineers  Deutsche Post  Continental  Commerzbank  and Adidas are among the big names releasing earnings on Wednesday.Fed Chair Powell and FOMC Members in the SpotlightOn Wednesday  Fed Chair Jerome Powell will draw investor attention. Amidst rising euro area recessionary fears  a hawkish Fed could force the DAX into retreat. Softer US labor market stats fueled bets on the Fed ending its rate hike cycle and a June 2024 rate cut. However  uncertainty lingers. Overnight on Tuesday  Fed speakers left rate hikes on the table  stirring investor jitters.While Fed Chair Powell will be the focal point  Fed Vice Chair John Williams and FOMC voting members Philip Jefferson and Michael Barr will also deliver speeches. Contradictions to forward guidance could fuel uncertainty and pressure the demand for riskier assets.The futures markets point to a negative start to the Wednesday session. The DAX and the Nasdaq mini were down 42 and 21 points  respectively.Short-Term ForecastNear-term trends remain dependent on central bank speeches. Investors are resigned to the prospect of a euro area recession. However  hawkish Fed and ECB forward guidance would adversely impact the DAX.DAX Technical IndicatorsDaily ChartThe DAX remained below the 50-day and 200-day EMAs  affirming bearish price signals.A DAX move through the 15 247 resistance level and the 50-day EMA would give the bulls a run at the 200-day EMA.Euro area economic indicators  corporate earnings  and central bank speeches will be focal points on Wednesday.However  a drop below 15 000 would bring the 14 957 support level into play.The 14-day RSI reading of 52.03 indicates a DAX move through the 15 247 resistance level and the 50-day EMA before entering overbought territory.4-Hourly ChartDAX 081123 Daily ChartThe DAX remains above the 50-day EMA while sitting below the 200-day EMA  reaffirming bullish near-term but bearish longer-term price signals. A DAX move through the 15 247 resistance level would bring the 200-day EMA into play.However  a break below the 50-day EMA and the 14 957 support level would give the bears a run at 14 800.The 60.35 14-4 hour RSI reading indicates a DAX move through the 15 247 resistance level before entering overbought territory.DAX 081123 4-Hourly ChartFor a look at the economic events  check out our economic calendar.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq  Inc.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.05,0.26,0.69,True,English,"['Euro Area Stats', 'The Midweek Challenges', 'DAX Index', 'Chair Powell', 'Earnings', 'Fed', 'rising euro area recessionary fears', 'Softer US labor market stats', '4-Hourly Chart DAX 081123 Daily Chart', 'Fed Vice Chair John Williams', 'DAX Technical Indicators Daily Chart', 'ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane', 'recent manufacturing PMI surveys', 'Euro Area Stats Impact', 'euro area economic indicators', 'euro area retail sales', 'Fed Chair Jerome Powell', 'The Tuesday Market Movers', 'German industrial production figures', 'theeconomic calendar corporate earnings', 'Fed Chair Powell', 'Daimler Truck Holding', 'Supply chain issues', 'Mercedes Benz Group', 'Executive Board member', '14-day RSI reading', 'rate hike cycle', 'June 2024 rate cut', 'Finalized inflation figures', 'Softer inflation numbers', 'longer-term price signals', 'non-durable consumer goods', 'consumer sector-listed stocks', 'Eurozone Retail Sales', 'central bank speeches', 'disappointing Q3 earnings', 'ECB President Lagarde', 'Eurozone producer prices', 'FOMC voting members', 'auto sector woes', 'German corporate earnings', 'German inflation rate', 'lackluster demand environment', 'third consecutive session', 'bearish price signals', 'ECB forward guidance', 'Tuesday DAX Overview', 'economic outlook', 'FOMC Members', 'Philip Jefferson', 'auto stocks', 'German economy', 'rate hikes', 'mixed signals', 'vehicle sales', 'ECB speeches', 'hawkish Fed', 'Fed speakers', 'capital goods', 'preliminary numbers', 'earnings forecasts', 'The DAX', 'ECB commentary', 'A DAX', 'DAX move', 'focal point', 'Macroeconomic conditions', 'similar message', 'downward trend', 'investor sentiment', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'impressive forecasts', 'tight range', 'Andrea Enria', 'risk appetite', 'Eurogroup meetings', 'monetary policy', 'Siemens Healthineers', 'Deutsche Post', 'big names', 'investor attention', 'investor jitters', 'Michael Barr', 'riskier assets', 'futures markets', 'negative start', 'Nasdaq mini', 'Short-Term Forecast', '200-day EMAs', '15,247 resistance level', '14,957 support level', '50-day EMA', 'modest 0.1% fall', 'sharp fall', 'negative territory', 'Near-term trends', 'Wednesday session', 'FXEmpire', 'Highlights', 'interest', '0.35% loss', 'Monday', 'September', '0.1% decline', 'August', 'Economists', 'year', 'sectors', 'Investors', 'way', 'BMW', 'Porsche', 'Volkswagen', 'Continental', 'Focus', 'spotlight', 'October', 'consideration', 'pressure', 'rates', 'expected', 'More', 'Influence', 'consumption', 'Brussels', 'References', 'direction', 'Commerzbank', 'Adidas', 'retreat', 'bets', 'uncertainty', 'table', 'Contradictions', 'prospect', 'bulls', 'run', 'drop', 'play', 'overbought', 'bullish']",2023-11-08,2023-11-08,nasdaq.com

APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About leniolisibLeniolisib is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the US as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy of leniolisib in the coprimary endpoints; demonstrating statistically significant impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype within these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term leniolisib administration.8 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review by the European Medicines Agency  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in the UK  Canada  Australia and Japan. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial in children aged 4 to 11 with APDS  with a further trial planned in children aged 1 to 6 years with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(NYSE: CNHI / MI: CNHI) announces today that its Board of Directors has approved an...,Basildon  November 7  2023CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE: CNHI / MI: CNHI) announces today that its Board of Directors has approved an application to delist its ordinary shares from Euronext Milan. Such application will be filed today.As announced on February 2  2023  the decision to delist from Euronext Milan and concentrate its listing on NYSE was taken following a careful review of the relative trading volumes on the two exchanges. Since the spin-off in January 2022 of CNH’s On-Highway activities and the creation of Iveco Group  the majority of CNH stock trading has progressively shifted to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)  revealing that the Company’s business profile and investor base fit better with a single US listing. Concentrating trading in one market should allow for increased liquidity and investor focus  while further simplifying the company profile and compliance requirements.The Company believes that the NYSE meets all requirements provided in the Milan Stock Exchange rules applicable to CNH  i.e.  that NYSE’s characteristics are equivalent to European regulated markets and it has a sufficient level of liquidity  ensuring also adequate safeguards for investors. This press release includes a summary overview of such key safeguards for investors.Upon satisfaction of all conditions  Borsa Italiana will arrange for the delisting of CNH’s ordinary shares and will publish a notice indicating the date of effectiveness of the delisting. Delisting from Euronext Milan would take effect no earlier than 45 days after the publication by Borsa Italiana of its notice arranging for delisting. The Company is confident that single listing on the NYSE will be effective at the beginning of January 2024. Further information will be made available pursuant to the applicable regulation. Until the day of delisting  CNH’s common shares will continue to be listed also on Euronext Milan.CNH’s Board of Directors and its Management Team are grateful to Euronext Milan for having been the Company’s listing venue for more than 10 years and are excited about the Company’s continued presence on the NYSE.Additional practical information regarding the delisting will be published in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.cnhindustrial.com as soon as Borsa Italiana will announce its decision about the delisting application.CNH further announces today that the Board of Directors has approved a new share buyback program (the “Program”). Under the Program the Company will repurchase from time to time up to US$1 billion worth of its common shares between November 8  2023  and March 1  2024. Funded by the Company’s liquidity  the Program is intended to optimize the capital structure of the Company and to assist with offsetting any potential volatility arising from the delisting of its shares on Euronext Milan.The Program will consist of two primary components:Component 1:The first component will involve share repurchases of an amount equivalent to up to EUR 400 million worth of the Company’s common shares between November 8  2023  and December 29  2023The purchases will be carried out on Euronext Milan and on multilateral trading facilities (MTFs)  in compliance with applicable rules and regulations  subject to a maximum price per common share equal to the average of the highest price on each of the five trading days prior to the date of acquisition  as shown in the Official Price List of Euronext Milan plus 10% (maximum price) and to a minimum price per common share equal to the average of the lowest price on each of the five trading days prior to the date of acquisition  as shown in the Official Price List of Euronext Milan minus 10% (minimum price)The actual timing  number and value of common shares repurchased under the Program will depend on various factors  including market conditions  general business conditions  and compliance with applicable legal requirements. The Program does not oblige the Company to repurchase any common shares  and  also on the basis of trading volumes and price volatility  it may be modified upwards  suspended  discontinued  at any time  for any reason and without previous notice  in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.Subject to the above conditions  purchases will be carried out in compliance with the conditions and the restrictions under Article 3 (paragraphs 1  2 and 3) and Article 4 (paragraph 1) of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 and market practicesDetails of the transactions carried out will be disclosed in accordance with the terms and conditions required by the applicable regulationsComponent 2:The second component will involve share repurchases from time to time of up to the remaining authorized repurchase amount under the Program between November 8  2023  and March 1  2024The purchases will be executed on the NYSE. Pursuant to this component  CNH Industrial will provide purchase instructions from time to time in compliance with applicable rules  regulations and legal requirements. The actual timing  number and value of common shares repurchased on the NYSE will depend on a number of factors  including market and general business conditionsAny repurchases executed under Component 1 could additionally be executed on the NYSE between November 8  2023  and December 29  2023 to further supplement repurchases executed on Euronext Milan under Component 1The Program will be conducted within the framework of the authorization granted by the Shareholders’ Meeting held on April 13  2023  whereby the Board is vested with the authority to purchase up to 10% of the Company’s issued common shares during the eighteen-month period following such Shareholders’ Meeting.As of today  the Company holds 36 197 502 common shares in treasury.Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is acting as financial advisor to CNH.BNP Paribas is acting as co-advisor and buyback agent for CNH in Europe.Overview on safeguards for investors under the U.S. laws  regulations and standardsGeneral Overview on U.S. securities exchange systemThe U.S. securities exchange system is thoroughly regulated and supervised by independent government agencies. The main securities regulator in the United States is the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”)  an independent US government agency that: (i) oversees the disclosure requirements applicable to public companies; (ii) oversees securities exchanges  securities brokers and dealers  investment advisers  and mutual funds; (iii) has enforcement authority for violation of the securities law.The SEC has rulemaking and enforcement authority  and administers the federal securities laws  including the following primary statutes: (i) Securities Act of 1933  as amended (the “Securities Act”); and (ii) Securities Exchange Act of 1934  as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The following laws also affect capital markets: (i) Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)  parts of which are incorporated into the Exchange Act; (ii) Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act); (iii) Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) of 2012; (iv) Investment Company Act of 1940  as amended.To trade on a US exchange  a security must generally be both registered with the SEC and accepted for listing on an exchange.The NYSE has qualitative requirements for its listed companies relating to  among other things  corporate governance  including maintenance of audit and compensation committees comprised of independent directors  and compliance with ongoing requirements  such as distributing annual and interim reports.There are continuous obligations for public companies concerning  for instance  periodic reporting  beneficial ownership reporting and rules relating to the conduct of tender offers and other securities-related transactions. Creeping AcquisitionsThe U.S. tender offer and “going private” rules administered by the SEC provide protections to shareholders in the face of creeping acquisitions of shares by a third party  including any affiliate of the issuer (e.g. a shareholder holding a significant position in the issuer)  and regulate any efforts by a third party or an affiliate to acquire or consolidate a controlling position in a company the shares of which are listed on a U.S. securities exchange.Any person or “group” that acquires beneficial ownership of 5% or more of a class equity securities must disclose that holding as well as provide detailed disclosure in relation to any plans or proposals that relate to or otherwise affect management or control of the listed company (as well as subsequent amendments in case of material changes in the information already communicated – including any further acquisitions of 1% of the shares of the listed company and change in the holder’s plans with respect to its relationship to or holdings in the listed company).Wherever certain factors occur (e.g.  a person purchases a significant percentage of the issuer’s securities or is engaged in widespread solicitation of shareholders for the purchase of shares)  tender offer rules (as adopted and administered by the SEC) apply. If so  significant process and disclosure protections also apply to the benefit of investors. Under these rules the listed company’s Board of Directors must express a position what it recommends shareholders to do in response to the offer. In this last regard  it is virtually unheard of that a Board of a listed company would recommend that shareholders tender their shares into an offer for less than 100% of the company’s outstanding shares and equally rare for a tender offer to succeed without ultimately being recommended by the company’s Board of Directors.Based on the above  as a practical matter  it would be very difficult for an investor (whether a third party or an affiliate) to acquire a controlling stake in a U.S. listed company or consolidate its controlling position within a reasonable period of time without triggering the SEC’s tender offer rules.Going Private TransactionsAcquisitions of shares made by an “affiliate” that are intended or likely to result in the listed company “going private”  requirements under Rule 13e-3 would apply also requiring significant disclosures as to a bidder’s valuation of  and plans for  the listed company  as well as detailed disclosure by both bidder and the target company as to the purpose of the transaction and its fairness to the unaffiliated shareholders of the target company.Delisting from a U.S. securities exchange  such as NYSE  does not automatically deregister the shares under the U.S. securities laws nor does it terminate the company’s ongoing SEC reporting obligations or the application of the tender offer or “going private” rules that continue to apply. To deregister  the company must demonstrate that the primary trading market for the shares is on a securities market outside the U.S. (the primary trading market being a major international securities exchange outside the U.S.  where the company’s shares are traded  with significant trading liquidity and volume) and that the trading volume in the U.S. is less than 5% of the global trading volume in the shares.Delisting from a U.S. securities exchange without an alternative listing on a major international stock exchange is virtually unheard of and  should a Board of Directors seek a delisting in such a scenario  it would subject itself to significant litigation risk as well as scrutiny from U.S. securities authorities.It would therefore be extremely difficult for an issuer listed solely on a U.S. securities exchange to delist in an attempt to avoid the application of the requirements provided by SEC rules and governance principles.Change of Control TransactionsCNHI is expected to satisfy U.S. governance standards were it to be listed solely on a U.S. stock exchange. Although certain specific U.S. governance requirements are not strictly applicable to Dutch incorporated entities such as CNHI  if CNHI were to be listed only on the NYSE and not on a European exchange  three factors would apply: (i) first  the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) would limit the “home country” exemptions to the NYSE corporate governance rules for which CNHI would be eligible if its shares are listed on a European exchange; (ii) second  application and administration of SEC rules would no longer be mitigated by questions of deference to home country regulators and the SEC would fully apply domestic company rules and (iii) institutional investors and proxy advisory firms would expect and require the Company governance standards to be comparable to those applicable to U.S. domestic companies. This would particularly be true in the case of a proposed change in control transaction involving CNHI  in which case CNHI would be held to the U.S. disclosure  process and substantive standards.In this regard  it has been extremely rare for a listed company on a U.S. exchange with a significant (>30%) non-majority shareholder to be acquired by a third party. In each of these cases in which such a transaction has been completed  the acquisition was negotiated and approved by the Board of the listed company and the Board then recommended the transaction to the shareholders for their approval or acceptance.Therefore  the NYSE listing and SEC registration afford significant protections to public minority shareholders.The high levels of protection for minority shareholders  in change-in-control transactions for U.S. listed companies are evident in the relatively higher control premia paid in the U.S even though the U.S. system does not include the mandatory takeover offer rules applicable to CNHI as a consequence of its listing on Euronext Milan. Each of Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris has determined that the NYSE is substantially equivalent to an EU regulated market for purposes of its listing rates.* * *The Company believes  also on the basis of the opinion of its legal counsels  that the rules and standards applicable to CNHI after the delisting provide significant protections to shareholders  particularly in the face of a potential creeping acquisition by a third party seeking to obtain control or by an affiliate (e.g.  a significant shareholder) seeking to consolidate a controlling position and in the case of a proposed change in control transaction involving CNHI of the sort addressed by the mandatory takeover offer rules prevalent in Europe  and  therefore all the conditions required by the Rules of the Markets governing the delisting process are met.Important informationPlease note that any information above is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial  legal  tax or any other professional advice.

As a result  our turnover for the 3rd quarter of 2023 has posted a 75% increase versus the year-earlier period. In the current “all-digital” era  this increase is the perfect reward for the tremendous work conducted by our teams”.The launch of our new online version was a major project involving all of Artprice's databases and services  and which took two years to plan and develop (prolonged by the Covid-19 crisis).After a call for tenders  Artprice by Artmarket selected the company Vahumana of the TRSb Group and its team of highly talented top-level external consultants for the audit and development of the complete overhaul of Artprice.com. The entire project was conducted with a ‘user-centric' approach that prioritizes the intuitivity of the user experience (UX) and optimizes the fluidity and ergonomics of the user interface (UI).From early September 2023  the final online version of Artprice.com by Artmarket  World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years  has become the Art Market benchmark in terms of customer experience and ergonomics.After this brilliantly successful launch  our initial data shows excellent uptake of the new Artprice.com by Artmarket among existing and new customers as well as a massive 441% increase in online traffic (activity logs) on a 50MM traffic moving average. In the long term  we can therefore expect significant turnover growth (due to higher traffic) and this has already been confirmed by our Q3 2023 figures which show a 75% turnover increase vs. Q3 2022.Our new intuitive and user-friendly online presence  with its simplified access  has unified all the high value-added databanks built by Artprice.com  its subsidiaries and its various departments  thus allowing easy access to the most relevant and exhaustive information on the art market. This has led to a very significant increase in the number (and duration) of professional & high-end annual subscriptions  clearly confirming customers' strong confidence in Artprice.We've made a deliberate effort to elevate our users' mobile experience by implementing responsive web design (RWD) for the entire Artprice database.

We eagerly anticipate sharing the outcomes of this world-class study in the second quarter of 2024. This achievement bolsters our commitment to delivering an innovative drug for the treatment of cardiovascular emergencies  that is strengthened  moving forward at every milestone of development plan execution. »Adeline Meilhoc  Head of Global Clinical Development of Acticor Biotech  says: « We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the patients and their families  as well as medical teams at about 70 clinical centers around the world for supporting this extraordinary study. The pace of recruitment and the quality of the data fill us with immense pride for our dedicated project teams  who were able to stay the course despite the constraints associated with conducting a trial in a medical emergency and the international context. All have already expressed their willingness to participate in the development of glenzocimab in future trials. »ACTISAVE (NCT05070260) is an international  adaptive  multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group Phase 2/3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single dose of glenzocimab used in combination with the standard of care (thrombolysis +/- thrombectomy) for acute ischemic stroke. Deployed in the United States  Europe  Israel  and United Kingdom  ACTISAVE has enrolled 438 patients  of whom about 40% have undergone mechanical thrombectomy.As a reminder  following consultations with the European (EMA) and American (FDA) regulatory agencies  and in agreement with ACTISAVE Scientific Committee  Acticor Biotech decided in September 2023 to change the main endpoint of the study by retaining only one single endpoint  namely the reduction in the number of patients who died or suffered from severe disability as a result of AIS (mRS score 4-6 at 90 days).As previously announced  phase 2/3 clinical results are expected in the second quarter of 2024.Based on these results and the recommendations of international experts in stroke  Acticor Biotech plans to consult again with the EMA and the FDA in 2024 to confirm that the Phase 3 design will support final registration in both Europe and the United States  envisaged by 2028 at the latest.About ACTICOR BIOTECHActicor Biotech is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  a spin-off from INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research)  which is aiming to develop an innovative treatment for cardiovascular emergencies  including ischemic stroke.The positive results of the phase 1b/2a study  ACTIMIS  confirmed the safety profile of glenzocimab and showed a reduction in mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage in the glenzocimab-treated group of stroke patients. The efficacy of glenzocimab is now being analyzed in an international Phase 2/3 study  ACTISAVE  with clinical results expected in Q2 2024.In July 2022  Acticor Biotech was granted ""PRIME"" status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for glenzocimab in the treatment of stroke. This designation will allow the company to strengthen its interactions and obtain early dialogues with regulatory authorities.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Mediolanum farmaceutici  Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Anaxago  and the Armesa foundation).

Following the announcement of i…,7 November 2023  6:00 pm  Antwerp  Belgium: VGP NV (‘VGP’ or ‘the Group’) today announces the acquisition of a 19-hectare site in Vélizy-Villacoublay  part of the 26-hectare site currently occupied by car manufacturer Stellantis. Following the announcement of its first major investment of 32 hectares in Petit-Couronne (Rouen)  VGP is stepping up its development in France with its first investment in the strategic district of Greater Paris.Located in the municipality of Vélizy-Villacoublay  8 km from the inner city of Paris  the site boasts an exceptional location  just 15 minutes from Paris Orly airport and in the immediate vicinity of Paris-Saclay  a leading science and technology centre. At the junction of the outer ring road of Paris (A86) and N118 motorways and just a few minutes from the capital  the location is ideal for prospective customers and employees who can reach the site by various means of public transport.Established in France since 2021  VGP is making its second acquisition on an iconic site at the heart of France's leading economic zone. The location and historical presence of Stellantis make this a particularly iconic project. With 19.4 hectares of land at its disposal  the Group plans to develop a business park of around 80 000 m2 for industrial companies and small and medium-sized value-added businesses. Construction work is due to start in the second half of 2025  with the first buildings due for delivery in 2026. As with all the Group's projects  an ambitious environmental approach will be applied to this park and all buildings will achieve a BREEAM Excellent certification as a minimum.Aurélien Coudert  Managing Director of VGP France: “Given the scarcity of land on the French market  this deal demonstrates our agility and ability to execute. VGP is delighted to be able to take part in a project as strategic as this one  thanks to the relationship of trust we have built up with all the parties involved  in particular the Vélizy town council. We are positioning ourselves as a long-term partner of the Vélizy area and will remain the main partner and point of contact for the project  from the construction phase through to the operation of the buildings. We are convinced that  with its differentiating model  VGP has the capacity to develop strongly in France  on large-scale projects that can boost local economies.”Jan Van Geet  CEO of VGP: “The acquisition of this iconic site close to the inner city of Paris is an important step in our ambition to develop our business in France  which is a priority market for VGP. We would like to thank Stellantis for their confidence and cooperation on this project and are now looking forward to redeveloping this brownfield into a prime and future-proof business park that meets the needs and requirements of our prospective customers and local authorities. The acquisition of this land gives us the opportunity to deploy our operational expertise in one of Europe's most attractive economic areas. As anticipated previously  VGP has been able to secure a number of other iconic sites in major European metropolitan areas  which will be communicated soon. ”CONTACT DETAILS FOR INVESTORS AND MEDIA ENQUIRIESInvestor RelationsTel: +32 (0)3 289 1433investor.relations@vgpparks.eu Karen HuybrechtsHead of Marketing Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432 Apolline ThomassetEsprit des Sens for VGP France Tel: +33 6 19 42 57 83a.thomasset@eds-groupe.com Florian BergerEsprit des Sens for VGP France Tel: + 33 10 78 64 26f.berger@eds-groupe.comABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate as well as a provider of renewable energy solutions.

However  activity is down -9.1% (-6.8% at constant exchange rates) on Q2 2022-2023  a period that benefitted from a strong upturn in order intake following the pandemic.This readjustment to activity can also be seen in S1 total sales figures that stand at €26.6 million  close to S2 2022-2023 levels  but down -11.6% (-9.5% at constant exchange rates) on S1 2022-2023.Printing activity for the six-month period stands at €18.9 million  down -5.5% (-3.1% at constant exchange rates) on S1 2022-2023. Communications activity continues to resist the cyclical drop in demand in some sectors with total sales at €16.8 million  down just -1.6% at constant exchange rates (-4.3% at current scope). The activity also benefits from a strong interest among clients for the all-inclusive print-to-installation service offers. Home décor activity  however  is down -14.1% at €2.1 million. The market is less buoyant and order volumes from the main commercial customer are down.Hardware activity sales stand at €7.8 million  down -23.6% (-21.9% at constant exchange rates) on S1 2022-2023 whose strong level of activity was boosted by major international orders  notably from Germany.However  the results are the 2nd best for a first six-month period in the past 5 years. In S1 2023-2024  LED display turnover stands at €4.0 million (vs €6.3 million in S1 2022-2023) helped by the delivery of orders to Italy and South America and relatively dynamic activity on the French municipalities sector. Sales figures for traditional hardware activities (notably static signage solutions) remain stable at €3.8 million (vs €3.9 million in N-1).Despite this decrease in activity  the Group's current operating profitability for the six-month period should be higher than that recorded in 2022-2023  thanks first to a decrease in procurement costs and the adjustment of the pricing policy implemented at the end of the previous financial year  and the Group's careful control of operating expenses.Outlook 2023-2024Order backlog on September 30  2023 stands at €8.2 million  down €3.5 million on June 30  2023. The figures reflect the uncertainty of the current economic situation and the wait-and-see attitude adopted by contractors  notably concerning Hardware.The more stable Printing division continues to benefit from a strong order backlog at €4.2 million that integrates a cautious approach as to future orders for the Home décor activity. Order backlog for the Communications sector is in line with expectations. The recent investment in a printer in the United Kingdom should go towards boosting activity in this area.Concerning Hardware activity  the order backlog stands at €4.0 million  which represents a low point with regard to previous levels. Despite the positive reaction to the latest technological innovations (new LED modules with a sharper resolution as an alternative to outdoor LCD screens)  Prismaflex International is impacted by extended decision-making processes  both cyclical  as with the postponement until 2024 of anticipated orders from a key client in Germany  and geographically  with the current political unrest in Africa. Nevertheless  the Gorup confirms the sound market trends in France  both for the municipalities and retail sectors backed by the success of its backlit displays.In a such a context  Prismaflex International continues to prioritise improving operating profitability and a positive free-cash-flow despite the current slowdown in activity.Forthcoming dates :2023-2024 six-month results: December 11  2023 after closure.

In an economic environment still marked by a sharp decline in volumes of food consumption expenditure  the group’s retail activity grew in value but posted a slight decline in volumes  as the group’s presence in both the branded product and private label products  coupled with a major targeted promotion campaign  should allow the group to maintain its business activity and market share. Despite this environment  the food service activity remains flat overall in terms of volumes but is growing in value.The fresh processed segment  bagged salads  which is more sensitive to the consumer environment  remains under pressure in Germany and France  while Italy posted growth in terms of both volumes and value. The fresh prepared activity  which is more sensitive to weather conditions  benefited from a particularly dynamic month of September with significant increases in volumes and market share gains.Non-Europe ZoneIn the Non-Europe Zone which accounted for 34.0% of Q1 business activity  declined -0.5% on a like-for-like basis* and -13.2% on reported figures  under the combined effect of the depreciation of the Russian ruble and  to a lesser extent  the weakening of the US dollar versus the euro. On a like-for-like basis*  the activity in the Non-Europe Zone was flat in terms of value and down slightly in volumes  with significant differences in performance between regions.In Eurasia and Mercosur  the canned activity remains sustained in terms of both volumes and value  particularly for the Bonduelle brand  while the frozen activity in Eurasia  which is more marginal  continued to be penalized by market trends.In North America  the salad bowls activity is still in decline  but gained market share again due to a decline in the overall market  while volumes in salad kits (salad bags with ingredients)  supported by innovations  grew in terms of both volumes and value.Other significant informationPublication of the Universal Registration DocumentThe Bonduelle Group announces that its 2022-2023 Universal Registration Document was filed with the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) on October 19  2023.

Changes in the consumer environment  the recovery of the fresh processed activity and the achievement of new price increases designed to compensate for inflation  particularly for agricultural raw materials  observed during the 2023 summer harvest and not offset by operating efficiency gains will be key factors in achieving these targets.* at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis.

Coty continues to deliver on our balanced growth agenda  with strong LFL growth across both divisions and all regions  with growth contribution from volumes and premiumized mix  complemented by targeted pricing  and from our key categories including fragrances  cosmetics  and skincare.While the external environment remains complex and consumers are being considered in their spending  the beauty category remains advantaged  at the nexus of affordable luxury  self-care  and confidence boosting. We remain well positioned to benefit from this strong beauty performance  while capitalizing on the multiple white space opportunities in our portfolio  including female fragrances  ultra premium fragrances  skincare  China and Travel Retail. These opportunities and our strong Q1 delivery enable us to raise our FY24 guidance for the second time this fiscal year.The exceptional performance of our recent fragrance launches  and in particular Burberry Goddess which has become the #1 female fragrance launch in key markets  reaffirms Coty's position as a leading fragrance expert with best in class end-to-end capabilities  from developing a winning scent which resonates with consumers across all regions to activating distinctive marketing campaigns  and launching disruptive in-store and online activations.Even as we invest to fuel our near and medium term growth ambitions  we continue to deliver robust profit growth  cash generation  and deleveraging. Our strong and consistent execution on our strategy and financial framework paved the way for the next major Coty milestone  as we successfully listed our shares and issued equity on the Euronext Paris Exchange  in a substantially oversubscribed transaction. At the same time  we intend to minimize the dilution to less than 1% exiting FY24 by executing the first phase of our equity swap for 27 million shares by the end of Q3. We anticipate further share count reduction in the coming years  by executing the second phase of our equity swap for 23 million shares in FY25 as we continue to target reducing our diluted share count toward 800 million by FY26.In short  on the eve of our 120th anniversary  Coty has returned to our Parisian roots  now providing both U.S. and European investors with the perfect opportunity to join our accelerating growth trajectory and success.""*Adjusted financial metrics used in this release are non-GAAP. See reconciliations of GAAP results to Adjusted results in the accompanying tables.Highlights1Q24 net revenues increased 18% as reported and LFL  fueled by double-digit percentage LFL growth in both Prestige and Consumer Beauty.1Q24 reported operating income grew 15% to $197.5 million.1Q24 adjusted operating income increased 21% to $302.2 million  with an adjusted operating margin of 18.4% reflecting 40 basis points of margin expansion.1Q24 adjusted EBITDA grew 17% to $360.3 million  with the adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.0%.1Q24 reported EPS was $0.00.1Q24 adjusted EPS totaled $0.09  which includes a negative non-operating EPS impact of $0.06 from the mark-to-market on the equity swap due to the stock price decline in the first quarter  as well as a discrete one-time non-cash tax impact of $0.03 from a change in the Swiss statutory rate.Savings totaled approximately $35 million in Q1. Coty continues to target savings of over $100 million in FY24 and $75 million in FY25.1Q24 free cash flow totaled as $124.0 million  up 41% YoY.Financial Net Debt was $3.9 billion and Economic Net Debt totaled $2.9 billion at quarter end  resulting in financial leverage of approximately 3.8x.OutlookSeveral months into FY24  the beauty market remains a strong and outperforming category  with ongoing premiumization trends. Coty continues to benefit from this attractive market dynamic  with momentum across its core categories  strong launch results  and early wins in key white spaces. Against this favorable backdrop and given Coty's strong Q1 delivery  the Company now expects FY24 LFL revenue growth of +9-11%  ahead of its recently raised guidance of +8-10%. For the first half FY24  Coty now expects LFL revenue growth of +11-13%  an increase from its previous outlook of +10-12%. Reported FY24 revenues are expected to include neutral to 2% benefit from FX  primarily in first half of FY24  and a 1-2% scope headwind from the divestiture of the Lacoste license  concentrated in the second half of FY24.Coty is targeting FY24 adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 10-30 bps on the stronger revenue outlook  with similar performance in 1H24 and 2H24. As a result  Coty now sees FY24 adjusted EBITDA of $1 080-1 090M based on current FX rates  above its recently raised EBITDA outlook of $1 075-1 085M. Within this outlook  Coty expects steady improvement in the YoY gross margin trajectory  driving modest FY24 gross margin expansion YoY  with strong expansion in 2H24. Coty continues to target FY24 adjusted EPS  excluding the equity swap  of $0.44-0.47  implying strong +16-25% YoY growth  with the incrementally higher profit outlook balanced by the discrete one-time negative tax impact. As part of Coty's target to manage its diluted share count toward approximately 800 million by FY26  Coty expects to execute a 27 million share buyback in Q3 via its first equity swap and a 23 million buyback in FY25 via its second equity swap.In light of Coty’s strong free cash flow trajectory in first half FY24  its successful Paris dual listing  and given misalignment on final deal terms  Coty and its counterparties have decided to end the partial sale of its Wella stake. Coty remains fully on track to reach its targeted leverage of ~3x exiting CY23 driven by its strong free cash flow trajectory and its successful Paris dual listing  as well as leverage of ~2.5x exiting CY24 and ~2x exiting CY25  as it continues to target the full divestiture of its Wella stake by end of CY25.Financial Results*Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release; reconciliations from reported to adjusted results can be found at the end of this release.Revenues:1Q24 net revenues of $1 641.4 million increased 18% as reported and LFL. This was driven by a 22% LFL increase in Prestige and a 10% LFL increase in Consumer Beauty.Gross Margin:1Q24 reported gross margin of 63.5% decreased 40 basis points from the same period in the prior year  while adjusted gross margin of 63.5% decreased by 60 basis points from 64.1% in 1Q23. The decline in gross margin was driven by COGS inflation of approximately 2% of revenues  a normalization of fragrance gift sets as a percentage of the mix  and increased excess & obsolescence tied to the inventory build-up in the Prestige business to support strong service levels. These impacts were partially offset by targeted pricing  positive mix management and supply chain productivity.Operating Income and EBITDA:1Q24 reported operating income of $197.5 million increased by 15% from the prior year  driven by higher gross profit.1Q24 adjusted operating income of $302.2 million rose 21% from $249.6 million in the prior year  driven by higher gross profit. The adjusted EBITDA of $360.3 million grew 17% from $307.9 million in the prior year  due to higher sales and gross profit  partially offset by higher A&CP.For 1Q24  the adjusted operating margin was 18.4% reflecting 40 basis points of margin expansion  fueled by fixed cost operating leverage  while adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.0% decreased 20 basis points.Net Income:1Q24 reported net loss of $1.7 million decreased from net income of $125.3 million in the prior year  due to a higher benefit in the prior year from a change in Wella's fair value.The 1Q24 adjusted net income of $74.1 million decreased from $92.7 million in the prior year  as the increase in adjusted operating income was more than offset by a $58 million negative impact from the mark-to-market on the equity swap  reflecting a lower Coty share price at the end of Q1 as compared to the beginning of the quarter  as well as a $24 million discrete one-time non-cash tax impact from a change in the Swiss statutory rate.Earnings Per Share (EPS) - diluted:1Q24 reported earnings per share of $0.00 decreased from a reported earnings per share of $0.15 in the prior year  while the 1Q24 adjusted EPS of $0.09 decreased from an adjusted EPS of $0.11 in the prior year.The decline was primarily due to the one-time non-cash discrete tax impact of $0.03 and a higher negative impact from the equity swap mark-to-market of $0.06  compared with a $0.04 negative impact from the mark-to-market on the equity swap in the prior year.Operating Cash Flow:1Q24 cash from operations totaling $186.2 million increased from $163.2 million during the same period in the prior year.1Q24 free cash flow of $124.0 million increased by $35.8 million from free cash flow of $88.2 million in the prior year  driven by the $23.0 million increase in operating cash flow and a $12.8 million decrease in capex.Financial Net Debt:Financial Net Debt of $3 932.1 million on September 30  2023  decreased from $4 034.7 million on June 30  2023  driven by solid free cash flow generation.First Quarter Business Review by Segment*PrestigeIn 1Q24  Prestige net revenues of $1 064.7 million or 65% of Coty sales  increased by 23% on a reported basis and 22% on a LFL basis  supported by strong momentum in prestige beauty demand  which led to double-digit percentage growth in all regions  and outperformance in Americas  APAC and Travel Retail.During Q1  the Prestige fragrance category continued to see robust growth across North America and Europe  with nearly all major markets generating double-digit percentage growth  led by the U.S.  Canada  Germany and Spain.

More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company’s business and financial results is included under the heading “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30  2022 and other periodic reports the Company has filed and may file with the SEC from time to time.All forward-looking statements made in this release are qualified by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this release  and the Company does not undertake any obligation  other than as may be required by applicable law  to update or revise any forward-looking or cautionary statements to reflect changes in assumptions  the occurrence of events  unanticipated or otherwise  or changes in future operating results over time or otherwise.Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance unless expressed as such  and should only be viewed as historical data.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company operates on a global basis  with the majority of net revenues generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect results of operations. Therefore  to supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP  certain financial information is presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how the underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations (“constant currency”). Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period  with the current period’s results calculated at the prior-year period’s rates. The Company calculates constant currency information by translating current and prior-period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company discloses the following constant currency financial measures: net revenues  organic like-for-like (LFL) net revenues  adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income.The Company presents period-over-period comparisons of net revenues on a constant currency basis as well as on an organic (LFL) basis. The Company believes that organic (LFL) better enables management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's net revenues performance from period to period. For the periods described in this release  the term “like-for-like” describes the Company's core operating performance  excluding the financial impact of (i) acquired brands or businesses in the current year period until we have twelve months of comparable financial results  (ii) the divested brands or businesses or early terminated brands  generally  in the prior year non-comparable periods  to maintain comparable financial results with the current fiscal year period and (iii) foreign currency exchange translations to the extent applicable. For a reconciliation of organic (LFL) period-over-period  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Revenues to Like-For-Like Net Revenues”.The Company presents operating income  operating income margin  gross profit  gross margin  effective tax rate  net income  net income margin  net revenues  EBITDA  and EPS (diluted) on a non-GAAP basis and specifies that these measures are non-GAAP by using the term “adjusted” (collectively the Adjusted Performance Measures). The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in tables below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for or superior to  financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Moreover  these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies  including companies in the beauty industry  may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do  limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.Adjusted operating income/Adjusted EBITDA from Coty Inc excludes restructuring costs and business structure realignment programs  amortization  acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts  stock-based compensation  and asset impairment charges and other adjustments as described below. For adjusted EBITDA  in addition to the preceding  we exclude the adjusted depreciation as defined below. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size  nature and significance. They are primarily incurred to realign our operating structure and integrate new acquisitions  and exclude divestitures  and fluctuate based on specific facts and circumstances. Additionally  Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. and Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share are adjusted for certain interest and other (income) expense and deemed preferred stock dividends  as described below  and the related tax effects of each of the items used to derive Adjusted net income as such charges are not used by our management in assessing our operating performance period-to-period.Adjusted Performance Measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:Costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities: The Company has excluded acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and the accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction. Additionally  for divestitures  the Company excludes write-offs of assets that are no longer recoverable and contract related costs due to the divestiture. The nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and divestitures  and the maturities of the businesses being acquired or divested. Also  the size  complexity and/or volume of past transactions  which often drives the magnitude of such expenses  may not be indicative of the size  complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions or divestitures.Restructuring and other business realignment costs: The Company has excluded the costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition  the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from the non-GAAP financial measures  management is able to further evaluate the Company's ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore  our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of operating performance.Asset impairment charges: The Company has excluded the impact of asset impairments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Amortization expense: The Company has excluded the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets  as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Although we exclude amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses  our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.Gain on sale and early license termination: We have excluded the impact of gain on sale and early license termination as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the size of the sale and early license termination.Costs related to market exit: We have excluded the impact of direct incremental costs related to our decision to wind down our business operations in Russia. We believe that these direct and incremental costs are inconsistent and infrequent in nature. Consequently  our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Gains on sale of real estate: The Company has excluded the impact of Gains on sale of real estate as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the size of the sale. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Stock-based compensation: Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees  we have excluded the effect of these expenses from the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA. This is due to their primarily non-cash nature; in addition  the amount and timing of these expenses may be highly variable and unpredictable  which may negatively affect comparability between periods.Depreciation and Adjusted depreciation: Our adjusted operating income excludes the impact of accelerated depreciation for certain restructuring projects that affect the expected useful lives of Property  Plant and Equipment  as such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. Further  we have excluded adjusted depreciation  which represents depreciation expense net of accelerated depreciation charges  from our adjusted EBITDA. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Other (income) expense: We have excluded the impact of pension curtailment (gains) and losses and pension settlements as such events are triggered by our restructuring and other business realignment activities and the amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. Further  we have excluded the change in fair value of the investment in Wella  as well as expenses related to potential or actual sales transactions reducing equity investments  as our management believes these unrealized (gains) and losses do not reflect our underlying ongoing business  and the adjustment of such impact helps investors and others compare and analyze performance from period to period. We have excluded the gain on the exchange of Series B Preferred Stock. Such transactions do not reflect our operating results and we have excluded the impact as our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Noncontrolling interest: This adjustment represents the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests based on the relevant noncontrolling interest percentage.Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from Adjusted net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred. Additionally  adjustments are made for the tax impact of any intra-entity transfer of assets and liabilities.Deemed Preferred Stock Dividends: The Company has excluded preferred stock deemed dividends related to the First Exchange and the Second Exchange from our calculation of adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. These deemed dividends are non-monetary in nature  the transactions were entered into to simplify our capital structure and do not reflect our underlying ongoing business. Management believes that this adjustment helps investors and others compare and analyze our performance from period to period.The Company has provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measures and the financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of adjusted gross profit to gross profit  adjusted EPS (diluted) to EPS (diluted)  and adjusted net revenues to net revenues  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported to Adjusted Results for the Consolidated Statements of Operations.” For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to operating income and adjusted operating income margin to operating income margin  see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income (Loss) to Adjusted Operating Income” and ""Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income (Loss) to Adjusted Operating Income by Segment."" For a reconciliation of adjusted effective tax rate to effective tax rate  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates to Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes and Adjusted Effective Tax Rates.” For a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income margin to net income (loss)  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income.”The Company also presents free cash flow  adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization (""adjusted EBITDA"")  immediate liquidity  Financial Net Debt and Economic Net Debt. Management believes that these measures are useful for investors because it provides them with an important perspective on the cash available for debt repayment and other strategic measures and provides them with the same measures that management uses as the basis for making resource allocation decisions. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures; adjusted EBITDA is defined as adjusted operating income  excluding adjusted depreciation and non-cash stock-based compensation. Net debt or Financial Net Debt (which the Company referred to as ""net debt"" in prior reporting periods) is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents  and Economic Net Debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents less the value of the Wella Stake. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow ” for adjusted EBITDA  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income to Adjusted EBITDA” and for Financial Net Debt and Economic Net Debt  see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Total Debt to Financial Net Debt and Economic Net Debt.” Further  our immediate liquidity is defined as the sum of available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (please see table ""Immediate Liquidity"").These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.To the extent that the Company provides guidance  it does so only on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation  including adjustments that could be made for restructuring  integration and acquisition-related expenses  amortization expenses  non-cash stock-based compensation  adjustments to inventory  and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers  the amount of which  based on historical experience  could be significant.- Tables Follow -COTY INC.SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULES INCLUDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESRESULTS AT A GLANCE Three Months Ended September 30  2023 (in millions  except per share data) Change YoY COTY  INC.

Q3 2023 costs positively impacted by FX rate. Full-year 2023 costs expected to be lower than guidance.Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Milan  Oslo and Paris – 8 November 2023 – Euronext  the leading pan-European market infrastructure  today publishes its results for the third quarter of 2023.Q3 2023 revenue and income was €360.2 million  up +2.8% compared to Q3 2022 underlying revenue and income (+19.5% compared to Q3 2022 total revenue and income): Strong performance of non-volume-related business : Technology Solutions reported €27.4 million of revenue (+5.5% 1 )  thanks to the continued benefits from the internalisation of colocation services following the migration of the Core Data Centre to Bergamo and the good performance of Nord Pool technology activities. Advanced Data Services reported €55.5 million of revenue (+4.7%)  reflecting growth in market data and continued strong performance of the advanced data solutions business. Custody and Settlement reported €58.9 million of revenue (+3.1%) as new services and growing assets under custody offset lower settlement activity and the negative impact of the NOK 2 depreciation. Like-for-like at constant currencies  revenue was up +6.5%. Listing reported €54.6 million of revenue (+1.1%)  resulting from Corporate Services activities and sustained leadership position for listing in Europe  partially offset by the NOK depreciation. Euronext welcomed 23 new listings  representing 72% of the new listings in Europe in Q3 2023. Like-for-like at constant currencies  revenue was up +3.4%. Non-volume-related revenue accounted for 60% of Q3 2023 revenue (vs. 53% in Q3 2022) and covered 148% of underlying operating expenses  excluding D&A (vs. 106% in Q3 2022). Clearing revenue was €29.5 million (+1.6%)  reflecting dynamic bond clearing activities and solid derivatives clearing activities offsetting softer equities clearing volumes  and NTI were at €13.7 million. Trading revenue was solid  at €118.3 million (+0.4%)  resulting from Euronext’s diversified trading activities and strengthened leadership in cash trading in a low volatility environment for equities trading. Strong organic growth was recorded in fixed income trading (€25.4 million  up +18.7%) and power trading (€8.6 million  up +10.0%)  more than offsetting lower cash trading revenue (€64.4 million  -4.4%). Cash equity market share averaged 66.5% in Q3 2023 and revenue capture averaged 0.54 bps  above indicated floors.Adjusted EBITDA 3 was €213.7 million (+6.9%) and adjusted EBITDA margin reached 59.3% (+2.3pts): Underlying operating expenses  excluding D&A  were at €146.5 million (-2.6%)  primarily resulting from continued cost discipline and the positive impact of foreign exchanges rates. Considering the current foreign exchange rate of the NOK  Euronext expects a full-year positive impact of €12 million from the NOK depreciation on the cost base. Consequently  Euronext expects its underlying costs excluding D&A to be lower than its 2023 underlying costs excluding D&A guidance of €630 million.Adjusted net income was €146.5 million (+13.2%) and adjusted EPS was €1.38 (+13.7%).Reported net income was €166.5 million (+119.6%)  reflecting the €41.6 million capital gain following the disposal of Euronext 11.1% stake in LCH SA  the positive comparison base from the non-underlying one-off loss in net treasury income in Q3 2022 related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing investment portfolio 4 and positive net financing income.Key figures for Q3 2023:Story continuesIn €m  unless stated otherwise Q3 2023 Q3 2022 % var % varl-f-l5 Revenue and income 360.2 301.4 +19.5% +21.3% Underlying revenue and income 360.2 350.3 +2.8% +4.1% Underlying operational expenses excluding D&A2 (146.5) (150.4) -2.6% +0.1% Adjusted EBITDA 213.7 199.9 +6.9% +7.0% Adjusted EBITDA margin 59.3% 57.1% +2.3pts +1.6pts Net income  share of the parent company shareholders 166.5 75.8 +119.6% Adjusted Net income  share of the parent company shareholders 146.5 129.5 +13.2% Adjusted EPS (basic  in €) 1.38 1.21 +13.7% Reported EPS (basic  in €) 1.57 0.71 +120.5% Adjusted EPS (diluted  in €) 1.38 1.21 +13.6% Reported EPS (diluted  in €) 1.56 0.71 +120.4%Net debt to reported EBITDA was at 2.2x at the end of Q3 2023 (vs. 2.6x at end of Q2 2023)  and net debt to adjusted EBITDA was at 2.0x.Major achievements in Q3 2023 for the Borsa Italiana Group integration  delivering synergies in line with announced schedule: €47.6 million of cumulated run-rate annual EBITDA synergies were achieved since the acquisition of Borsa Italiana Group in April 2021  of which €3.4 million were delivered in Q3 2023. €4.9 million of implementation costs were incurred during Q3 2023. This brings to €95.1 million the cumulated implementation costs incurred since the beginning of the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. The migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext’s Optiq ® trading platform was completed by the migration of Borsa Italiana Fixed Income  Warrants and Certificates markets on 11 September 2023. This trading platform migration was the second milestone in the three phases of the major Borsa Italiana markets migration to the Optiq trading platform. Cash markets in all seven Euronext countries are now integrated on the same trading platform  allowing for the decommissioning of Borsa Italiana’s third-party-provided cash trading platform in Q4 2023. The third phase will see the migration of derivatives instruments to the Optiq trading platform  targeted for the first quarter of 2024. A new VaR-based margin methodology for Euronext Clearing was introduced on the Euronext Milan equities  ETF and financial derivatives markets on 16 October 2023 6 . In addition  the first phase of the European expansion of Euronext Clearing was successfully delivered with Euronext Clearing positioned as the default CCP for the Euronext Brussels cash markets since 6 November 2023. Together with the second phase of the European expansion of Euronext Clearing with the cash equity clearing operation extended to other Euronext cash equity markets 7 clearing flows in Q4 2023 as expected  this new activity will significantly contribute to the 2023 run-rate cumulative synergies target of €70 million.Continued delivery of new innovative trading solutions for clients: Euronext will expand its Global Equity Market (GEM) retail offering for pan-European and US stocks on 13 November 2023. Retail brokers and investors trading from Euronext’s markets in Europe and beyond will then have access to trade 350+ pan-European and US securities  in addition to the 1 900 listed stocks already available on Euronext. Euronext GEM benefits from a smooth and efficient post-trade set-up through Euronext Clearing and Euronext Securities. Euronext announces that the European Union has nominated MTS as a recognized interdealer platform for the implementation of electronic market making on European Union issued debt instruments. This new market was launched very successfully early November  and traded volumes and dealer participation have been very dynamic.Stéphane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:“Euronext’s Q3 2023 results demonstrate the success of our diversification strategy. Q3 2023 underlying revenues grew by +2.8% to €360.2 million. Robust organic growth across our non-volume related businesses and double-digit growth in our power and fixed income activities more than offset negative FX impacts and softer cash trading activities. Euronext’s adjusted EBITDA grew by +6.9% in Q3 2023 to €213.7 million  resulting from this solid operating performance  combined with our best-in-class cost discipline as well as positive FX impacts on our costs. Considering the current foreign exchange rate dynamics  we also expect our underlying costs for the full year to be lower than guided at the beginning of the year. As a result of this strong performance and thanks to the €41.6 million capital gain realised through the disposal of Euronext’s 11.1% stake in LCH SA  our reported EPS more than doubled in Q3 20231  to €1.57.Euronext strengthened its position as the leading venue for equity listing and trading in Europe. We welcomed 72% of the new equity listings in Europe this quarter. Notably  the US-based beauty company Coty dual-listed on Euronext Paris to expand its exposure to European investors. In a softer environment in equity trading  we remained the go-to trading venue in Europe  providing best-in-class liquidity  with a market share averaging 66.5% over the quarter and an increased revenue capture. Our leadership in cash trading has been achieved thanks to the excellent work of our cash team led by Simon Gallagher. I am thrilled to announce that Simon Gallagher will continue to drive client centricity in the City and across Europe as newly appointed Head of Global Sales for Euronext and CEO of Euronext London.We delivered several milestones in our ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan in Q3 2023. We completed the second phase of the trading migration of Italian markets to our proprietary trading platform Optiq. Cash markets from all of our seven exchanges in Europe are now integrated on the same trading platform. I am also proud today to announce the completion of the first step in the expansion of Euronext Clearing to all our markets. Since 6 November  Euronext Clearing is the default clearing house for equity trading in Brussels  and the remaining markets will follow later this month. This strategic milestone will significantly contribute to the targeted delivery of €70 million of cumulated run-rate pre-tax synergies by year end. In addition  our European cross-selling efforts continue to yield with the launch of MTS EU on 1 November 2023  which has shown very dynamic initial activity both in terms of traded volumes and participants.”■ Euronext Q3 2023 financial performanceIn €m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

In addition  transitional revenue was negatively impacted by a non-recurring credit note.On a reported basis  total revenue and income was up +19.5%  reflecting notably the positive comparison base of the non-underlying one-off loss of €49.0 million in net treasury income in Q3 2022 related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing investment portfolio9.Non-volume related revenue accounted for 60% of Group revenue in Q3 2023  compared to 53% in Q3 2022  reflecting the successful diversification towards non-volume related activities and low volatility environment for cash trading. The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage ratio by non-volume related revenue was at 148% in Q3 2023  compared to 106% in Q3 2022.On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was up +21.3%.Q3 2023 adjusted EBITDAUnderlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation decreased to €146.5 million  down -2.6%  reflecting strong cost discipline in an inflationary environment and positive FX impact from the depreciation of the NOK over the year.Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled €213.7 million  up +6.9% compared to Q3 2022  resulting from the solid quarter for non-volume related activities  fixed income and power trading  and post-trade revenue combined with Euronext’s continued cost discipline. As a result  adjusted EBITDA margin reached 59.3%  up +2.3 points compared to Q3 2022.The reported EBITDA was at €206.6 million  up +39.3% compared to Q3 2022  reflecting the strong performance in Q3 2023 and the non-underlying one-off loss of €49.0 million in net treasury income in Q3 2022. The reported EBITDA margin grew to 57.3%  up +8.1 points year on year.Q3 2023 net income  share of the parent company shareholdersDepreciation and amortisation amounted to €41.9 million in Q3 2023  an increase of +7.8% compared to Q3 2022  resulting from ongoing migration projects. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for €20.5 million.Adjusted operating profit was €195.4 million  a +6.3% increase compared to Q3 2022.€30.7 million of non-underlying expenses  including depreciation and amortisation  were reported in Q3 2023  related to the ongoing migration projects and PPA.Net financing income for Q3 2023 was €1.5 million  compared to a net financing expense of €4.6 million in Q3 2022. This decrease reflects higher interest income from cash held offsetting the cost of issued debt.Results from equity investments amounted to €54.4 million in Q3 2023  resulting from a dividend received from Euroclear and from a €41.6 million tax-exempted non-underlying capital gain in relation to the disposal of Euronext’s 11.1% stake in LCH SA. As a reminder  following this disposal the Group will not record any contribution from LCH SA from Q3 2023 in results from equity investments.Income tax for Q3 2023 was €48.4 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 22.0% for the quarter  primarily reflecting the positive impact of the tax-exempted one-off capital gain from the disposal of the LCH SA stake (Q3 2022: €27.9 million and 26.2% respectively).Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to -€5.6 million in Q3 2023.Consequently  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  increased by +119.6% for Q3 2023 compared to Q3 2022  to €166.5 million. This represents a reported EPS of €1.57 basic and €1.56 fully diluted in Q3 2023  compared to €0.71 basic and €0.71 fully diluted in Q3 2022.Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was up +13.2% to €146.5 million. Consequently  adjusted EPS (basic) was up +13.7% in Q3 2023  at €1.38 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of €1.21 per share in Q3 2022.The weighted number of shares over the first nine months of 2023 used for EPS computation was 106 563 821 for the basic calculation and 106 844 622 for the fully diluted calculation  slightly decreasing from the first nine months of 2022 as a result of the ongoing share repurchase programme.In Q3 2023  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of €174.5 million  compared to €318.1 million in Q3 2022  reflecting lower change in working capital. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities  net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 100.7% of EBITDA in Q3 2023.Business highlightsListingListing revenue  in €m unless stated otherwise Q3 2023 Q3 2022 % change Listing revenue 54.6 54.0 +1.1% Equity 26.8 27.4 -0.7% Annual fees 17.2 16.9 +1.6% Follow-ons 5.8 5.4 +9.1% IPOs 3.8 5.1 -26.0% Debts 8.5 8.6 -1.6% ETFs  Funds & Warrants 5.8 5.6 +3.1% Corporate Services 10.6 9.4 +12.5% Others 3.0 3.0 -1.7% Money raised 267 412 177 660 +50.5%Listing revenue was €54.6 million in Q3 2023  up +1.1% compared to Q3 2022  reflecting a resilient quarter for listing and follow-on activity and strong traction of the SaaS Corporate Services offering  absorbing the negative impact of the NOK.Euronext’s primary equity listing business sustained its leading position in Europe with 23 new listings in Q3 2023  out of 32 new listings  representing 72% of the listing activity in Europe.

This marks a major milestone in the journey to integrating all Borsa Italiana markets into the Euronext Optiq platform  as the Italian cash markets are all now live. This phase of the trading migration brought across Borsa Italiana’s three fixed income markets: MOT  the regulated market designed to facilitate access to the bond market for private investors; Euronext Access Milan (formerly ExtraMOT)  a multilateral trading facility (MTF) for professional investors that offers trading in bonds listed in other EU markets as well as Italian bonds  particularly those issued by SMEs; and EuroTLX  an MTF targeted specifically to non-professional and professional investors trading in retail-size fixed income securities. Also included in the scope was the Borsa Italiana SeDeX market  for retail investors trading certificates and covered warrants  collectively known as securitised derivatives products. Migrating the Borsa Italiana markets onto one platform gives investors in Italy the opportunity to trade a much wider range of products  while issuers of financial instruments gain access to a broad investor base across Europe and internationally  through all seven Euronext marketplaces. Likewise  European investors can benefit from trading Italian products through the Euronext platform.This successful migration means that two of the three phases in the major Borsa Italiana markets migration to the Optiq platform are complete  and the cash markets in all seven Euronext countries are now integrated on the same trading platform. The third phase will see the migration of derivatives instruments  and is targeted for the first quarter of 2024.Corporate highlights since 30 September 2023Euronext Clearing introduces innovative VaR-based margin methodology for Italian equities  ETF and financial derivatives marketsEuronext Clearing announced on 23 October 2023 the introduction of the new VaR-based margin methodology on the Euronext Milan equities  ETF and financial derivatives markets.

These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable IFRS measures and should be read only in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.Non-volume-related revenue definitionNon-volume-related revenue includes Listing (excluding IPOs)  Advanced Data Services  Custody & Settlement and other Post-Trade  fixed revenue from the Clearing activities (including for instance NTI and membership fees)  Investor Services  Technology Solutions  Other Income and Transitional Revenue.Adjusted EPS definitionQ3 2023 Q3 2022 Net income reported 166.5 75.8 EPS reported 1.57 0.71 Adjustments of which revenues 0.0 (48.9) of which Operating expenses exc.
