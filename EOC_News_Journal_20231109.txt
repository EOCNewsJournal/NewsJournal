Those who run the shelter hope to get a new building to update services  with new tax rate. Kelly Wilkinson  Indianapolis StarThe Indianapolis Animal Care Services shelter is getting a new facility at a former public housing complex  located at 5001 E. Raymond Street  Mayor Joe Hogsett announced Thursday morning.Owned by the Indianapolis Housing Agency  the Clearstream site has been vacant for nearly two decades. The city said it is collaborating with the agency and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on final terms for property transfer  which will be funded through city funds.The new shelter will be located in the 46203 zip code  the second-highest zip code for stray pick-ups and animal control-related runs  according to the city. The adjacent 46201 zip code takes the top spot for that.The approximately $30 million facility will be funded by a $19 million bond approved by the City-County Council; $6.7 million raised by the nonprofit that financially supports the shelter  Friends of Indy Animals; a $3 million grant from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust; a $1 million investment from the Lilly Endowment and a $1 million gift from the Irsay family and the Indianapolis Colts  among other sources.The facility  which is still being designed  will include a shelter  barn  dog park and garage.The current city-run animal shelter at Harding Street has long faced problems of dire overcrowding and staff have previously told IndyStar that the outdated building is falling apart and wasn't designed for housing animals for a long period of time.Upon opening the new facility  the city said the current Harding Street shelter will close.Indianapolis animal welfare: Indy's animal shelter faces 'dire' overcrowding. How to help even if you don't adopt.“With a new location  we are able to accelerate progress on a new facility while continuing our remediation and development commitments on the Near Eastside ” Hogsett  who is running for reelection Nov. 7  wrote in a news release. “This new site will bring a community resource to a vacant lot while serving Indy zip codes with some of the highest animal care needs in the city.”Hogsett's Republican challenger for mayor  Jefferson Shreve  said in response to Thursday's announcement that the timing of the announcement is no accident.Indianapolis mayoral election 2023: Everything you need to know before voting for Indianapolis mayor""This is dirty politics at its lowest  with animals being used as collateral to protect Joe Hogsett’s tenuous hold on political power "" Shreve wrote in a statement.Previous site for animal shelter at Sherman Park turned out problematicMonday night  at a televised mayoral debate on WISH-TV  Shreve pressed Hogsett on what he said was the mayor's failure to deliver on the promise for a new animal care services shelter.Hogsett had announced in August 2022 that the city would build a new animal shelter on Sherman Park  a former RCA plant. But the Sherman Park site turned out to be problematic  delaying construction  Hogsett said at the debate Monday  adding that he was frustrated that the project is not yet underway.Mayoral candidate Shreve has made animal welfare a campaign issueShreve has made animal welfare a key campaign priority  pledging in early October to improve the animal shelter and donate his entire salary  if elected mayor  to the nonprofit that financially supports the shelter.He has drawn attention to the euthanization of dogs and cats at the shelter. From January to September this year  1101 animals were euthanized.Indianapolis mayoral election 2023: Shreve pledges to improve animal shelter  donate salary  if elected mayorHogsett has defended his record on animal welfare  pointing to how the live release rate of animals has increased during his tenure. In 2015  about 81% of animals were adopted or released alive. In 2022  the number was 87%.Meanwhile  Shreve has rebutted that the live release rate has only increased because the shelter is taking in fewer animals with an appointment-only policy.The election is Nov. 7. Early voting is underway.Contact IndyStar reporter Ko Lyn Cheang at kcheang@indystar.com or 317-903-7071.

In response  Moscow froze some assets belonging to foreign investors and companies.Russians will be able to exchange frozen assets abroad up to a value of 100 000 rubles ($1 100) with funds from so-called Type C accounts that were held by foreigners in Russia  AFP reports. The owner of the Type C account  typically a foreign company  will then have the option of receiving a foreign share abroad that was owned by a Russian investor.From the archives (August 2023): Unilever CEO vows to look at Russian operations with ‘fresh eyes’ as pressure to exit the country mountsEuropean clearinghouse Clearstream has not yet responded to MarketWatch’s request for comment on whether it would cooperate on an exchange of shares.

This innovative service is slated for release in 2024 and represents HSBC's deeper foray into the realm of digital finance.Ripple Labs  through its acquisition of the tech firm Metaco  will be instrumental in ensuring the secure storage of digital assets. This service is not standalone; it will enhance HSBC's existing digital asset solutions  like the HSBC Orion platform for asset issuance and the recently unveiled tokenized gold system. The latter is particularly notable  employing distributed ledger technology to digitally represent the ownership of physical gold in HSBC's London vaults.HSBC's venture into the digital custody domain is part of a broader trend among major financial institutions experimenting with blockchain to commercialize its applications. With the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co and Euroclear making headway into blockchain utilization for client collateral settlements and securities issuance  respectively  HSBC is joining a forward-thinking league aiming to transform traditional finance.AdvertisementDigital asset custody  a burgeoning niche within the finance sector  is witnessing an upsurge in interest from heavyweights  signaling robust opportunities for start-ups in this space. Ripple's anticipation that the institutional crypto custody market may balloon to a staggering $10 trillion by 2030 reflects the immense potential this collaboration harbors.This partnership also casts light on the dynamic landscape of digital asset services  where other major players like Citigroup Inc are exploring alliances  and State Street Corp recently ended a licensing deal with a crypto custody firm.

Indeed  this annual event largely accounts for France's centrality in this niche market. In 2022  French auction houses generated 11% of the art photography segment's global auction turnover  a contribution that was almost twice that of its contribution to other artistic mediums at the global level (5.9%).Auction turnover from photographs in France and around the world [ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/11/image1-artmarket-com-photography-at-auction-turnover-france-vs-world-artprice.png ]László Moholy-Nagy -Untitled  Berlin (1922)  sold on 20 October 2023 at Christie's in Paris for $93 400 (Estimated: $160 000 – $260 000)[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/11/image2-artmarket-com-laszlo-moholy-nagy-untitled-berlin-2022-christies-paris-october-2023-20-usd-93-400.jpeg ]thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice: “Paris Photo has become the essential fair for all sectors of photography: this 27th edition of the fair will host international galleries (Pace  Gagosian…) in historic places (Camera Obscura  Le Réverbère…)  press agencies (Magnum  Aperture…)  publishing houses (Actes Sud  Hatje Cantz...)  experimental projects (L'Avant Galerie Vossen  laCollection.io...) as well as the work of numerous photographers (Kristine Potter  Omar Victor Diop...).“We have always been dedicated to endorsing Paris Photo  especially in 2000 when we proudly served as the main sponsor  supporting Rik Gadella in the development of the show "" thierry Ehrmann recalls.The popularity of the photography medium is primarily due to its accessibility: the average price for a photographic work is $6 000 at auction  compared to $41 000 for a painting and $23 000 for a sculpture. This accessibility is partly due to their reproducible nature; photos usually exist in several copies  sometimes in different sizes  which can be exchanged regularly or have equivalents in highly prestigious collections. NFT technology opens up new avenues for informing and reassuring collectors about the quantities of works in circulation.Return to the big names in traditional photographyWith 24 100 lots sold worldwide in 2022 (including 5 000 in France)  sales of photographs represented 3.4% of the total number of fine art auction transactions around the world and generated a total of $147 million. But it was only the 11th best year for this medium  whose turnover reached a record $220 million in 2014. Despite two historic results – for Man Ray's Le Violon d'Ingres (1924) at $12.4 million (Christie's New York on 14 May 2022) and for Edward Steichen's The Flatiron (1904) at $11.8 million (Christie's New York on 9 November 2022) – the high-end photography market is no longer as buoyant as it was ten years ago: there were only six results above the million-dollar threshold in 2022 compared with thirteen in 2014.Since 2020  hard hit by the health crisis  the photography market has nevertheless returned to growth  driven by the big names of the 20th century rather than by the superstars of Contemporary photography. This change in collectors' preferences is particularly noticeable for Andreas Gursky  notably through the results of Pyongyang IV (2007) of which seven very large copies were printed (304 x 207 cm):14/02/2008 : 1 375 000 $ (estimated: $300 000 - $400 000)15/10/2010 : 2 128 000 $ (estimated: $800 000 - $1 120 000 $)11/11/2015 : 1 390 000 $ (estimated: $1 200 000 $ - $1 800 000 $)10/15/2021: Not sold (estimated: $440 000 - $578 000)06/28/2023: Not sold (estimated: $253 000 - $380 000)https://fr.artprice.com/artiste/81985/andreas-gursky/lots/passes?height=304&keyword=Pyongyang%20IV&p=1&percent=5&sort=datesale_aschttps://www.artprice.com/artiste/81985/andreas-gursky/lots/passes?height=304&keyword=Pyongyang%20IV&p=1&percent=5&sort=datesale_ascRichard Avedon  new ‘top-seller'At Paris Photo 2023  the Gagosian Gallery will be presenting works by William Eggleston (1939)  Sally Mann (1951)  and Richard Avedon (1923-2004).

Q3 2023 costs positively impacted by FX rate. Full-year 2023 costs expected to be lower than guidance.Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Milan  Oslo and Paris – 8 November 2023 – Euronext  the leading pan-European market infrastructure  today publishes its results for the third quarter of 2023.Q3 2023 revenue and income was €360.2 million  up +2.8% compared to Q3 2022 underlying revenue and income (+19.5% compared to Q3 2022 total revenue and income): Strong performance of non-volume-related business : Technology Solutions reported €27.4 million of revenue (+5.5% 1 )  thanks to the continued benefits from the internalisation of colocation services following the migration of the Core Data Centre to Bergamo and the good performance of Nord Pool technology activities. Advanced Data Services reported €55.5 million of revenue (+4.7%)  reflecting growth in market data and continued strong performance of the advanced data solutions business. Custody and Settlement reported €58.9 million of revenue (+3.1%) as new services and growing assets under custody offset lower settlement activity and the negative impact of the NOK 2 depreciation. Like-for-like at constant currencies  revenue was up +6.5%. Listing reported €54.6 million of revenue (+1.1%)  resulting from Corporate Services activities and sustained leadership position for listing in Europe  partially offset by the NOK depreciation. Euronext welcomed 23 new listings  representing 72% of the new listings in Europe in Q3 2023. Like-for-like at constant currencies  revenue was up +3.4%. Non-volume-related revenue accounted for 60% of Q3 2023 revenue (vs. 53% in Q3 2022) and covered 148% of underlying operating expenses  excluding D&A (vs. 106% in Q3 2022). Clearing revenue was €29.5 million (+1.6%)  reflecting dynamic bond clearing activities and solid derivatives clearing activities offsetting softer equities clearing volumes  and NTI were at €13.7 million. Trading revenue was solid  at €118.3 million (+0.4%)  resulting from Euronext’s diversified trading activities and strengthened leadership in cash trading in a low volatility environment for equities trading. Strong organic growth was recorded in fixed income trading (€25.4 million  up +18.7%) and power trading (€8.6 million  up +10.0%)  more than offsetting lower cash trading revenue (€64.4 million  -4.4%). Cash equity market share averaged 66.5% in Q3 2023 and revenue capture averaged 0.54 bps  above indicated floors.Adjusted EBITDA 3 was €213.7 million (+6.9%) and adjusted EBITDA margin reached 59.3% (+2.3pts): Underlying operating expenses  excluding D&A  were at €146.5 million (-2.6%)  primarily resulting from continued cost discipline and the positive impact of foreign exchanges rates. Considering the current foreign exchange rate of the NOK  Euronext expects a full-year positive impact of €12 million from the NOK depreciation on the cost base. Consequently  Euronext expects its underlying costs excluding D&A to be lower than its 2023 underlying costs excluding D&A guidance of €630 million.Adjusted net income was €146.5 million (+13.2%) and adjusted EPS was €1.38 (+13.7%).Reported net income was €166.5 million (+119.6%)  reflecting the €41.6 million capital gain following the disposal of Euronext 11.1% stake in LCH SA  the positive comparison base from the non-underlying one-off loss in net treasury income in Q3 2022 related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing investment portfolio 4 and positive net financing income.reflecting the €41.6 million capital gain following the disposal of Euronext 11.1% stake in LCH SA  the positive comparison base from the non-underlying one-off loss in net treasury income in Q3 2022 related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing investment portfolio and positive net financing income.

This brings to €95.1 million the cumulated implementation costs incurred since the beginning of the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. The migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext’s Optiq ® trading platform was completed by the migration of Borsa Italiana Fixed Income  Warrants and Certificates markets on 11 September 2023. This trading platform migration was the second milestone in the three phases of the major Borsa Italiana markets migration to the Optiq trading platform. Cash markets in all seven Euronext countries are now integrated on the same trading platform  allowing for the decommissioning of Borsa Italiana’s third-party-provided cash trading platform in Q4 2023. The third phase will see the migration of derivatives instruments to the Optiq trading platform  targeted for the first quarter of 2024. A new VaR-based margin methodology for Euronext Clearing was introduced on the Euronext Milan equities  ETF and financial derivatives markets on 16 October 2023 6 . In addition  the first phase of the European expansion of Euronext Clearing was successfully delivered with Euronext Clearing positioned as the default CCP for the Euronext Brussels cash markets since 6 November 2023. Together with the second phase of the European expansion of Euronext Clearing with the cash equity clearing operation extended to other Euronext cash equity markets 7 clearing flows in Q4 2023 as expected  this new activity will significantly contribute to the 2023 run-rate cumulative synergies target of €70 million.Continued delivery of new innovative trading solutions for clients: Euronext will expand its Global Equity Market (GEM) retail offering for pan-European and US stocks on 13 November 2023. Retail brokers and investors trading from Euronext’s markets in Europe and beyond will then have access to trade 350+ pan-European and US securities  in addition to the 1 900 listed stocks already available on Euronext. Euronext GEM benefits from a smooth and efficient post-trade set-up through Euronext Clearing and Euronext Securities. Euronext announces that the European Union has nominated MTS as a recognized interdealer platform for the implementation of electronic market making on European Union issued debt instruments. This new market was launched very successfully early November  and traded volumes and dealer participation have been very dynamic.Stéphane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:“Euronext’s Q3 2023 results demonstrate the success of our diversification strategy. Q3 2023 underlying revenues grew by +2.8% to €360.2 million. Robust organic growth across our non-volume related businesses and double-digit growth in our power and fixed income activities more than offset negative FX impacts and softer cash trading activities. Euronext’s adjusted EBITDA grew by +6.9% in Q3 2023 to €213.7 million  resulting from this solid operating performance  combined with our best-in-class cost discipline as well as positive FX impacts on our costs. Considering the current foreign exchange rate dynamics  we also expect our underlying costs for the full year to be lower than guided at the beginning of the year. As a result of this strong performance and thanks to the €41.6 million capital gain realised through the disposal of Euronext’s 11.1% stake in LCH SA  our reported EPS more than doubled in Q3 20231  to €1.57.Euronext strengthened its position as the leading venue for equity listing and trading in Europe. We welcomed 72% of the new equity listings in Europe this quarter. Notably  the US-based beauty company Coty dual-listed on Euronext Paris to expand its exposure to European investors. In a softer environment in equity trading  we remained the go-to trading venue in Europe  providing best-in-class liquidity  with a market share averaging 66.5% over the quarter and an increased revenue capture. Our leadership in cash trading has been achieved thanks to the excellent work of our cash team led by Simon Gallagher. I am thrilled to announce that Simon Gallagher will continue to drive client centricity in the City and across Europe as newly appointed Head of Global Sales for Euronext and CEO of Euronext London.We delivered several milestones in our ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan in Q3 2023. We completed the second phase of the trading migration of Italian markets to our proprietary trading platform Optiq. Cash markets from all of our seven exchanges in Europe are now integrated on the same trading platform. I am also proud today to announce the completion of the first step in the expansion of Euronext Clearing to all our markets. Since 6 November  Euronext Clearing is the default clearing house for equity trading in Brussels  and the remaining markets will follow later this month. This strategic milestone will significantly contribute to the targeted delivery of €70 million of cumulated run-rate pre-tax synergies by year end. In addition  our European cross-selling efforts continue to yield with the launch of MTS EU on 1 November 2023  which has shown very dynamic initial activity both in terms of traded volumes and participants.”■ Euronext Q3 2023 financial performanceIn €m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

In addition  transitional revenue was negatively impacted by a non-recurring credit note.On a reported basis  total revenue and income was up +19.5%  reflecting notably the positive comparison base of the non-underlying one-off loss of €49.0 million in net treasury income in Q3 2022 related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing investment portfolio9.Non-volume related revenue accounted for 60% of Group revenue in Q3 2023  compared to 53% in Q3 2022  reflecting the successful diversification towards non-volume related activities and low volatility environment for cash trading. The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage ratio by non-volume related revenue was at 148% in Q3 2023  compared to 106% in Q3 2022.On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was up +21.3%.Q3 2023 adjusted EBITDAUnderlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation decreased to €146.5 million  down -2.6%  reflecting strong cost discipline in an inflationary environment and positive FX impact from the depreciation of the NOK over the year.Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled €213.7 million  up +6.9% compared to Q3 2022  resulting from the solid quarter for non-volume related activities  fixed income and power trading  and post-trade revenue combined with Euronext’s continued cost discipline. As a result  adjusted EBITDA margin reached 59.3%  up +2.3 points compared to Q3 2022.The reported EBITDA was at €206.6 million  up +39.3% compared to Q3 2022  reflecting the strong performance in Q3 2023 and the non-underlying one-off loss of €49.0 million in net treasury income in Q3 2022. The reported EBITDA margin grew to 57.3%  up +8.1 points year on year.Q3 2023 net income  share of the parent company shareholdersDepreciation and amortisation amounted to €41.9 million in Q3 2023  an increase of +7.8% compared to Q3 2022  resulting from ongoing migration projects. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for €20.5 million.Adjusted operating profit was €195.4 million  a +6.3% increase compared to Q3 2022.€30.7 million of non-underlying expenses  including depreciation and amortisation  were reported in Q3 2023  related to the ongoing migration projects and PPA.Net financing income for Q3 2023 was €1.5 million  compared to a net financing expense of €4.6 million in Q3 2022. This decrease reflects higher interest income from cash held offsetting the cost of issued debt.Results from equity investments amounted to €54.4 million in Q3 2023  resulting from a dividend received from Euroclear and from a €41.6 million tax-exempted non-underlying capital gain in relation to the disposal of Euronext’s 11.1% stake in LCH SA. As a reminder  following this disposal the Group will not record any contribution from LCH SA from Q3 2023 in results from equity investments.Income tax for Q3 2023 was €48.4 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 22.0% for the quarter  primarily reflecting the positive impact of the tax-exempted one-off capital gain from the disposal of the LCH SA stake (Q3 2022: €27.9 million and 26.2% respectively).Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to -€5.6 million in Q3 2023.Consequently  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  increased by +119.6% for Q3 2023 compared to Q3 2022  to €166.5 million. This represents a reported EPS of €1.57 basic and €1.56 fully diluted in Q3 2023  compared to €0.71 basic and €0.71 fully diluted in Q3 2022.Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was up +13.2% to €146.5 million. Consequently  adjusted EPS (basic) was up +13.7% in Q3 2023  at €1.38 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of €1.21 per share in Q3 2022.The weighted number of shares over the first nine months of 2023 used for EPS computation was 106 563 821 for the basic calculation and 106 844 622 for the fully diluted calculation  slightly decreasing from the first nine months of 2022 as a result of the ongoing share repurchase programme.In Q3 2023  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of €174.5 million  compared to €318.1 million in Q3 2022  reflecting lower change in working capital. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities  net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 100.7% of EBITDA in Q3 2023.Business highlightsListingListing revenue  in €m unless stated otherwise Q3 2023 Q3 2022 % change Listing revenue 54.6 54.0 +1.1% Equity 26.8 27.4 -0.7% Annual fees 17.2 16.9 +1.6% Follow-ons 5.8 5.4 +9.1% IPOs 3.8 5.1 -26.0% Debts 8.5 8.6 -1.6% ETFs  Funds & Warrants 5.8 5.6 +3.1% Corporate Services 10.6 9.4 +12.5% Others 3.0 3.0 -1.7% Money raised 267 412 177 660 +50.5%Listing revenue was €54.6 million in Q3 2023  up +1.1% compared to Q3 2022  reflecting a resilient quarter for listing and follow-on activity and strong traction of the SaaS Corporate Services offering  absorbing the negative impact of the NOK.Euronext’s primary equity listing business sustained its leading position in Europe with 23 new listings in Q3 2023  out of 32 new listings  representing 72% of the listing activity in Europe.

This marks a major milestone in the journey to integrating all Borsa Italiana markets into the Euronext Optiq platform  as the Italian cash markets are all now live. This phase of the trading migration brought across Borsa Italiana’s three fixed income markets: MOT  the regulated market designed to facilitate access to the bond market for private investors; Euronext Access Milan (formerly ExtraMOT)  a multilateral trading facility (MTF) for professional investors that offers trading in bonds listed in other EU markets as well as Italian bonds  particularly those issued by SMEs; and EuroTLX  an MTF targeted specifically to non-professional and professional investors trading in retail-size fixed income securities. Also included in the scope was the Borsa Italiana SeDeX market  for retail investors trading certificates and covered warrants  collectively known as securitised derivatives products. Migrating the Borsa Italiana markets onto one platform gives investors in Italy the opportunity to trade a much wider range of products  while issuers of financial instruments gain access to a broad investor base across Europe and internationally  through all seven Euronext marketplaces. Likewise  European investors can benefit from trading Italian products through the Euronext platform.This successful migration means that two of the three phases in the major Borsa Italiana markets migration to the Optiq platform are complete  and the cash markets in all seven Euronext countries are now integrated on the same trading platform. The third phase will see the migration of derivatives instruments  and is targeted for the first quarter of 2024.Corporate highlights since 30 September 2023Euronext Clearing introduces innovative VaR-based margin methodology for Italian equities  ETF and financial derivatives marketsEuronext Clearing announced on 23 October 2023 the introduction of the new VaR-based margin methodology on the Euronext Milan equities  ETF and financial derivatives markets.

The computation of reported net income and earnings per share is not impacted.2024 strategic plan targets remain unchanged and are not affected by this change in reporting.The related non-IFRS indicators are defined below.Non-IFRS financial measuresFor comparative purposes  the company provides unaudited non-IFRS measures including:Operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA  EBITDA margin  adjusted EBITDA  adjusted EBITDA margin.Non-IFRS measures are defined as follows:Operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation as the total of salary and employee benefits  and other operational expenses;Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation as the total of salary and employee benefits  and other operational expenses  excluding non-recurring costs;Underlying revenue and income as the total of revenue and income  excluding non-recurring revenue and income;Non-underlying items as items of revenue  income and expense that are material by their size and/or that are infrequent and unusual by their nature or incidence are not considered to be recurring in the normal course of business and are classified as non-underlying items on the face of the income statement within their relevant category in order to provide further understanding of the ongoing sustainable performance of the Group. These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable IFRS measures and should be read only in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.Non-volume-related revenue definitionNon-volume-related revenue includes Listing (excluding IPOs)  Advanced Data Services  Custody & Settlement and other Post-Trade  fixed revenue from the Clearing activities (including for instance NTI and membership fees)  Investor Services  Technology Solutions  Other Income and Transitional Revenue.Adjusted EPS definitionQ3 2023 Q3 2022 Net income reported 166.5 75.8 EPS reported 1.57 0.71 Adjustments of which revenues 0.0 (48.9) of which Operating expenses exc.

The offering will complement HSBC’s platform for digital assets issuance  called HSBC Orion  and the bank’s system to issue tokenized gold which it launched last week. The latter uses distributed ledger technology to represent ownership of physical gold held in its London vault through digital tokens.HSBC is the latest large financial institution to move to commercialize blockchain-based applications  after years testing the technology at the core of cryptocurrencies. JPMorgan Chase & Co went live with its first collateral settlement for clients using blockchain last month  while Euroclear launched a platform for issuing traditional securities using blockchain. For almost a decade  banks  asset managers and market infrastructure providers have been investing millions of dollars in adapting blockchain with the aim of streamlining some of their more complex processes and reducing costs. So far the industry has yet to reap any large-scale benefits from these efforts  though the latest launches may prove to be a testing ground for the technology’s utility.Also Read 70% crypto yields are back with DeFi becoming a hot spot for leverage againCustody  in particular  has become a hotbed of activity from large players  creating opportunities for the sector’s startups  while also underscoring the challenges smaller firms face in partnering with big financial companies. San Francisco-based Ripple—which agreed to acquire Metaco in May— has estimated that the crypto custody market for institutions alone could reach almost $10 trillion by 2030.“We’re seeing increasing demand for custody and fund administration of digital assets from asset managers and asset owners  as this market continues to evolve ” Zhu Kuang Lee  chief digital  data and innovation officer  securities services at HSBC said in a statement. Citigroup Inc  which was building its digital-assets custody offering in partnership with Metaco  started informal talks earlier this year with other providers and was reviewing its partnership with the firm.

In response  Moscow froze some assets belonging to foreign investors and companies.Russians will be able to exchange frozen assets abroad up to a value of 100 000 rubles ($1 100) with funds from so-called Type C accounts that were held by foreigners in Russia  AFP reports. The owner of the Type C account  typically a foreign company  will then have the option of receiving a foreign share abroad that was owned by a Russian investor.From the archives (August 2023): Unilever CEO vows to look at Russian operations with ‘fresh eyes’ as pressure to exit the country mountsEuropean clearinghouse Clearstream has not yet responded to MarketWatch’s request for comment on whether it would cooperate on an exchange of shares.

The company didn't respond to requests for comment.The following are the key protagonists and events in the saga:HOW DID IT ALL BEGIN?Born in 1977 in Innsbruck  Rene Benko dropped out of school and began by turning attics into apartments.In 2000  he founded Immofina  which later became Signa  and got a big boost with investment from Austrian gas station heir Karl Kovarik.In 2003  Benko  tried to attract investors to Signa with promises on his website: ""You can now earn money by doing nothing"" and: ""It was never so boring to get rich"".WHAT IS SIGNA TODAY?The group has holdings of 27 billion euros ($28.8 billion) and 25 billion euros in development. Its real-estate division operates in Austria  Germany  Italy  Luxembourg and Switzerland.Big purchases included the corporate headquarters in 2010 of Deutsche Boerse  the German stock exchange operator  which it has since sold.In 2011  Signa bought the storied KaDeWe department store in Berlin as part of a retail portfolio for 1.1 billion euros.Benko's group also owns Kaufhof and Karstadt  German retailers that have been struggling as shoppers go online.WHAT'S THE BACKDROP?For years  the property sector in Germany and elsewhere in Europe boomed as interest rates were low and demand strong.Now a sharp rise in rates and building costs has put an end to the run  tipping developers into insolvency as bank financing dries up  deals freeze and prices fall.The turmoil comes amid the biggest property crisis in decades in Germany  Signa's most important market  and where within the span of a week Signa's sports retailer filed for insolvency and construction on a skyscraper was halted.WHAT ARE SOME SIGNS OF TROUBLE AT SIGNA?Construction of one of Germany's tallest buildings in Hamburg has halted midway after Signa stopped paying its builder  Reuters reported last week.Days earlier  Signa Sports United and a number of subsidiaries filed for insolvency.WHAT DO CREDIT RATINGS AGENCIES SAY?Fitch this week downgraded one of Signa's divisions  Signa Development  to junk.""Other Signa group entities have ceased projects and have financing difficulties due to the changes in the interest rate environment  bank funding and valuations "" Fitch said.""Unpaid suppliers and bank funding providers to other Signa entities may cross-contaminate and disrupt Signa Development's projects and funding "" it added.The price of a 2026 Signa Development bond has plummeted over the past two weeks.WHO ARE TOP SIGNA INVESTORS?Benko will remain the largest shareholder.Hans Peter Haselsteiner  the founder of Austrian construction firm Strabag  is a major shareholder  according to a filing  and German pet retailer Torsten Toeller is too  according to his family office.Ernst Tanner  the chair of Swiss chocolate company Lindt & Spruengli  has been a big investor but didn't immediately respond to a request about the current status of any holding.WHO ARE OTHER FINANCIAL BACKERS?A 76-page internal presentation seen by Reuters listed nearly 40 lenders and insurance companies as ""investors and financing partners"". It is undated but contains data from 2019.They included Allianz  Munich Re's Ergo insurance  BNP Paribas  Austrian banks including RBI  and some German savings banks. Allianz and Ergo declined to comment  RBI said its commercial real estate loans were ""very well collateralised""  while the others didn't respond.In Germany  Deutsche Bank was joint bookrunner for a Signa bond sold in 2021  and Commerzbank's real estate last year became a co-investor in Signa's Hamburg skyscraper. Deutsche Bank declined to comment and Commerz Real said its investment was relatively small.German regulator BaFin and the European Central Bank (ECB)have been asking banks to detail their exposure to Signa  a person with knowledge of the matter said  confirming press reports.The ECB didn't comment on Signa and instead referred to a letter on Tuesday by chief supervisor Andrea Enria to a German lawmaker about ""concerns"" on real estate lending.WHO IS THE NEW CHAIR?Arndt Geiwitz  a restructuring expert best known for his role in the insolvency proceedings of Galeria Kaufhof-Karstadt department stores and drug store chain Schlecker.($1 = 0.9366 euros)(Writing by Tom Sims Editing by Mark Potter)",negative,0.04,0.43,0.53,negative,0.01,0.23,0.76,True,English,"['Chrysler Building owner Benko', 'tycoon', 'grip', 'empire', 'chief supervisor Andrea Enria', 'Galeria Kaufhof-Karstadt department stores', 'drug store chain Schlecker', 'German stock exchange operator', 'Austrian gas station heir', 'commercial real estate loans', 'Other Signa group entities', 'Selfridges department store', 'KaDeWe department store', 'OTHER FINANCIAL BACKERS', 'CREDIT RATINGS AGENCIES', 'Hans Peter Haselsteiner', '76-page internal presentation', 'German regulator BaFin', 'real estate empire', 'real estate lending', 'other Signa entities', 'prominent property tycoons', 'biggest property crisis', 'past two weeks', 'interest rate environment', 'German pet retailer', 'European Central Bank', 'Swiss chocolate company', 'German savings banks', 'Austrian construction firm', 'bank funding providers', 'Signa Sports United', 'TOP SIGNA INVESTORS', '2026 Signa Development bond', 'sports retailer', 'German retailers', 'German lawmaker', 'Commerz Real', 'Austrian entrepreneur', 'Austrian banks', 'property industry', 'bank financing', 'Deutsche Bank', 'Signa bond', 'New York', 'Chrysler Building', 'major figure', 'two decades', 'interest rates', 'key protagonists', 'big boost', 'Karl Kovarik', 'real-estate division', 'Big purchases', 'corporate headquarters', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'retail portfolio', 'property sector', 'sharp rise', 'building costs', 'important market', 'SOME SIGNS', 'tallest buildings', 'financing difficulties', 'Unpaid suppliers', 'largest shareholder', 'major shareholder', 'Torsten Toeller', 'family office', 'Ernst Tanner', 'current status', 'financing partners', 'Munich Re', 'BNP Paribas', 'joint bookrunner', 'press reports', 'Arndt Geiwitz', 'restructuring expert', 'Tom Sims', 'Mark Potter', '27 billion euros', '25 billion euros', '1.1 billion euros', 'investor revolt', 'big investor', 'insurance companies', 'Ergo insurance', 'NEW CHAIR', 'Rene Benko', 'insolvency proceedings', 'Signa Holding', 'Hamburg skyscraper', 'The ECB', '0.9366 euros', 'VIENNA/DUESSELDORF/FRANKFURT', 'Reuters', 'Wednesday', 'chairmanship', 'prospects', 'owner', 'Britain', 'troubles', 'repercussions', 'surge', 'requests', 'comment', 'events', 'saga', 'Innsbruck', 'school', 'attics', 'apartments', 'Immofina', 'investment', 'promises', 'website', 'money', 'holdings', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Luxembourg', 'Switzerland', 'storied', 'Berlin', 'shoppers', 'BACKDROP', 'years', 'demand', 'developers', 'deals', 'prices', 'turmoil', 'span', 'builder', 'number', 'subsidiaries', 'Fitch', 'divisions', 'junk', 'projects', 'changes', 'valuations', 'founder', 'Strabag', 'filing', 'Lindt', 'Spruengli', '40 lenders', 'data', 'Allianz', 'RBI', 'others', 'Commerzbank', 'exposure', 'person', 'knowledge', 'matter', 'letter', 'Tuesday', 'concerns', 'role']",2023-11-08,2023-11-09,marketscreener.com

Some of the D7 customers include Commerzbank AG (ETR: CBK)  DekaBank  Vontobel Holdings AG (SWX: VONN)  and LBBW  among others.Deutsche Börse and the Cryptocurrency Market OutlookThe cryptocurrency market has grown exponentially around the world in the past few years  mostly fueled by the rising interest rates meant to curb high inflation. Since the German legislators formulated and enacted clear crypto regulations  more asset managers have been allocating their portfolios to digital assets  with the trend expected to accelerate in the coming years. As for Deutsche Börse  it has been making notable moves to prepare for its ultimate launch of cryptocurrency trading.For instance  the company acquired FundsDLT  a cross-boundary decentralized platform focused on investment fund distribution  to further enhance its digital financial services. Notably  Deutsche Börse has also invested in 360X Music AG  which is focused on tokenizing the music industry for mainstream investment.The cryptocurrency market has grown to a $1.43 trillion industry and experts believe hundreds of trillions of dollars will enter the sector in the coming years fueled by institutional investors.

Q3 2023 costs positively impacted by FX rate. Full-year 2023 costs expected to be lower than guidance.Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Milan  Oslo and Paris – 8 November 2023 – Euronext  the leading pan-European market infrastructure  today publishes its results for the third quarter of 2023.Q3 2023 revenue and income was €360.2 million  up +2.8% compared to Q3 2022 underlying revenue and income (+19.5% compared to Q3 2022 total revenue and income): Strong performance of non-volume-related business : Technology Solutions reported €27.4 million of revenue (+5.5% 1 )  thanks to the continued benefits from the internalisation of colocation services following the migration of the Core Data Centre to Bergamo and the good performance of Nord Pool technology activities. Advanced Data Services reported €55.5 million of revenue (+4.7%)  reflecting growth in market data and continued strong performance of the advanced data solutions business. Custody and Settlement reported €58.9 million of revenue (+3.1%) as new services and growing assets under custody offset lower settlement activity and the negative impact of the NOK 2 depreciation. Like-for-like at constant currencies  revenue was up +6.5%. Listing reported €54.6 million of revenue (+1.1%)  resulting from Corporate Services activities and sustained leadership position for listing in Europe  partially offset by the NOK depreciation. Euronext welcomed 23 new listings  representing 72% of the new listings in Europe in Q3 2023. Like-for-like at constant currencies  revenue was up +3.4%. Non-volume-related revenue accounted for 60% of Q3 2023 revenue (vs. 53% in Q3 2022) and covered 148% of underlying operating expenses  excluding D&A (vs. 106% in Q3 2022). Clearing revenue was €29.5 million (+1.6%)  reflecting dynamic bond clearing activities and solid derivatives clearing activities offsetting softer equities clearing volumes  and NTI were at €13.7 million. Trading revenue was solid  at €118.3 million (+0.4%)  resulting from Euronext’s diversified trading activities and strengthened leadership in cash trading in a low volatility environment for equities trading. Strong organic growth was recorded in fixed income trading (€25.4 million  up +18.7%) and power trading (€8.6 million  up +10.0%)  more than offsetting lower cash trading revenue (€64.4 million  -4.4%). Cash equity market share averaged 66.5% in Q3 2023 and revenue capture averaged 0.54 bps  above indicated floors.Adjusted EBITDA 3 was €213.7 million (+6.9%) and adjusted EBITDA margin reached 59.3% (+2.3pts): Underlying operating expenses  excluding D&A  were at €146.5 million (-2.6%)  primarily resulting from continued cost discipline and the positive impact of foreign exchanges rates. Considering the current foreign exchange rate of the NOK  Euronext expects a full-year positive impact of €12 million from the NOK depreciation on the cost base. Consequently  Euronext expects its underlying costs excluding D&A to be lower than its 2023 underlying costs excluding D&A guidance of €630 million.Adjusted net income was €146.5 million (+13.2%) and adjusted EPS was €1.38 (+13.7%).Reported net income was €166.5 million (+119.6%)  reflecting the €41.6 million capital gain following the disposal of Euronext 11.1% stake in LCH SA  the positive comparison base from the non-underlying one-off loss in net treasury income in Q3 2022 related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing investment portfolio 4 and positive net financing income.reflecting the €41.6 million capital gain following the disposal of Euronext 11.1% stake in LCH SA  the positive comparison base from the non-underlying one-off loss in net treasury income in Q3 2022 related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing investment portfolio and positive net financing income.

This brings to €95.1 million the cumulated implementation costs incurred since the beginning of the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. The migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext’s Optiq ® trading platform was completed by the migration of Borsa Italiana Fixed Income  Warrants and Certificates markets on 11 September 2023. This trading platform migration was the second milestone in the three phases of the major Borsa Italiana markets migration to the Optiq trading platform. Cash markets in all seven Euronext countries are now integrated on the same trading platform  allowing for the decommissioning of Borsa Italiana’s third-party-provided cash trading platform in Q4 2023. The third phase will see the migration of derivatives instruments to the Optiq trading platform  targeted for the first quarter of 2024. A new VaR-based margin methodology for Euronext Clearing was introduced on the Euronext Milan equities  ETF and financial derivatives markets on 16 October 2023 6 . In addition  the first phase of the European expansion of Euronext Clearing was successfully delivered with Euronext Clearing positioned as the default CCP for the Euronext Brussels cash markets since 6 November 2023. Together with the second phase of the European expansion of Euronext Clearing with the cash equity clearing operation extended to other Euronext cash equity markets 7 clearing flows in Q4 2023 as expected  this new activity will significantly contribute to the 2023 run-rate cumulative synergies target of €70 million.Continued delivery of new innovative trading solutions for clients: Euronext will expand its Global Equity Market (GEM) retail offering for pan-European and US stocks on 13 November 2023. Retail brokers and investors trading from Euronext’s markets in Europe and beyond will then have access to trade 350+ pan-European and US securities  in addition to the 1 900 listed stocks already available on Euronext. Euronext GEM benefits from a smooth and efficient post-trade set-up through Euronext Clearing and Euronext Securities. Euronext announces that the European Union has nominated MTS as a recognized interdealer platform for the implementation of electronic market making on European Union issued debt instruments. This new market was launched very successfully early November  and traded volumes and dealer participation have been very dynamic.Stéphane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:“Euronext’s Q3 2023 results demonstrate the success of our diversification strategy. Q3 2023 underlying revenues grew by +2.8% to €360.2 million. Robust organic growth across our non-volume related businesses and double-digit growth in our power and fixed income activities more than offset negative FX impacts and softer cash trading activities. Euronext’s adjusted EBITDA grew by +6.9% in Q3 2023 to €213.7 million  resulting from this solid operating performance  combined with our best-in-class cost discipline as well as positive FX impacts on our costs. Considering the current foreign exchange rate dynamics  we also expect our underlying costs for the full year to be lower than guided at the beginning of the year. As a result of this strong performance and thanks to the €41.6 million capital gain realised through the disposal of Euronext’s 11.1% stake in LCH SA  our reported EPS more than doubled in Q3 20231  to €1.57.Euronext strengthened its position as the leading venue for equity listing and trading in Europe. We welcomed 72% of the new equity listings in Europe this quarter. Notably  the US-based beauty company Coty dual-listed on Euronext Paris to expand its exposure to European investors. In a softer environment in equity trading  we remained the go-to trading venue in Europe  providing best-in-class liquidity  with a market share averaging 66.5% over the quarter and an increased revenue capture. Our leadership in cash trading has been achieved thanks to the excellent work of our cash team led by Simon Gallagher. I am thrilled to announce that Simon Gallagher will continue to drive client centricity in the City and across Europe as newly appointed Head of Global Sales for Euronext and CEO of Euronext London.We delivered several milestones in our ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan in Q3 2023. We completed the second phase of the trading migration of Italian markets to our proprietary trading platform Optiq. Cash markets from all of our seven exchanges in Europe are now integrated on the same trading platform. I am also proud today to announce the completion of the first step in the expansion of Euronext Clearing to all our markets. Since 6 November  Euronext Clearing is the default clearing house for equity trading in Brussels  and the remaining markets will follow later this month. This strategic milestone will significantly contribute to the targeted delivery of €70 million of cumulated run-rate pre-tax synergies by year end. In addition  our European cross-selling efforts continue to yield with the launch of MTS EU on 1 November 2023  which has shown very dynamic initial activity both in terms of traded volumes and participants.”■ Euronext Q3 2023 financial performanceIn €m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

In addition  transitional revenue was negatively impacted by a non-recurring credit note.On a reported basis  total revenue and income was up +19.5%  reflecting notably the positive comparison base of the non-underlying one-off loss of €49.0 million in net treasury income in Q3 2022 related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing investment portfolio9.Non-volume related revenue accounted for 60% of Group revenue in Q3 2023  compared to 53% in Q3 2022  reflecting the successful diversification towards non-volume related activities and low volatility environment for cash trading. The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage ratio by non-volume related revenue was at 148% in Q3 2023  compared to 106% in Q3 2022.On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was up +21.3%.Q3 2023 adjusted EBITDAUnderlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation decreased to €146.5 million  down -2.6%  reflecting strong cost discipline in an inflationary environment and positive FX impact from the depreciation of the NOK over the year.Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled €213.7 million  up +6.9% compared to Q3 2022  resulting from the solid quarter for non-volume related activities  fixed income and power trading  and post-trade revenue combined with Euronext’s continued cost discipline. As a result  adjusted EBITDA margin reached 59.3%  up +2.3 points compared to Q3 2022.The reported EBITDA was at €206.6 million  up +39.3% compared to Q3 2022  reflecting the strong performance in Q3 2023 and the non-underlying one-off loss of €49.0 million in net treasury income in Q3 2022. The reported EBITDA margin grew to 57.3%  up +8.1 points year on year.Q3 2023 net income  share of the parent company shareholdersDepreciation and amortisation amounted to €41.9 million in Q3 2023  an increase of +7.8% compared to Q3 2022  resulting from ongoing migration projects. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for €20.5 million.Adjusted operating profit was €195.4 million  a +6.3% increase compared to Q3 2022.€30.7 million of non-underlying expenses  including depreciation and amortisation  were reported in Q3 2023  related to the ongoing migration projects and PPA.Net financing income for Q3 2023 was €1.5 million  compared to a net financing expense of €4.6 million in Q3 2022. This decrease reflects higher interest income from cash held offsetting the cost of issued debt.Results from equity investments amounted to €54.4 million in Q3 2023  resulting from a dividend received from Euroclear and from a €41.6 million tax-exempted non-underlying capital gain in relation to the disposal of Euronext’s 11.1% stake in LCH SA. As a reminder  following this disposal the Group will not record any contribution from LCH SA from Q3 2023 in results from equity investments.Income tax for Q3 2023 was €48.4 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 22.0% for the quarter  primarily reflecting the positive impact of the tax-exempted one-off capital gain from the disposal of the LCH SA stake (Q3 2022: €27.9 million and 26.2% respectively).Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to -€5.6 million in Q3 2023.Consequently  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  increased by +119.6% for Q3 2023 compared to Q3 2022  to €166.5 million. This represents a reported EPS of €1.57 basic and €1.56 fully diluted in Q3 2023  compared to €0.71 basic and €0.71 fully diluted in Q3 2022.Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was up +13.2% to €146.5 million. Consequently  adjusted EPS (basic) was up +13.7% in Q3 2023  at €1.38 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of €1.21 per share in Q3 2022.The weighted number of shares over the first nine months of 2023 used for EPS computation was 106 563 821 for the basic calculation and 106 844 622 for the fully diluted calculation  slightly decreasing from the first nine months of 2022 as a result of the ongoing share repurchase programme.In Q3 2023  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of €174.5 million  compared to €318.1 million in Q3 2022  reflecting lower change in working capital.

This marks a major milestone in the journey to integrating all Borsa Italiana markets into the Euronext Optiq platform  as the Italian cash markets are all now live. This phase of the trading migration brought across Borsa Italiana’s three fixed income markets: MOT  the regulated market designed to facilitate access to the bond market for private investors; Euronext Access Milan (formerly ExtraMOT)  a multilateral trading facility (MTF) for professional investors that offers trading in bonds listed in other EU markets as well as Italian bonds  particularly those issued by SMEs; and EuroTLX  an MTF targeted specifically to non-professional and professional investors trading in retail-size fixed income securities. Also included in the scope was the Borsa Italiana SeDeX market  for retail investors trading certificates and covered warrants  collectively known as securitised derivatives products. Migrating the Borsa Italiana markets onto one platform gives investors in Italy the opportunity to trade a much wider range of products  while issuers of financial instruments gain access to a broad investor base across Europe and internationally  through all seven Euronext marketplaces. Likewise  European investors can benefit from trading Italian products through the Euronext platform.This successful migration means that two of the three phases in the major Borsa Italiana markets migration to the Optiq platform are complete  and the cash markets in all seven Euronext countries are now integrated on the same trading platform. The third phase will see the migration of derivatives instruments  and is targeted for the first quarter of 2024.Corporate highlights since 30 September 2023Euronext Clearing introduces innovative VaR-based margin methodology for Italian equities  ETF and financial derivatives marketsEuronext Clearing announced on 23 October 2023 the introduction of the new VaR-based margin methodology on the Euronext Milan equities  ETF and financial derivatives markets.

These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable IFRS measures and should be read only in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.Non-volume-related revenue definitionNon-volume-related revenue includes Listing (excluding IPOs)  Advanced Data Services  Custody & Settlement and other Post-Trade  fixed revenue from the Clearing activities (including for instance NTI and membership fees)  Investor Services  Technology Solutions  Other Income and Transitional Revenue.Adjusted EPS definitionQ3 2023 Q3 2022 Net income reported 166.5 75.8 EPS reported 1.57 0.71 Adjustments of which revenues 0.0 (48.9) of which Operating expenses exc.

Talks are in the final stages but a definitive decision has not yet been reached  they said.Italian oil and gas major Eni entered into talks with EIP  a Zurich-based fund  on a potential deal earlier this year  as it sought a partner for the unit in the run-up to a future stock market listing. Plenitude sells energy to households and businesses  produces renewable power  and runs electric-vehicle charging stations. It serves about 10 million retail clients across Europe  operating in 15 countries globally.The sale of a stake could help Eni lock in the unit’s value while giving it more cash for investments  paving the way for an initial public offering as soon as next year. Eni Chief Executive Officer Claudio Descalzi acknowledged in late September that talks were ongoing with potential suitors for a stake in Plenitude.Representatives for Eni and EIP both declined to comment.Energy CrisisThe plan to list Plenitude was postponed last year with Europe in the throes of an energy crisis  but Eni still aims to proceed with the listing on the Euronext Milan exchange when market conditions permit  likely in 2024  Descalzi has said.The current valuation for the unit is higher than the €6 billion to €7 billion the state-controlled energy firm considered setting for it in mid-2022  people familiar with the matter said at the time.Milan-based Plenitude  which is targeting around €900 million in Ebitda for this year  was set up to pool Eni’s energy retailing and renewables businesses.,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.35,0.33,0.33,True,English,"['Renewables Unit Stake', '$800MM Sale', 'Eni', 'EIP', 'Eni Chief Executive Officer Claudio Descalzi', 'Energy Infrastructure Partners AG', 'future stock market listing', 'electric-vehicle charging stations', '10 million retail clients', 'initial public offering', 'Euronext Milan exchange', 'state-controlled energy firm', 'Plenitude renewables unit', 'market conditions', 'Energy Crisis', 'energy retailing', 'final stages', 'definitive decision', 'Italian oil', 'Zurich-based fund', 'renewable power', 'late September', 'potential suitors', 'current valuation', 'renewables businesses', 'Eni SpA', 'major Eni', 'potential deal', 'next year', 'Milan-based Plenitude', 'sale', 'stake', 'value', 'cash', 'investments', 'accord', 'people', 'matter', 'end', 'month', 'information', 'Talks', 'gas', 'EIP', 'run-up', 'households', 'Europe', '15 countries', 'way', 'Representatives', 'plan', 'throes', 'mid-2022', 'time', 'Ebitda']",2023-11-08,2023-11-09,rigzone.com

(“AMG”  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: “AMG”) reported third quarter 2023 revenue of $369 million  a 13% decrease versus the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2023 EBITDA of $54 millio…,Amsterdam  8 November 2023 (Regulated Information) --- AMG Critical Materials N.V. (“AMG”  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: “AMG”) reported third quarter 2023 revenue of $369 million  a 13% decrease versus the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2023 EBITDA of $54 million decreased 48% compared to the third quarter of 2022.Cash from operating activities was $178 million on a year-to-date basis  compared to $111 million for the first nine months of 2022.In 000’s US dollars Q3 ‘23 Q3 ‘22 Change YTDSept ‘23 YTDSept ‘22 Change Revenue $368 717 $424 813 (13%) $1 258 626 $1 252 770 —% EBITDA (1) 53 785 102 603 (48%) 279 349 238 489 17% Cash from operating activities 24 926 74 747 (67%) 178 296 110 598 61% Return on Capital Employed 28.4% 29.5%Note:(1) EBITDA is defined as EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  “The 48% decrease in EBITDA compared to the third quarter of 2022 was driven in large part by the global decline in metal prices within our portfolio  predominantly the lithium price decline. The average quarterly prices of lithium carbonate and ferrovanadium have decreased over 50% and 29%  respectively  versus the average pricing in the third quarter of 2022. On a year-to-date basis  however  EBITDA has increased 17% compared to the first nine months of 2022.We ended the third quarter in a $320 million net debt position  and continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the quarter. As of September 30  2023  the Company had $347 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $195 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $542 million of total liquidity as of September 30  2023. In today’s rising rate environment  AMG continues to benefit from its low-cost fixed-rate debt facilities  and has an average interest rate charge across its two main debt instruments of 5%.AMG Engineering signed $81 million in new orders during the third quarter of 2023  51% higher year-to-date in 2023 than in the same period in 2022  driven by strong orders of remelting and heat treatment furnaces  representing a 1.02x book to bill ratio. AMG’s order backlog was $341 million as of September 30  2023  the highest in AMG’s history for the second straight quarter. This is largely driven by the aerospace market  which is experiencing strong growth. Our third quarter 2023 order intake remains at a very high level  reaching $323 million year-to-date.”Strategic HighlightsThe Supervisory Board has authorized the implementation of a new corporate structure  which will be operational January 1  2024. The present segmental reporting structure will be replaced by three corporate entities: AMG Lithium BV  AMG Vanadium BV  and AMG Technologies (AG/GmbH). Each entity will have its own leadership team and operating management.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  “The three new 100% owned subsidiaries AMG Lithium  AMG Vanadium  and AMG Technologies  have very specific trends and business models  and require very different management skill sets. They will each be managed by newly installed Management Boards  which will exercise their control through respective Supervisory Boards that will reflect corporate governance principles that currently apply to AMG Critical Materials NV.This updated structure will enable AMG to realize strategic  operational  and risk management synergies that will improve decision making  as well as strengthen the resiliency of the organization. This new structure will decrease the potential for overreliance on individual executives  improve succession planning  and improve collaboration throughout the organization. Additionally  the new structure will create strategic flexibility for various forms of equity diversification.”LithiumIn Brazil  the lithium concentrate plant shutdown to facilitate the expansion from 90 000 tons to 130 000 tons will take place in the first quarter of 2024 due to delivery delays of electronic components for processing automation. This will negatively impact second quarter sales volumes. We expect to produce at full run rate capacity  which is 130 000 tons per year  starting in the third quarter of 2024.AMG Brazil’s project with Grupo Lagoa will begin basic engineering in December 2023. From present data  we conclude that the plant will confirm the main assumptions for the construction of a 150 000-ton lithium concentrate plant at the site.AMG’s lithium hydroxide refinery’s first 20 000-ton module in Bitterfeld  Germany  is in the initial phases of commissioning and the ramp-up and the qualification process is planned for the second and third quarters of 2024. We expect to produce approximately 7 000 tons of qualified battery-grade lithium hydroxide in 2024 which is not included in our EBITDA guidance for 2024. We expect to produce and sell a full 20 000 tons in 2025.VanadiumThe spent catalyst roasting facility in Zanesville  Ohio operated at full capacity for the third quarter and outperformed our roasting facility in Cambridge  Ohio. The Zanesville melt shop has operated at full capacity utilization and the Vanadium team is focused on increasing operational availability  optimizing cycle time and increasing yield.AMG’s innovative lithium vanadium battery (“LIVA”) projects are integral for industrial power management applications and accelerate the industrial energy transition. The batteries are currently under various stages of bidding and development. One is operational  three are under construction  and 13 are in bidding and development stages  with a total megawatt hour (MWh) capacity of 379 MWh.The vanadium electrolyte plant at AMG Titanium in Nuremberg  Germany is under construction. The target capacity is 6 000 m³ vanadium electrolyte  the equivalent of approximately 100 MWh  which will serve the electricity storage market  including a vertical integration into LIVA batteries. Production is expected to start in the first quarter of 2024.Applying a newly developed process technology  AMG Titanium in Nuremberg  Germany has started to process spent roasted catalyst to V 2 O 5 .O . Shell & AMG Recycling’s (“SARBV”) project development of a closed loop circular recycling facility in the Middle East is progressing. Phase I of the “Supercenter” project  a hydrometallurgical facility to process vanadium-containing gasification ash  is under a long-term contract with Aramco. The gasification ash will be processed into vanadium oxide and then to vanadium electrolytes for use in batteries in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Phase I is expected to reach FEL3 status by the end of the year. The “Supercenter” concept also includes spent catalyst recycling projects  fresh catalyst production  and the manufacturing of vanadium batteries. The Phase I facility will also produce 6 000 m³ of electrolyte  which will support 100 MWh of vanadium redox flow battery capacity annually. In addition  a LIVA Hybrid Energy Storage System and a Fresh Catalyst R&D facility will be part of Phase 1.Financial HighlightsCash from operating activities was $25 million in the third quarter of 2023  and $178 million on a year-to-date basis  compared to $111 million for the first nine months of 2022.AMG’s liquidity as of September 30  2023 was $542 million  with $347 million of unrestricted cash and $195 million of revolving credit availability.Annualized return on capital employed was 28.4% for the first nine months of 2023  compared to 29.5% for the same period in 2022.AMG Engineering’s order backlog of $341 million as of September 30  2023  the highest in AMG’s history  was driven primarily by the aerospace industry.Key FiguresIn 000’s US dollars Q3 ‘23 Q3 ‘22 Change YTDSept ‘23 YTDSept ‘22 Change Revenue $368 717 $424 813 (13%) $1 258 626 $1 252 770 —% Gross profit 66 803 112 071 (40%) 334 179 289 505 15% Gross margin 18.1% 26.4% 26.6% 23.1% Operating profit 24 059 121 680 (80%) 202 249 224 740 (10%) Operating margin 6.5% 28.6% 16.1% 17.9% Net income attributable to shareholders 163 68 146 N/A 99 147 126 892 (22%) EPS - Fully diluted 0.00 2.09 N/A 3.04 3.91 (22%) EBIT (1) 40 225 91 536 (56%) 239 149 205 532 16% EBITDA (2) 53 785 102 603 (48%) 279 349 238 489 17% EBITDA margin 14.6% 24.2% 22.2% 19.0% Cash from operating activities 24 926 74 747 (67%) 178 296 110 598 61%Notes:(1) EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes.

Ferrovanadium production increased 48% versus the third quarter of 2022.Gross profit for the quarter decreased 60% compared to the same period in the prior year  primarily due to the lower sales prices. The primary driver is the lithium price decline. Also  vanadium gross profit was lower due to fixed price inventory being processed from global sources. All other existing contracts are under indexed prices. We are working towards long-term contracts similar to our Cambridge model.SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2023 were higher than the same period in 2022 at $15 million  mainly driven by the increase in headcount related to the lithium and vanadium expansion projects  as well as higher employee benefit costs.The third quarter 2023 EBITDA decreased 53%  to $39 million  from $84 million in the third quarter of 2022  due to the decline in metal prices as noted above.During the third quarter of 2023  a total of 16 012 dry metric tons (“dmt”) of lithium concentrates was sold. The third quarter experienced lower sales volumes due to shipping schedule variances noted in the second quarter. The average realized sales price was $2 395/dmt CIF China for the quarter. The average cost per ton for the quarter was $529/dmt CIF China. The cost per ton is lower than the second quarter due to higher sales volumes of tantalum concentrate in the current quarter.In 2024  we anticipate the cost per ton to rise due to unabsorbed costs during the ramp-up as well as lower relative tantalum sales volumes offsetting higher spodumene production. It is important to note that AMG is one of the lowest cost mines in the world and we plan to maintain that position.AMG Critical MineralsQ3 ‘23 Q3 ‘22 Change Revenue $52 593 $84 935 (38%) Gross profit 6 887 674 922% Operating (loss) profit (269) 40 301 N/A EBITDA 1 247 7 327 (83%)AMG Critical Minerals’ revenue for the third quarter of 2023 decreased by 38%  to $53 million  mainly due to lower volumes across the segment largely driven by the silicon metal plant operating one furnace during the quarter  as discussed in detail below. The slowdown in the European industrial economy also continued to negatively impact the segment.Gross profit of $7 million in the third quarter of 2023 was $6 million higher compared to the same period last year  largely due to the significant increases in gas and electricity costs experienced in the third quarter of 2022.SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2023 of $7 million were in line with the same period in 2022.The third quarter 2023 EBITDA decreased 83% compared to the same period in 2022  to $1 million  due to silicon shutdown as well as the slowdown in the end-use markets for the segment in the current quarter.AMG Silicon operated one of four furnaces throughout the third quarter and plans to operate one furnace for the remainder of 2023. The operational parameters of the silicon business will continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Due to the noted interruptions in AMG Silicon’s operations  the financial impact of the business will be excluded from EBITDA during this period of abnormal operations. However  AMG Silicon generated $10 million in cash flow from operating activities during the quarter driven by the receipt of energy sales made in the fourth quarter of 2022.AMG Critical Materials TechnologiesQ3 ‘23 Q3 ‘22 Change Revenue $175 780 $151 560 16% Gross profit 25 583 24 943 3% Operating profit 5 616 6 491 (13%) EBITDA 13 383 11 602 15%AMG Critical Materials Technologies' third quarter 2023 revenue increased by $24 million  or 16%  compared to the same period in 2022. This improvement was driven by strong revenues in our engineering unit  as well as higher sales volumes of titanium alloys and chrome metal  partially offset by lower chrome metal pricing.SG&A expenses increased by 10% in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022  due to additional personnel at AMG Engineering and AMG LIVA corresponding to the record order backlog and business development  respectively.AMG Critical Materials Technologies’ EBITDA was $13 million during the quarter compared to $12 million in the same period of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher profitability in Engineering and Titanium  partially offset by lower chrome margins driven by continued sequential decline in chrome price in the third quarter of 2023.AMG Engineering signed $81 million in new orders during the third quarter of 2023  driven by strong orders of remelting and heat treatment furnaces  representing a 1.02x book to bill ratio. Order backlog was $341 million as of September 30  2023  the highest in AMG’s history.AMG Engineering has been selected by PCC’s TIMET to supply the vacuum melting and re-melting furnaces for their new  state-of-the-art Titanium melt facility in Ravenswood  West Virginia. AMG’s scope includes several vacuum arc re-melting  electron beam welding  and electron beam melting furnaces  signifying one of the largest orders in all of AMG Engineering’s history.Financial ReviewTaxAMG recorded an income tax expense of $13 million in the third quarter of 2023  compared to $39 million in the same period in 2022. This variance was mainly driven by lower profitability in the current quarter.AMG paid taxes of $33 million in the third quarter of 2023  compared to tax payments of $10 million in the third quarter of 2022  primarily due to the timing lag in tax payments relative to tax expense recognition.Exceptional ItemsAMG’s third quarter 2023 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA.A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in the third quarters of 2023 and 2022 are below:Exceptional items included in gross profitQ3 ‘23 Q3 ‘22 Change Gross profit $66 803 $112 071 (40%) Inventory cost adjustment 1 388 — N/A Restructuring expense 2 745 11 N/A Asset impairment expense — 11 587 N/A Strategic project expense 4 924 1 241 297% Gross profit excluding exceptional items 75 860 124 910 (39%)AMG Vanadium had a $1.3 million non-cash expense during the third quarter of 2023. This is a result of inventory cost adjustments associated with declining prices and an increased inventory position of spent catalyst as we diversify our sourcing strategy which has been adjusted in EBITDA.SG&AAMG’s third quarter 2023 SG&A expenses were $43 million compared to $37 million in the third quarter of 2022  with the increase largely attributable to higher personnel costs driven by increased hiring in our Lithium  Engineering  and LIVA businesses.LiquiditySeptember 30  2023 December 31  2022 Change Senior secured debt $337 952 $348 622 (3%) Cash & cash equivalents 347 293 346 043 —% Senior secured net (cash) debt (9 341) 2 579 N/A Other debt 12 170 14 959 (19%) Net debt excluding municipal bond 2 829 17 538 (84%) Municipal bond debt 319 064 319 244 —% Restricted cash 1 428 6 920 (79%) Net debt 320 465 329 862 (3%)AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the third quarter. As of September 30  2023  the Company had $347 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $195 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $542 million of total liquidity as of September 30  2023.Net Finance CostsAMG’s third quarter 2023 net finance cost was $9 million compared to $14 million in the third quarter of 2022. This decrease was mainly driven by foreign exchange gains of $3 million during the quarter primarily due to non-cash intergroup balances and higher interest income earned on an increased cash and cash equivalents balance in the third quarter 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. Additionally  in today’s rising rate environment  AMG continues to benefit from its low-cost fixed-rate debt facilities. AMG has an average interest rate charge across its two main debt instruments of 5%.OutlookSince the end of July when we issued the previous 2023 EBITDA guidance of between $350 million and $380 million  market prices for spodumene and lithium carbonate have decreased by 50% and 43%  respectively. Given these price decreases  AMG’s new EBITDA guidance for the full year 2023 is approximately $320 million.Considering the ramp-up of the strategic projects explained above  as well as the volatility of our key material prices  specifically lithium  it is challenging to provide firm guidance for 2024. The recent fall in lithium prices has surprised every industry participant. Establishing the cause of the fall in prices and projecting future movements involves analyzing both the Chinese lithium industry as well as broader macroeconomic factors in China.Given the difficulty of this analysis  and despite certain signs that the lithium supply and demand picture remains strong  there is high uncertainty with regard to near-term pricing dynamics. Therefore  utilizing today’s depressed price levels  AMG’s EBITDA will be approximately $200 million in 2024 with a stronger performance in the second half of the year.Profit for the period to adjusted EBITDA reconciliationQ3 ‘23 Q3 ‘22 Profit for the period $1 002 $68 339 Income tax expense 12 565 38 603 Net finance cost 9 295 13 988 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 392 1 386 Restructuring expense 2 745 11 Net contract settlements — (46 407) Silicon’s partial closure (739) — Inventory cost adjustment 1 388 — Asset impairment expense — 11 587 Strategic project expense (1) 11 196 3 282 Share of loss of associates 1 197 750 Others 184 (3) EBIT 40 225 91 536 Depreciation and amortization 13 560 11 067 EBITDA 53 785 102 603Notes:(1) The Company is in the initial development and ramp-up phases for several strategic expansion projects  including the joint venture with Shell  the LIVA Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational.

Beginning as a bottom-up effort  Stellantis’ global manufacturing facilities identified 35 challenges that align to their strategic goals and the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan. In a unique process  Stellantis shared these factory challenges with current and potential future suppliers  including startup companies and universities  in an “open call ” asking for their best ideas.The process culminated with the 2023 Factory Booster Day event in Betim  Brazil  where selected companies presented 99 of the most promising solutions to the challenges. In addition to the physical event  Stellantis manufacturing team members from around the world viewed presentations and demonstrations virtually through a metaverse platform. Plant managers who believe a solution can solve the challenge are empowered to launch a pilot test. Test results are reviewed and shared by an Innovation Committee  led by engineering and plant leadership. Successful solutions are then deployed at other Stellantis plants around the globe.Some of the challenges for 2023 Factory Booster Day include:How to improve process performance by leveraging AIHow to model  measure and better manage energy consumptionHow to detect loose material or contamination in a BEV battery“In an automotive industry where disruption and opportunities are unlike any other time  we are building a strong community of actors that will bring innovative technologies and smart solutions to our facilities ” said Arnaud Deboeuf  Stellantis Chief Manufacturing Officer. “This great annual event allows us  together  to improve our efficiency and competitiveness  with our customers being the ultimate winner. I want to thank each of our business partners who brought us innovations across all fronts.”Innovations previously adopted by Stellantis manufacturing plants include:High-tech welding of short flanges on vehicle doors  which delivered improvements in quality and stability of the welded part and less cost  compared with laser welding.Advanced computer vision tool that can assemble parts on a moving assembly line. Computer algorithms enable tools to track any object. The system is easily integrated into an assembly line at minimal cost.Real-time energy use measurement and management with cloud-based analytics. The system proactively manages energy usage to meet targets and detects anomalies.While the challenges explored for Factory Booster Day can be diverse  such as reducing energy usage or ensuring a defect-free product  they all play a role in meeting the ambitions of the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan:Becoming a carbon net zero corporation by 2038  all scopes included  with single-digit percentage compensation of remaining emissions. In 2022  Stellantis achieved an 11% reduction of the manufacturing carbon footprint of scopes 1 and 2 since 2021.Reducing production costs by 40% by 2030  including deploying automation  digital solutions and artificial intelligence.Achieving improved product quality with optimized defect detection  delivering an industry-leading customer experience.Earning recognition as a great place to work for ergonomics  health preservation and safety  along with diversity and inclusion.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

Beginning as a bottom-up effort  Stellantis’ global manufacturing facilities identified 35 challenges that align to their strategic goals and the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan. In a unique process  Stellantis shared these factory challenges with current and potential future suppliers  including startup companies and universities  in an “open call ” asking for their best ideas.The process culminated with the 2023 Factory Booster Day event in Betim  Brazil  where selected companies presented 99 of the most promising solutions to the challenges. In addition to the physical event  Stellantis manufacturing team members from around the world viewed presentations and demonstrations virtually through a metaverse platform. Plant managers who believe a solution can solve the challenge are empowered to launch a pilot test. Test results are reviewed and shared by an Innovation Committee  led by engineering and plant leadership. Successful solutions are then deployed at other Stellantis plants around the globe.Some of the challenges for 2023 Factory Booster Day include:How to improve process performance by leveraging AIHow to model  measure and better manage energy consumptionHow to detect loose material or contamination in a BEV battery“In an automotive industry where disruption and opportunities are unlike any other time  we are building a strong community of actors that will bring innovative technologies and smart solutions to our facilities ” said Arnaud Deboeuf  Stellantis Chief Manufacturing Officer. “This great annual event allows us  together  to improve our efficiency and competitiveness  with our customers being the ultimate winner. I want to thank each of our business partners who brought us innovations across all fronts.”Innovations previously adopted by Stellantis manufacturing plants include:High-tech welding of short flanges on vehicle doors  which delivered improvements in quality and stability of the welded part and less cost  compared with laser welding.Advanced computer vision tool that can assemble parts on a moving assembly line. Computer algorithms enable tools to track any object. The system is easily integrated into an assembly line at minimal cost.Real-time energy use measurement and management with cloud-based analytics. The system proactively manages energy usage to meet targets and detects anomalies.While the challenges explored for Factory Booster Day can be diverse  such as reducing energy usage or ensuring a defect-free product  they all play a role in meeting the ambitions of the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan:Becoming a carbon net zero corporation by 2038  all scopes included  with single-digit percentage compensation of remaining emissions. In 2022  Stellantis achieved an 11% reduction of the manufacturing carbon footprint of scopes 1 and 2 since 2021.Reducing production costs by 40% by 2030  including deploying automation  digital solutions and artificial intelligence.Achieving improved product quality with optimized defect detection  delivering an industry-leading customer experience.Earning recognition as a great place to work for ergonomics  health preservation and safety  along with diversity and inclusion.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

This agreement includes a proposal for a new deployment commitment by Orange in the AMII zone.[1] The agreement will soon be submitted to ARCEP for an advisory opinion before being definitively approved by the government.Within the AMII perimeter  Orange is stepping up the pace of deployment  and is committed to bringing fiber to an additional 1 120 000 homes by the end of 2025.Where deployment disparities between different urban areas exist  additional efforts will be made in areas with the lowest fiber coverage within this perimeter to make more than 140 000 homes be connectable to a fiber network by 2024.Orange will also provide an ""on demand"" offer providing connectability to all customers who are not eligible for fiber within six months of their request[2]. This offer will be available until the copper network is shut down. By introducing on-demand connections to complement industrial deployments by geographical sector  Orange is changing the way it manages its deployments in the AMII zone.This proposal will deliver widespread fiber availability in AMII zones by the end of 2025.In the most densely populated areas  Orange is committed to continuing the deployments  with the aim of making more than 300 000 homes and businesses connectable to a fiber network by 2025. In 2024  the Group will conduct a trial of on-demand deployment for its customers in two major cities within this perimeter.Last but not least  Orange will continue to offer fiber access at a subsidized rate for eligible households until at least 2027.

This agreement includes a proposal for a new deployment commitment by Orange in the AMII zone.1 The agreement will soon be submitted to ARCEP for an advisory opinion before being definitively approved by the government.Within the AMII perimeter  Orange is stepping up the pace of deployment  and is committed to bringing fiber to an additional 1 120 000 homes by the end of 2025.Where deployment disparities between different urban areas exist  additional efforts will be made in areas with the lowest fiber coverage within this perimeter to make more than 140 000 homes be connectable to a fiber network by 2024.Orange will also provide an “on demand” offer providing connectability to all customers who are not eligible for fiber within six months of their request2. This offer will be available until the copper network is shut down. By introducing on-demand connections to complement industrial deployments by geographical sector  Orange is changing the way it manages its deployments in the AMII zone.This proposal will deliver widespread fiber availability in AMII zones by the end of 2025.In the most densely populated areas  Orange is committed to continuing the deployments  with the aim of making more than 300 000 homes and businesses connectable to a fiber network by 2025. In 2024  the Group will conduct a trial of on-demand deployment for its customers in two major cities within this perimeter.Last but not least  Orange will continue to offer fiber access at a subsidized rate for eligible households until at least 2027. The “Coup de Pouce” (Helping Hand) offer enables low-income households3 to benefit from a no-commitment package that includes Internet  TV and phone access  a refurbished laptop and digital coaching.Christel Heydemann  Orange CEO  said: ""After making a major contribution to the success of the France Très Haut Débit plan (France's superfast broadband plan) in 2022  Orange is once again working with the government to ensure the widespread deployment of fiber by 2025.

Dassault Systèmes’ simulation confirmed that we are on track to provide these in 2024  as well as long after  when the buildings are repurposed for future residents ” said Antoine du Souich  director of strategy and innovation  SOLIDEO.Based on data provided by SOLIDEO and its construction partners  Dassault Systèmes used its SIMULIA software to create a 3D model of an upper floor in one of the buildings  simulate parameters such as insulation  ventilation  solar shades  and an ecological system to cool floors  and calculate the resulting indoor temperature throughout the day.The simulations have helped SOLIDEO confirm how each of these parameters will function  and how the building as planned could optimize indoor comfort levels at any given time  without requiring additional structural solutions. They demonstrated the efficacy of both the solar shades based on their position and the time of day  and the innovative cooling floors.“Thanks to our simulations  SOLIDEO has benefited from key insights to optimize comfort inside the buildings  even if temperatures soar outside ” said Jacques Beltran  Vice President  Cities and Public Services  Dassault Systèmes. “Our partnership with SOLIDEO is another example of the depth and breadth of our technology. From the heat inside a building to the airflow inside hospitals  office spaces and concert halls  or to understand outdoor heat island effects in urban areas  we can simulate any scenario  understand what otherwise can’t be seen  and help contribute to safer  healthier quality of life for citizens.”###ABOUT SOLIDEOSOLIDEO is overseeing the delivery and completion of more than 60 structures and development projects required for the organization of the Paris 2024 Games  in line with a defined budget and an ambitious  sustainable and exemplary legacy.

This agreement includes a proposal for a new deployment commitment by Orange in the AMII zone.1 The agreement will soon be submitted to ARCEP for an advisory opinion before being definitively approved by the government.Within the AMII perimeter  Orange is stepping up the pace of deployment  and is committed to bringing fiber to an additional 1 120 000 homes by the end of 2025.Where deployment disparities between different urban areas exist  additional efforts will be made in areas with the lowest fiber coverage within this perimeter to make more than 140 000 homes be connectable to a fiber network by 2024.Orange will also provide an “on demand” offer providing connectability to all customers who are not eligible for fiber within six months of their request2. This offer will be available until the copper network is shut down. By introducing on-demand connections to complement industrial deployments by geographical sector  Orange is changing the way it manages its deployments in the AMII zone.This proposal will deliver widespread fiber availability in AMII zones by the end of 2025.In the most densely populated areas  Orange is committed to continuing the deployments  with the aim of making more than 300 000 homes and businesses connectable to a fiber network by 2025. In 2024  the Group will conduct a trial of on-demand deployment for its customers in two major cities within this perimeter.Last but not least  Orange will continue to offer fiber access at a subsidized rate for eligible households until at least 2027. The “Coup de Pouce” (Helping Hand) offer enables low-income households3 to benefit from a no-commitment package that includes Internet  TV and phone access  a refurbished laptop and digital coaching.Christel Heydemann  Orange CEO  said: ""After making a major contribution to the success of the France Très Haut Débit plan (France's superfast broadband plan) in 2022  Orange is once again working with the government to ensure the widespread deployment of fiber by 2025. Having already covered 21 million of the 36 million eligible premises in France  we're determined to make this major project a national success  benefiting as many people as possible. I want to thank all Orange teams and partners contributing to the success of this major industrial project.”About OrangeOrange is one of the world’s leading telecommunications operators with sales of €43.5 billion in 2022 and 137 000 employees worldwide as at September 30  2023  including 73 000 in France.

On this basis  Ateme confirms its Full Year objective of 10-15% like-for-like revenue growth. We also maintain our EBITDA target above €5 million  however  in the macroeconomic context  it is understandably more challenging.Elsewhere  our objective of growing MRR from €1.5 million in January 2021 to €3 million in 2024  translates into an average incremental €100k per quarter. Following performances in excess in both 2021 and 2022  MMR growth has marked a pause in the first nine months of 2023. The MRR is expected to revert to growth in the Fourth Quarter  thereby leading us to confirm our roadmap and our 2024 objective.ATEME Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Michel Artières  said: ""North America and EMEA delivered strong growth in the first 9 months of this year  offsetting more pedestrian performances in Latin America and APAC  which  as expected  were penalized by a strong previous year bases effect. Based on the traditionally strong Q4 seasonality and a strong pipeline heading int the end of the year  we maintain our Full Year 2023 objectives.”Upcoming event:January 25th  2024: Full Year 2023 revenuesAbout Ateme: Ateme is a global leader of video compression and delivery solutions helping Tier-1 Content Providers  Service Providers and Streaming Platforms to boost their viewership and subscription engagement.Leveraging a unique R&D task force in the video industry  Ateme's solutions power green sustainable TV services  improve end-users' quality of experience  optimize the total cost of ownership of TV/VOD services and generate new revenue streams based on personalization and ad insertion.

They should be bought  as 10-year yields may decline toward 4% as the slump becomes more evident "" it said.Energy:Oil futures were lower early Wednesday amid concerns over a slowdown in energy demand.The market is ""getting back to staring down fundamentals and is seeing Russia push more oil onto the global market and Chinese appetite for crude rolling over as refining margins are dropping and refiners have exhausted their product export quotas "" Troy Vincent  senior market analyst at DTN said.While OPEC is likely to continue to extend their supply cuts into 2024  that should ""now be assumed as the base case and likely offers little upside for prices "" he said.Metals:Gold prices edged higher in Asia amid mixed global cues.While strong central bank buying remains a supportive factor  a rebound in the U.S. dollar and hawkish comments from Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari were weighing on investor sentiment for the precious metal  ANZ analysts said.China increased its gold holdings for a 12th straight month in October  with its gold stockpiles rising by about 740 000 ounces  official data showed.--Copper prices were higher in Asia  underpinned by signs of China demand.China's trade data released Tuesday indicated the country's appetite for commodities remains strong  ANZ Research analysts said.Also  China's imports of copper concentrates rose as smelters continued their purchases amid attractive treatment charges  the analysts added.--Iron-ore prices were lower with sentiment likely weighed by the Dalian Commodity Exchange having raised daily commission rates on trading iron-ore contracts  Huatai Futures said.Demand for the steelmaking material will likely also decline as weather conditions push Dongbei province--a major consumer of iron ore--into the off-season earlier than usual  it said.Demand may also be weighed by China's latest steps in its plan to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 which may shift investment away from non-environmentally-friendly commodities.TODAY'S TOP HEADLINESChina Is Becoming a Problem for InvestorsChina has long been a source of stock-market optimism. Now it is turning into a reason for worry.Investors started the year by pouring money into China-focused funds  a bet that the end of Covid-19 restrictions would unleash supercharged spending in the world's second-largest economy. Instead  a stubborn lack of growth and escalating political tensions with the U.S. are fostering poor returns and uncertainty about the future.Fed community-bank advocate Michelle Bowman says proposed bank reforms go beyond what the law intendsFed governor Michelle Bowman said Tuesday that federal officials are overstepping the spirit of the law with a series of proposed bank rules now under debate.Bowman said the measures are potentially disruptive to banks and may not strengthen the financial system as they're intended to do.Fed's Kashkari: No discussion about interest-rate cutsFederal Reserve officials have not discussed what it would take to cut interest rates  Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Tuesday.Asked in an interview on Bloomberg about ""a feeling in the market"" that the bar to cut interest rates was not as high now as it was previously  Kashkari replied: ""I have no idea where market participants are getting that. There's no discussion amongst me and any of my colleagues about when we're going to start preparing to cut rates.""Fed's Goolsbee: Slowdown in job growth in October was welcome  as it brought labor market into better balanceThe slowdown in job creation in October was welcome news because it brought the labor market into ""a more balanced"" and sustainable growth  said Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee  on Tuesday.""The job market is getting into better balance. So far the slowdown is what you would want  is what you would expect "" and the labor market is moving toward a sustainable growth rate  Goolsbee said  in an interview on CNBC.Enel Raises Guidance After Surge in ProfitEnel upgraded its guidance for the year after profit more than doubled in the first nine months.The Rome-based energy company on Tuesday reported a net profit of EUR4.25 billion ($4.56 billion)  up from EUR1.76 billion in the first nine months of last year.

The plan  which was suggested for the first time since the start of the Oct. 7 war  raised concerns from the Biden administration.Gilead Sciences Results Beat EstimatesGilead Sciences posted better-than-expected top- and bottom-line results in the latest quarter  which the company credited to its virology and oncology segments.The biopharmaceutical company logged net income of $2.18 billion  or $1.73 a share  for the third quarter ended Sept. 30  compared to $1.79 billion  or $1.42 a share  a year earlier.

Key findings portray a legal industry that is boldly embracing seismic innovations  such as generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)  while continuing efforts to deploy specialized legal technology solutions that can improve their day-to-day work. This is all while law firms and corporate legal departments contend with the changes required to service crucial Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG) needs and attract and retain the talents of a future-ready workforce.“Even in a world increasingly impacted by ChatGPT and other forms of AI  the legal profession continues to derive its strength from human relationships ” said Martin O’Malley  CEO  Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory. “Still  the 2023 Future Ready Lawyer Survey suggests that lawyers are acknowledging the pivotal role of technology in creating more value for their organizations and for society as a whole. This is an essential development for the legal industry. With legal professionals facing the challenge of an ever-growing volume and complexity of legal and regulatory requirements  technology is playing an increasingly important role in their daily work. Whether it’s improving collaboration  cementing relationships  or improving workflows  technology is at the heart of driving the entire industry into the future.”Approaching generative AI with confidenceAttorneys have only just begun embracing generative AI (GenAI). A sizable 73% of the lawyers polled in this year’s Future Ready Lawyer Survey expect to integrate GenAI in their legal work within the next year. Many respondents appear poised to greet this latest technological development with confidence – 68% indicated that they feel prepared for GenAI’s impact while 73% said that they understand how it can be applied to their work. Despite this  there seems to be no consensus among lawyers about whether they see GenAI as an opportunity or a threat. Almost half of the surveyed lawyers (43%) see GenAI as an opportunity  one in four (25%) see it as a threat and 26% see it as both an opportunity and a threat.ESG preparedness not yet at required levelWhile the majority of law firms (68%) have established dedicated ESG practices within the last three years  both law firms and corporate legal departments still have plenty of work ahead of them to meet the heightened demand for ESG-related legal expertise and guidance that has continued to rise steadily over the last two years. According to the survey  69% of law firms and 61% of corporate legal departments say they are not yet very prepared to fully deliver against expectations in the area of ESG. Nevertheless  ESG remains an important strategic growth area  with half of the attorneys surveyed (50%) expecting demand [from clients for ESG legal services] to increase  and 45% expecting demand to stay the same (up from 36% in 2022).Lawyers pressured to expand technology useTechnology has become firmly established as part of the legal profession  with almost all attorneys (87%) saying that technology has improved their day-to-day work. Still  less than half of them (46%)  believe they are fully leveraging technology  50% are transitioning and 4% feel they are not leveraging tech as much as they should. Meanwhile  lawyers continue to face pressure to expand their investment in and use of technology in the face of client demands. Almost half of law firms (46%) rank the need to use technology to improve productivity and efficiency as a top need to meet client demands  as well as improve collaboration and work processes. Lawyers from both law firms (85%) and corporate legal departments (84%) also expect to make greater use of technology that improves productivity.Finding and serving a future-ready workforceThe difficulty of attracting the right people for the right role seems likely to become a major obstacle to tackling heavy workloads and productivity demands. A vast majority (81%) of lawyers from both law firms and corporate legal departments see their ability to recruit and retain talent as a key area of focus moving forward. Still  most (80%) say they’re ready to navigate recruitment demands. Among the most pressing demands from talent – 89% of lawyers say it’s important to have technology that supports their ability to work remotely. Technology aside  the nature of the work itself appears to be changing as well  with most lawyers (78%) from both law firms and legal departments expecting an increased demand for specialization and a decline in generalist work. The stakes are high: Law firm respondents cited specialization as one of the factors clients will use to evaluate their outside counsel in the next three years. Fortunately  a majority of firms and corporations (75%) say they are prepared to offer greater specialization to clients.Formal DEIB plans still a work-in-progressDiversity  Equity  Inclusion and Beloning (DEIB) rates low on the list of workplace satisfaction indicators. Nevertheless  the survey finds that most legal professionals (88%) are satisfied with their employer’s efforts to create a diverse workforce and culture. Additionally  a high percentage of lawyers (82%) work for organizations that claim to have successfully created a diverse and inclusive environment. However  those sentiments don’t necessarily reflect a more formalized approach to promoting DEIB. Only 55% of law firms and corporate legal departments surveyed currently have formal Diversity  Equity Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB) policies in place. Timing varies among firms and legal departments who are still firmly in the planning stage of their DEIB policy implementations  with 22% saying they plan to implement a formal policy in the next 12 months  and 15% targeting “the next few years.”International perspectivesGenerative AI and ChatGPT may be global phenomenons  but the survey indicates that views continue to vary from country to country. More lawyers in the Netherlands (65%) appear to be convinced about the benefits of GenAI than legal professionals in the U.S. (46%)  Belgium (38%) and France (20%). Additionally  professionals from the Netherlands are most likely to see GenAI as an opportunity (65%) while also seeming to have the greatest understanding of how this technology applies to their work (89%) – a sentiment that is also shared by 80% of U.S. legal professionals. Both countries also indicate a rise in demand for ESG guidance in the past year  and the majority have DEIB policies in place. Meanwhile  Belgium  France and Hungary each score below 40% when it comes to having DEIB policies in place.About the surveyWolters Kluwer’s 2023 Future Ready Lawyer Survey includes insights from 700 lawyers in law firms  corporate legal departments and business services firms across in the U.S.  the Netherlands  Germany  France  Spain  Hungary  Italy  Poland and Belgium. Now in its fifth year  the survey continues to examine how client expectations  technology  and market trends are affecting the future of the legal profession and how legal organizations are prepared to address these challenges.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG.

Indeed  this annual event largely accounts for France's centrality in this niche market. In 2022  French auction houses generated 11% of the art photography segment's global auction turnover  a contribution that was almost twice that of its contribution to other artistic mediums at the global level (5.9%).Auction turnover from photographs in France and around the world [ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/11/image1-artmarket-com-photography-at-auction-turnover-france-vs-world-artprice.png ]László Moholy-Nagy -Untitled  Berlin (1922)  sold on 20 October 2023 at Christie's in Paris for $93 400 (Estimated: $160 000 – $260 000)[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/11/image2-artmarket-com-laszlo-moholy-nagy-untitled-berlin-2022-christies-paris-october-2023-20-usd-93-400.jpeg ]thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice: “Paris Photo has become the essential fair for all sectors of photography: this 27th edition of the fair will host international galleries (Pace  Gagosian…) in historic places (Camera Obscura  Le Réverbère…)  press agencies (Magnum  Aperture…)  publishing houses (Actes Sud  Hatje Cantz...)  experimental projects (L'Avant Galerie Vossen  laCollection.io...) as well as the work of numerous photographers (Kristine Potter  Omar Victor Diop...).“We have always been dedicated to endorsing Paris Photo  especially in 2000 when we proudly served as the main sponsor  supporting Rik Gadella in the development of the show "" thierry Ehrmann recalls.The popularity of the photography medium is primarily due to its accessibility: the average price for a photographic work is $6 000 at auction  compared to $41 000 for a painting and $23 000 for a sculpture. This accessibility is partly due to their reproducible nature; photos usually exist in several copies  sometimes in different sizes  which can be exchanged regularly or have equivalents in highly prestigious collections. NFT technology opens up new avenues for informing and reassuring collectors about the quantities of works in circulation.Return to the big names in traditional photographyWith 24 100 lots sold worldwide in 2022 (including 5 000 in France)  sales of photographs represented 3.4% of the total number of fine art auction transactions around the world and generated a total of $147 million. But it was only the 11th best year for this medium  whose turnover reached a record $220 million in 2014. Despite two historic results – for Man Ray's Le Violon d'Ingres (1924) at $12.4 million (Christie's New York on 14 May 2022) and for Edward Steichen's The Flatiron (1904) at $11.8 million (Christie's New York on 9 November 2022) – the high-end photography market is no longer as buoyant as it was ten years ago: there were only six results above the million-dollar threshold in 2022 compared with thirteen in 2014.Since 2020  hard hit by the health crisis  the photography market has nevertheless returned to growth  driven by the big names of the 20th century rather than by the superstars of Contemporary photography. This change in collectors' preferences is particularly noticeable for Andreas Gursky  notably through the results of Pyongyang IV (2007) of which seven very large copies were printed (304 x 207 cm):14/02/2008 : 1 375 000 $ (estimated: $300 000 - $400 000)15/10/2010 : 2 128 000 $ (estimated: $800 000 - $1 120 000 $)11/11/2015 : 1 390 000 $ (estimated: $1 200 000 $ - $1 800 000 $)10/15/2021: Not sold (estimated: $440 000 - $578 000)06/28/2023: Not sold (estimated: $253 000 - $380 000)https://fr.artprice.com/artiste/81985/andreas-gursky/lots/passes?height=304&keyword=Pyongyang%20IV&p=1&percent=5&sort=datesale_aschttps://www.artprice.com/artiste/81985/andreas-gursky/lots/passes?height=304&keyword=Pyongyang%20IV&p=1&percent=5&sort=datesale_ascRichard Avedon  new ‘top-seller'At Paris Photo 2023  the Gagosian Gallery will be presenting works by William Eggleston (1939)  Sally Mann (1951)  and Richard Avedon (1923-2004).

Key findings portray a legal industry that is boldly embracing seismic innovations  such as generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)  while continuing efforts to deploy specialized legal technology solutions that can improve their day-to-day work. This is all while law firms and corporate legal departments contend with the changes required to service crucial Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG) needs and attract and retain the talents of a future-ready workforce.“Even in a world increasingly impacted by ChatGPT and other forms of AI  the legal profession continues to derive its strength from human relationships ” said Martin O’Malley  CEO  Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory. “Still  the 2023 Future Ready Lawyer Survey suggests that lawyers are acknowledging the pivotal role of technology in creating more value for their organizations and for society as a whole. This is an essential development for the legal industry. With legal professionals facing the challenge of an ever-growing volume and complexity of legal and regulatory requirements  technology is playing an increasingly important role in their daily work. Whether it’s improving collaboration  cementing relationships  or improving workflows  technology is at the heart of driving the entire industry into the future.”Approaching generative AI with confidenceAttorneys have only just begun embracing generative AI (GenAI). A sizable 73% of the lawyers polled in this year’s Future Ready Lawyer Survey expect to integrate GenAI in their legal work within the next year. Many respondents appear poised to greet this latest technological development with confidence – 68% indicated that they feel prepared for GenAI’s impact while 73% said that they understand how it can be applied to their work. Despite this  there seems to be no consensus among lawyers about whether they see GenAI as an opportunity or a threat. Almost half of the surveyed lawyers (43%) see GenAI as an opportunity  one in four (25%) see it as a threat and 26% see it as both an opportunity and a threat.ESG preparedness not yet at required levelWhile the majority of law firms (68%) have established dedicated ESG practices within the last three years  both law firms and corporate legal departments still have plenty of work ahead of them to meet the heightened demand for ESG-related legal expertise and guidance that has continued to rise steadily over the last two years. According to the survey  69% of law firms and 61% of corporate legal departments say they are not yet very prepared to fully deliver against expectations in the area of ESG. Nevertheless  ESG remains an important strategic growth area  with half of the attorneys surveyed (50%) expecting demand [from clients for ESG legal services] to increase  and 45% expecting demand to stay the same (up from 36% in 2022).Lawyers pressured to expand technology useTechnology has become firmly established as part of the legal profession  with almost all attorneys (87%) saying that technology has improved their day-to-day work. Still  less than half of them (46%)  believe they are fully leveraging technology  50% are transitioning and 4% feel they are not leveraging tech as much as they should. Meanwhile  lawyers continue to face pressure to expand their investment in and use of technology in the face of client demands. Almost half of law firms (46%) rank the need to use technology to improve productivity and efficiency as a top need to meet client demands  as well as improve collaboration and work processes. Lawyers from both law firms (85%) and corporate legal departments (84%) also expect to make greater use of technology that improves productivity.Finding and serving a future-ready workforceThe difficulty of attracting the right people for the right role seems likely to become a major obstacle to tackling heavy workloads and productivity demands. A vast majority (81%) of lawyers from both law firms and corporate legal departments see their ability to recruit and retain talent as a key area of focus moving forward. Still  most (80%) say they’re ready to navigate recruitment demands. Among the most pressing demands from talent – 89% of lawyers say it’s important to have technology that supports their ability to work remotely. Technology aside  the nature of the work itself appears to be changing as well  with most lawyers (78%) from both law firms and legal departments expecting an increased demand for specialization and a decline in generalist work. The stakes are high: Law firm respondents cited specialization as one of the factors clients will use to evaluate their outside counsel in the next three years. Fortunately  a majority of firms and corporations (75%) say they are prepared to offer greater specialization to clients.Formal DEIB plans still a work-in-progressDiversity  Equity  Inclusion and Beloning (DEIB) rates low on the list of workplace satisfaction indicators. Nevertheless  the survey finds that most legal professionals (88%) are satisfied with their employer’s efforts to create a diverse workforce and culture. Additionally  a high percentage of lawyers (82%) work for organizations that claim to have successfully created a diverse and inclusive environment. However  those sentiments don’t necessarily reflect a more formalized approach to promoting DEIB. Only 55% of law firms and corporate legal departments surveyed currently have formal Diversity  Equity Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB) policies in place. Timing varies among firms and legal departments who are still firmly in the planning stage of their DEIB policy implementations  with 22% saying they plan to implement a formal policy in the next 12 months  and 15% targeting “the next few years.”International perspectivesGenerative AI and ChatGPT may be global phenomenons  but the survey indicates that views continue to vary from country to country. More lawyers in the Netherlands (65%) appear to be convinced about the benefits of GenAI than legal professionals in the U.S. (46%)  Belgium (38%) and France (20%). Additionally  professionals from the Netherlands are most likely to see GenAI as an opportunity (65%) while also seeming to have the greatest understanding of how this technology applies to their work (89%) – a sentiment that is also shared by 80% of U.S. legal professionals. Both countries also indicate a rise in demand for ESG guidance in the past year  and the majority have DEIB policies in place. Meanwhile  Belgium  France and Hungary each score below 40% when it comes to having DEIB policies in place.About the surveyWolters Kluwer’s 2023 Future Ready Lawyer Survey includes insights from 700 lawyers in law firms  corporate legal departments and business services firms across in the U.S.  the Netherlands  Germany  France  Spain  Hungary  Italy  Poland and Belgium. Now in its fifth year  the survey continues to examine how client expectations  technology  and market trends are affecting the future of the legal profession and how legal organizations are prepared to address these challenges.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG.

The Company expects to continue adding headcount across the organization ahead of the U.S. commercial launch.Operating LossTotal operating loss for the third quarter 2023 was €11.0 million versus €8.8 million in the third quarter of 2022.

This represents organic growth of +16.9%.This growth is mainly driven by Solutions30’s excellent momentum from the Benelux countries. The group’s recognized expertise in the deployment of ultra-fast Internet networks (FTTH) has helped position it as a leader in this market. The group will leverage this position as other countries open up  seeing its first significant contracts coming out of Germany in the next few weeks.Revenue by regionIn France  revenue in the third quarter of 2023 was €98.4 million compared to €96.7 million a year earlier  representing growth of 1.7% (0.2% organic growth).Connectivity Solutions generated revenue of €70.9 million  up 2.9% compared to the third quarter of 2022. The usual peak in activity that occurs between September and November was especially significant in September and October this year. This had a positive impact on revenue for this quarter  but it means that the fourth quarter may see a slightly negative impact as a consequence. Nonetheless  this will not undermine the overall progress made by France this year.Revenue from Energy Solutions amounted to €13.0 million compared to €11.5 million the previous year  up 12.9% (0.4% organic growth). This strong performance is due to the growth of operations related to the energy transition. This includes the contribution from Elec ENR  which has been consolidated into the group’s financials since the start of July 2023. This completely offsets the decline in Linky business  and affirms the group’s successful strategic shift in this area  now that the supply chains are fully operational again. Lastly  Technology Solutions posted revenue of €14.5 million  down 11.2% over the quarter  due to worsening economic conditions which are causing customers to cut back on investments.Over the first nine months of the year  revenue in France is down 6.5% to €297.8 million (-7% organic decline).In France  the focus is on returning to profitability by executing a five-point action plan:Restructuring Energy Solutions around a five-pillar strategy  which includes rolling out charging stations for electric vehicles in a B-to-B-to-C model  setting up B-to-B electric vehicle charging stations  industrial-scale photovoltaic solutions  solar panels for the mass market  and the development of smart grids. Developing technicians’ skills to allow them to work across the group’s diverse operations. Further integrating Scopelec’s activities in the Southeast and optimizing production infrastructure. Streamlining and enhancing processes and IT systems to continuously boost quality and leverage synergies across different business areas. Reducing central costs and overhead.The initial effects of this plan were felt in the first half of the year and are expected to continue in the coming quarters.In the Benelux  revenue in the third quarter of 2023 amounted to €89.6 million compared to €53.6 million a year earlier  representing organic growth of 67.1%.Revenue from Connectivity Solutions was €72.4 million during the quarter  compared to €40.3 million in the third quarter of 2022. The 79.7% surge in revenue reflects the rapid expansion of the ultra-fast network in Belgium and the Netherlands  along with the group’s capacity to quickly hire  train  and deploy technicians in the field  which has enabled it to gain and consolidate significant market share. Solutions30 is fully leveraging its extensive expertise from the French market and demonstrating its ability to replicate its successful business model in other European nations.Revenue from Energy Solutions was up 35.4% to €12.8 million  compared with €9.5 million a year earlier. This business is driven by the ongoing deployment of smart meters in Flanders and the start of new contracts related to new energies  electric mobility  and smart grids  demonstrating the synergies of the model created by Solutions30.Lastly  Technology Solutions posted revenue of €4.3 million  up 12.9%.For the first nine months of 2023  revenue amounted to €269.6 million  up 77.2%. Benelux now accounts for 35% of the group’s total revenue  almost as much as its historical market in France  underscoring Solutions30 new international dimension.The EBITDA margin  temporarily affected by rapid growth in the first half of the year  is rebounding as anticipated. This improvement is due to enhanced coordination of our field teams and the streamlining of operational procedures.In all other countries  the group posted quarterly revenue of €62.7 million  compared to €62.1 million a year earlier  representing purely organic growth of 1.0%.In Germany  revenue amounted to €16.4 million compared to €16.2 million the previous year. The group renewed a major contract with its first customer in this country. Under the terms of the contract  the two partners will be working together more closely on coaxial infrastructures. Following the successful conclusion of fiber pilot projects  Solutions30 expects to sign major deployment contracts in the coming weeks. These contracts are highly strategic for the group  as the German market has the greatest potential in Europe  with only 4 million households subscribing to fiber  representing less than 10% of the total number of German households. They are poised to be the next catalysts for the group’s expansion following the Benelux region  ensuring strong organic growth and  consequently  improved visibility.In Italy  revenue amounted to €12.7 million in the third quarter of 2023  compared to €14.8 million one year earlier. Due to worsening conditions under which its contracts are being executed  the group has chosen to slow down the pace of its fiber rollouts. Meanwhile  it is reassessing its structure to mitigate losses in this market until an agreement is reached with its customers.On the Iberian Peninsula  revenue reached €13.0 million  compared to €14.4 million a year earlier. As previously indicated  the group is concentrating on its most profitable activities  especially within the energy sector  in response to the largely mature telecoms market.In Poland  revenue amounted to €11.7 million  up 48.8%. The country continues to benefit from market share gains  in both fixed and mobile networks.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions30’s quarterly revenue was up 2.3% to €9.0 million. The group has discontinued some of its long-established operations to pivot towards expanding its more lucrative FTTH deployments  aligning with the group’s profitability criteria.In all these countries  the group posted revenue of €202.4 million for the first nine months of 2023  an increase of 8.7% (8.6% organic growth) compared to the same period in 2022.OutlookSolutions30 reaffirms its goal to surpass one billion euros in revenue in 2023.The group is actively refining its service offerings to bring profit margins back to a double-digit EBITDA margin (IFRS). However  during periods when Solutions30 is intensively hiring  training  and structuring its operations to manage increased production speeds  the business model is not at peak efficiency. Consequently  the EBITDA margin may experience a temporary decline. In the second half of 2023  the EBITDA margin will continue to improve. The group expects to return to a double-digit EBITDA margin in the course of 2024  the exact timing will hinge on how quickly the deployments in Germany will ramp up.The group aims to resume a path of profitable and sustainable growth  entering a new phase characterized by the expansion into the German market. Solutions30’s financing policy  which relies on self-financing and keeping a low leverage  will continue to be based on three pillars:Recurring working capital on historical contracts is financed by factoring. The deconsolidating factoring program remains competitive  even in the current context of rising interest rates  given the quality of the customers and assigned receivables.Ramp-ups are financed by the group’s cash. Solutions30 has proven in the past that it can finance its substantial growth internally. By concentrating on profitable activities and redeploying its longstanding business model  Solutions30 is well positioned to maintain this growth trajectory  which will be further supported by incorporating the German market.The group finances acquisitions through long-term borrowing  supported by a strong borrowing capacity  as evidenced by a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.7 as of the end of June 2023.By adhering to this non-dilutive financing approach  which Solutions30 plans to maintain  along with executing an improved operational strategy and introducing its services in profitable markets with high potential  the group seeks to rapidly relaunch the creation of shareholder value.Communication timetable for 2024Webinar – Solutions30 Growth Model: 13 December 20232023 Revenue Report: January 24  20242023 Earnings Report: April 3  20242023 Annual Report: April 19  2024Capital Markets Day: May 20242024 Q1 Revenue Report: May 13  2024Annual Shareholders Meeting: June 20242024 Q2 Revenue Report: July 24  20242024 HY Earnings Report: September 18  20242024 Q3 Revenue Report: November 6  2024About Solutions30 SEThe Solutions30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

Third quarter 2023 EBITDA of $54 million decreased 48% compared to the third …,Amsterdam  8 November 2023(Regulated Information) --- AMG Critical Materials N.V. (“AMG”  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: “AMG”) reported third quarter 2023 revenue of $369 million  a 13% decrease versus the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2023 EBITDA of $54 million decreased 48% compared to the third quarter of 2022.Cash from operating activities was $178 million on a year-to-date basis  compared to $111 million for the first nine months of 2022.In 000’s US dollars Q3 ‘23 Q3 ‘22 Change YTDSept ‘23 YTDSept ‘22 Change Revenue $368 717 $424 813 (13%) $1 258 626 $1 252 770 —% EBITDA (1) 53 785 102 603 (48%) 279 349 238 489 17% Cash from operating activities 24 926 74 747 (67%) 178 296 110 598 61% Return on Capital Employed 28.4% 29.5%Note:(1) EBITDA is defined as EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  “The 48% decrease in EBITDA compared to the third quarter of 2022 was driven in large part by the global decline in metal prices within our portfolio  predominantly the lithium price decline. The average quarterly prices of lithium carbonate and ferrovanadium have decreased over 50% and 29%  respectively  versus the average pricing in the third quarter of 2022. On a year-to-date basis  however  EBITDA has increased 17% compared to the first nine months of 2022.We ended the third quarter in a $320 million net debt position  and continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the quarter. As of September 30  2023  the Company had $347 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $195 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $542 million of total liquidity as of September 30  2023. In today’s rising rate environment  AMG continues to benefit from its low-cost fixed-rate debt facilities  and has an average interest rate charge across its two main debt instruments of 5%.AMG Engineering signed $81 million in new orders during the third quarter of 2023  51% higher year-to-date in 2023 than in the same period in 2022  driven by strong orders of remelting and heat treatment furnaces  representing a 1.02x book to bill ratio. AMG’s order backlog was $341 million as of September 30  2023  the highest in AMG’s history for the second straight quarter. This is largely driven by the aerospace market  which is experiencing strong growth. Our third quarter 2023 order intake remains at a very high level  reaching $323 million year-to-date.”Strategic HighlightsThe Supervisory Board has authorized the implementation of a new corporate structure  which will be operational January 1  2024. The present segmental reporting structure will be replaced by three corporate entities: AMG Lithium BV  AMG Vanadium BV  and AMG Technologies (AG/GmbH). Each entity will have its own leadership team and operating management.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  “The three new 100% owned subsidiaries AMG Lithium  AMG Vanadium  and AMG Technologies  have very specific trends and business models  and require very different management skill sets. They will each be managed by newly installed Management Boards  which will exercise their control through respective Supervisory Boards that will reflect corporate governance principles that currently apply to AMG Critical Materials NV.This updated structure will enable AMG to realize strategic  operational  and risk management synergies that will improve decision making  as well as strengthen the resiliency of the organization. This new structure will decrease the potential for overreliance on individual executives  improve succession planning  and improve collaboration throughout the organization. Additionally  the new structure will create strategic flexibility for various forms of equity diversification.”LithiumIn Brazil  the lithium concentrate plant shutdown to facilitate the expansion from 90 000 tons to 130 000 tons will take place in the first quarter of 2024 due to delivery delays of electronic components for processing automation. This will negatively impact second quarter sales volumes. We expect to produce at full run rate capacity  which is 130 000 tons per year  starting in the third quarter of 2024.AMG Brazil’s project with Grupo Lagoa will begin basic engineering in December 2023. From present data  we conclude that the plant will confirm the main assumptions for the construction of a 150 000-ton lithium concentrate plant at the site.AMG’s lithium hydroxide refinery’s first 20 000-ton module in Bitterfeld  Germany  is in the initial phases of commissioning and the ramp-up and the qualification process is planned for the second and third quarters of 2024. We expect to produce approximately 7 000 tons of qualified battery-grade lithium hydroxide in 2024 which is not included in our EBITDA guidance for 2024. We expect to produce and sell a full 20 000 tons in 2025.VanadiumThe spent catalyst roasting facility in Zanesville  Ohio operated at full capacity for the third quarter and outperformed our roasting facility in Cambridge  Ohio. The Zanesville melt shop has operated at full capacity utilization and the Vanadium team is focused on increasing operational availability  optimizing cycle time and increasing yield.AMG’s innovative lithium vanadium battery (“LIVA”) projects are integral for industrial power management applications and accelerate the industrial energy transition. The batteries are currently under various stages of bidding and development. One is operational  three are under construction  and 13 are in bidding and development stages  with a total megawatt hour (MWh) capacity of 379 MWh.The vanadium electrolyte plant at AMG Titanium in Nuremberg  Germany is under construction. The target capacity is 6 000 m³ vanadium electrolyte  the equivalent of approximately 100 MWh  which will serve the electricity storage market  including a vertical integration into LIVA batteries. Production is expected to start in the first quarter of 2024.Applying a newly developed process technology  AMG Titanium in Nuremberg  Germany has started to process spent roasted catalyst to V 2 O 5 .O . Shell & AMG Recycling’s (“SARBV”) project development of a closed loop circular recycling facility in the Middle East is progressing. Phase I of the “Supercenter” project  a hydrometallurgical facility to process vanadium-containing gasification ash  is under a long-term contract with Aramco. The gasification ash will be processed into vanadium oxide and then to vanadium electrolytes for use in batteries in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Phase I is expected to reach FEL3 status by the end of the year. The “Supercenter” concept also includes spent catalyst recycling projects  fresh catalyst production  and the manufacturing of vanadium batteries. The Phase I facility will also produce 6 000 m³ of electrolyte  which will support 100 MWh of vanadium redox flow battery capacity annually. In addition  a LIVA Hybrid Energy Storage System and a Fresh Catalyst R&D facility will be part of Phase 1.Financial HighlightsCash from operating activities was $25 million in the third quarter of 2023  and $178 million on a year-to-date basis  compared to $111 million for the first nine months of 2022.AMG’s liquidity as of September 30  2023 was $542 million  with $347 million of unrestricted cash and $195 million of revolving credit availability.Annualized return on capital employed was 28.4% for the first nine months of 2023  compared to 29.5% for the same period in 2022.AMG Engineering’s order backlog of $341 million as of September 30  2023  the highest in AMG’s history  was driven primarily by the aerospace industry.Key FiguresIn 000’s US dollars Q3 ‘23 Q3 ‘22 Change YTDSept ‘23 YTDSept ‘22 Change Revenue $368 717 $424 813 (13%) $1 258 626 $1 252 770 —% Gross profit 66 803 112 071 (40%) 334 179 289 505 15% Gross margin 18.1% 26.4% 26.6% 23.1% Operating profit 24 059 121 680 (80%) 202 249 224 740 (10%) Operating margin 6.5% 28.6% 16.1% 17.9% Net income attributable to shareholders 163 68 146 N/A 99 147 126 892 (22%) EPS - Fully diluted 0.00 2.09 N/A 3.04 3.91 (22%) EBIT (1) 40 225 91 536 (56%) 239 149 205 532 16% EBITDA (2) 53 785 102 603 (48%) 279 349 238 489 17% EBITDA margin 14.6% 24.2% 22.2% 19.0% Cash from operating activities 24 926 74 747 (67%) 178 296 110 598 61%Notes:(1) EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes.

Ferrovanadium production increased 48% versus the third quarter of 2022.Gross profit for the quarter decreased 60% compared to the same period in the prior year  primarily due to the lower sales prices. The primary driver is the lithium price decline. Also  vanadium gross profit was lower due to fixed price inventory being processed from global sources. All other existing contracts are under indexed prices. We are working towards long-term contracts similar to our Cambridge model.SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2023 were higher than the same period in 2022 at $15 million  mainly driven by the increase in headcount related to the lithium and vanadium expansion projects  as well as higher employee benefit costs.The third quarter 2023 EBITDA decreased 53%  to $39 million  from $84 million in the third quarter of 2022  due to the decline in metal prices as noted above.During the third quarter of 2023  a total of 16 012 dry metric tons (“dmt”) of lithium concentrates was sold. The third quarter experienced lower sales volumes due to shipping schedule variances noted in the second quarter. The average realized sales price was $2 395/dmt CIF China for the quarter. The average cost per ton for the quarter was $529/dmt CIF China. The cost per ton is lower than the second quarter due to higher sales volumes of tantalum concentrate in the current quarter.In 2024  we anticipate the cost per ton to rise due to unabsorbed costs during the ramp-up as well as lower relative tantalum sales volumes offsetting higher spodumene production. It is important to note that AMG is one of the lowest cost mines in the world and we plan to maintain that position.AMG Critical MineralsQ3 ‘23 Q3 ‘22 Change Revenue $52 593 $84 935 (38%) Gross profit 6 887 674 922% Operating (loss) profit (269) 40 301 N/A EBITDA 1 247 7 327 (83%)AMG Critical Minerals’ revenue for the third quarter of 2023 decreased by 38%  to $53 million  mainly due to lower volumes across the segment largely driven by the silicon metal plant operating one furnace during the quarter  as discussed in detail below. The slowdown in the European industrial economy also continued to negatively impact the segment.Gross profit of $7 million in the third quarter of 2023 was $6 million higher compared to the same period last year  largely due to the significant increases in gas and electricity costs experienced in the third quarter of 2022.SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2023 of $7 million were in line with the same period in 2022.The third quarter 2023 EBITDA decreased 83% compared to the same period in 2022  to $1 million  due to silicon shutdown as well as the slowdown in the end-use markets for the segment in the current quarter.AMG Silicon operated one of four furnaces throughout the third quarter and plans to operate one furnace for the remainder of 2023. The operational parameters of the silicon business will continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Due to the noted interruptions in AMG Silicon’s operations  the financial impact of the business will be excluded from EBITDA during this period of abnormal operations. However  AMG Silicon generated $10 million in cash flow from operating activities during the quarter driven by the receipt of energy sales made in the fourth quarter of 2022.AMG Critical Materials TechnologiesQ3 ‘23 Q3 ‘22 Change Revenue $175 780 $151 560 16% Gross profit 25 583 24 943 3% Operating profit 5 616 6 491 (13%) EBITDA 13 383 11 602 15%AMG Critical Materials Technologies' third quarter 2023 revenue increased by $24 million  or 16%  compared to the same period in 2022. This improvement was driven by strong revenues in our engineering unit  as well as higher sales volumes of titanium alloys and chrome metal  partially offset by lower chrome metal pricing.SG&A expenses increased by 10% in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022  due to additional personnel at AMG Engineering and AMG LIVA corresponding to the record order backlog and business development  respectively.AMG Critical Materials Technologies’ EBITDA was $13 million during the quarter compared to $12 million in the same period of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher profitability in Engineering and Titanium  partially offset by lower chrome margins driven by continued sequential decline in chrome price in the third quarter of 2023.AMG Engineering signed $81 million in new orders during the third quarter of 2023  driven by strong orders of remelting and heat treatment furnaces  representing a 1.02x book to bill ratio. Order backlog was $341 million as of September 30  2023  the highest in AMG’s history.AMG Engineering has been selected by PCC’s TIMET to supply the vacuum melting and re-melting furnaces for their new  state-of-the-art Titanium melt facility in Ravenswood  West Virginia. AMG’s scope includes several vacuum arc re-melting  electron beam welding  and electron beam melting furnaces  signifying one of the largest orders in all of AMG Engineering’s history.Financial ReviewTaxAMG recorded an income tax expense of $13 million in the third quarter of 2023  compared to $39 million in the same period in 2022. This variance was mainly driven by lower profitability in the current quarter.AMG paid taxes of $33 million in the third quarter of 2023  compared to tax payments of $10 million in the third quarter of 2022  primarily due to the timing lag in tax payments relative to tax expense recognition.Exceptional ItemsAMG’s third quarter 2023 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA.A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in the third quarters of 2023 and 2022 are below:Exceptional items included in gross profitQ3 ‘23 Q3 ‘22 Change Gross profit $66 803 $112 071 (40%) Inventory cost adjustment 1 388 — N/A Restructuring expense 2 745 11 N/A Asset impairment expense — 11 587 N/A Strategic project expense 4 924 1 241 297% Gross profit excluding exceptional items 75 860 124 910 (39%)AMG Vanadium had a $1.3 million non-cash expense during the third quarter of 2023. This is a result of inventory cost adjustments associated with declining prices and an increased inventory position of spent catalyst as we diversify our sourcing strategy which has been adjusted in EBITDA.SG&AAMG’s third quarter 2023 SG&A expenses were $43 million compared to $37 million in the third quarter of 2022  with the increase largely attributable to higher personnel costs driven by increased hiring in our Lithium  Engineering  and LIVA businesses.LiquiditySeptember 30  2023 December 31  2022 Change Senior secured debt $337 952 $348 622 (3%) Cash & cash equivalents 347 293 346 043 —% Senior secured net (cash) debt (9 341) 2 579 N/A Other debt 12 170 14 959 (19%) Net debt excluding municipal bond 2 829 17 538 (84%) Municipal bond debt 319 064 319 244 —% Restricted cash 1 428 6 920 (79%) Net debt 320 465 329 862 (3%)AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the third quarter. As of September 30  2023  the Company had $347 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $195 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $542 million of total liquidity as of September 30  2023.Net Finance CostsAMG’s third quarter 2023 net finance cost was $9 million compared to $14 million in the third quarter of 2022. This decrease was mainly driven by foreign exchange gains of $3 million during the quarter primarily due to non-cash intergroup balances and higher interest income earned on an increased cash and cash equivalents balance in the third quarter 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. Additionally  in today’s rising rate environment  AMG continues to benefit from its low-cost fixed-rate debt facilities. AMG has an average interest rate charge across its two main debt instruments of 5%.OutlookSince the end of July when we issued the previous 2023 EBITDA guidance of between $350 million and $380 million  market prices for spodumene and lithium carbonate have decreased by 50% and 43%  respectively. Given these price decreases  AMG’s new EBITDA guidance for the full year 2023 is approximately $320 million.Considering the ramp-up of the strategic projects explained above  as well as the volatility of our key material prices  specifically lithium  it is challenging to provide firm guidance for 2024. The recent fall in lithium prices has surprised every industry participant. Establishing the cause of the fall in prices and projecting future movements involves analyzing both the Chinese lithium industry as well as broader macroeconomic factors in China.Given the difficulty of this analysis  and despite certain signs that the lithium supply and demand picture remains strong  there is high uncertainty with regard to near-term pricing dynamics. Therefore  utilizing today’s depressed price levels  AMG’s EBITDA will be approximately $200 million in 2024 with a stronger performance in the second half of the year.Profit for the period to adjusted EBITDA reconciliationQ3 ‘23 Q3 ‘22 Profit for the period $1 002 $68 339 Income tax expense 12 565 38 603 Net finance cost 9 295 13 988 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 392 1 386 Restructuring expense 2 745 11 Net contract settlements — (46 407) Silicon’s partial closure (739) — Inventory cost adjustment 1 388 — Asset impairment expense — 11 587 Strategic project expense (1) 11 196 3 282 Share of loss of associates 1 197 750 Others 184 (3) EBIT 40 225 91 536 Depreciation and amortization 13 560 11 067 EBITDA 53 785 102 603Notes:(1) The Company is in the initial development and ramp-up phases for several strategic expansion projects  including the joint venture with Shell  the LIVA Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational.

However  the limitations imposed by the requirement for immunosuppression have hindered its widespread application. Adocia has set out to overcome this hurdle and has developed AdoShell® Islets  an implantable and fully retrievable scaffold for islet transplantation that eliminates the need for immunosuppressive drugs while ensuring the success of the transplantation procedure.AdoShell® is based on a permselective hydrogel scaffold  reinforced by a mechanical frame  specifically designed to facilitate the diffusion of insulin while effectively preventing the invasion of immune cells. This innovative biomaterial  comprised of 95% water  is synthesized using non-degradable polymers cross-linked by bio-orthogonal click chemistry. This technology is protected via three patent applications4.Human islets encapsulated in AdoShell® scaffold maintain  in vitro  a gluco-responsive insulin secretion comparable to naked islets. The islet functionality is maintained at identical levels for at least 4 months. Encapsulated islets maintain rapid insulin release in response to glucose stimulation  compared to naked islets.To evaluate the efficacy of AdoShell® in vivo  encapsulated rat islets in AdoShell® were implanted into immunocompetent STZ5-induced diabetic rats (allograft). The results obtained are really encouraging:- In 5 independent studies  a significant insulin secretion from encapsulated islets was obtained over 1 month  compared to control diabetic rats.- AdoShell® Islets induced physiological weight gain  hyperglycemia reduction and sustained insulin secretion for more than 4 months.- Implants were easily and safely retrieved  and as expected  rats reverted to diabetic phenotype after removal.One of the remarkable aspects of AdoShell® is its outstanding biocompatibility. After 7 months of implantation in the rat peritoneal cavity  AdoShell® Islets demonstrated excellent tolerance without triggering any inflammatory reaction nor fibrosis. Notably  neither biodegradation nor immune cell penetration was observed.AdoShell® Islets is scalable for clinical application  and implants parameters (density  thickness  etc) have been optimized in preparation for a first-in-human study.The surgical procedure has been validated in pigs  with quick and easy implantation and explantation by laparoscopy.The outcomes achieved by AdoShell® Islets in preclinical trials hold true promises for people with T1D. This technology could not only obviate the need for immunosuppression but also ensure extended functionality  and outstanding biocompatibility. The potential of AdoShell® Islets could have a fundamental impact on the lives of millions of people living with diabetes and the way we approach its treatment.Clinical and Business PerspectivesAdocia is committed to advancing the development of AdoShell®  making it one of its strategic priorities. Adocia is actively working towards initiating clinical trials to bring this technology to patients as quickly and safely as possible. Adocia is preparing interactions with the EMA (European Medicines Agency) to validate the proposed development plan. AdoShell® Islets could then be tested in clinics by the end of 2024.Preclinical data generated so far trigger interest from the scientific community and pharmaceutical industry.In parallel  AdoShell® scaffold  as a technology platform  is being considered for applications with stem cells and in other therapeutic areas (Parkinson disease  hemophilia  oncology  etc.). The deployment of the platform will be driven by interests from future partners.About AdoShell® IsletsAdoShell® Islets is an immuno-protective synthetic biomaterial containing islets of Langerhans. After implantation  the islets encapsulated in AdoShell® secrete insulin in response to blood glucose levels. The physical barrier formed by AdoShell® allows the implanted cells to be invisible to the host's immune system while allowing the necessary physiological exchanges to occur for the survival and function of the islets. AdoShell® Islets is easily implantable through a minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy) and is fully retrievable. This biomaterial has demonstrated to be biocompatible and non-fibrotic.About AdociaAdocia is a biotechnology company specializing in the discovery and development of therapeutic solutions in the field of metabolic diseases  primarily diabetes and obesity.The company has a broad portfolio of drug candidates based on four proprietary technology platforms: 1) The BioChaperone® technology for the development of new generation insulins and products combining insulins with other classes of hormones; 2) AdOral®  an oral peptide delivery technology; 3) AdoShell®  an immunoprotective biomaterial for cell transplantation  with a first application in pancreatic cells transplantation; 4) AdoGel®  a long-acting drug delivery platform.Adocia holds more than 25 patent families. Based in Lyon  the company has more than 80 employees.

This is nothing new. We have the best product in the market ” Mr Jackson insisted.He added: “We continue to invest heavily in marketing and generosity in the market. We will be continuing to deliver great experiences for customers in Q4 and we’ll also watch carefully what ESPN and other players do in the market.”In the first half of the year  FanDuel became the first online sports betting operator in the US to make a profit. Flutter said on Thursday that it expects the division to deliver adjusted earnings of £140m (€161m) this year  versus a previous estimate of between £90m and £190m.Flutter  which is the world’s biggest online gambling firm  said that it had 2.56 million monthly players  on average  in the US during the third quarter  which was 38pc higher year-on-year. It had a 40pc share of online sports betting revenue there during the period and has seen a strong customer response to the new US football season.But shares in Flutter plunged more than 10pc after it said that excluding the US  it expects to post adjusted earnings of £1.44bnfor 2023  compared with a previously guided range of between £1.44bn and £1.6bn.During the third-quarter  group revenue was up 13pc year-on-year at £2bn on a constant currency basis  while the number of average monthly players was 16pc higher at 11.1 million.The lower guidance was a result of customer-friendly sports results in September and October  a foreign exchange hit  and continued weakness in the Australian market.Flutter also confirmed that it aims to ditch its share listing on Dublin’s Euronext as it plans a listing debut in New York in the first quarter of 2024. It said that while it will retain a dual listing in London for the time being  it may ultimately pursue a primary listing in the US.Mr Jackson declined to comment on the outflow of big-name companies from Dublin Euronext  after CRH recently delisted its shares there.Following Flutter’s impending departure  Ryanair will become the largest Irish-listed firm on the Euronext.

While China continued to experience a soft recovery  our third-quarter revenue outside China grew by +9.9% organically and exceeded the 2019 level for the first time. This performance has been driven by the strong growth of digital  the ongoing recovery of our transport activities and by the continued growth of street furniture.Digital Out of Home (DOOH) grew strongly at +27.9%  +31.1% on an organic basis  to reach a record 36.2% of Group revenue vs 29.9% in Q3 2022 including a continued strong momentum of the programmatic advertising sales ecosystem through the VIOOH SSP (Supply Side Platform) and Displayce DSP (Demand Side Platform).All activities grew positively organically. Street Furniture delivered a solid organic revenue growth of +5.3% driven by digital and a continued high demand from advertisers. Transport’s organic revenue growth reached +15.4% reflecting the global airport passenger traffic recovery over the period almost back to pre-covid level except international traffic in China. Billboard grew by +2.5% organically driven in particular by its most digitised markets.All geographies grew positively organically including UK and Rest of the World growing double-digit. France  Rest of Europe and Rest of the World were above their 2019 revenue levels  while Asia was still significantly behind mainly due to China which remained impacted by a soft recovery in consumer spending and by international air traffic still c.50% below pre-covid levels as well as by the non-renewal of the Guangzhou airport and metro contracts.As far as Q4 is concerned  we now expect an organic revenue growth rate at around +6% partly driven by the ongoing recovery of Transport.We are confident that Out of Home (OOH) will continue to grow its market share in a fragmented media landscape with Digital Out of Home (DOOH) being the second fastest growing media segment. JCDecaux as the industry leader and the most digitised global OOH Media company is well positioned to benefit from this digital transformation.”Following the adoption of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014  the operating data presented below are adjusted to include our prorata share in companies under joint control.Please refer to the paragraph “Adjusted data” on page 3 of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros.

North America and Asia Pacific were double-digit above Q3 2019 revenue levels.ADJUSTED DATAUnder IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method. However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group  operating data of the companies under joint control will continue to be proportionately integrated in the operating management reports used by directors to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q3 2023  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€66.0 million (-€60.9 million in Q3 2022)  leaving IFRS revenue at €789.0 million (€747.5 million in Q3 2022).For the first nine months of 2023  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€184.1 million(-€167.8 million for the first nine months of 2022)  leaving IFRS revenue at €2 255.9 million (€2 115.4 million for the first nine months of 2022).ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 Q2 H1 Q3 9M 2022 adjusted revenue (a) 683.0 791.8 1 474.8 808.4 2 283.2 2023 IFRS revenue (b) 671.8 795.2 1 466.9 789.0 2 255.9 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 49.5 68.6 118.1 66.0 184.1 2023 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 721.3 863.7 1 585.0 855.0 2 440.0 Currency impacts (e) 1.2 19.1 20.3 33.4 53.7 2023 adjusted revenue at 2022 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 722.5 882 8 1 605.3 888.4 2 493.7 Change in scope (g) -5.7 -9.3 -15.0 -12.2 -27.2 2023 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 716.8 873.6 1 590.3 876.2 2 466.6 Organic growth (i) = (h)/(a)-1 +5.0% +10.3% +7.8% +8.4% +8.0%€m Impact of currencyas of September 30th  2023 CNY 14.8 AUD 12.5 GBP 6.8 USD 3.7 Others 15.9 Total 53.7Average exchange rate 9M 2023 9M 2022 CNY 0.1312 0.1425 AUD 0.6170 0.6647 GBP 1.1484 1.1804 USD 0.9230 0.9400Forward looking statementsThis release may contain some forward-looking statements.

First and foremost  we are satisfied with the encouraging disease control rate achieved in late stage and heavily pretreated melanoma patients in the ATLAS-IT-05 study. Secondly  we recognize the large commercial potential that could be realized through the potential use of LTX-315 in basal cell carcinoma patients. After examining the reassuring data from the Phase II study presented by our partner Verrica Pharmaceuticals during this quarter  we very much look forward to the results of their entire Phase II study  which is expected to be completed during the first half of 2024. Adding to that  we have great expectations for the upcoming study where LTX-315 will be tested in earlier stage melanoma patients in the neoadjuvant NeoLIPA trial at Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet during 2024.”Highlights from the third quarter 2023  and post-period events:ATLAS-IT-05 – Encouraging preliminary data presented at ESMO 2023:Disease control rate of 43% and one patient achieving a partial response to dateThere is evidence of tumor shrinkage in both injected and non-injected lesionsVerrica Pharmaceuticals’ Phase II study evaluating LTX-315 for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC):Complete clearance was observed in lesions treated with the highest dose testedBased on the stronger than expected activity observed in patients receiving LTX-315  Verrica has decided to accelerate the clinical development of LTX-315 and to complete the entire Phase II study in H1 2024Neoadjuvant study in earlier stage melanoma patients:An investigator led Phase II study at Oslo University Hospital  Radiumhospitalet is being plannedThe study protocol was presented at the 15th Nordic Melanoma Meeting  October 12thKey figures (unaudited):Profit and loss:Balance sheet:CEO Øystein Rekdal  CDO Graeme Currie and CFO Gjest Breistein will host a webcast for investors and analysts today at 14.30 CEST.The presentation and subsequent Q&A session will be held in English and may be viewed live by registering here: https://forms.office.com/e/N0xJzSx0GgThe presentation is now available at www.lytixbiopharma.com in the Investors’ section  and a recording of the presentation will be made available after the presentation.For more information  please contact:Gjest Breistein  CFOE-Mail: gjest.breistein@lytixbiopharma.comOle Peter Nordby  Head of IR & Communications ManagerE-mail: ole.peter.nordby@lytixbiopharma.comOptimum Strategic CommunicationsNick Bastin  Jonathan EdwardsE-mail: lytix@optimumcomms.comLytix in brief:Based in Oslo  Norway  Lytix Biopharma is a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing novel cancer immunotherapies  an area within cancer therapy that is aimed at activating the patient’s immune system to fight cancer. The Company’s technology is based on pioneering research in “host defense peptides” – nature’s first line of defense towards foreign pathogens. Lytix Biopharma’s lead product  LTX-315  is a first-in-class molecule representing a new and superior therapeutic principle to kill cancer cells and boost anti-cancer immunity  with the potential to be the ideal combination partner with other types of immunotherapies. LTX-315 targets cancer cells and disintegrates their cell membranes  causing immunogenic cell death and release of a patient’s tumor specific antigens. This mode of action allows cytotoxic T cells to recognize  infiltrate  and attack cancer cells.
