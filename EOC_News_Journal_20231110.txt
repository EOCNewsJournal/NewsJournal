The bank will be using technology from Swiss enterprise tech firm Metaco  which was recently acquired by blockchain startup Ripple  to store bonds and other securities.The new digital assets custody service  which is set to go live in 2024  will complement HSBC Orion  the bank’s platform for issuing digital assets  as well as HSBC’s recently launched offering for tokenized physical gold  as the bank works towards creating a complete digital asset offering for institutional clients.HSBC already lets its Hong Kong clients trade in bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs).Euroclear launches issuance serviceThe HSBC announcement followed the news that Euroclear  a major European clearinghouse  had launched a solution for the issuance of digital securities.The Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) service  which went live on October 24  enables the issuance  distribution and settlement of fully digital international securities – referred to as Digitally Native Notes (DNN) – on distributed ledger technology (DLT).The World Bank was the first organization to issue digital securities on the new platform.Deutsche Bank teams up with crypto firm TaurusIn Germany  Deutsche Bank signed in September a partnership agreement with Swiss crypto infrastructure firm Taurus to provide digital asset custody and tokenization services to the bank’s institutional clients. The partnership means Deutsche Bank will  for the first time  be able to hold a limited number of cryptocurrencies for its clients  as well as tokenized versions of traditional financial assets.The bank participated in Taurus’ US$65 million Series B funding round back in February 2023  and further demonstrated in June its intention to push into the crypto sector when it applied for regulatory approval to operate a custody service for digital assets  including cryptocurrencies.Stock exchange operator launches digital asset trading platformIn the UK  bourse operator the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) is also jumping on bandwagon  unveiling in September that it was working on the launch of a blockchain-powered trading venue that would allow investors to trade tokenized assets  Murray Roos  head of capital markets at the LSE Group  told the Financial Times in September.The move would see the LSEG becoming one of the world’s first large global stock exchanges to offer extensive trading of traditional financial assets on DLT  following the lead of other bourse operators including Switzerland’s SIX  which launched its DLT-based exchange for digital assets back in 2021.Asia sees new developmentsBanks are also ramping up their tokenization and crypto efforts in Asia. In Singapore  UBS Asset Management launched in October a live pilot of an Ethereum-based tokenized money market fund. The pilot is being conducted through UBS Tokenize  the firm’s dedicated platform for digital assets  as part of Project Guardian  a collaborative industry initiative led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).Meanwhile  Zodia Custody and Zodia Markets  two crypto companies owned by British bank Standard Chartered  are aggressively expanding their services across Asia-Pacific (APAC)  launching services in Hong Kong  Singapore  Japan and Australia in recent months.The tokenization opportunityThese developments highlight the increasing convergence of traditional financial services and digital assets as incumbents increasingly turn to DLT and tokenization to increase efficiency  lower operational costs  and improve accessibility and transparency.Global management consultancy Roland Berger forecasts that the market for asset tokenization could mushroom to at least US$10 trillion by 2030  representing a 40-fold increase in the value of tokenized assets from 2022 to 2030.,neutral,0.08,0.92,0.01,negative,0.02,0.48,0.5,True,English,"['Traditional Financial Institutions', 'Digital Assets Efforts', 'Taurus’ US$65 million Series B funding round', 'first large global stock exchanges', 'Ethereum-based tokenized money market fund', 'new digital assets custody service', 'Swiss enterprise tech firm', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'British bank Standard Chartered', 'Swiss crypto infrastructure firm', 'new digital assets service', 'complete digital asset offering', 'digital asset trading platform', 'The Digital Securities Issuance', 'Global management consultancy', 'Stock exchange operator', 'new growth opportunities', 'digital asset custody', 'blockchain startup Ripple', 'ether exchange-traded funds', 'major European clearinghouse', 'blockchain-powered trading venue', 'collaborative industry initiative', 'lower operational costs', 'digital assets offerings', 'UBS Asset Management', 'new developments Banks', 'two crypto companies', 'digital international securities', 'traditional financial assets', 'The HSBC announcement', 'other bourse operators', 'digital assets services', 'traditional financial services', 'British bank HSBC', 'Hong Kong clients', 'The World Bank', 'new platform', 'tokenized assets', 'Zodia Custody', 'crypto firm', 'issuance service', 'D-SI) service', 'LSE Group', 'DLT-based exchange', 'tokenized securities', 'other securities', 'first organization', 'first time', 'extensive trading', 'asset tokenization', 'Traditional banking', 'financial institutions', 'tokenized versions', 'crypto sector', 'Financial Times', 'crypto efforts', 'UBS Tokenize', 'dedicated platform', 'institutional clients', 'physical gold', 'Native Notes', 'limited number', 'regulatory approval', 'Murray Roos', 'capital markets', 'Project Guardian', 'Monetary Authority', 'Zodia Markets', 'recent months', 'increasing convergence', 'Roland Berger', '40-fold increase', 'Deutsche Bank', 'HSBC Orion', 'tokenization efforts', 'tokenization services', 'tokenization opportunity', 'ledger technology', 'partnership agreement', 'live pilot', 'cryptocurrencies', 'pace', 'bid', 'efficiencies', 'transparency', 'Euroclear', 'LSEG', 'Metaco', 'bonds', 'bitcoin', 'ETFs', 'news', 'solution', 'October', 'distribution', 'settlement', 'DNN', 'Germany', 'September', 'February', 'June', 'intention', 'UK', 'bandwagon', 'launch', 'investors', 'head', 'move', 'lead', 'Switzerland', 'SIX', 'Asia', 'Singapore', 'MAS', 'APAC', 'Japan', 'Australia', 'incumbents', 'efficiency', 'accessibility', 'value']",2023-11-10,2023-11-10,fintechnews.ch

32504,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.businesspost.ie/commercial-reports/making-the-planet-your-stakeholder-for-a-sustainable-future/,Making the planet your stakeholder for a sustainable future,With environmental issues no longer possible to ignore  the ESG Autumn Summit highlighted how important it will be to treat both local and global communities as crucial stakeholders,With environmental issues no longer possible to ignore  the ESG Autumn Summit highlighted how important it will be to treat both local and global communities as crucial stakeholdersESG has quickly become a pertinent topic  especially with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) coming into play.This and the many issues around society  climate change and cooperation set the stage for the ESG Autumn Summit  which took place in the Radisson Blu Royal Hotel on Thursday  November 9.The entire day saw a heavily engaged audience make the most of the occasion  with many questions asked of the various practitioners and experts speaking on the day.Shay Cloherty  managing director of iQuest Ltd  welcomed everyone to the summit  as did the summit chair Joe Lynam  broadcaster and business editor for Newstalk.Lynam set the scene by highlighting the many recent events caused by climate change  including major flooding  heatwaves  and wildfires  saying  “ESG policies couldn’t be more relevant today.”The opening keynote focused on the climate and everything emergency and had John Gibbons  climate change journalist and commentator  delivering a sober talk. He clarified what was at stake and how important it was for the world to act now.“These are special and consequential times that we live in ” he said. “The targets and goals are complex  but a simple way of thinking about them is pain theory: how much pain do you want? The way to think about this is that three paths lie ahead: mitigation  adaptation  or suffering.”Continuing this was Derarca Dennis  partner at EY  who looked at the preparation needed for the future of mandatory ESG disclosures. Discussing the European Sustainability Reporting Standards  she said the good news is that this topic is being looked at worldwide.“What’s different about the CSRD in Europe is the stakeholder is the whole community  not just your investors  and that’s very different ” she said. “That creates different dynamics and exposure for your company.”Next was a practitioner’s perspective on sustainability strategy development and reporting  delivered by Geoff Dooley  head of sustainability services at Antaris Consulting. For example  he brought up AstraZeneca’s approach as a good benchmark for sustainability reporting and stated that organisations need to make the business case for sustainability; otherwise  it won’t stick.“What AstraZeneca did is not just provide guidelines but minimum requirements ” he explained. “If you want to be one of their suppliers  you must have an emissions trajectory that aligns with the 1.5°C Paris Climate Accord commitment.“Sustainability is being positioned as a licence to operate  so we have to make the compelling business case.”After the first of many Q&As with speakers  the focus went on to the role of double materiality – referring to how information disclosed by a company can be material  both in how it impacts the company’s financial value as well as its impact on the world – and how it ties into sustainability reporting.Dee Moran  FCA  professional accountancy lead at Chartered Accountants Ireland  and Mike O’Halloran  FCA  technical manager of advocacy and voice department for Chartered Accountants Ireland  took the stage to discuss this topic.When asked about the 1 100 data points and 85 disclosure requirements the CSRD covers  Moran said that not all data points will apply to every industry and won’t all have to be covered.“Data points on climate will be important for all. For some  certain social ones will be more important for particular sectors ” she said.While CSRD came up numerous times throughout the day  Maureen O’Donnell  BWR Mark (Business Working Responsibly) manager for Business in the Community  gave an overview of it and CSDDD and how the latter is going to make businesses change through actions and consequences for not following it.Before the coffee break  Enda Gunnell  chief executive of Pinergy  spoke about strategies for improved sustainability reporting  the large role microgeneration can play  and how much solar has taken hold on the island.“Microgeneration is here to stay ” he said. “We’ve made huge progress in allowing and facilitating solar PV generation. Before  I would have said Ireland is a wind country  but that’s changing. We’re still at the point where 1 per cent can generate their own power  but that is growing weekly.”Previous Next Image 1 of 3 From left: Geoff Dooley  head of sustainability services  Antaris Consulting; Derarca Dennis  partner  EY; and John Gibbons  climate change journalist and commentator.

Stream one focused on ESG data challenges and was chaired by Brian O’Kennedy  chief executive of Clearstream Solutions.Stream two looked at setting up an effective sustainability reporting programme  chaired by Joe Lynam.The final stream discussed the path to sustainability for SMEs and was chaired by Sarah Blake  sustainability consultant for Earthology.Afterwards  all three gave a round-up of their respective streams.Stream one began with a look at the ESG data journey and the most challenging issues. This featured Aebhín Cawley  chief executive and founder of Scott Cawley; Brian Kennedy  CFA  senior global equity portfolio manager at Mediolanum International Funds Ltd(MIFL); and Dave O’Shaughnessy  partner at EY.Next up was a panel on collecting high-quality Scope 3 data and embedding circularity in supply chains  bringing together Geoff Dooley  head of sustainability services at Antaris Consulting; Ken Mulkerrins  group head of innovation & sustainability for Kilsaran Group; Les O’Reilly  managed services country lead for HP Ireland; and Marion Briggs  vice-president of Alliance to Zero.Summing it up  O’Kennedy commended both panels for being intriguing and highlighted a central point where nature was described as the silent stakeholder on these issues.The second stream started with Maria Diffley  co-founder and director of SustainIQ  discussing six steps to identify and plug gaps in a company’s ESG reporting.Following this was a panel discussion on providing practical advice on producing sustainability reports that stakeholders can trust. This brought together Dr Maria Kirrane  head of sustainability & climate action at University College Cork; Emer Keaveny  partner at EY; John Curran  managing director of Blue Planet Consulting; and Nicola Woods  chief technology officer of An Post.Curran mentioned the strong audience participation in each panel  highlighting the importance of identifying stakeholders and demonstrating how you’ve rigorously gone through your ESG process.The third and final stream on sustainability for SMEs began by discussing how collaboration between large enterprises and SMEs is a win-win for the planet.Liz Waters  chief executive of Watershed Group; Paul Monaghan  group head of sustainability at Mannok; and Paul Murphy  climate action solutions lead at Climeaction  took part in this discussion.That stream finished up by providing concrete measures to help SMEs on their sustainable transition  on which Alexa Toomey  head of sustainability  renewable energy and agtech at Enterprise Ireland; Darragh Blake  banking and finance partner at Eversheds Sutherland LLP (Ireland); Denise Bell  director of Bell Lane Coffee Ltd; and Philip Connor  head of energy services at Pinergy  gave their thoughts.Blake mentioned how the themes of collaboration and data were primary considerations throughout each panel and how framing problems as opportunities is a good takeaway.Previous Next Image 1 of 3 From left: Darragh Blake  banking and finance partner  Eversheds Sutherland LLP (Ireland); Sarah Blake  sustainability consultant  Earthology; Philip Connor  head of energy services  Pinergy; Denise Bell  director  Bell Lane Coffee Ltd; and Alexa Toomey  head of sustainability  renewable energy and agtech  Enterprise Ireland.

Photo by MAURA HICKEYChange is always possibleWith Lynam welcoming everyone back after lunch and the three stream moderators giving their takes  it was back to the final run of panels.The first panel looked at future-proofing your business with B Corp certification  which began with a presentation from James McManus  director of B Lab Ireland. He was later joined in a panel discussion with Louise O’Connor  CSR strategist for Strong Roots  and Mary Gray  marketing director of Urban Volt.Addressing concerns about revenue growth  McManus mentioned that those B Corp companies that looked after their stakeholders  which included employees  the community and more  saw an average revenue growth rate of 22 per cent.The final panel of the day looked at communicating and engaging with stakeholders and included Jonathan Carr  client director of Havas Genus; Lorraine Fitzgerald  head of sustainability at Glenveagh Properties PLC; Margot Slattery  global head of diversity  inclusion and belonging at ISS World Services; and Sylvia Coldrick  chief risk officer for Liberty Insurance.Slattery mentioned how  in ESG  the social and governance parts tend to be overshadowed by the environmental issues  saying that to her  the social element is the impact on the business  the community and the ecosystem. Likewise  Carr mentioned that how you engage with those stakeholders is crucial and makes a huge difference in the long run.When asked for their closing remarks  the message was that it’s never too late to change  and to see this as an opportunity to innovate and do things differently.

32509,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.coinspeaker.com/deutsche-borse-horizon-2026/,Deutsche Börse Announces New Investment Strategy Dubbed Horizon 2026 to Tap on Digital Assets,According to the Horizon 2026 plan  Deutsche Börse intends to double down on digitizing its trading platforms.,Deutsche Börse intends to further use cloud computing to accelerate the development of its digital post-trading platform D7 and a crypto trading platform to ensure sustainable future growth prospects.The Web3 market and blockchain technology have triggered a fast shift in the global financial system from the traditional stock market to digital assets and tokenization in the past few years. The shift has been accelerated by the ongoing crypto regulatory changes around the world led by European countries. In Germany  the country’s legislators have passed several crypto regulations to ensure a secure and sustainable environment for web3 developers  institutional investors  and retail traders. As a result  stock trading powerhouses Deutsche Börse AG (ETR: DB1) announced a new investment strategy dubbed Horizon 2026 geared towards growing its earnings and customer base year over year.According to the Horizon 2026 plan  Deutsche Börse intends to double down on digitizing its trading platforms in a bid to encompass more instruments in the coming years. Moreover  the traditional stock trading platforms are slowly being phased out by web3 exchanges both centralized and decentralized. Consequently  Deutsche Börse is committed to developing its cloud computing infrastructure to enhance its real-world asset tokenization.“Deutsche Börse is a leader in the area of ​​digital applications. In the long term  there is further growth potential from new technologies through the digitalization of existing or new asset classes along with corresponding trading and settlement platforms ” the company noted.Notably  Deutsche Börse has been offering its clients a tokenization platform dubbed D7 through distributed infrastructure and markets. However  the company noted that it is putting in place cloud computing infrastructure to further enhance the D7 platform. In addition to the D7 platform  Deutsche Börse highlighted that it intends to have a digital assets trading platform leveraging its cloud computing infrastructure.Deutsche Börse and Its Market OutlookAmid other strategic moves geared towards improving its earnings in the coming future  Deutsche Börse stock has gained about 5.17 percent in the past five days to trade around €166.95 on Friday. The €30.29 billion valued company has struggled to continue with its decade-bull rally since 2020 amid the Covid-19-related financial turbulence. Nonetheless  the company is keen to continue giving back to the shareholders by restructuring its business model and focusing on digital assets.As a result  the DB1 stock market received an average rating of over 22 analysts surveyed by MarketWatch. Notably  Deutsche Börse is competing with other global stock exchanges – like the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange Group Plc – in venturing into the digital assets market to ensure their future growth prospects. Moreover  more investors are expected to adopt digital assets in flight to quality amid high inflation and market uncertainties.,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.01,negative,0.01,0.1,0.89,True,English,"['Deutsche Börse', 'New Investment Strategy', 'Digital Assets', 'London Stock Exchange Group Plc', 'ongoing crypto regulatory changes', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'other global stock exchanges', 'Deutsche Börse AG', 'Deutsche Börse stock', 'traditional stock trading platforms', 'place cloud computing infrastructure', 'sustainable future growth prospects', 'digital assets trading platform', 'traditional stock market', 'stock trading powerhouses', 'global financial system', 'other strategic moves', 'DB1 stock market', 'several crypto regulations', 'crypto trading platform', 'new investment strategy', 'new asset classes', 'Covid-19-related financial turbulence', 'digital post-trading platform', 'The Web3 market', 'real-world asset tokenization', 'past five days', 'digital assets market', '30.29 billion valued company', 'web3 exchanges', 'sustainable environment', 'growth potential', 'new technologies', 'corresponding trading', 'coming future', 'settlement platforms', 'tokenization platform', 'Market Outlook', 'market uncertainties', '\u200b\u200bdigital applications', 'web3 developers', 'D7 platform', 'blockchain technology', 'European countries', 'retail traders', 'customer base', 'Horizon 2026 plan', 'long term', 'decade-bull rally', 'business model', 'average rating', 'high inflation', 'fast shift', 'institutional investors', 'coming years', 'development', 'Germany', 'country', 'legislators', 'secure', 'result', 'ETR', 'earnings', 'bid', 'instruments', 'leader', 'area', 'digitalization', 'existing', 'clients', 'markets', 'addition', '5.17 percent', 'Friday', 'shareholders', '22 analysts', 'MarketWatch', 'flight', 'quality']",2023-11-10,2023-11-10,coinspeaker.com

While China continued to experience a soft recovery  our third-quarter revenue outside China grew by +9.9% organically and exceeded the 2019 level for the first time. This performance has been driven by the strong growth of digital  the ongoing recovery of our transport activities and by the continued growth of street furniture.Digital Out of Home (DOOH) grew strongly at +27.9%  +31.1% on an organic basis  to reach a record 36.2% of Group revenue vs 29.9% in Q3 2022 including a continued strong momentum of the programmatic advertising sales ecosystem through the VIOOH SSP (Supply Side Platform) and Displayce DSP (Demand Side Platform).All activities grew positively organically. Street Furniture delivered a solid organic revenue growth of +5.3% driven by digital and a continued high demand from advertisers. Transport’s organic revenue growth reached +15.4% reflecting the global airport passenger traffic recovery over the period almost back to pre-covid level except international traffic in China. Billboard grew by +2.5% organically driven in particular by its most digitised markets.All geographies grew positively organically including UK and Rest of the World growing double-digit. France  Rest of Europe and Rest of the World were above their 2019 revenue levels  while Asia was still significantly behind mainly due to China which remained impacted by a soft recovery in consumer spending and by international air traffic still c.50% below pre-covid levels as well as by the non-renewal of the Guangzhou airport and metro contracts.As far as Q4 is concerned  we now expect an organic revenue growth rate at around +6% partly driven by the ongoing recovery of Transport.We are confident that Out of Home (OOH) will continue to grow its market share in a fragmented media landscape with Digital Out of Home (DOOH) being the second fastest growing media segment. JCDecaux as the industry leader and the most digitised global OOH Media company is well positioned to benefit from this digital transformation.”Following the adoption of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014  the operating data presented below are adjusted to include our prorata share in companies under joint control.Please refer to the paragraph “Adjusted data” on page 3 of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros.

North America and Asia Pacific were double-digit above Q3 2019 revenue levels.ADJUSTED DATAUnder IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method. However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group  operating data of the companies under joint control will continue to be proportionately integrated in the operating management reports used by directors to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q3 2023  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€66.0 million (-€60.9 million in Q3 2022)  leaving IFRS revenue at €789.0 million (€747.5 million in Q3 2022).For the first nine months of 2023  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€184.1 million(-€167.8 million for the first nine months of 2022)  leaving IFRS revenue at €2 255.9 million (€2 115.4 million for the first nine months of 2022).ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 Q2 H1 Q3 9M 2022 adjusted revenue (a) 683.0 791.8 1 474.8 808.4 2 283.2 2023 IFRS revenue (b) 671.8 795.2 1 466.9 789.0 2 255.9 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 49.5 68.6 118.1 66.0 184.1 2023 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 721.3 863.7 1 585.0 855.0 2 440.0 Currency impacts (e) 1.2 19.1 20.3 33.4 53.7 2023 adjusted revenue at 2022 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 722.5 882 8 1 605.3 888.4 2 493.7 Change in scope (g) -5.7 -9.3 -15.0 -12.2 -27.2 2023 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 716.8 873.6 1 590.3 876.2 2 466.6 Organic growth (i) = (h)/(a)-1 +5.0% +10.3% +7.8% +8.4% +8.0%€m Impact of currencyas of September 30th  2023 CNY 14.8 AUD 12.5 GBP 6.8 USD 3.7 Others 15.9 Total 53.7Average exchange rate 9M 2023 9M 2022 CNY 0.1312 0.1425 AUD 0.6170 0.6647 GBP 1.1484 1.1804 USD 0.9230 0.9400Forward looking statementsThis release may contain some forward-looking statements.

The results detailing the technical aspects of the development of this platform and showcasing the easiness  efficiency  and tunability of this technology to knock-down up to four target genes simultaneously have been published in Molecular Therapy – Nucleic Acids as of September 20.NKG2D-based CAR T-cells: We have developed different CD19/NKG2DL  BCMA/NKG2DL and PSMA/NKG2DL multi-specific CAR T-cells  utilizing both tandem constructs – that encompass the extracellular domain of the natural NKG2D receptor fused to a scFv targeting CD19  BCMA or PSMA  or dual constructs – that co-express the NKG2D-based CAR with an anti-CD19  anti-BCMA or anti-PSMA CAR  respectively; Our data provides the proof-of-concept that NKG2DL are valuable targets in a multispecific CAR approach; Specifically  we showed that CD19/NKG2DL multispecific CAR T-cells  and in particular dual receptors  are highly effective in vitro against CD19+ and CD19- cell lines and against CD19+ primary B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells. In vivo  CD19/NKG2DL tandem CAR T-cells outperforms dual CAR T-cells in controlling tumor growth in an aggressive B-ALL relapse model. In vitro data generated with BCMA/NKG2DL and PSMA/NKG2DL multispecific CAR T-cells further validate this approach and its application in other hematological and solid indications. Preliminary data were presented at the 4th ICLE conference in Munich (September 12-14) and at the 38th SITC meeting in San Diego (November 1-5) and posters are available on the company’s website  at https://celyad.com/our-science-technology/publications/.Financial highlights – Third quarter 2023 financial reviewAs of September 30  2023  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €2.3 million. Net cash burn during the third quarter of 2023 amounted to €2.7 million  in line with expectations.The Company projects that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2024.After due consideration of detailed budgets and estimated cash flow forecasts for the years 2023 and 2024  the Company continues to project that its existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund its estimated operating and capital expenditures over at least the next 12 months from the date that this release is issued.On August 24  2023  the Company announced that it has obtained commitments from Fortress  Tolefi and other longstanding existing shareholders to subscribe to a capital increase of up to €9.8 million (whose €2.0 million related to the first tranche has been already proceeded as of September 4  2023). Taking into account the Management’s assumptions regarding estimated cash-flows for the years 2023  2024 and 2025  the Company believes that following the close of the second tranche subscribed by Fortress which is subject to approval by the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting  its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient  based on the current scope of activities  to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2025.Upcoming Anticipated MilestonesMore data and evidence in the context of the multi-specific CAR platform and shRNA multiplexing approach will be shared in the first quarter of 2024  with the aim of a clinical evaluation of assets and initiation of clinical trials either by the Company and/or through strategic partnerships afterwards.Upcoming ConferencesCelyad Oncology will attend the 7th CAR-TCR Europe summit in London  UK (February 27-29  2024)  the must-attend forum to brainstorm advanced in cell therapies and stay at the forefront of cell therapy innovations.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a cutting-edge biotechnology company dedicated to pioneering the discovery and advancement of revolutionary technologies for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells.

There were some key…,We recently sat down with Mehdi Hemici  Chief Loyalty & Ecommerce Officer at Accor  and Ravindra Bhagwanani  Managing Director at Global Flight  to dig a little deeper into the findings in our ‘Hospitality Ahead’ Report published in March. There were some key discussions about the ongoing transformations in loyalty and how we need to adjust these programs to better suit consumer demand.Discover the video “3 Insights on Loyalty Transformation”Loyalty programs are undergoing a much-needed evolution. The focus is on delivering a rewards system which is simpler  personalized  transparent and provides greater value. This next generation of loyalty needs to connect with the traveler on a deeper level to ultimately fulfill its desire for connection and experiences.Simplicity Induces TrustLoyalty should be simple. In a world filled with endless choices and complicated rewards programs  our mission is clear: we want to make loyalty easy.As a loyalty industry  we still have a way to go to make loyalty a bit simpler. Clients should know exactly what they are going to get  and in doing so  we believe it induces a little bit more trust. Clients have said three things to us: make my life simple  make my life special  and look after me. Mehdi Hemici  Chief Loyalty & Ecommerce Officer  AccorPersonalization Needs a Human TouchHow do we achieve personalization at scale? The ultimate key is in the delivery. The challenge is to ensure that delivery at scale is as personalized as possible  so that the valued loyalty member indeed feel special and looked after in the easiest manner possible. All while balancing data and the human touch.What’s also important in this whole process of loyalty is not to lose sight of the basic principles. And for me the basics are in psychology. Being loyal is a natural human characteristic. And loyalty programs are based on that principle. Ravindra Bhagwanani  Managing Director  Global FlightThe core of a loyalty program is indeed powered by data. Yet it’s the human touch which involves truly understanding the client at the end of that cycle  which is key. It’s the magic touch actually at the hotel which will make all of the difference. That’s what loyalty is about today. Mehdi Hemici  Chief Loyalty & Ecommerce Officer  AccorData is Key to Exceeding Clients ExpectationsA key question asked to our two experts was  Would you rather know everything in advance about your clients or find out the information by speaking with them? . This inquiry clearly pits human interaction against data  with both factors potentially having significant importance. But it's by listening to clients  and also by harnessing their data  that we can go beyond their expectations.For me at the beginning of the cycle  the focus is to listen to the client  then look at the data  and then just really focus on the data. At the beginning  the customer insights were actually telling us more about what they needed than the data  but now the focus is data  data  data. There are some things clients don't even know they want or need. And so by wowing them through the data  you actually achieve a lot more. But we do still listen to our clients every time they come into our hotels as well. Mehdi Hemici  Chief Loyalty & Ecommerce Officer  AccorYou can look at your data and you see exactly what our customers like and how they react. For me  the answer is very clear. If you don’t have a program at the beginning  the situation is different  but once you have the program  the focus is really on the data side.

This includes the evolution of retailer sales at the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres. Growth was seen in all sectors apart from household equipment  in which revenues remained stable.By way of comparison  figures from French retail federation Procos show average sales growth of 3% for specialist retailers in France.Ongoing sustained letting activityMRM signed 18 new leases or lease renewals during the first nine months of the year  with an average reversion rate of +7.2%. Overall  these leases represent a total floor area of 9 200 sqm and cumulative annual rent of €1.0 million  equal to 7.9% of MRM’s gross annualised rental base.Gross rental incomeGross rental income for the first nine months of the year was boosted by the full effect of the acquisition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres  integrated as of 16 November 2022  as well as indexation and new leases coming into effect. At the same time  gross rental income was also affected by the freeing up of stores  in particular by retailers in difficulty at national level  and more specifically in personal goods  as well as the departure of office tenants at the Carré Vélizy mixed-use development.In total  gross rental income for the first nine months of the year was 61.8% higher than during the same period last year  at €11.6 million. Gross rental income for the third quarter of 2023 came to €3.8 million  an increase of 57.4%.On a like-for-like basis2  i.e. excluding the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres  gross rental income rose by 2.9% over the first nine months of the year and 0.4% in the third quarter of 2023.€m Q32023 Q32022 Change Like-for-like change2 9M 2023 9M2022 Change Like-for-like change2 Total grossrental income 3.84 2.44 +57.4% +0.4% 11.55 7.14 +61.8% +2.9%(Unaudited figures)OutlookOver the full year in 2023  MRM’s results will benefit from 12 full months of activity for the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres compared with just 1.5 months last year. However  the full effect of the integration of these shopping centres combined with new leases coming into effect and a positive indexation will be partly limited by the freeing up of premises and the strategic vacancy that will be maintained at the Flins shopping centre during the work project under study.MRM is continuing the dynamic management of its assets on the basis of its larger portfolio focusing on the following priorities:• Development and implementation of programmes to enhance the value of its historic portfolio together with the two shopping centres acquired at the end of 2022;• Letting available space;• Rolling out the company’s ESG action plan and Climate Plan  paying particular attention to reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the trajectories proactively published in April 2023 in the Statement of Non-Financial Performance (Declaration of Extra-Financial Performance  DPEF in French);• Managing the property portfolio dynamically  looking at potential acquisitions and disposals.MRM confirms its target of annualised net rents of over €16 million by 2025. This target is based on the current portfolio (excluding any acquisitions and disposals).CalendarRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2023 annual results are due on 7 March 2024 after market close.About MRMMRM is a listed real estate company that owns and manages a portfolio of retail properties across several regions of France.

It will delist from Euronext Dublin simultaneously or shortly before this point.The group  which will keep its listing on the London Stock Exchange  said it is appropriate to maintain “just two listings to minimise regulatory complexities.”For more than a year  the group had been considering a US stock market flotation of a small holding in FanDuel  which has grown to become the group’s largest business by revenue as several US states legalised sports betting.It instead opted for an additional group listing to boost Flutter’s profile  as well as open access to new capital markets.In a trading update published today  Flutter also reported an increase in revenues in the third quarter of the year as the number of average monthly players continues to rise.Group revenue was £2.035bn (€2.33bn) in the “seasonally quieter” period  up 8pc from the same period in 2022.Sports revenue declined by 2pc year-on-year following adverse sports results  while gaming revenue jumped by 22pc in the three-month period.Average monthly players increased by 16pc to over 11 million in the quarter.FanDuel recorded a strong start to the NFL season with a record number of new players acquired. Flutter reported that the US brand had a 40pc share of the online sports betting gross revenue market in the third quarter of 2023.FanDuel’s iGaming revenues also soared by 52pc in the period.Excluding the US market  sales were up 10pc due to customer friendly results in sports fixtures  as well as a declining Australian racing market.UK and Ireland revenues rose by 11pc  while the customer base increased by 5pc.The group now anticipates US revenue of around £3.75bn  as well as adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortisation (Ebitda) of £140m.Previously  the group had expected revenues of between £3.6bn and £3.9bn  as well as adjusted Ebitda of between £90m and £190m.Group Ebitda outside of the US is expected to be around £1.44bn  the lower end of the previously guided range  despite customer friendly results and adverse movements in foreign exchange rates.Chief executive Peter Jackson said the group was particularly pleased by its US performance.“We are the first online operator to achieve structural profitability  and the strong ramp in Ebitda uring 2023 will continue into 2024 and beyond  as our profit margins expand materially ” he said.He added that Flutter is making good progress towards its US listing  which will offer “significant benefits from accessing the world’s deepest and most liquid capital markets.”,neutral,0.09,0.9,0.01,mixed,0.29,0.26,0.44,True,English,"['Flutter Entertainment', 'Euronext Dublin', 'online sports betting gross revenue market', 'The Paddy Power owner', 'declining Australian racing market', 'Chief executive Peter Jackson', 'US stock market flotation', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'first online operator', 'London Stock Exchange', 'foreign exchange rates', 'liquid capital markets', 'new capital markets', 'average monthly players', 'customer friendly results', 'adverse sports results', 'several US states', 'additional US listing', 'US market', 'additional group listing', 'Sports revenue', 'new players', 'Exchange Commission', 'sports fixtures', 'new listing', 'additional listing', 'US revenue', 'customer base', 'gaming revenue', 'adverse movements', 'US Securities', 'US brand', 'US performance', 'first quarter', 'Euronext Dublin', 'two listings', 'regulatory complexities', 'small holding', 'largest business', 'open access', 'trading update', 'strong start', 'NFL season', '40pc share', 'lower end', 'structural profitability', 'strong ramp', 'profit margins', 'good progress', 'significant benefits', 'Group revenue', 'third quarter', 'quieter” period', 'same period', 'three-month period', 'next year', 'a year', 'record number', 'Ireland revenues', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Group Ebitda', 'application', 'point', 'FanDuel', 'profile', 'increase', '16pc', '52pc', 'sales', 'UK', '11pc', '5pc', 'earnings', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'range', 'world', 'deepest']",2023-11-09,2023-11-10,independent.ie

Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q3 2023  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€66.0 million (-€60.9 million in Q3 2022)  leaving IFRS revenue at €789.0 million (€747.5 million in Q3 2022).For the first nine months of 2023  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€184.1 million(-€167.8 million for the first nine months of 2022)  leaving IFRS revenue at €2 255.9 million (€2 115.4 million for the first nine months of 2022).ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 Q2 H1 Q3 9M 2022 adjusted revenue (a) 683.0 791.8 1 474.8 808.4 2 283.2 2023 IFRS revenue (b) 671.8 795.2 1 466.9 789.0 2 255.9 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 49.5 68.6 118.1 66.0 184.1 2023 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 721.3 863.7 1 585.0 855.0 2 440.0 Currency impacts (e) 1.2 19.1 20.3 33.4 53.7 2023 adjusted revenue at 2022 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 722.5 882 8 1 605.3 888.4 2 493.7 Change in scope (g) -5.7 -9.3 -15.0 -12.2 -27.2 2023 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 716.8 873.6 1 590.3 876.2 2 466.6 Organic growth (i) = (h)/(a)-1 +5.0% +10.3% +7.8% +8.4% +8.0%€m Impact of currencyas of September 30th  2023 CNY 14.8 AUD 12.5 GBP 6.8 USD 3.7 Others 15.9 Total 53.7Average exchange rate 9M 2023 9M 2022 CNY 0.1312 0.1425 AUD 0.6170 0.6647 GBP 1.1484 1.1804 USD 0.9230 0.9400Next information:Q4 2023 revenue: January 25th  2024 (after market)Key Figures for JCDecaux2022 revenue: €3 317m (a) – H1 2023 revenue: €1 585m (a)– H1 2023 revenue: €1 585m N°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of more than 850 million people in more than 80 countries1 040 132 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 573 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants11 200 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexesJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (3.4/5)  CDP (A-)  MSCI (AA) and has achieved Platinum Medal status from EcoVadis1st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (604 536 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 153 airports and 205 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (333 620 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (101 976 advertising panels worldwide)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (654 957 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (170 973 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (129 305 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (24 198 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (19 371 advertising panels)(a) Adjusted revenueFor more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on Twitter   LinkedIn   Facebook   Instagram and YouTube .Forward looking statementsThis news release may contain some forward-looking statements.

In France  the marketplace accounted for over 14% of e-commerce volume in September 2023 (+1.5 points in one quarter).

The Initiating Shareholders hold in aggregate 84.7% of the outstanding Shares of BW Ideol  which is being contributed to the Offeror subject to completion of the Offer.Under the Offer  eligible shareholders of BW Ideol will be offered a cash offer price of NOK 12 per Share in BW Ideol (the ""Cash Consideration""). The cash offer price represents a premium of 42.2% to the closing price of the Shares on 8 November 2023 and premium of 44.5%  and 34.2% to the volume-weighted average share price of BWI on Euronext Growth during the last 30 trading days and the last 90 trading days  respectively  up to and including 8 November 2023.The Offer will also include a share alternative  whereby eligible shareholders may elect to receive settlement for their Shares in BW Ideol in the form of shares in the Offeror on a 1:1 basis (the ""Share Consideration""). The shares in the Offeror are not  and are not intended to be  listed on any stock exchange  regulated market or multilateral trading facility. Shareholders electing to receive the Share Consideration will be required to enter into a shareholders' agreement regulating the ownership in the Offeror which will be described in more detail in the Offer Document (as defined below).The board of directors of BW Ideol (excluding its members having a conflict of interest with respect to the Offer) (the ""Board"") have unanimously resolved to recommend the shareholders of BW Ideol to accept the Offer on the basis of an independent fairness opinion from Carnegie AS commissioned by the Board The Board's recommendation will be enclosed in the Offer Document (as defined below) to be published by the Offeror on or about 14 November 2023.In order to realise the growth of the company and meet upcoming capital commitments  BW Ideol will require additional financing. Debt financing is not considered to be available on satisfactory terms. The Offer allows for BW Ideol’s public equity investors to realise all cash for their shares at a substantial premium to the market price in an illiquid equity. Raising new equity capital in an efficient manner is further constrained by the current Euronext Growth listed setting and capital market sentiment  and any such equity raise is expected to lead to a substantial dilution for non-participating shareholders. At the same time  the minority shareholders are given an alternative to the Cash Consideration to continue as shareholders together with the Initiating Shareholders by accepting the Share Consideration. The Initiating Shareholders further believe that BW Ideol  if privately held  will be able to raise capital more efficiently from investors that invest in privately held growth companies  including other industrial investors beyond BW Offshore. Additionally  the company would benefit from reduced cost  freed-up management time and reduced formal obligations.About the Offer:The Offeror has entered into contribution agreements with the Initiating Shareholders. Pursuant to the contribution agreements  the Initiating Shareholders have agreed (subject to the completion of the Offer) to transfer their Shares in BW Ideol to the Offeror free of any encumbrances against a consideration equal to the Share Consideration under the Offer  i.e. shares in the Offeror on a 1:1 basis  with the exception of 213 775 Shares which will be sold by certain Initiating Shareholders to the Offeror at the Offer Price.The Offeror and BW Ideol have entered into a transaction agreement (the ""Transaction Agreement"") regarding the Offer  pursuant to which  on certain terms and conditions  the Offeror has agreed to make  and the Board has agreed to recommend  the Offer.The complete details of the Offer  including all terms and conditions  will be contained in a combined offer document and national prospectus (the ""Offer Document"") to be sent to all eligible shareholders following registration of the Offer Document with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises accordance with the provisions for national prospectuses in Chapter 7 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.Completion of the Offer will be subject to the following main conditions being satisfied or waived by the Offeror:The Offeror receiving acceptances for the number of Shares in the Company required in order for the Offeror to become the owner of at least 90% of the total number of Shares and votes in BW Ideol.

The Initiating Shareholders hold in aggregate 84.7% of the outstanding Shares of BW Ideol  which is being contributed to the Offeror subject to completion of the Offer.Under the Offer  eligible shareholders of BW Ideol will be offered a cash offer price of NOK 12 per Share in BW Ideol (the ""Cash Consideration""). The cash offer price represents a premium of 42.2% to the closing price of the Shares on 8 November 2023 and premium of 44.5%  and 34.2% to the volume-weighted average share price of BWI on Euronext Growth during the last 30 trading days and the last 90 trading days  respectively  up to and including 8 November 2023.The Offer will also include a share alternative  whereby eligible shareholders may elect to receive settlement for their Shares in BW Ideol in the form of shares in the Offeror on a 1:1 basis (the ""Share Consideration""). The shares in the Offeror are not  and are not intended to be  listed on any stock exchange  regulated market or multilateral trading facility. Shareholders electing to receive the Share Consideration will be required to enter into a shareholders' agreement regulating the ownership in the Offeror which will be described in more detail in the Offer Document (as defined below).The board of directors of BW Ideol (excluding its members having a conflict of interest with respect to the Offer) (the ""Board"") have unanimously resolved to recommend the shareholders of BW Ideol to accept the Offer on the basis of an independent fairness opinion from Carnegie AS commissioned by the Board. The Board's recommendation will be enclosed in the Offer Document (as defined below) to be published by the Offeror on or about 14 November 2023.In order to realise the growth of the company and meet upcoming capital commitments  BW Ideol will require additional financing. Debt financing is not considered to be available on satisfactory terms. The Offer allows for BW Ideol’s public equity investors to realise all cash for their shares at a substantial premium to the market price in an illiquid equity. Raising new equity capital in an efficient manner is further constrained by the current Euronext Growth listed setting and capital market sentiment  and any such equity raise is expected to lead to a substantial dilution for non-participating shareholders. At the same time  the minority shareholders are given an alternative to the Cash Consideration to continue as shareholders together with the Initiating Shareholders by accepting the Share Consideration. The Initiating Shareholders further believe that BW Ideol  if privately held  will be able to raise capital more efficiently from investors that invest in privately held growth companies  including other industrial investors beyond BW Offshore. Additionally  the company would benefit from reduced cost  freed-up management time and reduced formal obligations.About the Offer:The Offeror has entered into contribution agreements with the Initiating Shareholders. Pursuant to the contribution agreements  the Initiating Shareholders have agreed (subject to the completion of the Offer) to transfer their Shares in BW Ideol to the Offeror free of any encumbrances against a consideration equal to the Share Consideration under the Offer  i.e. shares in the Offeror on a 1:1 basis  with the exception of 213 775 Shares which will be sold by certain Initiating Shareholders to the Offeror at the Offer Price.The Offeror and BW Ideol have entered into a transaction agreement (the ""Transaction Agreement"") regarding the Offer  pursuant to which  on certain terms and conditions  the Offeror has agreed to make  and the Board has agreed to recommend  the Offer.The complete details of the Offer  including all terms and conditions  will be contained in a combined offer document and national prospectus (the ""Offer Document"") to be sent to all eligible shareholders following registration of the Offer Document with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises accordance with the provisions for national prospectuses in Chapter 7 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.Completion of the Offer will be subject to the following main conditions being satisfied or waived by the Offeror:The Offeror receiving acceptances for the number of Shares in the Company required in order for the Offeror to become the owner of at least 90% of the total number of Shares and votes in BW Ideol.

The companies are collectively referred to as ""Icelandic Salmon"" or the ""Gro…","Bíldudalur  9th of November 2023Icelandic Salmon is the parent company of Arnarlax  and other subsidiaries involved in salmon farming and processing in Iceland. The companies are collectively referred to as ""Icelandic Salmon"" or the ""Group"".OperationsIn the third quarter 2023  Icelandic salmon resumed harvesting  following a second quarter with limited harvest volume. The group harvested 4 040 tonnes in the quarter  up from 3 804 tonnes in the third quarter 2022.“Our team demonstrated strong adaptability and commitment during a time with changing working conditions. Following a summer with limited harvest due to our focus on biological growth  we started harvesting in July. In the third quarter  total harvest came in slightly above the corresponding quarter last year  and the biological performance for the quarter was good” said Bjørn Hembre  CEO of Icelandic Salmon.The group reported revenues of 42 million EUR in the third quarter 2023  up from 34 million EUR in the third quarter 2022. The EBIT for the quarter was positive of 3.0 million EUR  resulting in an EBIT/kg harvest of EUR 0.73. The EBIT/kg harvest was down from the corresponding quarter last year of EUR 0.99  due to higher costs  partly offset by strong price achievement compared to market prices.The smolt stocking continued in the third quarter and the group achieved operational improvements in smolt production. YTD the smolt weight is 236  up 36% from 2022.“The quality of the smolt is good and the survival rate of smolts is high. We see good effect of recent years’ investment and operational focus in our smolt production. “said Bjørn Hembre  CEO of Icelandic Salmon.In October 2023  after the end of the third quarter  the group had to respond to an unfortunate biological challenge in Tálknafjörður. The incident was soon deemed a risk to animal health and the wellbeing of the fish  and a decision was made to take out significant volumes (see more information in Outlook below).Strategic milestonesIn September  Icelandic Salmon held its first Capital market day  giving stakeholders valuable insights into its operations and growth plans  and successfully completed a dual listing on the NASDAQ First North exchange in Iceland. This listing makes the company’s shares more easily accessible for Icelandic investors.In August  Arnarlax signed a commitment letter for its first sustainability-linked loan agreement  totalling EUR 100 million  with DNB  Danske Bank and Arion Bank who stepped in with an overdraft facility and as security agent for the loan agreement. The agreement was successfully completed in the beginning of November.OutlookFor the year 2023 as a whole  Icelandic Salmon expects to harvest 17 000 tonnes of salmon  up from the previous estimate of 16 000 tonnes. The increase is a result of growth beyond expected on our spring 2022 generation.As mentioned above  Icelandic Salmon decided to take out significant volumes of fish in Tálknafjörður. This will have a one-off impact estimated at around EUR 5-6 million on profits in the fourth quarter 2023. Harvest volumes for 2024 is expected at 15 000 tonnes.“For the longer term  we continue to see a potential for growth up to 26.000 tonnes on existing licenses supported by strong demand for sustainably farmed Atlantic Salmon ” said Bjørn Hembre  CEO of Icelandic Salmon.The presentation 9th of NovemberAttached is the presentation for the third quarter.The presentation will be held at Arion Bank headquarters in Borgartún 19  105 Reykjavík  in the conference room Þingvellir today  9th of November.

A capacity reservation agreement has been signed between both parties and Nexans has committed to reserve manufacturing and installation capacity for a significant contract to be signed in 2024.An essential project for the renewable energy transition in the UKIn recent years  the Orkney Islands have made significant investments to develop the generation of electricity from renewable sources. Existing and planned renewable energy projects on the islands will generate more electricity than can be consumed or exported with the existing grid infrastructure. With this increased generation capacity due to come online in the coming years  connecting Orkney to the Scottish transmission network has become a necessity to be able to export this renewable electricity and increase the proportion of low-carbon electricity in the UK.The 220 kV AC subsea and land cables supplied by Nexans will play a decisive role in the energy transition in the UK  illustrating the Group's commitment to the electrification of the world.A decisive partnership with SSEN TransmissionThis success demonstrates the quality of the solutions provided by Nexans and the technical expertise of its teams  whose collaboration with SSEN Transmission over the last few years has been of the highest quality. The agreement is an important step in our partnership with SSEN Transmission  which will continue until the official signing of the contract in the second quarter of 2024.This agreement will enable Nexans to further expand its presence in the UK and confirms its ambition to build strong relationships worldwide with strategic companies such as SSEN Transmission  a major player in electrification.Pascal Radue  EVP Generation and Transmission at Nexans  said: “This agreement marks a significant milestone for Nexans and we look forward to collaborating closely with SSEN Transmission. The Orkney transmission link is critical for the development of renewable energy in the UK  and underscores our commitment to advancing electrification and renewable energy in the region.”Sandy Mactaggart  Director of Offshore Delivery at SSEN Transmission  said: “We are delighted to have successfully secured the manufacturing and installation capacity with Nexans for the Orkney transmission link  a key milestone to support the timely delivery of this project. We now look forward to working closely in partnership with Nexans to conclude contractual arrangements and cement our strong working relationship as we work together to further unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential.”About NexansFor over a century  Nexans has played a crucial role in the electrification of the planet and is committed to electrifying the future.

With the integration of NurseTim® / NurseThink® now complete  Wolters Kluwer provides a full curriculum suite of educational products and services for the nation’s leading prelicensure nursing programs.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231109392068/en/Lippincott Partnership for Nursing Education and Testing empowers nursing schools to graduate safe  competent  practice-ready nurses while supporting faculty workflows. (Photo: Business Wire)Technology can help ease nurses’ transition to practiceAs new nurses enter the workforce  many of them aren’t sufficiently prepared for real-world patient care. In fact  just 11% of students transitioning to practice were evaluated as practice ready. Compounding the broader challenges of the present nursing shortage  the nursing profession critically needs nursing graduates who enter practice with confidence and well-developed clinical judgment skills.With the launch of Lippincott Partnership for Nursing Education and Testing  nursing programs of any size can now adopt Lippincott  NurseTim and NurseThink products across their entire program in three convenient packages  with a variety of options to add expert consulting and implementation services. This mix of education solutions and expertise supports both faculty development and nursing program success—from higher NCLEX® pass rates to more practice-ready nurses at graduation.“Combating unsafe practice and graduating more clinically prepared nursing students is at the heart of what we do every day ” said Julie Stegman  Vice President  Wolters Kluwer Health Learning & Practice. “Our collaboration with institutions like the University of Rochester School of Nursing is an example of how a program can transform by bringing a clinical focus into the classroom. With the Lippincott Partnership program  we bring together the right ingredients for schools to ensure the preparation of clinically competent and confident nurses.”Flagship university creates blueprint for successLeaders at the University of Rochester School of Nursing developed strategic objectives to identify evidence-based practices and to use digital technology whenever possible to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the training that was offered. To define what that approach and practices would look like  the school assembled a multidisciplinary task force composed of faculty and experts in instructional design and information technology. To make their vision a reality  they then turned to Wolters Kluwer Health to collaborate on bringing the clinical experience into the learning environment.“Preparing competent  practice-ready nurses is of the utmost importance. Healthcare has become increasingly complex  and preparing nurses with strong clinical judgement is foundational to the success of new graduates and to the health system ” said Lisa Kitko  PhD  RN  FAHA  FAAN  dean of the University of Rochester School of Nursing. “Implementing technology to bring the clinical experience to the classroom has now become essential for nursing school programs. With technology in the classroom  nurses have the opportunity to explore the clinical setting  analyze their patient care settings  and build their critical thinking techniques. Solutions like those from Wolters Kluwer allow us to take a competency-based  collaborative approach in successfully preparing nurses to safely and skillfully deliver exceptional patient care.”Recently  the university was recognized as a leader in educational innovation  winning a 2023 Innovations in Professional Nursing Education Award from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. Learn more about the transformation the school underwent in this case study.Understanding the challenges to provide everything a nursing program needsWith expert solutions that include knowledge acquisition  clinical and experiential learning  and testing and assessment  Wolters Kluwer can scale to support diverse program needs and budgets. This new offer creates a cost-effective way for nursing schools to ensure complete curriculum coverage that is essential for accreditation.

The companies are collectively referred to as ""Icelandic Salmon"" or the ""Group"".OperationsIn the third quarter 2023  Icelandic salmon resumed harvesting  following a second quarter with limited harvest volume. The group harvested 4 040 tonnes in the quarter  up from 3 804 tonnes in the third quarter 2022.“Our team demonstrated strong adaptability and commitment during a time with changing working conditions. Following a summer with limited harvest due to our focus on biological growth  we started harvesting in July. In the third quarter  total harvest came in slightly above the corresponding quarter last year  and the biological performance for the quarter was good” said Bjørn Hembre  CEO of Icelandic Salmon.The group reported revenues of 42 million EUR in the third quarter 2023  up from 34 million EUR in the third quarter 2022. The EBIT for the quarter was positive of 3.0 million EUR  resulting in an EBIT/kg harvest of EUR 0.73. The EBIT/kg harvest was down from the corresponding quarter last year of EUR 0.99  due to higher costs  partly offset by strong price achievement compared to market prices.The smolt stocking continued in the third quarter and the group achieved operational improvements in smolt production. YTD the smolt weight is 236  up 36% from 2022.“The quality of the smolt is good and the survival rate of smolts is high. We see good effect of recent years’ investment and operational focus in our smolt production. “said Bjørn Hembre  CEO of Icelandic Salmon.In October 2023  after the end of the third quarter  the group had to respond to an unfortunate biological challenge in Tálknafjörður. The incident was soon deemed a risk to animal health and the wellbeing of the fish  and a decision was made to take out significant volumes (see more information in Outlook below).Strategic milestonesIn September  Icelandic Salmon held its first Capital market day  giving stakeholders valuable insights into its operations and growth plans  and successfully completed a dual listing on the NASDAQ First North exchange in Iceland. This listing makes the company’s shares more easily accessible for Icelandic investors.In August  Arnarlax signed a commitment letter for its first sustainability-linked loan agreement  totalling EUR 100 million  with DNB  Danske Bank and Arion Bank who stepped in with an overdraft facility and as security agent for the loan agreement. The agreement was successfully completed in the beginning of November.OutlookFor the year 2023 as a whole  Icelandic Salmon expects to harvest 17 000 tonnes of salmon  up from the previous estimate of 16 000 tonnes. The increase is a result of growth beyond expected on our spring 2022 generation.As mentioned above  Icelandic Salmon decided to take out significant volumes of fish in Tálknafjörður. This will have a one-off impact estimated at around EUR 5-6 million on profits in the fourth quarter 2023. Harvest volumes for 2024 is expected at 15 000 tonnes.“For the longer term  we continue to see a potential for growth up to 26.000 tonnes on existing licenses supported by strong demand for sustainably farmed Atlantic Salmon ” said Bjørn Hembre  CEO of Icelandic Salmon.The presentation 9th of NovemberAttached is the presentation for the third quarter.The presentation will be held at Arion Bank headquarters in Borgartún 19  105 Reykjavík  in the conference room Þingvellir today  9th of November.

Notably  81.3% of subjects who completed the oral food challenge reached an eliciting dose of ≥1 000 mg after 24 months of treatment.55.9% of subjects completed the oral food challenge at a cumulative dose of 3 444 mg without meeting stopping criteria.Among treatment-arm subjects from EPITOPE  there were no treatment-related anaphylactic or serious treatment-related adverse events in the second year of active treatment.DBV to highlight EPOPEX results in late-breaking oral abstract presentation at the American College of Allergy  Asthma  and Immunology (ACAAI) annual meeting on Saturday  November 11 th at 9:35AM PT.at 9:35AM PT. Company to host investor conference call and webcast at 5:00pm ET today  Thursday  November 9th  to discuss the results.DBV Technologies (Euronext: DBV – ISIN: FR0010417345 – Nasdaq Stock Market: DBVT)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company  today announced positive interim results from its ongoing Open-Label Extension (OLE) Study of EPITOPE (Phase 3 trial of Viaskin™ Peanut 250 µg [VP250] in toddlers ages 1 to 3 years)  which is named EPOPEX. After completing participation in the EPITOPE study  eligible subjects could enroll in EPOPEX to receive a total of three years of Viaskin Peanut treatment. Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) are conducted at the end of each year of treatment with safety assessed throughout the entire OLE. Importantly  all subjects remained blinded to their treatment assignment in EPITOPE until every patient completed EPITOPE and the database was locked; therefore  the decision to enter the OLE was not biased by the unblinding of the randomized treatment.Twelve-Month EPITOPE OLE Interim Results:244 subjects were randomized to the active arm of EPITOPE with 208 completing the study. 85% of eligible subjects (175 of 208) entered the OLE with 95% (166 of 175) participating in the DBPCFC at Month 24 of Viaskin™ Peanut 250 µg (“VP250”) treatment. Similar percentages were observed for the subjects randomized to the placebo arm of EPITOPE: 92% of eligible subjects (91 of 99) entered the OLE with 86% (78 of 91) participating in the DBPCFC at Month 12 of VP 250 treatment.The 175 and 91 subjects presented in the OLE cohorts (24 months and 12 months of VP250 treatment  respectively) are a subset of the subjects presented in the EPITOPE 12-month results (e.g.  drop-outs  incomplete DBPCFC etc.).After 24 months of VP250  all efficacy parameters demonstrated an increase in treatment response relative to the corresponding EPITOPE 12-month results: 81.3% of participants reached an eliciting dose (ED) ≥1000 mg  or approximately 3 – 4 whole peanut kernels (64.2% in EPITOPE  n=244). 63.8% reached an ED ≥2000 mg (37.0% in EPITOPE  n=244). 55.9% completed the cumulative 3 444 mg DBPCFC without meeting stopping criteria (30.7% in EPITOPE  n=244). Using the EPITOPE primary endpoint definition  83.9% of subjects were responders (67.0% in EPITOPE  n=244).Month-12 assessment of the efficacy parameters in the EPITOPE subjects (n=175) that entered the OLE further demonstrates the improvement in treatment response following an additional 12 months of treatment (24 months total) At month 12  74.7%  reached an eliciting dose (ED) ≥1000 mg relative to 81.3% at Month 24. At month 12  52.4% reached an ED ≥2000 mg relative to 63.8% at Month 24. The proportion who completed the cumulative 3 444 mg DBPCFC without meeting stopping criteria was 39.5% and 55.9%  at months 12 and 24  respectively. Using the EPITOPE primary endpoint definition  77.4% were responders at Month 12 relative to 83.9% at month 24. 47.2% (17 of 36) of subjects that did not meet EPITOPE responder criteria at Month 12 did meet the responder criteria at Month 24.No treatment-related anaphylaxis or serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in the second year of active treatment. The frequency of local application site reaction decreased in the second year of treatment.Efficacy results for subjects that entered the OLE from the placebo arm of EPITOPE (i.e.  crossed-over to VP250 and received 12-months of treatment and were thus 2-4 years-old at VP250 treatment initiation): 62.7% reached an ED ≥1000 mg  36.5% reached an ED ≥2000 mg  28.4% completed the DBPCFC without meeting stopping criteria and 68.0% met the EPITOPE responder definition. These results were consistent with the EPITOPE VP250 arm results. The safety data for this group were consistent with what was observed in EPITOPE. There was a single event of treatment-related anaphylaxis (after 12 months of active treatment).“We are thrilled with the results generated from the two-year open-label extension to the Phase 3 EPITOPE trial. This OLE aimed to evaluate the continued efficacy  safety  and tolerability of Viaskin Peanut in toddlers in a real-world setting ” stated Daniel Tassé  Chief Executive Officer of DBV Technologies. “The data show that nearly 56% of subjects were able to consume a cumulative dose of 12 – 14 peanut kernels without meeting the pre-defined stopping criteria and more than 81% of subjects reached an eliciting dose of 3 – 4 peanut kernels. Recall that these are toddlers that began the study with an equivalent eliciting dose ranging from fractions of a peanut kernel to roughly one peanut kernel. This is a promising outcome for a community of peanut allergic toddlers where accidental exposure poses significant risk  and the current best practice – avoidance – places a daily burden on patients and families. These data further our belief that Viaskin Peanut has the potential to be the first FDA approved treatment for peanut allergic toddlers.”The interim data from the EPOPEX OLE will be presented at the American College of Allergy  Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) Annual Scientific Meeting  which is being held November 9-13  2023  in Anaheim  CA. The data were submitted in as a late-breaking abstract and accepted for an oral abstract presentation.The presentation and abstract details interim 12-month results from subjects previously enrolled in EPITOPE  a study of one year of epicutaneous immunotherapy with a patch containing 250 µg of peanut protein vs a placebo patch. The EPITOPE study resulted in a statistically significant treatment response vs placebo in 1-3-year-old peanut-allergic toddlers  as featured in a New England Journal of Medicine publication and editorial in May 2023.“These interim data from the first 12 months of follow-up from the OLE demonstrate that Viaskin Peanut continued to generate a treatment effect beyond what was observed in EPITOPE ” stated Dr. Matthew Greenhawt  Children’s Hospital Colorado  lead author and study investigator. “As a clinician  I am pleased that Viaskin Peanut showed improvement between months 12 and 24 of treatment across all evaluated efficacy parameters. It is even more encouraging that this was achieved with no new safety signals and with fewer local application site reactions in year two versus year one. I look forward to progressing the EPITOPE OLE to its conclusion with the goal of assessing the long-term efficacy  safety  and tolerability of Viaskin Peanut.”Late-Breaking Abstract (poster presentation):“EPOPEX  Efficacy and Safety of Epicutaneous Immunotherapy in Peanut-allergic Toddlers: 1-year Open-Label Extension to EPITOPE”Presenter: Matthew C.

This is nothing new. We have the best product in the market ” Mr Jackson insisted.He added: “We continue to invest heavily in marketing and generosity in the market. We will be continuing to deliver great experiences for customers in Q4 and we’ll also watch carefully what ESPN and other players do in the market.”In the first half of the year  FanDuel became the first online sports betting operator in the US to make a profit. Flutter said on Thursday that it expects the division to deliver adjusted earnings of £140m (€161m) this year  versus a previous estimate of between £90m and £190m.Flutter  which is the world’s biggest online gambling firm  said that it had 2.56 million monthly players  on average  in the US during the third quarter  which was 38pc higher year-on-year. It had a 40pc share of online sports betting revenue there during the period and has seen a strong customer response to the new US football season.But shares in Flutter plunged more than 10pc after it said that excluding the US  it expects to post adjusted earnings of £1.44bnfor 2023  compared with a previously guided range of between £1.44bn and £1.6bn.During the third-quarter  group revenue was up 13pc year-on-year at £2bn on a constant currency basis  while the number of average monthly players was 16pc higher at 11.1 million.The lower guidance was a result of customer-friendly sports results in September and October  a foreign exchange hit  and continued weakness in the Australian market.Flutter also confirmed that it aims to ditch its share listing on Dublin’s Euronext as it plans a listing debut in New York in the first quarter of 2024. It said that while it will retain a dual listing in London for the time being  it may ultimately pursue a primary listing in the US.Mr Jackson declined to comment on the outflow of big-name companies from Dublin Euronext  after CRH recently delisted its shares there.Following Flutter’s impending departure  Ryanair will become the largest Irish-listed firm on the Euronext.

We are excited to report compelling data from our short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based multiplexing platform  underscoring the remarkable versatility and adaptability of this technology. In addition  we are making significant progress with our multispecific CAR program  and we look forward to sharing an update at international conferences in the coming months. These achievements mark our commitment to advancing the frontiers of cellular immunotherapy and bringing innovative solutions to patients in need ” commented Georges Rawadi  Chief Executive Officer of the Company.Third quarter 2023 and recent corporate highlights:On August 24  2023  the Company announced that it has obtained commitments from Fortress  Tolefi and other longstanding existing shareholders to subscribe to a capital increase of up to €9.8 million in 2 tranches: A first tranche of 2.0 million was disbursed in the context of authorized capital as of September 4  2023; and A second tranche to be subscribed by Fortress is subject to the approval by the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting. Following this private placement  the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient  based on the current scope of activities  to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2025.Celyad Oncology has relocated from September 25  2023 into a new research facility which fits better its current needs after the strategic shift. The Company remains headquartered at the Axis Parc  Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium but with its new business location at Dumont 9.Operational highlightsshRNA multiplexing platform: Data validating our microRNA (miRNA)-based multiplex shRNA approach  which allows to down-regulate several genes simultaneously  were presented at the 4th International Conference on Lymphocyte Engineering (ICLE) in Munich (September 12-14) and at the 38th Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) in San Diego (November 1-5) and posters are available on the company’s website  at https://celyad.com/our-science-technology/publications/ ; With our approach we proved the feasibility of the simultaneous knock-down of 4 co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1  LAG-3  TIM-3 and CD95) to decrease the expression of exhaustion markers at the surface of CAR T-cells and the feasibility of this approach to improve allogeneic CAR T-cell viability by allowing evasion from graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)  host-versus-graft (HvG) reaction and CD95L-induced autophagy. The results detailing the technical aspects of the development of this platform and showcasing the easiness  efficiency  and tunability of this technology to knock-down up to four target genes simultaneously have been published in Molecular Therapy – Nucleic Acids as of September 20.NKG2D-based CAR T-cells: We have developed different CD19/NKG2DL  BCMA/NKG2DL and PSMA/NKG2DL multi-specific CAR T-cells  utilizing both tandem constructs – that encompass the extracellular domain of the natural NKG2D receptor fused to a scFv targeting CD19  BCMA or PSMA  or dual constructs – that co-express the NKG2D-based CAR with an anti-CD19  anti-BCMA or anti-PSMA CAR  respectively; Our data provides the proof-of-concept that NKG2DL are valuable targets in a multispecific CAR approach; Specifically  we showed that CD19/NKG2DL multispecific CAR T-cells  and in particular dual receptors  are highly effective in vitro against CD19+ and CD19- cell lines and against CD19+ primary B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells. In vivo  CD19/NKG2DL tandem CAR T-cells outperforms dual CAR T-cells in controlling tumor growth in an aggressive B-ALL relapse model. In vitro data generated with BCMA/NKG2DL and PSMA/NKG2DL multispecific CAR T-cells further validate this approach and its application in other hematological and solid indications. Preliminary data were presented at the 4th ICLE conference in Munich (September 12-14) and at the 38th SITC meeting in San Diego (November 1-5) and posters are available on the company’s website  at https://celyad.com/our-science-technology/publications/ .Financial highlights – Third quarter 2023 financial reviewAs of September 30  2023  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €2.3 million. Net cash burn during the third quarter of 2023 amounted to €2.7 million  in line with expectations.The Company projects that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2024.After due consideration of detailed budgets and estimated cash flow forecasts for the years 2023 and 2024  the Company continues to project that its existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund its estimated operating and capital expenditures over at least the next 12 months from the date that this release is issued.On August 24  2023  the Company announced that it has obtained commitments from Fortress  Tolefi and other longstanding existing shareholders to subscribe to a capital increase of up to €9.8 million (whose €2.0 million related to the first tranche has been already proceeded as of September 4  2023). Taking into account the Management’s assumptions regarding estimated cash-flows for the years 2023  2024 and 2025  the Company believes that following the close of the second tranche subscribed by Fortress which is subject to approval by the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting  its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient  based on the current scope of activities  to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2025.Upcoming Anticipated MilestonesMore data and evidence in the context of the multi-specific CAR platform and shRNA multiplexing approach will be shared in the first quarter of 2024  with the aim of a clinical evaluation of assets and initiation of clinical trials either by the Company and/or through strategic partnerships afterwards.Upcoming ConferencesCelyad Oncology will attend the 7th CAR-TCR Europe summit in London  UK (February 27-29  2024)  the must-attend forum to brainstorm advanced in cell therapies and stay at the forefront of cell therapy innovations.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a cutting-edge biotechnology company dedicated to pioneering the discovery and advancement of revolutionary technologies for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells.

The index had been unchanged year-on-year in September and edged up 0.1% in August.On Wednesday  a senior US monetary policymaker said the Federal Reserve is likely done raising interest rates to tackle inflation but probably won't cut them ""in the short term"".Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker told a conference in Evanston  Illinois  that he felt holding interest rates at their current  restrictive  level was the right course of action.The US bond market will likely be of some concern for the Fed soon enough  Swissquote analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya commented. The yield on the 10-year Treasury has eased markedly recently and now sits around 4.50%.""That's disquieting; the US 10-year yield has now fallen more than 50bp in less than 2 weeks. Yes  a part of it is a correction of the accelerated rise that we observed starting from September. But that rise partly explains why the Fed members decided to refrain from announcing another rate hike at the latest policy meeting. As such  the recent fall in long-term yields will certainly get them back to a high-alert level "" Ozkardeskaya explained.Here is what you need to know at the London market open:----------MARKETS----------FTSE 100: called down 0.3% at 7 382.32----------Hang Seng: down 0.2% at 17 535.76Nikkei 225: closed up 1.5% at 32 646.46S&P/ASX 200: closed up 0.3% at 7 014.90----------DJIA: closed down 40.33 points  or 0.1%  at 34 112.27S&P 500: closed up 0.1% at 4 382.78Nasdaq Composite: closed up 0.1% at 13 650.41----------EUR: flat at USD1.0706 (USD1.0707)GBP: down at USD1.2282 (USD1.2300)USD: up at JPY150.91 (JPY150.83)GOLD: down at USD1 949.92 per ounce (USD1 954.55)OIL (Brent): up slightly at USD80.10 a barrel (USD80.05)(changes since previous London equities close)----------ECONOMICS----------Thursday's key economic events still to come:08:10 GMT EU ECB Executive Board Member Philip Lane speaks13:30 GMT US unemployment insurance weekly claims report13:30 GMT US FRB Atlanta and Richmond presidents speak16:00 GMT US Fed St. Louis Interim President Kathleen O'Neill Paese speaks----------The pace of UK house price falls may be steadying as the end of the year approaches  according to surveyors. A net balance of 63% of property professionals reported house prices falling rather than increasing in October  edging down from a balance of 67% in September  the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said.

It has patents that have been both granted and applied for in various jurisdictions.Last year  Hamilton Beach Brands generated revenue of $641m (€600m) and made a $38.8m operating profit.The High Court heard last month that HealthBeacon has a “reasonable prospect of survival” as a going concern if a successful rescue plan is put together. HealthBeacon has projected growth of 387pc from 2024 to 2026  the court was told.The company  co-founded by former CEO Jim Joyce  raised €25m when it floated in Dublin in 2021  valuing at close to €100m.

The condensed consolidated interim financial results are available on the Company’s website (Financial Reports – Valneva).Valneva will provide a live webcast of its nine-month 2023 results conference call beginningat 3 p.m. CET/9 a.m. ET today. This webcast will also be available on the Company’s website. Please refer to this link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/do4mozxx.Peter Bühler  Valneva’s Chief Financial Officer  commented  “In the third quarter  we continued growing our commercial sales and are confident that we will meet our revenue target for the year. We remain focused on advancing our key R&D programs with a strong emphasis on working with the FDA to obtaining the first regulatory approval worldwide for a chikungunya vaccine”.Clinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesCHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1553BLA under priority review by the U.S. FDA; accelerated assessment confirmed by EMAVLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single-dose vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a mosquito-borne virus that has spread to more than 110 countries4 with the potential to rapidly expand further. The Pan American Health Organization issued an epidemiological alert in February 2023 as the number of cases and deaths due to chikungunya continues to rise in the Americas5. With no preventive vaccine or specific treatment yet available  chikungunya is considered a major public health threat.VLA1553 is currently the first and only chikungunya vaccine candidate worldwide for which regulatory review processes are underway. A BLA is currently under priority review by the U.S. FDA6 with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date planned for the end of November 20237.Additionally  an MAA was submitted to EMA in October 20238  and EMA’s CHMP confirmed accelerated assessment for the application based on the vaccine candidate’s “major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation”. A marketing application is also under review by Health Canada9.If approved  VLA1553 could become the first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need.The regulatory submissions follow final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 202210  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202211  twelve-month persistence data in December 202212 and positive initial Phase 3 safety data in adolescents13.The pivotal Phase 3 data were published in The Lancet  the world’s leading peer-reviewed medical journal  in June 202314. The article provides a detailed analysis of the Phase 3 results showing that VLA1553 demonstrated a very high seroresponse rate of 98.9% in participants 28 days after receiving the single administration.Earlier clinical data  published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases  showed a rapid onset of immune response with a single dose of VLA1553 between 7- and 14-days post-vaccination15. This was later confirmed in a further analysis of the Phase 1 data  which showed that 100% of vaccinated individuals reached the immune threshold16 established with the FDA at day 1417.Additionally  VLA1553 was able to demonstrate a robust immune response which was sustained for 12 months by 99% of participants and was equally durable in younger and older adults18. This dedicated antibody persistence trial (VLA1553-303) will continue to evaluate persistence for a period of at least five years. VLA1553 uses the live-attenuated virus vaccine technology  known to induce long-lasting immunity after a single dose. Examples of live-attenuated vaccines include the combined measles  mumps and rubella (MMR)  yellow fever  and chickenpox (varicella) vaccines.A clinical study in adolescents  VLA1553-321  is ongoing in Brazil  for which Valneva reported initial safety data in August 202319. Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and conducted in collaboration with Instituto Butantan  the VLA1553-321 adolescent trial is intended to support the label extension in this age group following a potential initial FDA approval in adults. The trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations.Initial safety data generated from the study  Valneva’s first clinical study in an endemic area and with individuals previously infected with CHIKV  showed that VLA1553 was generally well tolerated in 754 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years  regardless of previous CHIKV infection. Immunogenicity data for the trial are expected in November 2023.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing  and marketing of VLA155320. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201921  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.VLA1553 received FDA Fast Track  Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review designations in 2018  2021 and 2023 respectively. The sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine BLA to be approved in the United States will be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher  or PRV. The program was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the EMA in 2020 and accelerated assessment in October 2023.Valneva intends to commercialize VLA1553  if approved  by leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial infrastructures. The global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 203222.LYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 study ongoing and first positive pediatric and adolescent booster results reportedValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. VLA15 is a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine that targets six serotypes of Borrelia representing the most common strains found in North America and Europe. VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine program in advanced clinical development today and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA.Valneva and Pfizer reported results for three Phase 2 clinical trials of VLA15 in both adult and pediatric populations  in which high levels of antibodies against all six strains were observed23 24 25. These include the announcement in September 2023 of positive Phase 2 pediatric and adolescent immunogenicity and safety data following a booster vaccination with VLA15. These results from the VLA15-221 Phase 2 study showed a strong anamnestic antibody response for all serotypes in pediatric (5 to 11 years of age) and adolescent participants (12 to 17 years of age)  as well as in adults (18 to 65 years of age)  one month after administration of a booster dose (month 19). The safety and tolerability profile of VLA15 after a booster dose was consistent with previous studies26.In August 2022  the companies initiated a Phase 3 clinical study  ""Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR)""  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in participants five years of age and older in highly endemic regions in the United States and Europe27.The VALOR study is currently ongoing and is designed to follow vaccinated participants over two consecutive tick seasons. Participants enrolled in the first cohort will receive their booster vaccination as planned in the second quarter of 2024 in advance of the 2024 tick season. Enrollment for primary immunization of the second cohort began in the second quarter of 2023 with overall trial continuation to include the 2025 tick season.Pfizer is aiming to submit a BLA to the FDA and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the EMA in 2026  subject to positive data.ZIKA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1601Re-initiation of clinical development with further program evaluation plannedVLA1601 is a highly purified inactivated  adjuvanted vaccine candidate against the mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV). Disease outbreaks have been reported in tropical Africa  Southeast Asia  the Pacific Islands  and  since 2015  in the Americas. Zika virus transmission persists in several countries in the Americas and in other endemic regions. To date  a total of 89 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito-transmitted Zika virus infection28; however  surveillance remains limited globally. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  Zika remains a public health threat.VLA1601 is being developed on the original manufacturing platform of Valneva’s licensed Japanese Encephalitis vaccine IXIARO®  which was further optimized to develop the Company’s inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001  the first one to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe29.Valneva plans to re-initiate clinical development in the first quarter of 2024.Pre-Clinical Vaccine CandidatesValneva continues to progress selected pre-clinical assets to further strengthen its future clinical pipeline.In preclinical R&D  the Company is currently prioritizing VLA2112  a vaccine candidate targeting the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is a ubiquitous human pathogen that can cause infectious mononucleosis30 and is strongly associated with the development of several types of cancer31 and multiple sclerosis32.Other early-stage activities include vaccine candidates against different enteric diseases.Valneva continues to explore potential partnering opportunities for VLA1554  its vaccine candidate targeting the human metapneumovirus (hMPV)  a major worldwide respiratory pathogen that causes acute upper and lower respiratory tract infection33.Commercial VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO®/JESPECT®)IXIARO® is a Vero cell culture-derived inactivated Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine that is the only JE vaccine licensed and available in the United States  Canada and Europe. IXIARO® is indicated for active immunization against Japanese encephalitis  the most prevalent cause of viral encephalitis in Asia  for adults  adolescents  children and infants aged two months and older.In the first nine months of 2023  IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales increased by 119.4% to €50.3 million compared to €22.9 million in the first nine months of 2022  benefiting from a significant recovery in the private travel markets following the decline of the COVID-19 pandemic  as well as from price increases.In September 2023  Valneva announced the signing of a one-year contract with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) for the supply of IXIARO®. Under this new contract  the DoD will buy a minimum of $32 million worth of IXIARO® vaccines and has the possibility to purchase additional doses during the twelve months of the contract. First doses were delivered in September.CHOLERA / ETEC34-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL®)DUKORAL® is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC35  the leading cause of travelers’ diarrhea. DUKORAL® is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera  and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.In the first nine months of 2023  DUKORAL® sales increased by 128.5% to €21.1 million compared to €9.2 million in the first nine months of 2022  also benefiting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets and price increases. DUKORAL® sales for the first nine months of 2023 exceeded pre-COVID-19 sales levels during the first nine months of 2019.SARS-CoV-2 INACTIVATED WHOLE-VIRUS VACCINEValneva’s COVID-19 vaccine  VLA2001  is the only inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine approved in Europe36 and was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a full marketing authorization from the EMA.In light of reduced order volume linked to the decline of the COVID-19 pandemic  Valneva suspended manufacturing of the vaccine in August 2022 and inventories were fully written down as of December 31  2022. In order to save additional costs linked to the vaccine including license fees  Valneva recently requested the withdrawal of VLA2001’s marketing authorization in Europe. The withdrawal was accepted by EMA and will become effective on December 1  2023.In the first nine months of 2023  VLA2001 sales amounted to €5.7 million compared to €23.9 million in the first nine months of 2022.THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTIONValneva distributes certain third-party vaccines in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure. In the first nine months of 2023  third party product sales increased by 58% to €29.1 million from €18.4 million in the first nine months of 2022.Nine Months 2023 Financial Review37(Unaudited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €111.8 million in the first nine months of 2023  compared to €249.9 million in the first nine months of 2022. The 55.3% decrease was related to non-recurring revenues recorded in the prior year linked to the Company’s COVID-19 program.Valneva’s total product sales reached €106.1 million in the nine months ended September 30  2023  compared to €74.4 million in the same period of 2022. This 42.6% increase was driven by the continued recovery of travel vaccine sales. Currency fluctuations of €1.6 million adversely impacted product sales. COVID-19 vaccine sales in the first nine months of 2023 amounted to €5.7 million compared to €23.9 million in the first nine months of 2022. Excluding COVID-19  product sales reached €100.4 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to €50.6 million during the comparator period of 2022  an increase of 98.7%.IXIARO®/JESPECT® product sales were €50.3 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to €22.9 million in the first nine months of 2022. The 119.4% increase in sales is primarily the result of the continued travel market recovery  as well as price increases. The increase in IXIARO®/JESPECT® product sales included an adverse €0.7 million foreign currency impact. DUKORAL® sales were €21.1 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to €9.2 million in the first nine months of 2022. This 128.5% increase is also a result of the significant recovery in the private travel markets and price increases. Foreign currency fluctuations reduced DUKORAL® sales by €0.5 million. Third Party product sales were €29.1 million in the nine months ended September 30  2023 compared to €18.4 million in the comparison period of 2022  a 58.0% increase which was mainly driven by sales of Rabipur®/RabAvert® and Encepur® under the distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic.Other revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services amounted to €5.7 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to €175.5 million in the first nine months of 2022. The first nine months of 2022 included COVID-related one-time effects of €200.2 million consisting of released refund liability as a result of the settlement with the UK government  as well as released non-refundable advance payments from EU Member States  partially offset by €34.7 million of negative revenue resulting from an increase in the refund liability linked to the amended VLA15 collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer.Operating Result and adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €74.8 million in the nine months ended September 30  2023. The gross margin on commercial product sales  excluding COVID-19 vaccines sales  was 43.7% compared to 55.4% in the first nine months of 2022. COGS of €26.6 million were related to IXIARO® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 47.2%. COGS of €12.7 million were related to DUKORAL® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 39.8%. The IXIARO® gross margin was impacted by batch write-offs in the Scottish manufacturing site. Additionally  the gross margins of both IXIARO® and DUKORAL® were adversely impacted by high indirect sales in markets where Valneva sells through distributors. Of the remaining COGS for the first nine months of 2023  €17.3 million were related to the Third-Party product distribution business  €1.7 million to COVID-19 product sales and €9.3 million to initial COGS linked to the launch preparations for the Company’s chikungunya vaccine candidate  as well as idle capacity costs. The remaining COGS related to services. In the nine months ended September 30  2022  overall COGS were €202.7 million  of which €196.6 million related to cost of goods and €6.2 million related to cost of services. COGS in the first nine months of 2022 included write-offs related to the significant reduction of COVID-19 sales volumes to EC Member States.Research and development expenses amounted to €42.2 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to €75.4 million in the first nine months of 2022. This decrease was exclusively driven by the lower spend on Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine  VLA2001. At the same time  costs related to the Zika vaccine candidate increased as the Company has been working towards re-initiation of clinical development. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first nine months of 2023 amounted to €33.9 million compared to €13.1 million in the first nine months of 2022. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first nine months of 2023 notably included €13.8 million of expenses related to launch preparations for the chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  compared to €4.3 million in the first nine months of 2022. In the first nine months of 2023  general and administrative expenses increased to €35.1 million from €23.3 million in the first nine months of 2022. In the first nine months of 2022  COGS  research and development  marketing and distribution as well as general and administrative expenses benefited from an accrual adjustment income of €30.6 million related to the favorable effect of the Company’s share price development on the employee share-based compensation programs.Other income  net of other expenses  increased to €17.0 million in the first nine months of 2023 versus €7.5 million in the first nine months of 2022. This increase was mainly driven by the recognition of grant income received from Scottish Enterprise during the first nine months of 2023.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €57.2 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to an operating loss of €57.1 million in the first nine months of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss in the first nine months of 2023 was €46.0 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of €38.0 million in the first nine months of 2022 (as explained further below).Net ResultIn the nine months ended September 30  2023  Valneva generated a net loss of €69.3 million compared to a net loss of €99.1 million in the nine months ended September 30  2022.Finance expense and foreign currency effects in the first nine months of 2023 resulted in a net finance expense of €13.2 million  compared to a net finance expense of €39.8 million in the first nine months of 2022. The difference is primarily driven by a decrease of €25.1 million in the revaluation results of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  to a €1.4 million net foreign exchange loss in the first nine months of 2023 from €26.5 million in the first nine months of 2022. Interest expenses net of interest income were €11.8 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to €13.3 million in the first nine months of 2022.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €136.8 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to €189.5 million in the first nine months of 2022. Cash outflows in the first nine months of 2023 mainly resulted from the operating loss as well as payments of refund liabilities to Pfizer related to the Lyme VLA15 R&D collaboration agreement. Cash outflows in the first nine months of 2022 mainly resulted from the operating loss as well as releases from the refund liabilities following the signing of the COVID-19 settlement agreement with the UK government.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €4.3 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to €22.5 million in the first nine months of 2022. Cash outflows in the first nine months of 2023 mainly related to construction activities at the Scottish production site and purchases of equipment partly offset by proceeds from the divestment of the Clinical Trial Manufacturing unit in Sweden and from selling shares in BliNK Biomedical SAS. Cash outflows in the first nine months of 2022 mainly related to construction activities at the Scottish production site and purchases of equipment.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €26.1 million in the first nine months of 2023  which mainly resulted from proceeds from the additional tranche added to the existing credit facility with U.S. healthcare investment firms Deerfield Management Company & OrbiMed  partly offset by interest payments as well as payments of lease liabilities. Cash inflows in the first nine months of 2022 amounted to €121.6 million and mainly related to proceeds from the equity subscription agreement with Pfizer as well as disbursements from the credit facility provided by Deerfield Management Company & OrbiMed.Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €171.3 million as at September 30  2023  compared to €289.4 million as at December 31  2022.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results  as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provides additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) for the period before income tax  finance income/expense  foreign exchange gain/(loss)  results from investments in associates  amortization  depreciation  and impairment (excluding impairment loss of disposal).A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million Nine months ended September 30  2023 2022 Loss for the period (69 271) (99 075) Add: Income tax (benefit)/expense (1 103) 2 163 Total finance income (724) (59) Total finance expense 12 477 13 395 Foreign currency (gain)/loss – net 1 441 26 493 Result from investments in associates - (9) Amortization 4 680 5 259 Depreciation 8 396 10 581 Impairment excluding impairment loss of disposal (1 881) 3 286 Adjusted EBITDA (45 985) (37 967)Subsequent events:Following the expiry of the lease agreement  on October 31  2023 the Company’s subsidiary “Valneva Austria GmbH” acquired the legal entity that owns the Vienna building it was previously leasing  leveraging the security deposit. The acquisition price  excluding the security deposit and the entity’s cash  is approximately €10.9 million. The Company is evaluating the possibility of a sale and lease-back transaction.As an update on Note 5.17 in the 2023 half-year financial statements38  the litigation related to the Humalys acquisition has now finished  as no appeal was lodged prior to the statutory deadline.”About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Consequently  this also had an impact on personnel expenses (excluding LTIP and employment-related earn-out & option expenses) which grew by +2.7% to €965.8m.FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA TO ADJUSTED NET INCOMERestructuring and other non-recurring items: -€19.6m in 9M 2023 compared to -€99.5m in 9M 20225.LTIP expenses totaled -€107m in 9M 2023 compared to -€87.5m in 9M 2022.

Other financial income and expenses amounted to -€55.1m in 9M 2023 vs -€81.1m in 9M 2022  mainly explained by the change in fair value of the Put/Earn-out debt  hedging instruments and currency impact.Income tax expensesThe tax charge amounted to -€18.9m in 9M 2023 compared to -€40.3m in 9M 2022.

The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company has reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and is on track to file a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA by year end.The Company has reported first results from MOJAVE  the US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0 seeking to confirm the strong efficacy seen in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies. The first two patients have been successfully treated with DSR 2.0  and top-line data from all of the first three patients is expected by year end. Sequana Medical recently reported that a detailed biomarker analysis of RED DESERT and SAHARA patients indicates DSR’s mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

To this end  the company has today published the draft resolutions in the BALO.Vantiva points out that  from the parties' point of view  the value of the transaction lies primarily in the realization of future synergies made possible by the combination of the Home Networks business with Vantiva. The integration of the acquired businesses should lead to additional financing requirements before the benefits of the synergies. As a result  the company plans to meet these new needs notably by extending its existing credit lines to the combined perimeter  and by optimizing the acquired working capital. The company is therefore confident in its ability to meet the liquidity needs resulting from the transaction over the next twelve months.For the purposes of the transaction  Vantiva and CommScope have assumed a value of 88 million euros for the assets acquired  based mainly on discounted cash flows. This valuation and the exchange ratio will be the subject of a fairness opinion by RSM  acting as an independent expert. This will be made available on the Vantiva website prior to the Annual General Meeting.The valuation of the acquired assets adopted for the purposes of the transaction results in a unit issue price for Vantiva shares of sixty-five euro cents (€0.65) (including share premium). This valuation should not be used to draw conclusions concerning the evolution of Vantiva’s share price.###Warning: Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements""  including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.
