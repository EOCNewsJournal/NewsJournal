They took control in April 2022 after sanctions were imposed and the bank was cordoned off from Russia.VTB still officially owns the European subsidiary  and Hellwig said he contacted the bank's Russia headquarters to get permission to continue under the name while a licensing agreement ran its course.",neutral,0.05,0.78,0.17,negative,0.01,0.21,0.78,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'Putin', 'way', 'Russians', 'French yoghurt maker', 'high interest rates', 'ice hockey team', 'foreign clearing houses', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'chief executive officer', 'The European subsidiary', 'foreign investments', 'foreign investors', 'foreign share', 'Russian investors', 'Western countries', 'international payments', '$16 billion worth', 'Russian citizens', 'Russian residents', 'voluntary mechanism', 'Type-C account', 'The Kremlin', 'Russian subsidiaries', 'last year', 'OWH SE', 'licensing agreement', 'foreign companies', 'foreign company', 'Western companies', 'beer company', 'frozen assets', 'Russian assets', 'Type-C"" accounts', 'Frankfurt-based bank', 'Frank Hellwig', 'Europe hub', 'German savers', 'bank run', 'Russia headquarters', 'way', 'Russians', 'MOSCOW', 'decree', 'Nov.', 'conflict', 'Ukraine', 'barrage', 'sanctions', 'banks', 'response', 'country', 'value', '100,000 rubles', 'funds', 'owner', 'option', 'guarantee', 'Clearstream', 'exchange', 'shares', 'February', 'dozens', 'foul', 'money', 'sales', 'cases', 'control', 'July', 'Danone', 'Carlsberg', 'Germany', 'Uniper', 'Finland', 'Fortum', 'VTB', 'name', 'parent', 'brand', 'regulators', 'liquidation', 'tens', 'thousands', 'sponsor', 'Lions', 'war', 'outflow', 'April', 'permission', 'course']",2023-11-10,2023-11-11,hurriyetdailynews.com

The first to implement this feature was Siemens AG (OTC: )  which used it to automatically transfer funds in response to potential shortfalls. Today  Naveen Mallela  head of Coin Systems at Onyx  announced on LinkedIn that this programmable payments product is now accessible to institutional clients for managing banking account shortfalls and facilitating fund transfers for margin calls and overdue payments. Early users now also include Cargill and FedEx (NYSE: ).The introduction of programmable payments at scale by a traditional finance firm using commercial bank money is a first  according to Mallela. This move comes in the wake of growing interest in blockchain technology within the financial sector  as companies seek innovative solutions to streamline transactions and increase income on deposits.JPM Coin currently handles approximately $1 billion in daily transactions  a small proportion compared to the $10 trillion in US dollar transactions processed by JPMorgan. However  with FedEx and Cargill already utilizing this system and plans underway to extend it to other banks  the scope of JPM Coin is set to increase.This new feature builds upon JPMorgan's earlier efforts to leverage blockchain technology. Earlier this year  the company enabled collateral settlements and euro transactions via blockchain using JPM Coin. In addition  JPMorgan is crafting a blockchain solution for cross-border transactions that has awaited approval from US authorities since September 2023.In today's interest-rate environment  where rates are at 5.5% or rising  the ability to program payments could be an attractive option for company treasurers looking to increase income on deposits. This development follows recent moves by other financial giants such as HSBC Holdings Plc (LON: ) and Euroclear. Last week  HSBC launched a system for tokenized ownership of physical gold. Euroclear also entered the blockchain space late last month with a platform for issuing traditional securities.Despite the success of JPM Coin  JPMorgan expressed concerns today over an overestimated market rally. This reflects similar concerns within the financial industry  as institutions continue to explore and implement blockchain solutions.InvestingPro InsightsAs JPMorgan Chase continues to innovate with its JPM Coin  InvestingPro provides essential insights to understand the financial health of the company. As of the third quarter of 2023  JPMorgan Chase boasted a market cap of $417.14 billion  and its revenue growth was accelerating at a rate of 18.12% over the last twelve months.

Morgan has recently launched programmable payments through its blockchain-based digital currency  JPM Coin. This innovative solution allows users to program their transactions using an âIf-This-Then-Thatâ interface  providing greater control and flexibility over their accounts.According to a press release  the programmability allows clients to place customized rules on their payments. For example  they can specify a range of rules for funding a bank account in a dynamic manner in case of shortfalls â or execute payments based on events like margin calls  delivery of goods or fulfilment of contractual obligations.The introduction of programmable payments is a significant milestone in the evolution of digital currencies and tokenized money. It paves the way for real-time  automated and programmable treasury operations  revolutionizing the way transactions are conducted.Naveen Mallela  head of Coin Systems at Onyx by J.P. Morgan said  âProgrammability has been a key objective for digital currencies and tokenized money since the beginning. Our new offering makes payments programmable ushering in the era of dynamic and event driven infrastructure in the industry. This is an important milestone and foundational for real-time  automated and programmable treasury.âSiemens AG  a multinational conglomerate  became one of the first companies to utilize this feature  successfully completing its initial payment on November 6. Dr. Peter Rathgeb  the group treasurer of Siemens AG  expressed enthusiasm for the advantages and features that J.P. Morganâs programmable payments bring to fiat currencies. He highlighted the ability to leverage 24Ã7 blockchain-based bank accounts combined with programmability  which will enhance automation  optimize working capital utilization  and support data-driven digital business models.Other prominent companies  including FedEx and Cargill  are expected to adopt the solution in the coming weeks. Rebeca Fujimura Wiadacz  staff director of Global Cash Management at FedEx Corporation  praised the collaboration with J.P. Morgan and the use of innovative technologies like blockchain. She mentioned that FedEx has recently gone live with Onyx and JPM Coin  demonstrating their commitment to leveraging cutting-edge solutions to fuel their future growth.The launch of programmable payments by J.P. Morgan comes as major financial institutions  including HSBC  Euroclear  and Goldman Sachs  continue to explore and implement blockchain technology in mainstream finance. HSBC  for example  has introduced a platform that utilizes distributed ledger technology to expedite gold trading  simplifying the process and providing clients with an effortless way to track their gold ownership.J.P. Morganâs programmable payments system builds on the success of its previous initiatives involving blockchain technology. The bank has already demonstrated its commitment to innovation by operating HSBC Orion  a platform facilitating the issuance and storage of digital assets like digital bonds. Additionally  J.P. Morgan collaborated with ING in 2018 to complete a trade finance transaction using blockchain technology  further showcasing its dedication to exploring the potential of this technology.,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.0,positive,0.57,0.41,0.02,True,English,"['JPM Coin Programmable Payments', 'Siemens', 'data-driven digital business models', 'J.P.

They took control in April 2022 after sanctions were imposed and the bank was cordoned off from Russia.VTB still officially owns the European subsidiary  and Hellwig said he contacted the bank's Russia headquarters to get permission to continue under the name while a licensing agreement ran its course.",neutral,0.05,0.78,0.17,negative,0.01,0.21,0.78,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'Putin', 'way', 'Russians', 'French yoghurt maker', 'high interest rates', 'ice hockey team', 'foreign clearing houses', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'chief executive officer', 'The European subsidiary', 'foreign investments', 'foreign investors', 'foreign share', 'Russian investors', 'Western countries', 'international payments', '$16 billion worth', 'Russian citizens', 'Russian residents', 'voluntary mechanism', 'Type-C account', 'The Kremlin', 'Russian subsidiaries', 'last year', 'OWH SE', 'licensing agreement', 'foreign companies', 'foreign company', 'Western companies', 'beer company', 'frozen assets', 'Russian assets', 'Type-C"" accounts', 'Frankfurt-based bank', 'Frank Hellwig', 'Europe hub', 'German savers', 'bank run', 'Russia headquarters', 'way', 'Russians', 'MOSCOW', 'decree', 'Nov.', 'conflict', 'Ukraine', 'barrage', 'sanctions', 'banks', 'response', 'country', 'value', '100,000 rubles', 'funds', 'owner', 'option', 'guarantee', 'Clearstream', 'exchange', 'shares', 'February', 'dozens', 'foul', 'money', 'sales', 'cases', 'control', 'July', 'Danone', 'Carlsberg', 'Germany', 'Uniper', 'Finland', 'Fortum', 'VTB', 'name', 'parent', 'brand', 'regulators', 'liquidation', 'tens', 'thousands', 'sponsor', 'Lions', 'war', 'outflow', 'April', 'permission', 'course']",2023-11-10,2023-11-11,hurriyetdailynews.com

To this end  the company has today published the draft resolutions in the BALO.Vantiva points out that  from the parties' point of view  the value of the transaction lies primarily in the realization of future synergies made possible by the combination of the Home Networks business with Vantiva. The integration of the acquired businesses should lead to additional financing requirements before the benefits of the synergies. As a result  the company plans to meet these new needs notably by extending its existing credit lines to the combined perimeter  and by optimizing the acquired working capital. The company is therefore confident in its ability to meet the liquidity needs resulting from the transaction over the next twelve months.For the purposes of the transaction  Vantiva and CommScope have assumed a value of 88 million euros for the assets acquired  based mainly on discounted cash flows. This valuation and the exchange ratio will be the subject of a fairness opinion by RSM  acting as an independent expert. This will be made available on the Vantiva website prior to the Annual General Meeting.The valuation of the acquired assets adopted for the purposes of the transaction results in a unit issue price for Vantiva shares of sixty-five euro cents (â¬0.65) (including share premium). This valuation should not be used to draw conclusions concerning the evolution of Vantivaâs share price.###Warning: Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements""  including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on anti-CHIKV neutralizing antibody titers. Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.The Company will hold an analyst call and a webcast at 3:00pm CET or 9:00am EDT on Monday  November 13  2023. The link will be available on the Companyâs investor page. Please refer to this link Investors - Valneva.As sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine approved in the U.S.  Valneva has received a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) from the FDA  which it intends to monetize to help finance its research and development (R&D) programs.With this U.S. approval  IXCHIQÂ® becomes the worldâs first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need and the third vaccine Valneva1 has brought from early R&D to approval. Valneva reported final pivotal Phase 3 data for the vaccine in March 2022 showing a 98.9% seroresponse rate at 28 days with a single vaccination2 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20223. IXCHIQÂ®-induced seroresponse was sustained over time with a 96.3% seroresponse rate six months post-vaccination2. Valneva will continue to evaluate antibody persistence for at least five years4. The Companyâs pivotal Phase 3 results were published in the Lancet in June 2023.Every year  more than 60 million Americans travel to countries where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic5. Initially addressing the potential needs of U.S. travelers  IXCHIQÂ® fits seamlessly into Valnevaâs global established travel vaccines business  which includes vaccines against Japanese encephalitis and cholera/ETEC6  leveraging Valnevaâs existing commercial and industrial infrastructure  which has been augmented with this newest product.Valneva plans to begin commercializing IXCHIQÂ® in the U.S. early next year while continuing to support the work towards an anticipated vote from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at the end of February 2024.Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  said  âAs a leading specialty vaccines company  we aim to deliver vaccines in areas of unmet medical need supporting our vision to contribute to a world in which no one dies or suffers from a vaccine preventable disease. As such  today marks an important step forward in the prevention of chikungunya. I would like to personally express a huge thank you to everyone who helped make this possible. I would also like to recognize CEPI and Instituto Butantan for their collaboration in potentially bringing this product to low- and middle-income countries.âDr. Richard Hatchett  Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  commented  âThe first-ever licensed chikungunya vaccine will play a crucial role in preventing the suffering caused by this debilitating disease. Climate change is intensifying the threat posed by chikungunya  which means safe and effective vaccines are needed now more than ever before. Through our partnership with Valneva and Instituto Butantan  CEPI â with support from the EU â will help to make this vaccine accessible to the people most affected by the virus in low- and middle-income countries. I am proud of our contribution and congratulate our partner Valneva on this historic achievement.âJuan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  added  âToday  it is estimated that more than 75% of the world's population lives in areas at risk of CHIKV transmission due to factors such as global warming and climate change7. Chikungunya has already spread to over 110 countries and is currently regarded as one of the most likely viral infections to emerge in new geographic areas. Morbidity is high with 43% of CHIKV patients suffering from chronic chikungunya where joint pain  fatigue  and potentially debilitating effects may last from months to years and can have substantial impact on daily activities7 8. As we are introducing IXCHIQÂ®  our objective is to make this vaccine available to the largest number of people that will benefit from it.âEarlier this year  the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert as the number of cases and deaths due to chikungunya continues to rise in the Americas9. Modeling now shows the problem may only worsen due to climate change. As the Earthâs temperature continues to rise  vector habitats are likely to expand  which poses an immediate risk of outbreaks in warmer areas of the United States and Europe10.A clinical study in adolescents  aged 12 to 17 years  is ongoing in Brazil11 as part of an agreement signed between Instituto Butantan and Valneva in January 202112 to make the vaccine more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). The study  funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  may support future regulatory submissions in this age group as well as licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic region.The study is also expected to support regulatory approval in Europe. Initial safety data from this trial were included in the submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 202313. The vaccine was granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by EMA in 2020. A regulatory review is currently also underway with Health Canada.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite14. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 203215. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries16. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas17 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing âdiuretic-resistantâ patient population. alfapumpÂ® and DSRÂ® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company has reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and is on track to file a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA by year end.The Company has reported first results from MOJAVE  the US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0 seeking to confirm the strong efficacy seen in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies. The first two patients have been successfully treated with DSR 2.0  and top-line data from all of the first three patients is expected by year end. Sequana Medical recently reported that a detailed biomarker analysis of RED DESERT and SAHARA patients indicates DSRâs mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

To this end  the company has today published the draft resolutions in the BALO.Vantiva points out that  from the parties' point of view  the value of the transaction lies primarily in the realization of future synergies made possible by the combination of the Home Networks business with Vantiva. The integration of the acquired businesses should lead to additional financing requirements before the benefits of the synergies. As a result  the company plans to meet these new needs notably by extending its existing credit lines to the combined perimeter  and by optimizing the acquired working capital. The company is therefore confident in its ability to meet the liquidity needs resulting from the transaction over the next twelve months.For the purposes of the transaction  Vantiva and CommScope have assumed a value of 88 million euros for the assets acquired  based mainly on discounted cash flows. This valuation and the exchange ratio will be the subject of a fairness opinion by RSM  acting as an independent expert. This will be made available on the Vantiva website prior to the Annual General Meeting.The valuation of the acquired assets adopted for the purposes of the transaction results in a unit issue price for Vantiva shares of sixty-five euro cents (â¬0.65) (including share premium). This valuation should not be used to draw conclusions concerning the evolution of Vantivaâs share price.###Warning: Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements""  including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

(âPharmingâ or âthe Companyâ) (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has received a Day 180 Second List of Outstanding Issues (LoOI) from the European Medicines Agencyâs (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) regarding its Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with APDS  a rare primary immunodeficiency. Based on the timetable included in the CHMP Day 180 Second LoOI  and considering the CHMPâs decision to reschedule the Ad-Hoc Expert Group (AEG) meeting to the end of November  Pharming now expects the CHMP to issue its opinion on the leniolisib MAA in the first quarter of 2024.Pharming now intends to file an MAA with the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) through the International Recognition Procedure (IRP) which will replace the European Commission Decision Recognition Procedure (ECDRP) from January 1  2024. Under the IRP  Pharming would file an MAA for leniolisib on the basis of the US FDA approval in the first quarter of 2024 and the MHRA would have 110 days from the date the IRP submission is validated to review and issue its decision.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Î´ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KÎ´ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About leniolisibLeniolisib is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Káº) inhibitor approved in the US as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KÎ´) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy of leniolisib in the coprimary endpoints; demonstrating statistically significant impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype within these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term leniolisib administration.8 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review by the European Medicines Agency  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in the UK  Canada  Australia and Japan. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial in children aged 4 to 11 with APDS  with a further trial planned in children aged 1 to 6 years with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

Zilucoplan is a once-daily subcutaneously (SC)-injected  self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor).8In progressing a portfolio of medicines for the treatment of gMG  with the aim of providing HCPs the option of addressing either complement activation or pathogenic antibodies for appropriate patients  UCB hopes to offer a comprehensive portfolio of targeted therapeutics  embodying a commitment to addressing the gMG community's unmet needs.""There is a significant need to bring more targeted  well-tolerated  effective treatment options that address the pathophysiology of gMG disease. If approved by the European Commission  UCB will be the first and only company to offer a gMG-focused portfolio with rozanolixizumab and zilucoplan  providing patients and clinicians the option of two targeted therapies. We believe that the inclusion of both anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive patients and anti-AChR positive patients within the CHMP marketing authorization recommendation for rozanolixizumab could support clinicians to tailor their prescribing decisions to meet individual needs of their patients.' said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. 'This latest European gMG regulatory milestone  alongside approvals for both zilucoplan and rozanolixizumab in the U.S. and Japan in recent months  further reinforces the commitment we have made to the gMG community to help transform their experiences  outcomes and expectations. We are truly proud and excited for the future.""The CHMP opinion for rozanolixizumab is supported by safety and efficacy data from the pivotal Phase 3 MycarinG study (NCT03971422)  published in The Lancet Neurology in May 2023.2 The primary efficacy endpoint was the comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups (rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg  rozanolixizumab 10mg/kg) or placebo in the MG-ADL score at Day 43. MG-ADL is a measurement tool that assesses the impact of gMG on daily functions of 8 items that are typically affected in gMG. These include activities such as breathing  talking  swallowing  and being able to rise from a chair.3 Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 3 represents loss of ability to perform that function. A total score ranges from 0 to 24  with the higher scores indicating more impairment. Reductions in MG-ADL score from baseline to Day 43 were greater in the rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg group (least-squares mean change -3.37 [SE 0.49]) and in the rozanolixizumab 10 mg/kg group (-3.40 [0.49]) than with placebo (-0.78 [0.49]; for 7 mg/kg  least-squares mean difference â2.59 [95% CI â4.09 to â1.25]  p<0.001; for 10 mg/kg  â2.62 [â3.99 to â1.16]  p<0.001).2Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline to Day 43 in the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MG-C) and the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMC) scores. The MG-C is a 10-item instrument that measures the symptoms and signs of MG based on physician examination and patient history. Items are related to ptosis  double vision  eye closure  talking  chewing  swallowing  breathing  neck flexion  shoulder abduction  and hip flexion. Each item is scored on an ordinal scale with four possible categories and weighted. The total score ranges from 0 to 50  with higher scores indicating more severe impairments. The MG-C is composed of items originating from other scales (i.e.  QMG  MMT  MG-ADL). A statistically significant difference favoring rozanolixizumab compared to placebo was observed in the MG-C score change from baseline to Day 43 [least squares mean difference] -3.90 (95% CI (â6.63 to â1.25)  p<0.001 for rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg; least-squares mean difference â5.53 (95% CI â8.30 to â2.97)  p<0.001 for rozanolixizumab 10mg/kg.2The QMG is a 13-item categorical grading system that assesses muscle weakness. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents no weakness and a score of 3 represents severe weakness. A total possible score ranges from 0 to 39  where higher scores indicate more severe impairment.9 A statistically significant difference favoring rozanolixizumab compared to placebo was observed in the QMG total score change from baseline to Day 43 [least squares mean difference -3.48 (95% CI (â5.61 to â1.58)  p<0.001 for rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg; least-squares mean difference â4.76 (95% CI â6.82 to â2.86)  p<0.001 for rozanolixizumab 10mg/kg.2The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of patients treated with rozanolixizumab) were headache  diarrhea and pyrexia.1gMG is a rare  chronic  heterogeneous  unpredictable autoimmune disease characterized by dysfunction and damage at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).10 11 12 gMG has a global prevalence of 100-350 cases per every 1 million people.11""With the news of the CHMP's positive opinion of rozanolixizumab  we are very proud and excited to potentially provide the gMG community with further treatment options and new hope. Following recent approvals in the U.S. and Japan  it is our commitment to bring widespread access of innovative treatment options to a broader patient population living with myasthenia gravis. And  with our two different medicines for gMG  each with a distinct mechanism of action  UCB offers the community a unique portfolio of treatments that embodies our commitment to addressing the gMG community's unmet needs."" said Jean-Christophe Tellier  CEO  UCB. ""We would like to take this time to extend our gratitude to the patients  care partners and investigators who participated in the MycarinG study  and to our employees and collaborators for their dedication and support to the gMG community.""This announcement follows approval of rozanolixizumab and zilucoplan by the Japanese Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for treatment of gMG in adult patients (only for patients who inadequately respond to steroids or other immunosuppressants)  and approval of rozanolixizumab by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of gMG in adult patients who are anti-AChR or anti-MuSK antibody positive.7 5 Orphan designation was granted by the European Commission in 2020 to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis and successfully maintained after having received the positive CHMP Opinion.13The CHMP's positive opinion for rozanolixizumab is now being reviewed by the European Commission  which grants centralized marketing authorizations for medicinal products in the EU. Feedback from the European Commission is anticipated during Q1 2024.About rozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab 140 mg/ml solution for injection is a subcutaneously administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.2In June 2023  rozanolixizumab-noli was approved by the FDA  for the treatment of gMG in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody-positive  having been granted Priority Review for its Biologic License Application (BLA).5In September 2023  rozanolixizumab was granted approval by the Japanese Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients (only for patients who inadequately respond to steroids or other immunosuppressants).7Rozanolixizumab is currently under review by the Center of Drug Evaluation of the China National Medical Products Administration  the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)  Health Canada and Switzerland (Swissmedic) for the treatment of adults with gMG. Responses from regulatory agencies to these submissions are expected during H2 2023 and H1 2024.About zilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily SC  self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor). As the only once-daily generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) target therapy for self-administration by adult patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive gMG  zilucoplan inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted mechanism of action.8In October 2023  zilucoplan was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of gMG in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody-positive.6In September 2023  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion recommending granting marketing authorization for zilucoplan in the European Union (EU) as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of gMG in adult patients who are anti-AChR antibody-positive.4 A final decision on approval in the EU is expected before the end of the year  in line with the EMA's standard review timeline.Also in September 2023  the Japanese Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved zilucoplan for the treatment of gMG in adult patients (only for patients who inadequately respond to steroids or other immunosuppressants).7Zilucoplan is currently under review by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and Health Canada for the treatment of adults with gMG. Responses from regulatory agencies to these submissions are expected during H2 2023 and H1 2024.Orphan designation was granted by the FDA in 2019 to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.14About generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)gMG is a rare autoimmune disease with a global prevalence of 100-350 cases per every 1 million people.11 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including severe muscular weakness that can result in double vision  drooping eyelids  difficulty with swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.10 15In gMG  pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane.16 This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the skeletal muscle and results in a weaker contraction. gMG can occur in any race  gender or age.10 15About the MycarinG study2The MycarinG study (NCT03971422) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab in adult patients with gMG  with an open-label extension.The primary endpoint for the MycarinG study is change in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score  an eight-item patient-reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities. Additional endpoints include changes in the Myasthenia Gravis composite (MG-C) score  the Quantitative MG (QMG) score  patient-reported outcomes at Day 43 and adverse events (AEs). The majority of patients taking part in the MycarinG study opted to enroll in any future extensions to this clinical trial. As a result  UCB is exploring the potential for further extension studies into this treatment.For more information about the trial  visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03971422.For further information  contact UCB:Global Rare Disease CommunicationsJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01jim.baxter@ucb.comCorporate Communications  Media RelationsLaurent SchotsT+32.2.559.92.64Laurent.schots@ucb.comInvestor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14antje.witte@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise.
