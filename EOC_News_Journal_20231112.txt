Photograph: iStockGoodbody Stockbrokers swung to a loss of €15.8 million last year as fee income slumped amid weak equity markets and money made from its own securities trading book also slid.The result  reported in new filings with the Companies Registration Office (CRO)  compared to a profit of €3.2 million reported in 2021.Staff at the firm were given a sense last month that the financial performance for this year would also be weak when they were told not to expect bonuses for a second straight full year under AIB’s ownership.“Our financial results reflect the unprecedented set of challenges faced by investment banks globally in the past two years  and we have taken a number of decisive actions to strengthen our business and position ourselves for long-term success ” said Goodbody chief executive Michael Tormey.READ MOREGoodbody  which was bought by AIB in September 2021 for €138 million  said last month that it was cutting 20 of the 100 jobs in its investment banking unit amid a global slowdown in deal-making and fundraisings and an expected acceleration of large companies leaving the Irish stock market.The company also acquired Clearstream Solutions  an environmental  social and governance consultancy that has 15 employees  earlier this month for an undisclosed amount. Goodbody had 350 before the job cuts and acquisition were announced.“We believe these measures align our resources with our longer-term strategic priorities ” Mr Tormey said on Friday.Commission income slid to €16.9 million from €23.9 million in 2021  amid a dearth of initial public offerings  drop in share placings  and decline in income from client trading in equities  according to the new accounts for Goodbody Stockbrokers Unlimited. Commission income  primarily from the wealth management unit  declined to €43.5 million on the back of a drop in the value of clients’ assets.Trading income on securities held on Goodbody’s own books  which been the main driver of group profits in 2020 and 2021  plunged by 77 per cent to €747 000  according to the financial statement.The company also booked €3.6 million of exceptional costs relating to its planned move from its long-standing base in Ballsbridge in Dublin 4 to new offices on Dawson Street in the city centre. While the report said the move had been pencilled in for August of this year  it is understood that the timeline has now drifted to next March or April.Goodbody appointed former Goldman Sachs and Lloyds Bank executive James Garvey as chairman of Goodbody Stockbrokers in October  following the death of previous incumbent Gary Kennedy earlier this year. Mr Garvey also currently serves as chairman of Martello Expert Services and as a non-executive director on the boards of both S&P Global Ratings Europe and UK.Non-executive director Joan Kehoe had been acting as interim chair after Mr Kennedy’s death was announced in February following a short illness.Goodbody revealed in its 2021 report that it was subject to a Central Bank of Ireland enforcement investigation into alleged regulatory breaches for failing to have effective systems in place to spot and report potential suspicious client trades. The firm said in its latest report that “the steps taken to date do not involve any conclusion that there has been a breach of the law by the company or its officers  and the outcome here remains uncertain”.,negative,0.02,0.18,0.8,negative,0.02,0.26,0.73,True,English,"['unprecedented’ sector woes', 'Goodbody Stockbrokers', '€15.8m loss', 'S&P Global Ratings Europe', 'Lloyds Bank executive James Garvey', 'Goodbody chief executive Michael Tormey', 'previous incumbent Gary Kennedy', 'potential suspicious client trades', 'second straight full year', 'weak equity markets', 'past two years', 'Irish stock market', 'longer-term strategic priorities', 'initial public offerings', 'wealth management unit', 'former Goldman Sachs', 'Martello Expert Services', 'Ireland enforcement investigation', 'investment banking unit', 'Companies Registration Office', 'securities trading book', 'executive director', 'Mr Tormey', 'Mr Garvey', 'Central Bank', 'global slowdown', 'Mr Kennedy', 'investment banks', 'large companies', 'Trading income', 'new filings', 'financial performance', 'financial results', 'unprecedented set', 'decisive actions', 'long-term success', 'READ MORE', 'Clearstream Solutions', 'governance consultancy', 'undisclosed amount', 'job cuts', 'share placings', 'new accounts', 'clients’ assets', 'main driver', 'group profits', '77 per cent', 'financial statement', 'exceptional costs', 'standing base', 'new offices', 'Dawson Street', 'next March', 'Joan Kehoe', 'interim chair', 'short illness', 'regulatory breaches', 'effective systems', 'fee income', 'Commission income', 'Goodbody Stockbrokers', 'latest report', '2021 report', '100 jobs', 'deal-making', 'Photograph', 'iStock', 'loss', 'money', 'CRO', 'Staff', 'firm', 'sense', 'bonuses', 'AIB', 'ownership', 'challenges', 'number', 'business', 'September', 'fundraisings', 'acceleration', 'company', 'social', '15 employees', 'acquisition', 'measures', 'resources', 'Friday', 'dearth', 'decline', 'equities', 'back', 'drop', 'value', 'books', 'planned', 'move', 'Ballsbridge', 'Dublin', 'city', 'centre', 'August', 'timeline', 'April', 'chairman', 'October', 'death', 'boards', 'UK', 'February', 'place', 'steps', 'date', 'conclusion', 'law', 'officers', 'outcome']",2023-11-11,2023-11-12,irishtimes.com

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillEuronext Dubin  operator of the Irish stock exchange  has called on the Government to exempt from stamp duty trading on a market aimed at companies with dual Irish-US listings  after Flutter Entertainment became the latest heavyweight company to say it is dropping its Dublin quotation.“At the moment  an Irish company gets a stamp duty exemption from the Revenue Commissioners for any trading on a US exchange but not for any trading on its home market. It makes no sense to us why Irish taxation policy would incentivise an Irish company to list on a US market but not on its home exchange ” said Euronext Dublin chief executive Daryl Byrne. “This situation is untenable and needs to change.”Concerns about defections by Irish companies to the US prompted Euronext Dublin to do a lot of work over the summer on its so-called Atlantic securities market (ASM)  which was set up almost a decade ago to facilitate companies seeking dual Irish-US listings  but had essentially been dormant ever since.The exchange has been revising ASM rules to fully align them with those of the US Securities and Exchange Commission – along with other tweaks – in order to pitch this market to Irish companies considering a US listing.READ MOREWhile the ASM was originally granted a stamp duty exemption when launched  Revenue has in recent months refused to regrant that exemption.“In light of this we have sought an important amendment to the Finance Bill 2023 as a priority to introduce a stamp duty exemption for the Atlantic securities market ” said Mr Byrne.Market observers say  however  that there are a number of other factors at play as a number of Irish market heavyweights have either to quit Dublin – or signalled such plans – in recent times. These include deeper liquidity in New York equity markets  the fact that US-listed companies typically trade at a premium to European peers  and the growing reliance of some of the Irish market’s biggest names on the US for earnings.Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment  currently the largest company on Dublin’s Iseq index  said on Thursday it had decided to delist from Euronext Dublin as it plans to add a New York listing in the first quarter of 2024.CRH  the previous Iseq heavyweight  dropped its Irish quotation in September as part of rejig that saw the building materials group move its main listing from London to New York.Cardboard box-maker Smurfit Kappa has also recently it plans to get rid of its Irish quotation under a plan to merge with US rival WestRock.,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.04,negative,0.02,0.24,0.74,True,English,"['stamp duty relief', 'dual Irish-US listings', 'Dublin bourse', 'market', 'Euronext Dublin chief executive Daryl Byrne', 'Dara Mac Dónaill', 'New York equity markets', 'dual Irish-US listings', 'Paddy Power owner', 'building materials group', 'stamp duty exemption', 'previous Iseq heavyweight', 'New York listing', 'Irish taxation policy', 'latest heavyweight company', 'US rival WestRock', 'Atlantic securities market', 'stamp duty trading', 'Irish stock exchange', 'Irish market heavyweights', 'Mr Byrne.', 'Euronext Dubin', 'Dublin quotation', 'Irish company', 'US Securities', 'Iseq index', 'main listing', 'Irish quotation', 'largest company', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'home market', 'home exchange', 'Exchange Commission', 'other tweaks', 'READ MORE', 'recent months', 'important amendment', 'Finance Bill', 'Market observers', 'other factors', 'recent times', 'deeper liquidity', 'European peers', 'growing reliance', 'biggest names', 'first quarter', 'Cardboard box-maker', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'Irish companies', 'US exchange', 'US market', 'US-listed companies', 'Revenue Commissioners', 'ASM rules', 'Government', 'Photograph', 'operator', 'moment', 'sense', 'situation', 'Concerns', 'defections', 'lot', 'work', 'summer', 'order', 'light', 'priority', 'number', 'play', 'plans', 'premium', 'earnings', 'Thursday', 'CRH', 'September', 'part', 'rejig', 'London']",2023-11-11,2023-11-12,irishtimes.com

The data are being presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2023 in San Diego   November 10–15. 1In the initial EXXELERATE trial comparing the efficacy of CIMZIA and adalimumab  the primary endpoints of superiority were not met. In the post hoc analysis  efficacy outcomes in CIMZIA and adalimumab were assessed in patients with RA across RF subgroups. 1 Patients were randomized 1:1 to CIMZIA 200 mg every two weeks plus methotrexate (MTX) or adalimumab 40 mg every two weeks plus MTX. At Week 12  patients were classified as responders or non-responders  non-responders were switched to the other TNFi with possible follow-up to Week 104. Results showed that for patients in the higher RF quartile  65.7 percent of 453 patients treated with CIMZIA and 48.3 percent of 454 patients treated with adalimumab achieved low disease activity at Week 104. 1""It is well known that high rheumatoid factor (RF) levels are associated with a poor prognosis. 2 In addition  high RF levels may lead to decreased drug concentrations of monoclonal antibodies and potentially lower response to TNFis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 1 3 The results of this analysis highlight how  through its fragment crystallizable (Fc)-free molecular structure  certolizumab pegol maintained constant blood concentrations and therapeutic responses regardless of RF levels "" said Professor Josef Smolen   Emeritus Professor of Internal Medicine  Medical University of Vienna  Division of Rheumatology  Vienna  Austria . ""These data may be of clinical relevance in the context of using a personalized medicine approach for patients with RA and high RF levels."" 1RA is a chronic disease that causes inflammation throughout the body and commonly presents as joint pain  swelling  and deformity  which results in a decline in physical function and quality of life. 4 5 It is estimated that  as of 2021  approximately 1.5 million people in the United States live with this disease. 6 High RF is associated with a more aggressive and destructive disease course  which is often more difficult to treat. 7 One reason for this is the high levels of RF autoantibodies binding with the Fc parts of TNFis to form large immune complexes that are then degraded by macrophages  resulting in lower bioavailability of biologic drugs. 8 9To treat RA when high RF levels are present  American College of Rheumatology guidelines recommend biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDS) if there is no observed improvement with MTX treatment. 10 However  many bDMARDs such as TNFis contain an Fc region that RF antibodies bind to  which can result in a lower clinical efficacy and the need for additional interventions. 11 12 13 The distinctive  FC-free structure of CIMZIA means RF may not bind to the drug  allowing its concentration to remain stable over time. 14""At UCB  we aspire to achieve long-lasting drug-free remission for as many patients living with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as possible "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions & Head of U.S.  UCB. ""The data presented at this year's ACR Convergence demonstrate the benefits of certolizumab pegol  as it continues to deliver value for those with high unmet need  late into its lifecycle and beyond. We are excited to continue exploring its scientific potential as a personalized solution for RA patients with high levels of Rheumatoid Factor (RF)."" 1For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT: +32.2.559.94.14Email: antje.witte@ucb.comUS CommunicationsAlly FunkT: +1.678.365.6321Email: ally.funk@ucb.comAbout the EXXELERATE trial methodology and patient populationIn patients with RA  high RF levels are considered a poor prognostic factor and are associated with higher disease activity  risk of radiographic progression  and decreased response to TNF inhibitors (TNFis). 7 Recent data suggest that patients with RA and high RF levels may achieve and maintain greater clinical improvement with TNFis without a crystallizable fragment (Fc) compared with TNFis with an Fc. 12 In this post hoc analysis of the EXXELERATE trial  we assessed efficacy outcomes of CIMZIA (CZP)  a PEGylated  Fc-free TNFi  and adalimumab (ADA; Fc-containing TNFi) in patients with RA across different RF levels. 1About CIMZIA ® in the U.S. 15CIMZIA ® is the only Fc-free  PEGylated anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor). CIMZIA has a high affinity for human TNF-alpha  selectively neutralizing the pathophysiological effects of TNF-alpha.CIMZIA is also indicated for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA)  adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS)  and adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inflammation.CIMZIA is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (PSO) in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.In addition  CIMZIA is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease (CD) and maintaining clinical response in adult patients with moderately to severely active disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.See important safety information including risk of serious bacterial  viral and fungal infections and tuberculosis below.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION about CIMZIA in the U.S.CONTRAINDICATIONSCIMZIA is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to certolizumab pegol or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included angioedema  anaphylaxis  serum sickness  and urticaria.SERIOUS INFECTIONSPatients treated with CIMZIA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.Discontinue CIMZIA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis.Reported infections include:Active tuberculosis (TB)  including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before CIMZIA use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to CIMZIA use.Invasive fungal infections  including histoplasmosis  coccidioidomycosis  candidiasis  aspergillosis  blastomycosis  and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated  rather than localized  disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness.Bacterial  viral  and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens  including Legionella and Listeria.Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with CIMZIA prior to initiating therapy in the following patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to TB; with a history of opportunistic infection; who resided in or traveled in regions where mycoses are endemic; with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with CIMZIA  including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.Do not start CIMZIA during an active infection  including localized infections.Patients older than 65 years  patients with co-morbid conditions  and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants may be at greater risk of infection.If an infection develops  monitor carefully and initiate appropriate therapy.MALIGNANCYLymphoma and other malignancies  some fatal  have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers  of which CIMZIA is a member. CIMZIA is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.Consider the risks and benefits of CIMZIA treatment prior to initiating or continuing therapy in a patient with known malignancy.In clinical trials  more cases of malignancies were observed among CIMZIA-treated patients compared to control patients.In CIMZIA clinical trials  there was an approximately 2-fold higher rate of lymphoma than expected in the general U.S. population. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis  particularly those with highly active disease  are at a higher risk of lymphoma than the general population.Malignancies  some fatal  have been reported among children  adolescents  and young adults being treated with TNF blockers. Approximately half of the cases were lymphoma  while the rest were other types of malignancies  including rare types associated with immunosuppression and malignancies not usually seen in this patient population.Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL)  a rare type of T-cell lymphoma  have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers  including CIMZIA. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis  and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. Carefully assess the risks and benefits of treating with CIMZIA in these patient types.Cases of acute and chronic leukemia were reported with TNF blocker use.HEART FAILUREWorsening and new onset congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported with TNF blockers. Exercise caution and monitor carefully.HYPERSENSITIVITYAngioedema  anaphylaxis  dyspnea  hypotension  rash  serum sickness  and urticaria have been reported following CIMZIA administration. If a serious allergic reaction occurs  stop CIMZIA and institute appropriate therapy. The needle shield inside the removable cap of the CIMZIA prefilled syringe contains a plastic derivative of natural rubber latex which may cause an allergic reaction in individuals sensitive to latex.HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATIONUse of TNF blockers  including CIMZIA  may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers. Some cases have been fatal.Test patients for HBV infection before initiating treatment with CIMZIA.Exercise caution in patients who are carriers of HBV and monitor them before and during CIMZIA treatment.Discontinue CIMZIA and begin antiviral therapy in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Exercise caution when resuming CIMZIA after HBV treatment.NEUROLOGIC REACTIONSTNF blockers  including CIMZIA  have been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of central nervous system and peripheral demyelinating diseases  including multiple sclerosis  seizure disorder  optic neuritis  peripheral neuropathy  and Guillain-Barré syndrome.HEMATOLOGIC REACTIONSRare reports of pancytopenia  including aplastic anemia  have been reported with TNF blockers. Medically significant cytopenia has been infrequently reported with CIMZIA.Consider stopping CIMZIA if significant hematologic abnormalities occur.DRUG INTERACTIONSDo not use CIMZIA in combination with other biological DMARDS.AUTOIMMUNITYTreatment with CIMZIA may result in the formation of autoantibodies and  rarely  in development of a lupus-like syndrome. Discontinue treatment if symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome develop.IMMUNIZATIONSPatients on CIMZIA should not receive live or live-attenuated vaccines.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions in CIMZIA clinical trials (≥8%) were: upper respiratory infections (18%)  rash (9%)  and urinary tract infections (8%).For full prescribing information  please visit https://www.ucb.com/_up/ucb_com_products/documents/Cimzia_09_11_2019_en.pdfAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium ( www.ucb.com ) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

It looks like only Russian government restrictions or the war could slow Russian exports soon.”Traders were assessing disruptions to Ukrainian shipping after a cargo was hit by a missile this week.Following the attack prices for shipment of grains from Ukrainian ports in the shipping channel rose by $20 a ton before easing back to former levels on Friday.Traders were also monitoring ongoing rainfall in France where grain sowings further slowed last week and are now running well behind last year.Farmers had sown 67% of the expected soft wheat area for next year’s harvest by Nov. 6  up from 61% last week  farm office FranceAgriMer said in a report.
