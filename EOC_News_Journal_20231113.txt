Nov. 13  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today provided an update on operational progress and reported financial results for the third quarter of 2023.“Our robust NBTXR3 clinical program continues to demonstrate potentially transformative efficacy and well-tolerated safety across indications and patient types  including elderly and vulnerable populations. We are pleased with the encouraging  expanded potential in locally advanced pancreatic cancer supported by initial Phase 1 data from our strategic collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) presented at this year’s AACR and ESMO annual meetings ” said Laurent Levy  co-founder of Nanobiotix and chairman of the executive board. “Additionally  strong Phase 1 data from Study 102 in locally advanced head and neck cancer demonstrated high and durable activity including a 64% complete response rate  a 16.9 months mPFS and 23.1 months mOS in evaluable patients  which is nearly double the survival reported in historical data. Further  we believe the Study 102 results inform next steps and further strengthen the hypotheses underlying the design of the ongoing global  registrational NANORAY-312 Phase 3 study for NBTXR3.”Story continuesLaurent Levy continued  “Building on the momentum following our recent global licensing agreement with Janssen  we have raised €50.9 million in capital that includes a public offering and the partial execution of the second equity tranche from Johnson & Johnson Innovation  Inc. With the EIB cash covenant removed  our financial overhang addressed  and our cash runway extended  we are poised to successfully execute through several important catalysts and into the expected timeframe of the NANORAY-312 interim efficacy readout.”Third Quarter 2023 Operational Highlights  Subsequent Events  and Pipeline Status and Upcoming MilestonesNanobiotix announced on July 10  2023  that it had entered into a global exclusive licensing  co-development  and commercialization agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company  for the investigational  potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3.

Adding to this the €19.1 million gross proceeds from the restricted ADSs to be purchased by JJDC in the Concurrent Private Placement  the Company will receive aggregate gross proceeds of approximately €50.9 million (equivalent to approximately $53.8 million  based on an exchange rate of €1.00 = $1.0568  as published by Bloomberg on November 1  2023)  before deduction of underwriting commissions from the Global Offering and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. Following the approval of the French Ministry of Economy and the subscription by JJDC for the Remaining Placement Amount  the aggregate gross proceeds would increase to approximately €55.5 million (equivalent to approximately $58.7 million) and would extend the cash runway to the end of the second quarter of 2025 (assuming the development milestone as above and excluding cash inflows from future non-dilutive or dilutive financing opportunities).Successful Removal of the EIB Cash CovenantAs previously disclosed  the European Investment Bank (the “EIB”) has agreed to the removal of the minimum cash and cash equivalent covenant from the Company’s EIB loan  effective October 13  2023. As result of the financing with gross proceeds of €50.9 million  the company will prepay the EIB approximately €0.5 million (1% of €50.9M) of the €20.0 million milestone payment required under the EIB loan.Conference Call and WebcastNanobiotix will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Tuesday  November 14  2023  at 8:00 am ET / 2:00 pm CET  prior to the open of the U.S. market.

The firm’s premium listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and its membership of the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 will not be affected by the Euronext Dublin cancellation.The move comes as Flutter announced revenue had increased eight per cent year-over-year (YoY) to UK£2.04 billion (US$2.5 billion) for the third quarter of 2023  aided by gambling revenue rising 22 per cent. Average monthly player (AMP) numbers climbed 16 per cent. The group’s sports revenue was up four per cent. Revenue for the US rose by 12 per cent to UK£668 million (US$818 million)  while UK and Ireland revenue was up 11 per cent to UK£566 million (US$693 million).Flutter now expects revenue and adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in the US to be approximately UK£3.75 billion (US$4.59 billion) and UK£140 million (US$171 million) respectively. Beyond that  the company noted that the challenging Australian operating environment will continue into 2024. Revenue for Australia in Q3 was down 18 per cent YoY to UK£262 million (US$321 million).“The group had another strong quarter in Q3 and even in this seasonally quieter period  the power of our diversified business is clear with revenue growth of 13 per cent to over UK£2 billion ” said Peter Jackson  Flutter chief executive. “We remain the number one choice for sports betting and gaming customers globally  and our 16 per cent growth in average monthly players augurs well for our continued growth and market leadership.“We are particularly pleased by the great progress we are making in the US. We are the first online operator to achieve structural profitability  and the strong ramp in EBITDA during 2023 will continue into 2024 and beyond  as our profit margins expand materially.”“The NFL season is off to an excellent start with our product leadership driving average monthly player growth of 38 per cent to 2.6 million in the quarter. I am excited about our plans heading into the sports rich months of November and December as we execute on our winning strategy which  combined with the FanDuel Advantage  keep us leading the industry.He continued: “We are making good progress towards our US listing which will bring the group significant benefits from accessing the world’s deepest and most liquid capital markets.“Overall  the significant potential for US growth and ability to leverage scale benefits across our diversified portfolio outside of the US  underpins our confidence in our significant and sustainable long term earnings growth potential.”,neutral,0.19,0.8,0.01,positive,0.69,0.3,0.01,True,English,"['FanDuel owner Flutter', 'NYSE listing', 'early', 'revenue', 'Q3', 'sustainable long term earnings growth potential', 'Irish-based gambling giant Flutter Entertainment', 'challenging Australian operating environment', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Financial Times Stock Exchange', 'average monthly players augurs', 'Euronext Dublin stock exchange', 'average monthly player growth', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Euronext Dublin cancellation', 'number one choice', 'The NFL season', 'liquid capital markets', 'sports rich months', 'Flutter chief executive', 'first online operator', '16 per cent growth', 'primary US listing', 'significant potential', 'continued growth', 'gambling revenue', 'US growth', 'revenue growth', 'premium listing', '12 per cent', '13 per cent', '38 per cent', 'sports betting', 'first quarter', 'US operator', 'due course', 'shareholder consultation', 'two listings', 'regulatory complexities', 'AMP) numbers', 'quieter period', 'diversified business', 'Peter Jackson', 'gaming customers', 'market leadership', 'great progress', 'structural profitability', 'strong ramp', 'profit margins', 'excellent start', 'product leadership', 'winning strategy', 'good progress', 'diversified portfolio', 'sports revenue', 'third quarter', 'strong quarter', 'Paddy Power', 'FanDuel Advantage', 'Ireland revenue', 'adjusted EBITDA', 'significant benefits', 'UK', 'NYSE', 'company', 'brands', 'Betfair', 'group', 'order', 'firm', 'LSE', 'membership', 'FTSE', 'move', 'year', 'four', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'Q3', 'plans', 'November', 'December', 'industry', 'world', 'deepest', 'scale', 'confidence', '2024']",2023-11-13,2023-11-13,sportspromedia.com
