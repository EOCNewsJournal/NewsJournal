The board of directors shall ensure that the agreements with the Participants contain terms that prohibit transfers and pledges of the Employee Stock Options and for vesting of the Employee Stock Options in accordance with below principles.The Employee Stock Options shall be allocated to the Participants free of charge.The allocated Employee Stock Options shall be vested with 1/3 after 12 months (year 2025)  then an additional 1/3 shall be vested after 12 months (year 2026) and an additional 1/3 shall be vested 12 months thereafter (year 2027). Vesting requires that the Participant is still employed by the Company or its subsidiaries. If the Participant’s employment is terminated by the Participant or due to the Participant’s breach of contract  all Employee Stock Options shall immediately expire for the Participant and cannot be exercised by the Participant. If the employment is terminated for other reasons  vested Employee Stock Options may be exercised  however the right to Employee Stock Options not yet vested will expire.

In addition  the Company's costs for the Employee Stock Option Program 2023/2027 are related costs for preparation  implementation and administration of the program.The estimated costs of the program will be included in the board of directors’ complete proposal for resolution.Outstanding incentive programsAs a part of the preparation of this proposal the board of directors has decided to cancel all outstanding employee stock options and related warrants under LTI 2021/2024 and LTI 2022/2025 and thereby terminate the employee stock option programs in advance. The restricted share units issued under LTI 2021/2024 have not been canceled.The number of restricted share units issued under LTI 2021/2024 amounts to 419 000.

Elafibranor demonstrates significant improvements in biomarkers of disease progression versus placebo  including significant treatment benefit with improvement in biochemical response and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) normalization  along with patient-reported outcomes data suggesting a possible improvement in pruritus.Elafibranor was generally well-tolerated with a well-documented safety profile consistent with previous trials.PARIS  FRANCE  13 November  2023 – Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) and GENFIT (Nasdaq and Euronext: GNFT) today announced full results from the pivotal Phase III ELATIVE® trial  which are being presented in a late-breaking oral session (Abstract #484  Monday  13 November at 16.45 EST) at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of investigational elafibranor  an oral  dual PPAR α δ agonist  as a potential novel class of treatment for patients with the rare  autoimmune cholestatic liver disease  primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).Results show statistically significant improvements in biomarkers of disease progression across key endpoints with a significant treatment benefit achieved in the primary composite endpoint  demonstrating a 47% placebo-adjusted difference (P<0.001) between patients on elafibranor 80mg (51%) compared with patients on placebo (4%) achieving a biochemical response. In the trial  a biochemical response is defined as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) <1.67 x upper limit of normal (ULN)  an ALP decrease ≥ 15 percent and total bilirubin (TB) ≤ ULN at 52 weeks. ALP and bilirubin are important predictors of PBC disease progression. Reductions in levels of both can indicate reduced cholestatic injury and improved liver function.Only patients receiving elafibranor achieved normalization of ALP (upper limit of normal 104 U/L in females and 129 U/L in males) at Week 52 (15% vs 0% placebo  P=0.002)  a key secondary endpoint of the trial. The significant biochemical effect of elafibranor measured by ALP reduction was further supported by data demonstrating reductions from baseline in ALP levels were rapid  seen as early as Week 4 in the elafibranor group  and were sustained through Week 52  with a decrease in ALP of 41% on elafibranor compared with placebo.“When managing PBC our first goal is to effectively control the disease progression which can lead to liver failure. The results from ELATIVE provide compelling evidence that elafibranor has the potential to achieve this goal  with evidence of a highly significant treatment benefit that is associated with improved clinical outcomes ” said Dr Christopher Bowlus  Professor of Gastroenterology and Hepatology  University of California Davis  U.S. “In addition  our patients need relief from the significant symptom burden of PBC  particularly those with moderate to severe itch. Data from ELATIVE demonstrated the possibility of improved pruritus for patients taking elafibranor compared with those on placebo. Taken together  these data suggest elafibranor could offer an effective new treatment opportunity for PBC management.”ELATIVE investigated the effect of treatment with elafibranor on pruritus (severe itch) across three separate patient-reported outcome measures. On the key secondary endpoint using the PBC Worst Itch NRS score  the reduction of pruritus observed for elafibranor versus placebo was not statistically significant (LS mean  –1.93 versus –1.15; difference  –0.78; 95% CI  –1.99 to 0.42; P=0.20). Two other secondary patient-reported outcome measures were used to assess itch  and greater reductions in pruritus were observed with elafibranor compared with placebo at Week 52  according to the itch domain of PBC-40 quality of life questionnaire (LS mean difference -2.3; 95% CI  -4.0 to -0.7) and 5-D Itch total score (LS mean difference  -3.0; 95% CI  -5.5 to -0.5).“We believe these data suggest that elafibranor could be a paradigm-changing treatment meeting the unmet need for an effective second-line option ” said Christelle Huguet  EVP and Head of Research and Development  Ipsen. “These data from ELATIVE have provided a better understanding of how we can effectively manage both disease progression and the symptom burden still experienced by many people living with PBC. It would not have been possible for us to investigate the potential for new innovative treatments without the involvement of the patients and their wider families and caregivers  to whom we are immensely grateful. We are also enormously grateful to the study investigators  who have supported us and provided us with the benefit of their expertise in designing and running this study.”PBC is a rare  autoimmune  cholestatic liver disease  affecting approximately nine women for every one man. A build-up of bile and toxins (cholestasis) and chronic inflammation causes irreversible fibrosis (scarring) of the liver and destruction of the bile ducts. It is a life-long condition that can worsen over time if not effectively treated  leading to liver transplant and in some cases  premature death. PBC impacts patient’s daily lives through debilitating symptoms including most commonly pruritus and fatigue. Currently  there are no approved treatments available that can effectively manage both disease progression and life-impacting symptoms.“Living with PBC can be very challenging for many people. The fear of the disease progressing hangs over you  and you have to manage as best you can with the daily symptom burden  symptoms that can sometimes be so debilitating it takes every ounce of strength to get through another day ” explained Mo Christie  Head of Patient Services  PBC Foundation  UK. “As someone who is living with PBC  I appreciate the need for clinicians  other patients  and families to understand the condition and the impact that coming to terms with living with an incurable condition can have on a person’s life. The impact can be enormous  so it is vitally important to all aspects of our lives that we can access knowledge  care and effective medicines  when we see our clinicians.”Elafibranor was well tolerated in the trial. Similar percentages of patients in the treatment group and the placebo group experienced adverse events  treatment-related adverse events  severe or serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation. Adverse events occurring in >10% of patients and more frequently on elafibranor versus placebo included abdominal pain  diarrhea  nausea  and vomiting. Elafibranor has a well-documented safety profile across a broad patient population and is consistent with cumulative safety data from past elafibranor trials in other indications  including NASH.Data from ELATIVE are being used to support submissions for elafibranor as a treatment for PBC with regulatory authorities worldwide.ENDSELATIVEELATIVE is a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial  with an open-label long-term extension (NCT04526665). ELATIVE is evaluating the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 80mg once daily versus placebo for the treatment of patients with PBC with an inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)  the existing first-line therapy for PBC. The trial enrolled 161 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive elafibranor 80mg once daily or placebo. Patients with an inadequate response to UDCA would continue to receive UDCA in combination with elafibranor or placebo  while patients unable to tolerate UDCA would receive only elafibranor or placebo.ElafibranorElafibranor is a novel  oral  once-daily  dual peroxisome activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/delta (α δ) agonist  currently under investigation as a treatment for patients with PBC  a rare liver disease. Concurrent α δ activation targets inflammation  cholestasis and fibrosis in PBC. In 2019  elafibranor was granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to UDCA. Elafibranor has not received approval by regulatory authorities anywhere in the world.IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements.

This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of investigational elafibranor  an oral  dual PPAR α δ agonist  as a potential novel class of treatment for patients with the rare  autoimmune cholestatic liver disease  Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC).Results show statistically significant improvements in biomarkers of disease progression across key endpoints with a significant treatment benefit achieved in the primary composite endpoint  demonstrating a 47% placebo-adjusted difference (P<0.001) between patients on elafibranor 80mg (51%) compared with patients on placebo (4%) achieving a biochemical response. In the trial  a biochemical response is defined as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) <1.67 x upper limit of normal (ULN)  an ALP decrease ≥ 15 percent and total bilirubin (TB) ≤ ULN at 52 weeks. ALP and bilirubin are important predictors of PBC disease progression. Reductions in levels of both can indicate reduced cholestatic injury and improved liver function.Only patients receiving elafibranor achieved normalization of ALP (upper limit of normal 104 U/L in females and 129 U/L in males) at Week 52 (15% vs 0% placebo  P=0.002)  a key secondary endpoint of the trial. The significant biochemical effect of elafibranor measured by ALP reduction was further supported by data demonstrating reductions from baseline in ALP levels were rapid  seen as early as Week 4 in the elafibranor group  and were sustained through Week 52  with a decrease in ALP of 41% on elafibranor compared with placebo.“When managing PBC  our first goal is to effectively control the disease progression which can lead to liver failure.

The fear of the disease progressing hangs over you  and you have to manage as best you can with the daily symptom burden  symptoms that can sometimes be so debilitating it takes every ounce of strength to get through another day ” explained Mo Christie  Head of Patient Services  PBC Foundation  UK. “As someone who is living with PBC  I appreciate the need for clinicians  other patients  and families to understand the condition and the impact that coming to terms with living with an incurable condition can have on a person’s life. The impact can be enormous  so it is vitally important to all aspects of our lives that we can access knowledge  care and effective medicines  when we see our clinicians.”Elafibranor was well tolerated in the trial. Similar percentages of patients in the treatment group and the placebo group experienced adverse events  treatment-related adverse events  severe or serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation. Adverse events occurring in >10% of patients and more frequently on elafibranor versus placebo included abdominal pain  diarrhea  nausea  and vomiting. Elafibranor has a well-documented safety profile across a broad patient population and is consistent with cumulative safety data from past elafibranor trials in other indications  including NASH.Data from ELATIVE® are being used to support submissions for elafibranor as a treatment for PBC with regulatory authorities worldwide.ENDSABOUT ELATIVE®ELATIVE® is a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial  with an open-label long-term extension (NCT03124108). ELATIVE® is evaluating the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 80mg once daily versus placebo for the treatment of patients with PBC with an inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)  the existing first-line therapy for PBC. The trial enrolled 161 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive elafibranor 80mg once daily or placebo. Patients with an inadequate response to UDCA would continue to receive UDCA in combination with elafibranor or placebo  while patients unable to tolerate UDCA would receive only elafibranor or placebo.ABOUT ELAFIBRANORElafibranor is a novel  oral  once-daily  dual peroxisome activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/delta (α δ) agonist  currently under investigation as a treatment for patients with PBC  a rare liver disease. Concurrent α δ activation targets inflammation  cholestasis and fibrosis in PBC. In 2019  elafibranor was granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to UDCA. Elafibranor has not received approval by regulatory authorities anywhere in the world.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

These results complement the initial Phase 3 safety data the Company reported for the trial in August 20231.Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program  and conducted in collaboration with Instituto Butantan  the VLA1553-321 adolescent trial is intended to support label extension in this age group following recent regulatory approval in adults from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States (U.S)2. The trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations. Additionally  the trial is expected to support regulatory approval in Europe and the initial safety data were included in the submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 20233. VLA1553-321 represents the first clinical trial Valneva is conducting in an endemic area and with individuals previously infected with CHIKV.The pivotal immunogenicity data showed that a single-dose vaccination with VLA1553 induced a robust immune response in adolescents aged 12 to <18 years4  confirming the excellent immunogenicity previously observed in adults5.Trial VLA1553-321 met its primary endpoint. VLA1553 induced levels of protective antibody titers6 in 98.8% of participants 28 days after a single vaccination (seroresponse rate7 of 98.8% (95% CI: 96.5  99.8; 247 of 250 baseline seronegative participants from the per-protocol population)  significantly exceeding the FDA’s requirement for study success of the lower bound of the 95%CI for SRR >70%).The vaccine was highly immunogenic with a Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) of 3890 in baseline seronegative participants. Neutralizing antibody GMTs at Day 29 in baseline seronegative participants were similar to GMTs observed in seropositive participants at baseline  indicating that VLA1553 induces levels of antibodies comparable to those in individuals with a history of CHIKV wild type infection.As reported previously  VLA1553 administered as a single-dose was generally well tolerated in adolescents aged 12 to <18 years  irrespective of previous CHIKV infection and showed a similar safety profile as reported in adults8.754 individuals were vaccinated in trial VLA1553-321  and the present analysis includes data up to Day 29 (primary endpoint). An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board has continuously evaluated safety data during the trial and has not identified any safety concerns. The majority of solicited adverse events observed following VLA1553 administration were mild or moderate and resolved within three days. Importantly  the initial data suggest a favorable safety profile in seropositive participants  confirming the observations following re-vaccination of individuals in Phase 1 trial VLA1553-1019.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “These new data in a younger population and in individuals previously infected with the chikungunya virus confirm the robust immunity and safety profile we previously observed in adults and the elderly. Given the significant threat that chikungunya poses to individuals living in or traveling to endemic areas  it is crucial to make the vaccine accessible to all age groups. By doing so  we can enhance the protection and reduce the impact of this debilitating disease.”The recent U.S. FDA approval10 was based on final pivotal Phase 3 data in 4 115 adults aged 18 years and above reported in March 202211  and the Lancet subsequently published these results in June 202312. Final lot-to-lot consistency results were published in May 202213 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202214.About Phase 3 study VLA1553-321VLA1553-321 is a prospective  double-blinded  multicenter  randomized  placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 trial conducted in 754 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old in Brazil. The VLA1553-321 clinical trial was initiated in January 2022 and Valneva reported enrollment and vaccination completion in February 2023. VLA1553 or placebo was administered as a single intramuscular immunization to participants who were randomized into two study groups at a 2:1 ratio. The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the adult dose of VLA1553 28 days following a single vaccination. Secondary objectives of the trial include assessment of safety and immunogenicity up to twelve months following a single vaccination with VLA1553. Additional information  including a detailed description of the study design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04650399).About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 203215. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries16. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas17 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 110 countries18. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 202219  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202220 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202221.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA155322. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201923  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.VLA1553 received FDA approval in November 2023 under the brand name IXCHIQ® and is indicated for the prevention of disease caused by CHIKV in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation and accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020 and 2023 respectively.The Company intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Nov. 13  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today provided an update on operational progress and reported financial results for the third quarter of 2023.“Our robust NBTXR3 clinical program continues to demonstrate potentially transformative efficacy and well-tolerated safety across indications and patient types  including elderly and vulnerable populations. We are pleased with the encouraging  expanded potential in locally advanced pancreatic cancer supported by initial Phase 1 data from our strategic collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) presented at this year’s AACR and ESMO annual meetings ” said Laurent Levy  co-founder of Nanobiotix and chairman of the executive board. “Additionally  strong Phase 1 data from Study 102 in locally advanced head and neck cancer demonstrated high and durable activity including a 64% complete response rate  a 16.9 months mPFS and 23.1 months mOS in evaluable patients  which is nearly double the survival reported in historical data. Further  we believe the Study 102 results inform next steps and further strengthen the hypotheses underlying the design of the ongoing global  registrational NANORAY-312 Phase 3 study for NBTXR3.”Laurent Levy continued  “Building on the momentum following our recent global licensing agreement with Janssen  we have raised €50.9 million in capital that includes a public offering and the partial execution of the second equity tranche from Johnson & Johnson Innovation  Inc. With the EIB cash covenant removed  our financial overhang addressed  and our cash runway extended  we are poised to successfully execute through several important catalysts and into the expected timeframe of the NANORAY-312 interim efficacy readout.”Third Quarter 2023 Operational Highlights  Subsequent Events  and Pipeline Status and Upcoming MilestonesNanobiotix announced on July 10  2023  that it had entered into a global exclusive licensing  co-development  and commercialization agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company  for the investigational  potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3.

Adding to this the €19.1 million gross proceeds from the restricted ADSs to be purchased by JJDC in the Concurrent Private Placement  the Company will receive aggregate gross proceeds of approximately €50.9 million (equivalent to approximately $53.8 million  based on an exchange rate of €1.00 = $1.0568  as published by Bloomberg on November 1  2023)  before deduction of underwriting commissions from the Global Offering and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. Following the approval of the French Ministry of Economy and the subscription by JJDC for the Remaining Placement Amount  the aggregate gross proceeds would increase to approximately €55.5 million (equivalent to approximately $58.7 million) and would extend the cash runway to the end of the second quarter of 2025 (assuming the development milestone as above and excluding cash inflows from future non-dilutive or dilutive financing opportunities).Successful Removal of the EIB Cash CovenantAs previously disclosed  the European Investment Bank (the “EIB”) has agreed to the removal of the minimum cash and cash equivalent covenant from the Company’s EIB loan  effective October 13  2023. As result of the financing with gross proceeds of €50.9 million  the company will prepay the EIB approximately €0.5 million (1% of €50.9M) of the €20.0 million milestone payment required under the EIB loan.Conference Call and WebcastNanobiotix will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Tuesday  November 14  2023  at 8:00 am ET / 2:00 pm CET  prior to the open of the U.S. market.

These results compl…,Saint-Herblain (France)  November 13  2023 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported positive pivotal Phase 3 immunogenicity data in adolescents for its single-dose chikungunya virus (CHIKV) vaccine candidate VLA1553. These results complement the initial Phase 3 safety data the Company reported for the trial in August 20231.Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program  and conducted in collaboration with Instituto Butantan  the VLA1553-321 adolescent trial is intended to support label extension in this age group following recent regulatory approval in adults from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States (U.S)2. The trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations. Additionally  the trial is expected to support regulatory approval in Europe and the initial safety data were included in the submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 20233. VLA1553-321 represents the first clinical trial Valneva is conducting in an endemic area and with individuals previously infected with CHIKV.The pivotal immunogenicity data showed that a single-dose vaccination with VLA1553 induced a robust immune response in adolescents aged 12 to <18 years4  confirming the excellent immunogenicity previously observed in adults5.Trial VLA1553-321 met its primary endpoint. VLA1553 induced levels of protective antibody titers6 in 98.8% of participants 28 days after a single vaccination (seroresponse rate7 of 98.8% (95% CI: 96.5  99.8; 247 of 250 baseline seronegative participants from the per-protocol population)  significantly exceeding the FDA’s requirement for study success of the lower bound of the 95%CI for SRR >70%).The vaccine was highly immunogenic with a Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) of 3890 in baseline seronegative participants. Neutralizing antibody GMTs at Day 29 in baseline seronegative participants were similar to GMTs observed in seropositive participants at baseline  indicating that VLA1553 induces levels of antibodies comparable to those in individuals with a history of CHIKV wild type infection.As reported previously  VLA1553 administered as a single-dose was generally well tolerated in adolescents aged 12 to <18 years  irrespective of previous CHIKV infection and showed a similar safety profile as reported in adults8.754 individuals were vaccinated in trial VLA1553-321  and the present analysis includes data up to Day 29 (primary endpoint). An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board has continuously evaluated safety data during the trial and has not identified any safety concerns. The majority of solicited adverse events observed following VLA1553 administration were mild or moderate and resolved within three days. Importantly  the initial data suggest a favorable safety profile in seropositive participants  confirming the observations following re-vaccination of individuals in Phase 1 trial VLA1553-1019.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “These new data in a younger population and in individuals previously infected with the chikungunya virus confirm the robust immunity and safety profile we previously observed in adults and the elderly. Given the significant threat that chikungunya poses to individuals living in or traveling to endemic areas  it is crucial to make the vaccine accessible to all age groups. By doing so  we can enhance the protection and reduce the impact of this debilitating disease.”The recent U.S. FDA approval10 was based on final pivotal Phase 3 data in 4 115 adults aged 18 years and above reported in March 202211  and the Lancet subsequently published these results in June 202312. Final lot-to-lot consistency results were published in May 202213 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202214.About Phase 3 study VLA1553-321VLA1553-321 is a prospective  double-blinded  multicenter  randomized  placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 trial conducted in 754 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old in Brazil. The VLA1553-321 clinical trial was initiated in January 2022 and Valneva reported enrollment and vaccination completion in February 2023. VLA1553 or placebo was administered as a single intramuscular immunization to participants who were randomized into two study groups at a 2:1 ratio. The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the adult dose of VLA1553 28 days following a single vaccination. Secondary objectives of the trial include assessment of safety and immunogenicity up to twelve months following a single vaccination with VLA1553. Additional information  including a detailed description of the study design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04650399).About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 203215. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries16. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas17 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 110 countries18. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 202219  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202220 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202221.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA155322. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201923  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.VLA1553 received FDA approval in November 2023 under the brand name IXCHIQ® and is indicated for the prevention of disease caused by CHIKV in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation and accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020 and 2023 respectively.The Company intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Otovo rents out solar panels and inverters at a fixed mon…,Norway-headquartered Otovo has secured €40mn to expand its rent-to-buy online marketplace for solar panels  as it seeks to cash in on booming demand from homeowners looking to slash their energy bills.Otovo rents out solar panels and inverters at a fixed monthly cost  which includes all repairs and maintenance. It also offers the option to purchase the panels outright.The platform  currently available 13 European countries  uses satellite data and mapping information to calculate how much sunlight a section of your roof receives and the corresponding energy produced  as well as the size  shape  and specification of suitable rooftop solar products. Then it finds the best price and solar installer for the job in your area.Between 2010 and 2020  the price of solar electricity dropped 89% to become the cheapest energy source in history. As gas prices soar  homeowners are increasingly looking to solar panels to increase their energy security  cut costs  and boost the value of their properties. Rooftop solar added 25 GW of capacity in 2022  8 GW more than in 2021  according to industry body SolarPower Europe.But even though solar panels are comparatively cheap  they still present a significant upfront cost. Currently  in the EU it costs roughly € 10 000 for a photovoltaic system capable of catering to the energy needs of a 3-bedroom house. Otovo’s rent-to-buy option looks to flatten this financial barrier.The Oslo-based company now plans to use the fresh funding to ensure its path to reach profitability and to take the number one position in the European residential solar market  it said.“The equity raise allows Otovo to aggressively pursue the opportunities given by an energy market in which the cost of building new solar energy is at an all-time low  traditional energy prices are rising and consumers are looking for ways to cut their expenses ” said Otovo CEO  Andreas Thorsheim.The round was led by existing shareholders Å Energy  Axel Johnson Group  and Nysnø  the Norwegian government’s Climate Investment Fund.This latest raise brings Otovo’s total funding to €231mn  according to Crunchbase data. The company went public in 2021 after listing on the Euronext Growth stock exchange.From the top investors in this latest round  Nordic energy utility Å Energi was allocated shares worth 22.4mn  Axel Johnson Group for €8.7m  and the state climate fund Nysnø for €2.4mn.,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.38,0.26,0.36,True,English,"['solar marketplace', 'Norway', 'Otovo', 'industry body SolarPower Europe', 'Euronext Growth stock exchange', 'suitable rooftop solar products', 'low, traditional energy prices', 'European residential solar market', 'number one position', 'Axel Johnson Group', 'Climate Investment Fund', 'state climate fund', 'cheapest energy source', 'Nordic energy utility', 'fixed monthly cost', 'significant upfront cost', 'The Oslo-based company', 'new solar energy', 'energy market', '13 European countries', 'gas prices', 'solar installer', 'solar electricity', 'energy bills', 'corresponding energy', 'energy security', 'energy needs', 'solar panels', 'online marketplace', 'booming demand', 'satellite data', 'mapping information', 'photovoltaic system', '3-bedroom house', 'financial barrier', 'fresh funding', 'equity raise', 'Andreas Thorsheim', 'existing shareholders', 'Norwegian government', 'latest raise', 'total funding', 'Crunchbase data', 'top investors', 'best price', 'buy option', 'latest round', 'Norway-headquartered Otovo', 'Otovo CEO', 'Å Energy', 'homeowners', 'inverters', 'repairs', 'maintenance', 'platform', 'sunlight', 'section', 'size', 'shape', 'specification', 'job', 'area', 'history', 'costs', 'value', 'properties', '25 GW', 'capacity', 'path', 'profitability', 'opportunities', 'time', 'consumers', 'ways', 'expenses', 'Nysnø', 'listing', 'Å Energi', 'shares']",2023-11-13,2023-11-14,thenextweb.com

Syensqo’s specific targets include:-23% Scope 3 GHG emissions 5 by 2030 compared to 2021by 2030 compared to 2021 Carbon neutrality on Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2040  with -40% Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2021Increasing circular economy sales to 18% of total sales by 2030Aiming for Gender parity across our organization by 2033 for mid and senior managementFinancial advisorsIn relation to the separation  BNP PARIBAS and Morgan Stanley are acting as Financial Advisors and Lead ECM Advisors  Berenberg  Deutsche Bank AG and J.P. Morgan SE are acting as ECM Advisors  Bank Degroof Petercam SA/NV  BofA Securities Europe SA and Société Générale are acting as Co-Advisors. STJ Advisors is acting as Independent Equity Capital Markets Advisor to the Company.DefinitionsCircular economy sales refers to: (i) sales of products increasing durability in the use phase downstream in the value chain; (ii) sales based on recycled or renewable materials and renewable energy (based on costs weighted as described below); and (iii) sales of products enabling recycling at the end of life downstream in the value chain.Focus five categories of Scope 3 GHG emissions (categorized according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol corporate value chain (Scope 3) accounting and reporting standard and the GRI-305 Sustainability Reporting Standard) are (1) purchased goods and services (Category 1)  which include impacts of upstream transportation and distribution (Category 4) and waste generated in operations (Category 5)  (2) fuel- and energy-related activities (Category 3)  (3) processing of sold products (Category 10)  (4) use of sold products (Category 11) and (5) end-of-life treatment of sold products (Category 12).Free Cash Flow is equal to cash flows from operating activities (excluding cash flows linked to acquisitions or disposals of subsidiaries and cash outflows of voluntary pension contributions  as they are deleveraging in nature as a reimbursement of debt and cash flows related to internal management of portfolio such as one-off costs of internal carve-outs and related taxes)  cash flows from investing activities (excluding cash flows from or related to the acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries  and cash flows associated with the partial demerger project) and other investments  and excluding loans to associates and non-consolidated investments  and recognition of factored receivables and increase/decrease of borrowings related to environmental remediation. In addition  because leases are generally considered to be operating in nature  free cash flow incorporates the payment of the lease liability (excluding the interest expense) recorded in cash flow from financing activities in accordance with IFRS 16.Levered (Pre-Capital Expenditures) Cash Flow is defined as Free Cash Flow after payment of net interests  coupons of perpetual hybrid bonds and dividends to non-controlling interests  but before capital expenditures.ROCE is calculated as the ratio between Underlying EBIT (before adjustment for the amortization of purchase price allocation) and capital employed. Capital employed consists of net working capital  tangible and intangible assets  goodwill  rights-of-use assets  investments in associates and joint ventures and other investments  and is taken as the average of the situation at the beginning and at the end of each period. In future periods  ROCE is expected to be calculated in accordance with this definition  subject to potential adjustments to eliminate material distortions associated with the full consolidation of the results of any joint ventures under IFRS.Underlying EBIT is calculated by applying the adjustments to EBIT listed in the Registration Document in Section 9.3  “Alternative Performance Measures.” EBIT is equal to earnings before interest and taxes (which includes the Syensqo group’s share of earnings from associates and joint ventures).Underlying EBITDA Margin is defined as underlying EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Underlying EBITDA is calculated by applying the adjustments to EBITDA listed in the Registration Document in Section 9.3  “Alternative Performance Measures.” EBITDA is equal to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization. It is equal to EBIT (which includes the Syensqo group’s share of earnings from associates and joint ventures)  after adding charges for depreciation  amortization and impairment.__________________________________________________________1 Refers to Levered (Pre-Capital Expenditures) Cash Flow.

The combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS from the consolidated financial statements of Solvay SA. However  they may not be indicative of the future performance of Syensqo and do not necessarily reflect SpecialtyCo’s financial position  results of operations  capital structure and cash flows had it operated as an independent standalone company during such periods. The combined financial statements of SpecialtyCo for the years 2020  2021 and 2022 are included in the Registration Document  and the interim combined financial statements of SpecialtyCo for the six-month period ended June 30  2023 are available on the website of the Company. Information derived from such combined financial statements in this press release is qualified by the detailed information contained therein  including in the notes thereto.Certain financial information for periods prior to 2020 relating to the business units of Solvay that will form part of SpecialtyCo after completion of the Partial Demerger is presented herein for purposes of illustrating indicative trends. However  the financial information for those business units was prepared on a basis that is different from the basis of preparation of the combined financial statements of SpecialtyCo. Accordingly  the trend information presented herein may be different from the trends that would be shown had combined financial statements of SpecialtyCo been prepared for such periods. Investors should not place undue reliance on such trend information.In addition  this press release refers to certain non-GAAP financial measures  or alternative performance measures  used by the Company in analyzing SpecialtyCo’s operating trends  financial performance and financial position and providing investors with additional information considered useful and relevant regarding SpecialtyCo’s results. These non-GAAP financial measures are not recognized measures under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards  and they generally have no standardized meaning and therefore may not be comparable to similarly labeled measures used by other companies. As a result  none of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  SpecialtyCo’s combined financial statements and related notes prepared in accordance with IFRS. For a definition of each non-GAAP financial measure included in this press release and a reconciliation from such non-GAAP financial measure to the relevant line item  subtotal or total in SpecialtyCo’s financial statements  please refer to Section 9.3  “Alternative Performance Measures” of the Registration Document.Certain calculated figures (including data expressed in thousands or millions) and percentages presented in the press release have been rounded. Where applicable  the totals presented in this press release may slightly differ from the totals that would have been obtained by adding the exact amounts (not rounded) for these calculated figures.DisclaimerThis press release is for informational purposes only and is not intended to  and does not  constitute an offer or invitation to sell or solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy  or an invitation to purchase or subscribe for  any securities of the Company or Solvay  any part of the business or assets described herein  or any other interests or the solicitation of any vote or approval in any jurisdiction in connection with the transactions described herein or otherwise  nor shall there be any sale  issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law.

""Regarding our clinical plan  we obtained valuable feedback from the FDA confirming the value of our main asset  anti-S. aureus Phages  for a development in the United States. We plan to design a global consolidated development plan once we get the EMA scientific advice feedback in the coming weeks. In parallel  the enrolment of the first patient in our Phase 1 endocarditis infections study  expected around the end of the year  will be another major step forward for PHAXIAM in its strategic positioning to target indications of very high clinical value.""BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSa)Confirmed strategic focus on Phage Therapy in high-value indicationsPHAXIAM has been refocusing its clinical development programs in indications of high medical needs  for patients with severe resistant infections  often associated with high mortality and budget impact. This quarter's clinical progress of PHAXIAM's key therapeutic programs  particularly with its lead program targeting resistant S. aureus infections  confirms the Company's advanced positioning in phage therapy.b)Significant progress in the Clinical and Regulatory strategyS. Aureus programWith its lead S. aureus program  PHAXIAM pursues the ambition to propose a therapeutic solution to patients who failed traditional antimicrobial treatments in complex mono-bacterial S. aureus infections in several high-value indications  starting with Prosthetic Joint Infections and Endocarditis Infections.Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI)Leveraging on promising activity signals from real-life compassionate treatments  PHAXIAM is preparing the initiation of a global (EU/US) study for PJI patients having an open-surgery debridement (DAIR) in combination with antibiotics.PHAXIAM received feedback from FDA on the next steps for its clinical development plan in PJI  with the following key points:Confirmation of the value of a clinical development in this indication  Confirmation that PHAXIAM's non-clinical data and CMC capabilities support a formal clinical development plan in the US  FDA provided PHAXIAM with clear guidelines for a Phase 2 study in the US.A Scientific Advice meeting with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to take place in January 2024 and its outcomes  combined with the recommendations from the FDA  will be the basis to design PHAXIAM's future global (EU/US) clinical plan in PJI.Endocarditis Infections (EI)PHAXIAM is preparing the launch of a phase 1 trial (PK data) in Endocarditis Infections caused by S. aureus  to evaluate intravenous administration of phages for EI. The results  if positive  could allow PHAXIAM to use this administration route for other indications.In October  PHAXIAM obtained approvals from the French ANSM and South-East II-Lyon Ethics Committee to launch the study that should enroll 12 patients requiring replacement of an infected heart valve.The enrollment is targeted to start by the end of 2023 and the first study results are expected in mid-2024.Robust real-life activity data from compassionate treatmentsIn June 2022  the ANSM granted PHAXIAM an AAC (Autorisation d'Accès Compassionnel - early access program) and to date  more than 90 patients have been treated under the compassionate/AAC status. Data from the first 77 PJI patients evaluated so far show promising clinical data for infection control at 3 months  considered as a significant improvement over standard of care in this hard-to-treat patient population with severe resistant infections.The Company has applied for a second AAC regulatory validation for PJI patients  associated with P. aeruginosa resistance.c)Confirmed efficiency of Phagogram  PHAXIAM's proprietary platform to assess phage activityPhagogram is an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test designed to determine the in-vitro activity of PHAXIAM's phages to patients' bacterial strains. It is the first CE-marked IVD test dedicated to phage activity evaluation.In October 2023  the Company announced that the data obtained from Phagogram showed 98% response rate over 105 clinical S. aureus strains  showing the highest spectrum of activity of the anti-S. aureus phages among other competing solutions.These data clearly demonstrate the efficiency of PHAXIAM's phagogram for the current and upcoming clinical developments. It also proves how it is a unique asset for the development of other phages in PHAXIAM's portfolio.d)Preclinical research programs initiated to reinforce PHAXIAM's phage therapy platformPHAXIAM launched several strategic research programs to reinforce its current clinical programs and prepare future developments  including with the extension of the current phage bank for E. coli and P. aeruginosa to increase resistant infections coverage and the demonstration of a Pre-clinical POC for Endolysins.On September 19  2023  the Company announced the extension of its portfolio to Klebsiella pneumoniae  a new resistant aggressive bacterial target  very complementary to the first 3 pathogens (S. aureus  P. aeruginosa  E. coli)A strategic research program  PhageBac  targeting Bacteremia  has been initiated. Currently at preclinical stage  this program is aiming at controlling blood infection and the risk of secondary infection with mono-bacterial infection due to S. aureus  P. aeruginosa  or E. coli.In October 2023  PHAXIAM concluded a strategic research partnership with Vetophage  a biotechnology company specialized in veterinary phage therapy  to combine expertise in the research of new phages and phage endolysins. This agreement provides PHAXIAM with exclusive licensing options on specified phages and endolysins from the Vetophage platform  to further strengthen its product portfolio in human health.Q3 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS (unaudited)Key financial figures for the first nine months of 2023 compared with the same period of the previous year are summarized below. In the context of the Erytech-Pherecydes merger  PHAXIAM's consolidated financial statements in IFRS standards include ex-Pherecydes financial results as from the date of the merger  i.e. June 23  2023.

""Regarding our clinical plan  we obtained valuable feedback from the FDA confirming the value of our main asset  anti-S. aureus Phages  for a development in the United States. We plan to design a global consolidated development plan once we get the EMA scientific advice feedback in the coming weeks. In parallel  the enrolment of the first patient in our Phase 1 endocarditis infections study  expected around the end of the year  will be another major step forward for PHAXIAM in its strategic positioning to target indications of very high clinical value.""BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSa) Confirmed strategic focus on Phage Therapy in high-value indicationsPHAXIAM has been refocusing its clinical development programs in indications of high medical needs  for patients with severe resistant infections  often associated with high mortality and budget impact. This quarter's clinical progress of PHAXIAM's key therapeutic programs  particularly with its lead program targeting resistant S. aureus infections  confirms the Company's advanced positioning in phage therapy.b) Significant progress in the Clinical and Regulatory strategyS. Aureus programWith its lead S. aureus program  PHAXIAM pursues the ambition to propose a therapeutic solution to patients who failed traditional antimicrobial treatments in complex mono-bacterial S. aureus infections in several high-value indications  starting with Prosthetic Joint Infections and Endocarditis Infections.Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI)Leveraging on promising activity signals from real-life compassionate treatments  PHAXIAM is preparing the initiation of a global (EU/US) study for PJI patients having an open-surgery debridement (DAIR) in combination with antibiotics.PHAXIAM received feedback from FDA on the next steps for its clinical development plan in PJI  with the following key points:Confirmation of the value of a clinical development in this indication  Confirmation that PHAXIAM's non-clinical data and CMC capabilities support a formal clinical development plan in the US  FDA provided PHAXIAM with clear guidelines for a Phase 2 study in the US.A Scientific Advice meeting with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to take place in January 2024 and its outcomes  combined with the recommendations from the FDA  will be the basis to design PHAXIAM's future global (EU/US) clinical plan in PJI.Endocarditis Infections (EI)PHAXIAM is preparing the launch of a phase 1 trial (PK data) in Endocarditis Infections caused by S. aureus  to evaluate intravenous administration of phages for EI. The results  if positive  could allow PHAXIAM to use this administration route for other indications.In October  PHAXIAM obtained approvals from the French ANSM and South-East II-Lyon Ethics Committee to launch the study that should enroll 12 patients requiring replacement of an infected heart valve.The enrollment is targeted to start by the end of 2023 and the first study results are expected in mid-2024.Robust real-life activity data from compassionate treatmentsIn June 2022  the ANSM granted PHAXIAM an AAC (Autorisation d'Accès Compassionnel – early access program) and to date  more than 90 patients have been treated under the compassionate/AAC status. Data from the first 77 PJI patients evaluated so far show promising clinical data for infection control at 3 months  considered as a significant improvement over standard of care in this hard-to-treat patient population with severe resistant infections.The Company has applied for a second AAC regulatory validation for PJI patients  associated with P. aeruginosa resistance.Loading... Loading... Loading...c) Confirmed efficiency of Phagogram  PHAXIAM's proprietary platform to assess phage activityPhagogram is an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test designed to determine the in-vitro activity of PHAXIAM's phages to patients' bacterial strains. It is the first CE-marked IVD test dedicated to phage activity evaluation.In October 2023  the Company announced that the data obtained from Phagogram showed 98% response rate over 105 clinical S. aureus strains  showing the highest spectrum of activity of the anti-S. aureus phages among other competing solutions.These data clearly demonstrate the efficiency of PHAXIAM's phagogram for the current and upcoming clinical developments. It also proves how it is a unique asset for the development of other phages in PHAXIAM's portfolio.d) Preclinical research programs initiated to reinforce PHAXIAM's phage therapy platformPHAXIAM launched several strategic research programs to reinforce its current clinical programs and prepare future developments  including with the extension of the current phage bank for E. coli and P. aeruginosa to increase resistant infections coverage and the demonstration of a Pre-clinical POC for Endolysins.On September 19  2023  the Company announced the extension of its portfolio to Klebsiella pneumoniae  a new resistant aggressive bacterial target  very complementary to the first 3 pathogens (S. aureus  P. aeruginosa  E. coli)A strategic research program  PhageBac  targeting Bacteremia  has been initiated. Currently at preclinical stage  this program is aiming at controlling blood infection and the risk of secondary infection with mono-bacterial infection due to S. aureus  P. aeruginosa  or E. coli.In October 2023  PHAXIAM concluded a strategic research partnership with Vetophage  a biotechnology company specialized in veterinary phage therapy  to combine expertise in the research of new phages and phage endolysins. This agreement provides PHAXIAM with exclusive licensing options on specified phages and endolysins from the Vetophage platform  to further strengthen its product portfolio in human health.Q3 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS (unaudited)Key financial figures for the first nine months of 2023 compared with the same period of the previous year are summarized below.
