There are cypherpunks  “degens ” and the rabid online faithful who say tokens named after a cartoon frog are going to the “moon.”However  the boring suits and ties of traditional finance are increasingly grabbing a slice of the crypto pie  and on Monday  Fnality International  a startup that hopes to use blockchain tech to transfer cash between financial institutions  announced that it had raised approximately $95 million in a Series B round led by Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas. The U.K.-based firm has now raised about $163 million since it launched in 2019.Other participants in the Series B include BNY Mellon  Barclays  Nasdaq Ventures  UBS  Banco Santander  DTCC  Euroclear  Nomura  and WisdomTree.

Optimism for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF  a financial vehicle that would open the world’s largest cryptocurrency to potentially trillions in capital from traditional investors  has reached a fevered pitch. And JPMorgan  run by the famously anti–Bitcoin Jamie Dimon  has continued to explore blockchain technology  including JPM Coin  its private token.Ram  Fnality’s CEO  spent more than two decades at Deustche Bank and retired in 2016. But in 2017  he agreed to lead a research project backed by 16 financial institutions  including Credit Suisse  UBS  and Deutsche Bank  to assess the validity of using blockchain technology to send and receive cash. And in 2019  buoyed by results from the research  the institutions backed and helped launch Fnality International.“The thesis for us and many of our investors and participants is there are a lot of innovations within that crypto/DeFi space that really are going to make a massive difference to finance overall ” Ram told Fortune  referring to decentralized finance. “The question is  how do you pull them into a regulated environment?Since then  Fnality has built out a private blockchain network  modeled after Ethereum  that allows banks to transfer money 24 hours a day. The network isn’t live yet  but Ram says a full launch is “imminent” for the U.K.  and from there  the U.S. and beyond. “We see ourselves as ultimately a convergence of traditional finance and the methodologies of the DeFi space  for lack of a better word ” he said.,neutral,0.04,0.95,0.01,mixed,0.14,0.34,0.52,True,English,"['$100 million funding round', 'Goldman Sachs', 'BNP Paribas', 'Fnality International', 'The U.K.-based firm', 'anti–Bitcoin Jamie Dimon', 'declining venture capital interest', 'spot Bitcoin ETF', 'rabid online faithful', 'potential use cases', 'central bank funds', 'Series B round', 'private blockchain network', 'U.S.', 'private token', 'Deustche Bank', 'Deutsche Bank', 'cartoon frog', 'boring suits', 'traditional finance', 'blockchain tech', 'Goldman Sachs', 'BNP Paribas', 'BNY Mellon', 'Nasdaq Ventures', 'Banco Santander', 'resilient way', 'wide set', 'Mathew McDermott', 'global head', 'digital assets', 'Wall Street', 'bigger mover', 'financial vehicle', 'largest cryptocurrency', 'fevered pitch', 'JPM Coin', 'two decades', 'Credit Suisse', 'crypto/DeFi space', 'massive difference', 'decentralized finance', 'regulated environment', 'full launch', 'crypto industry', 'crypto pie', 'financial institutions', 'Other participants', 'traditional investors', 'Fnality International', 'Rhomaios Ram', 'cypherpunks', 'degens', 'tokens', 'moon', 'ties', 'slice', 'Monday', 'startup', 'cash', 'Barclays', 'UBS', 'DTCC', 'Euroclear', 'Nomura', 'WisdomTree', 'CEO', 'updated', 'valuation', 'application', 'statement', 'year', 'fundraise', 'shakers', 'Optimism', 'approval', 'world', 'trillions', 'JPMorgan', 'research', 'validity', 'results', 'thesis', 'lot', 'innovations', 'Fortune', 'question', 'Ethereum', 'banks', 'money', 'convergence', 'methodologies', 'lack', 'word']",2023-11-13,2023-11-15,fortune.com

32704,Euroclear,Bing API,https://indianexpress.com/article/express-exclusive/cracking-cyprus-confidential-eu-state-gave-investors-tax-haven-secrecy-and-a-golden-passport-9026642/,Cracking Cyprus Confidential: EU state gave investors tax haven  secrecy – and a golden passport,Another veil lifts on offshore money flows involving Russian oligarchs  Syrian warlords and global investors including Indian corporates.,Offshore Leaks (2013)  HSBC Swiss Leaks (2015)  Panama Papers (2016)  Paradise Papers (2017)  Pandora Papers (2021) and now Cyprus Confidential.Even as governments worldwide scramble to plug regulatory holes  money flows of the global elite  from Russian oligarchs to Syrian warlords  UK football clubs to Indian investors  continue to pour into tax havens — the latest revelations come from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus that has earned the reputation of a shady financial hub washing dirty money.Six financial service providers based on this island and a Latvian agency with an office in Cyprus have yielded a trove of over 3.6 million records that form the subject of the latest in the series of investigations by The Indian Express  in collaboration with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)  into offshore tax havens.AdvertisementOver eight months  The Indian Express analysed more than 20 000 documents — the India connection in the project — from the data trove comprising 3.6 million records. Dating from the mid-1990s to mid-2022  these include confidential background checks  organisational charts  financial statements  bank account applications  and email messages.Along with this newspaper  there are more than 60 media partners including Munich-based investigative newsroom Paper Trail Media  The Guardian  Washington Post and The Asahi Shimbun  working on this ICIJ investigation.The investigation lifted the wraps on a complex maze of investments made by prominent Indian businessmen in Cyprus who cashed in on its range of benefits: from preferential — and loosely controlled — tax rates to tax exemptions on income and gains of offshore trusts; zero estate duty  no trust registration requirements and the promise of beneficial owner secrecy.What the investigation found | Vinod Adani  Pankaj Oswal among 66 Indians who got golden passportThat’s not all  many of the investors (see adjacent story) also procured Cypriot passports under the country’s now-withdrawn golden passport investment scheme which ran from 2007 to 2020 – passports that  in return for an investment of 2 million Euros (the figure for 2016)  gave them freedom of movement and another protective and  of course  secretive shield for their investments in that country.AdvertisementResponding to ICIJ  the office of the Cyprus Presidency said Cyprus can be placed in the top quartile internationally on the implementation of the international standards as depicted in the FATF consolidated list of assessment ratings. Russian deposits in the banking sector stand at only about 4 per cent at the end of 2021 and thus the relevant direct risks have been contained. “I would like to stress that our government is unequivocally committed to fighting corruption and illicit finance and take all necessary actions to ensure full implementation of EU Sanctions ” Konstantinos Letymbiotis  a spokesperson for the Cyprus government  said in a statement.“More specifically  as a result of the restrictive measures around 1.1 billion Euros have been reported as frozen by CY investment firms and funds related to financial instruments. A large proportion of these funds are under the custody of EU financial institutions  the vast majority with Euroclear ” the spokesperson said.For the Cyprus Confidential project  over 270 investigative reporters looked into records from six financial service providers: ConnectedSky  Cypcodirect  DJC Accountants  Kallias & Associates  MeritKapital and MeritServus. The Latvian company  Dataset SIA  maintains a website  i-Cyprus  through which it sells information about Cyprus companies  including Cyprus corporate registry documents.AdvertisementThe MeritServus and MeritKapital records were obtained by Distributed Denial of Secrets. Leaked records from Cypcodirect  ConnectedSky  i-Cyprus and Kallias & Associates  were obtained by Paper Trail Media. In the case of Kallias & Associates  the documents were obtained from Distributed Denial of Secrets  which shared them with Paper Trail Media and ICIJ. DJC Accountants’ records were obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). The partner organisations shared all leaked records in the project with ICIJ  which structured  stored and translated them from several languages before sharing them with the reporting partners  including The Indian Express.Taken together  the project’s 3.6 million documents – despite representing a small fraction of Cyprus’s offshore industry records – reveal how Cyprus  despite being a EU member state  has become a massive financial hub for Russian oligarchs. The documents also provide a glimpse into the oligarchs’ lavish lifestyle – their super yachts  their priceless art collections of Matisse  Monet and Lucien Freud  and their private concerts featuring Amy Winehouse  Red Hot Chili Peppers and other famous rock stars.The ICIJ-led investigation reveals how the EU-member state plays an even bigger role than was commonly known in moving dirty money for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s autocratic regime and other dictators and anti-democratic actors.Among them: Syria’s rulers  whose state-owned oil company attempted to evade the United States ban on doing business with it by using an intermediary on the island to disguise requests to purchase products from a Houston oil equipment supplier; and Kremlin operatives who channeled payments through Cyprus to a prominent German journalist known for producing fawning coverage of Russia’s autocratic leader.The Russian money flow was a bonanza for Cyprus’s powerful industry of bankers  offshore service providers  accounting firms like PwC and other Big Four firms  and an army of 4 000 lawyers — all deeply intertwined with a Cypriot political class that erected some of Europe’s most stringent corporate secrecy and turned the Central Bank of Cyprus into a protector of the system rather than its regulator.AdvertisementHere  in India  Cyprus Confidential is expected to prompt regulatory and investigative agencies to lift one more veil as they have done with each of the earlier global investigations in which they have detected sizeable tax avoidance and evasion.Indeed  while announcing its probe into the Pandora Papers leak in October 2021  the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) disclosed that Rs 20 352 crore of “undisclosed credits” had  till then  been detected by tax sleuths following the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers (2017) leaks.(With Neil Weinberg  ICIJ)Advertisement– Don’t miss out on the latest stories in this investigation.

The EBIT for the quarter was positive of 3.0 million EUR  resulting in an EBIT/kg harvest of EUR 0.73.

Unsurprisingly  the second quarter of the 2023-2024 financial year confirms the slowdown in growth. The macroeconomic context continues to darken. We must rely on the Group’s strengths to take advantage of all the opportunities that our teams  whose performance I applaud  will encounter over the coming months.”In €m1st half (to September 30) 2022-2023 2023-2024 Change Organicchange* First quarter revenue 238.45 269.32 +12.9% +10.1% Second quarter revenue 238.75 269.03 +12.8% +8.0% Six month revenue 477.20 538.35 +12.8% +9.5% of which: France 199.18 214.36 +7.6% +3.4% of which: International 278.02 323.99 +16.5% +13.8%* excluding external growth and exchange rate effects (exchange rate 2022-2023 applied to 2023-2024 revenue)The SII Group  a specialist in engineering businesses  posted revenue of €538.1 million for the first half of the 2023-2024 financial year  up 12.8% despite three fewer working days. The second quarter saw growth of 12.8% to €269.0 million. With the exception of Germany and the UK  all countries are experiencing a slowdown. Against this backdrop  we would like to highlight the performance of all our teams.Stable growth in FranceIn France  the SII group registered revenues of €100.5 million over this second quarter of the 2023-2024 financial year  representing stable organic growth for the past three quarters.Overall  for the entire half-year  total revenue of €214.4 million was generated in France  up 7.6% (including 3.4% of a like-for-like basis).The AREH (Activity Rate Excluding HStronger international growthInternationally  the SII group recorded quarterly revenue of €164.0 million  up 15.8% (of which 11.1% on a like-for-like basis) compared with the second quarter of the previous financial year. A number of countries continued to report strong quarterly organic growth: Poland (+9%)  Germany (+42%)  Romania (+30%) and the Czech Republic (+47%).For the first half  international sales increased by 16.5% to €324.0 million (13.8% on a like-for-like basis).The various activity rates are holding up well and should enable us to maintain a satisfactory operating profit rate.OutlookRevenues in the first semester are in line with the targets set at the start of the year. Given the lower level of activity rate in the first half of the year  the operating margin should be at the lower end of the announced range  i.e. close to 9%. Looking beyond the first half of the year  the limited visibility means that we have to look ahead quarter by quarter. Our objective for the third quarter of the 2023-2024 financial year is to achieve sales growth of between 7% and 10%.***Next financial announcement:Fiscal 2023-2024 half-year financial results  Tuesday  November 29  2023  after the close of trading-Contacts:SII - Eric Matteucci: +33(0)142 848 222-Receive all of our communications by subscribing on our website: www.sii-group.comEuronext Paris Compartment BLEI: 96950044FWV7YEJCKR65ATTACHEMENT: Revenue by quarterIn €mQ12023-2024 Q22023-2024 H12023-2024 France 109.36 105.00 214.36 Changeof which: organic growth* +7.3%+3.3% +8.0%+3.5% +7.6%+3.4% International operations 159.96 164.03 323.99 Changeof which: organic growth* +17.1%+15.2% +15.9%+11.1% +16.5%+13.8% SII Group Total 269.32 269.03 538.35 Changeof which: organic growth* +12.9%+10.1% +12.8%+8.0% +12.8%+9.5%*: excluding external growth and exchange rate effects (exchange rate 2022-2023 applied to 2023-2024 revenue)About SIIFounded in 1979 by qualified engineer Bernard Huvé  the SII Group’s activity is balanced between engineering and technology consulting (ETC) and digital services (DSC).The SII Group provides employment for more than 16 000 people  structured in a way that offers all the responsiveness and flexibility of a local service.

Using the prosthetic central vision provided by PRIMA  patients reliably recognized letters and sequences of letters with a clinically meaningful improvement in visual acuity of up to eight lines. The data currently undergoing journal peer review are available here.In the beginning of Q2 2024 Pixium is expecting to report the full data readout from PRIMAvera  its European pivotal study  an open-label  baseline controlled  non-randomized  multi-center  prospective single-arm pivotal trial which has enrolled 38 patients (NCT04676854).“One of the major visual disabilities for patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and geographic atrophy is the gradual decline and then a permanent loss of reading ability within the central field ” commented Professor Frank Holz  Scientific Coordinator of the study  “Unlike the current and potential pharmacological treatments for geographic atrophy  which aim to slow the growth of atrophic lesions without functional improvement in visual acuity  the PRIMA study results demonstrate restoration of central vision in the former scotoma. At the 4-year time-point  the mean gain was 32 letters  which corresponds to an improvement of logMAR 0.6 (six lines) and should be considered clinically meaningful for patients with geographic atrophy with foveal involvement secondary to AMD.”“We are delighted that thanks to our PRIMAvera pivotal study  19 leading European retinal surgery sites have been trained in the minimally invasive procedure to implant our 2x2 mm photovoltaic sub-retinal microchip in under 2 hours” stressed Ralf Hornig  PhD Director of Clinical Affairs“Further improvements of the AR glasses will widen the visual field  while the advanced image processing and stimulation protocol promise even more functional restoration of sight for patients suffering from atrophic macular degeneration no longer treatable with Pegcetacoplan injections” predicted Daniel Palanker  the Department of Ophthalmology and Hansen Experimental Physics Laboratory at Stanford University CA USA  who is leading the engineering development of Pixium’s next generation chip.The PRIMA retinal prosthesis includes a microchip  which is self-sustaining and needs no wires for external power supply  inserted under the fovea (central part of the retina). Each pixel of the implant (of which there are 378) independently converts light projected from transparent augmented-reality (AR) glasses into electric current stimulating the inner retinal cells  restoring vision in patients’ central blind spot. The retinal photovoltaic neurostimulation microchip is just 2-mm wide and 30-μm thick  carrying 378 electrodes of just 100 μm (1 μm = one millionth of a meter) in diameter.As a reminder  the Company is currently subject to receivership proceedings and is actively looking for buyers to acquire the Company’s business. In that context  the Company draws investors’ attention to the possibility that  in the event of a court-ordered plan to sell off all or part of the Company’s assets  the price offered may not allow shareholders to be reimbursed in full or in part.The deadline for submission of offers has been set to November 20  2023  at 12:00 p.m. (noon) CET.Pixium will continue to regularly inform the market on the progress of the procedure and  more generally  of Pixium Vision’s financial situation.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

KBRA Europe and DBRS Morningstar have assigned an indicative financial rating of BBB+ and BBB respectivily for the proposed structure. The new financing is expected to close by December 31  2023  subject to an agreement on the final documentation and the satisfaction of usual conditions.Construction work on the LDLC Arena  100% owned by OL Groupe  is nearing completion. The venue is due to open on November 23  with a full program already on offer  including 11 LDLC Asvel Euroleague basketball matches  as well as numerous shows and events: LDLC Arena programming.As announced on October 25[4]  the Groupama Stadium has a rich program for the coming months  including some major concerts: Taylor Swift (June 2 & 3  2024)  Rammstein (June 15  2024)  Coldplay (June 22  23 & 25  2024) as well as sporting events: the France/England rugby match (March 16  2024 - 6 Nations Tournament)  a French football team match (March 2024)  11 football matches (men's and women's) as part of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games (July and August 2024)  the opening and closing ceremonies of WorldSkills Lyon 2024 at Groupama Stadium and LDLC Arena (September 2024)  as well as the TOP 14 semi-finals (June 2025).On the sporting front  after a difficult start to the 23/24 season  the club is determined to do everything it can to improve its performance in the short term and move closer to the top of the French Ligue 1 league table. The club's ambition for the future remains recurrent participation in the European Cup.The operation announced last May by OL Groupe and Michele Kang to create a global multi-team structure dedicated to women's football should be completed shortly  subject to satisfaction of the final conditions precedent. At the end of this transaction  the OL Group should hold 48%[5] of the share capital of a new company  to which the Olympique Lyonnais women's team and the Washington Spirit (NWSL team) will have been contributed. The new organization aims to acquire additional women's clubs in other countries.Given the Group's and Michele Kang's future indirect stakes in OL Reign and Washington Spirit  both of which play in the American women's NWSL  OL Groupe is working on the disposal of its stake in OL Reign (NWSL 2023 finalist against Gotham FC) in order to eliminate any future conflict of interest within the NWSL and annual operating losses from this entity. A competitive auction process has been launched to identify a potential buyer for OL Reign.3/ STRATEGIC OBJECTIVESThe Group's strategic objectives remain unchanged from those announced on October 25  2023:the Group intends to refocus on its men's football and to divest all or part of certain non-core assets  the proceeds from the sale of which could be used to invest in the training and development of young players and reduce the Group's debt.OL Groupe is considering the possibility of listing its shares (or those of a holding company belonging to the Eagle group) in the United States on the New York Stock Exchange. Such a listing  if carried out  could be announced in the first half of 2024.In view of the redefinition of the Group's strategy  including the planned acquisitions and disposals of assets and the forthcoming refinancing  OL Groupe will communicate its longer-term objectives at a later date.Tel: +33 4 81 07 55 00Fax: +33 4 81 07 45 65Email : investisseurs@ol.frwww.ol.frEuronext Paris - compartment CIndices: CAC All-Share - CAC Consumer DiscretionaryISIN code: FR0010428771Reuters : OLG.PABloomberg: OLG FPICB : 40501030 Leisure services[1] Alternative Performance Indicator (API) - Total operating income includes income from non-trading activities and income from the sale of player contracts.[2] Reminder: Following the creation of the LFP's commercial subsidiary and the investment fund CVC Capital Partners' acquisition of a stake in the said subsidiary in July 2022 (€1.5 billion for 13%)  the L1 and L2 colleges and the LFP Board of Directors voted to distribute €1.13 billion to the clubs (split over several financial years)  including a total allocation of €90 million to be received by Olympique Lyonnais.[3] Read the press release dated 8 November 2023: https://www.actusnews.com/documents_communiques/ACTUS-0-82831-231108-olg-cp-point-refinancement-en.pdf .[4] Read the 2022/23 annual results press release dated 25 October 2023: https://www.actusnews.com/fr/ol-groupe/cp/2023/10/25/annual-results-for-the-financial-year-2022-23.[5] Without any voting rights.This publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: x2dsYJRnZZeanG1wYZlpZ5SWmWeVm2LHbJaVlpadlMiZmZuUlJySmcaVZnFjnmdr- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Quarterly financial reporting:- First quarter financial report Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/82925-olg-141123-ca-t1-23-24-en.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2023 ActusNews",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,negative,0.01,0.31,0.67,True,English,"['Olympique Lyonnais Groupe', 'First-quarter', 'revenue', 'November', '02:40', '11 LDLC Asvel Euroleague basketball matches', 'Red Hot Chili Peppers', 'leading global financial institutions', 'unfavorable provisional Ligue 1 ranking', 'AVERAGE MATCH DAY REVENUE', '3 Rugby World Cup matches', 'French football team match', 'France/England rugby match', 'LFP TV rights revenues', 'indicative financial rating', 'Karl TOKO EKAMBI', 'first two payments', 'Olympique Lyonnais SASU', 'Paris 2024 Olympic Games', '2022/23 financial year', 'First-quarter 2023/24 revenue', 'LDLC Arena programming', 'EXCLUDING PLAYER TRADING', 'CVC Capital Partners', 'LFP-FFF TV rights', 'The Groupama Stadium', '1/ TOTAL REVENUE', 'other brand-related revenue', 'UEFA media rights', 'Domestic ticketing revenues', 'French Ligue', '11 football matches', '3 Ligue 1 matches', 'other matches', 'MARKETING RIGHTS', 'previous year', 'TRADING PLAYERS', 'Trading activity', 'stadium tours', 'European competitions', 'derivatives products', 'PLAYERS REGISTRATIONS', 'unaudited figures', 'initial payment', '1st tranche', 'one-off impact', 'LFP/CVC transaction', 'lower number', '1st quarter', 'Bradley BARCOLA', 'Castello LUKEBA', 'Romain FAIVRE', 'Thiago MENDES', 'Al Rayyan', 'Abdoulaye NDIAYE', 'Abha FC', 'Habib KEITA', 'Akhmat Grozny', 'player contracts', 'final instalment', 'forthcoming transactions', 'substantial majority', 'long-term basis', 'KBRA Europe', 'DBRS Morningstar', 'new financing', 'final documentation', 'usual conditions', 'Construction work', 'OL Groupe', 'full program', 'numerous shows', 'rich program', 'major concerts', 'Taylor Swift', '6 Nations Tournament', 'closing ceremonies', 'TOP 14 semi-finals', 'sporting front', 'TOTAL REVENUE1', 'commercial subsidiary', 'July 1er', 'preliminary agreement', 'WorldSkills Lyon', 'major events', 'RECENT EVENTS', 'sporting events', 'coming months', '€M Var', 'M€', '2 contracts', '3 months', '22% INCREASE', '7% INCREASE', '14% INCREASE', 'SPECTATOR', 'November', 'September', 'SPONSORING', 'ADVERTISING', 'seminars', 'SALE', 'Q1', 'income', 'acquisition', 'stake', 'N-1', 'amount', 'investment', 'PSG', 'Leipzig', 'Bournemouth', 'Troyes', 'Clermont', 'CAMILO', '2 loans', 'incentives', 'OUTLOOK', '3ème', 'completion', 'debt', 'BBB+', 'structure', 'December', 'satisfaction', 'offer', 'October', 'June', 'Rammstein', 'Coldplay', 'March', 'women', 'August', 'opening', '1.1', '30']",2023-11-14,2023-11-15,marketscreener.com

In a significantly disrupted economic and geopolitical context  the performances recorded confirm the Group's full-year targets for double-digit growth. This has further strengthened the Group's commitment to building a sustainable growth model.FIRST-HALF KEY DEVELOPMENTS__________GECI International recorded consolidated revenues of €11.55m during the first half of FY 2023-24  up +17.9% from the previous year (+18.7% at constant exchange rates).The continued trend for strong organic growth is supported primarily by the sustained progress with the telecoms activities  building on the transformation of major contracts in Brazil  and the resilience of the high performance computing (HPC) and financial IT activities despite the slowdown in demand.At September 30  2023  the breakdown of the Group's consolidated revenues was as follows: 59.3% in France and 40.7% in Brazil. This reflects a negative exchange effect in Brazil for €0.08m  representing 0.7% of revenues  taking into account the change in the Brazilian real against the euro during the first half of this year.At end-September 2023  the Group had a total of 504 employees  compared with 442 at end-September 2022 and 530 at end-March 2023. This change is linked primarily to the deployment of various framework agreements in Brazil.During the first half of this year  the Group continued moving forward with its policy to develop international alliances  focused in particular on human resources  commercial aspects and technologies.CHANGE IN REVENUES FOR EACH BUSINESS LINE AND REGION__________(currently being audited) Apr 2023 to Sep 2023(6 months) Apr 2022 to Sep 2022(6 months) Change €m % of rev €m % of rev (%) Business division Technologies 6.36 55.1% 3.86 39.4% + 64.9% Digital 5.19 44.9% 5.94 60.6% - 12.7% Half-year revenues 11.55 100% 9.80 100% +17.9% Region France 6.85 59.3% 7.48 76.3% - 8.4% Brazil 4.70 40.7% 2.30 23.5% + 104.5% Israel 0.00 0.0% 0.03 0.3% ns Half-year revenues 11.55 100% 9.80 100% +17.9%The Technology division (€6.4m  representing 55.1% of half-year revenues) is up +64.9% from the previous year. This performance is linked mainly to the ramping up of the Brazilian subsidiary's business development (+108.0% at constant exchange rates) with the rollout of major contracts signed in previous years in the telecoms sector. In France  the division is able to confirm the upturn in the Telecoms business (+3.7%) and the emergence of the Engineering activities (+31.1%).The Digital division (€5.2m  representing 44.9% of half-year revenues) is down -12.7% compared with the first half of the previous year. This change primarily reflects the contraction in IT Outsourcing activities over the period (-42.8%)  while the HPC and Finance activities remained stable overall in relation to the high bases for comparison from the first half of the previous year.FINANCIAL POSITION__________The Group has continued to further strengthen its financial position by:reinforcing its presence alongside its main contracting authorities with a range of stronger value-added solutions  notably reflected in strong revenue growth for the Technologies division and the resilience of the Digital division's revenues in a more difficult economic environment; continuing to increase the average daily billing rate in France (+12% between April 2023 and October 2023).The Group's net financial debt totaled €6.4m at end-September 2023 (figures currently being audited)  including €0.6m of financial debt (including overdrafts)  €1.7m for the factoring advance  €0.4m for the ORNAN bond and convertible bond debt  €0.5m for the restatement of lease charges  €3.4m of debt linked to the Eolen Group's acquisition (put and vendor loan)  €0.1m for a partner current account and €0.4m of cash.Net financial debt is therefore down €0.3m or -4.6% compared with March 2023 (€6.6m). The partner current account concerns the leading shareholder XLP Holding  which contributed €0.2m in August 2022 to support the Group's development strategy.During the first half of FY 2023-24  the Group raised €0.25m gross through the conversion of 25 ORNAN bonds[1]. This refinancing enabled the Group to repay part of its debt and further strengthen its equity at end-September 2023  through capital increases for the same amount.OUTLOOK__________The revenue growth  the continued strengthening of the financial position and the expected improvement in profitability confirm the relevance of the Group's strategy and its ability to maintain sustainable growth.For the current financial year  considering the trends observed  the Group is forecasting double-digit growth in its full-year revenues.In a disruptive environment driven by the new challenges relating to the digital  ecological and energy transformation of organizations and businesses  GECI International is continuing to move forward with its innovation strategy with a view to increasing the convergence of its two business divisions and ramping up its positions on strong value-added markets: telecommunications  transport  renewable energies and IT.Alongside this  the Group is moving forward with the diversification of its business model  capitalizing on technological alliances and commercial partnerships  especially in France and Brazil  to market smart solutions with strong potential  focusing in particular on the smart city market (smart cities and related systems such as traffic systems  public lighting  parking  residences  internet of things  etc.).With the innovative mindset that has guided the Group since it was founded  its expert management of complex projects  and its ability to drive progress with new technologies  the Group aims to continue building on its profitable growth  while expanding its business model.NEXT DATE2023-24 half-year earnings on December 15  2023 (after close of trading).ABOUT GECI INTERNATIONAL__________“Smart Solutions for a Smart World”GECI International is a specialist Technology and Digital group.

Business information revenue in particular was up +14.7%  confirming it is less cyclical.Coface has a significant historical presence in Israel  particularly in business information. Despite its horrific human cost  the current conflict does not yet appear to have had a major economic impact. While there is a real risk that the conflict will persist or expand  we continue to support our local teams and clients in the region.In an environment of rising business insolvencies  risk prevention measures from the beginning of the year so far enabled us to limit claims  and our sound cost management let to a net combined ratio of 66.0% for the first nine months of the year.Over the last quarter  Coface's net income was €61m with a year-to-date annualised RoATE of 14.1%  which is well over our mid-cycle targets.Lastly  we welcome Moody’s decision to raise Coface's credit rating from A2 to A1  associated with a stable outlook. This recognizes our team's hard work and attests to Coface's agility and resilience  as well as the quality of its risk management  which are at the heart of our culture and expertise.”Key figures at 30 September 2023The Board of Directors of COFACE SA examined the consolidated financial statements at 30 September 2023 (non-audited figures) at its meeting of 14 November 2023. The Audit Committee at its meeting on 13 November 2023 also previously reviewed them.Income statements items in €m 9M-22 9M-23 Variation % ex.

TurnoverCoface recorded a consolidated turnover of €1 417.8m over the first nine months  up +7.1% at constant FX and perimeter compared to 9M-22. As reported (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover rose +5.3%.Revenues from insurance activities (including surety bonds and single risk) increased by +6.6% at constant FX and perimeter. Growth was bolstered by a rise in client activity at the beginning of the year which fell into negative territory in Q3-23 following a decline in inflation and the economic slowdown. The retention rate reached a record level of 93.9% (up +0.4% compared to 9M-22). Buoyed by the mid-market segment  new business rose to €89m  up €7m compared to 9M-22. This level is relatively close to pre-COVID levels (€96m at 9M-19).The growth in Coface’s client activity had a positive impact of +2.4% as of 9M-23. However  this growth reflects the slowdown of the economy and inflation (-8.7 ppts compared to 9M-22). The price effect remained negative  coming in at -2.0% for 9M-23 (compared to -3.0% for 9M-22) and stabilised in Q3-23. This is largely due to very low past losses offset by the current normalisation environment.Turnover from non-insurance activities was up +9.8% compared to 9M-22. All the business lines are experiencing positive growth. Turnover from factoring rose +3.8%  mainly due to the increase in volumes refinanced in Germany. Information services turnover rose +14.7%. Fee and commission income (debt collection commissions) increased +41.3% due to the increase in claims to be collected. Commissions were up +10.2%.Total revenue - in €m(by country of invoicing) 9M-22 9M-23 Variation % ex.

The region saw a slump in client activity but adjacent activities were on the rise (+6.4% in factoring revenue).In Western Europe  turnover increased +7.4% at constant FX (+7.0% at current FX). All the business lines contributed to this growth.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover fell -5.6% at constant FX (-4.3% at current FX) due to the decline in business in Russia. Excluding Russia  growth would be +1.7%.In the Mediterranean and Africa region  which is driven by Italy and Spain  turnover rose +14.5% at constant FX and +10.9% at current FX due to new business and resilient activity.In North America  turnover increased +6.9% at constant FX and +4.0% as reported  driven by the return in client activity and rising commissions.In Latin America  turnover increased +6.3% at constant FX and fell 0.2% at current FX. The region saw a slump in client activity mainly in commodities and metals.In Asia-Pacific  turnover increased +6.5% at constant FX and +2.7% at current FX. The boost in revenue was driven by past sales performances which sustained the growth of the portfolio.2. ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio net of reinsurance was 66.0% in 9M-23  up +0.3 ppt year on year.(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 38.8%  up 3.3 ppts compared to the previous year. This reflects an increased claims frequency since H1-21  with the number of claims nearing pre-COVID levels. The amount of claims recorded is now higher than in 2019. Lastly  large losses have become relatively significant in size again while remaining below the historical average.The Group’s provisioning policy remained unchanged. The amount of provisions related to the underwriting year  although discounted  remained in line with the historical average. Strict management of past claims enabled the Group to record 36.8 ppts of recoveries.The net loss ratio rose to 40.2%  up 1.3 ppt compared to 9M-22.(ii) Cost ratioCoface follows a strict cost management policy. Coface remained disciplined over the first nine months of the year  with costs rising 8.2% at constant FX and perimeter (+4.0% in Q3-23). This increase was slightly more than growth in revenue over the year (7.1%) due to ongoing investment. The cost ratio before reinsurance stood at 30.5%  down 0.1 ppt despite slowed revenue growth due to an improvement in the product mix.The cost ratio net of reinsurance was 25.7% for 9M-23  an improvement of 1.1 ppt year on year as a result of reinsurance commissions that remain high.Financial resultNet financial income was +€14.5m over the first nine months. This amount includes market value adjustments for -€19.6m (including -€25.8m for real estate funds)  positive hedging results and currency effect of -€17.8m due to the application of IAS 29 (hyperinflation) in Argentina and in Turkey as well as the rise of the euro against the other currencies in which the group operates.The portfolio’s current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  depreciation and FX) was €49.8m. The accounting yield3  excluding capital gains and fair value effect  was 1.7% for 9M-23. The yield on new investments was 3.9%.Insurance Finance Expenses (IFE) stood at €30.1m for the first nine months of the year due to higher discount rates and higher loss reserves.Operating income and net incomeOperating income amounted to €273.4m in 9M-23  down -0.8%.The effective tax rate was 24%  compared to 27% for 9M-22.In total  net income (group share) stood at €189.7m  up +2.1% compared to 9M-22  of which €60.9m in Q3-23.3. Shareholders’ equity & solvencyAt 30 September 2023  Group shareholders’ equity stood at €1 983.7m  down €34.9m  or -1.7% (compared to €2 018.6m at 31 December 2022).This change is mainly due to positive net income of €189.7m  the payment of the dividend (-€227.0m) and a rise in unrealised capital gains (€12.4m).The annualised return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 14.1% at 30 September 2023  mainly due to the improvement in underwriting income.4. OutlookThe global economy experienced a net slowdown over the last quarter. Monetary tightening from central banks affected multiple sectors of the economy  particularly real estate  and ultimately also hampered consumption. The full impact of these policies is yet to come. Meanwhile  price drops across most commodities caused an accelerated dip in inflation which affected Coface's clients growth  and therefore Coface’s premium revenue.Coface still expects modest growth for the global economy both in 2023 (2.4%) and 2024 (2.2%)  and a further decline in inflation.As expected at the start of the year  business failures continued to rise  sometimes above pre-pandemic levels. However  the many preventive measures taken by Coface so far avoided a major spike in recorded claims. Year-to-date their number is currently 8% lower than in 2019 for a total amount that is now equivalent.Geopolitical instability (Ukraine  Israel  etc.) and the potential for enduring conflicts also translate to downside risks weighing on the economy.As such  the credit insurance sector is entering a new phase in the cycle  characterised by weaker client activity that may be negative in the short-term  an increase in business insolvencies and reduced pressure on prices and an increase on demand. Amidst this clearly less encouraging environment  Coface remains dedicated to strict risks and costs management while honouring its strategy of closely collaborating with its clients.One of Coface's strategic initiatives is focused on expanding services  which have low capital requirements. This strategy is now even more relevant as they tend to be less sensitive to the economic environment.Coface is actively devising its next strategic plan  which will be presented to investors on 5 March 2024.Conference call for financial analystsCoface’s results for 9M-2023 will be discussed with financial analysts during the conference call on 14 November 2023 at 18.00 (Paris time).

As such  no distinction is made in third-party management  which is presented solely in agent form.This presentation therefore allows a direct reading of syndication fees  sales commissions  and management fees.This presentation has no impact on EBITDA  operating income  or net income. The accounting presentation of revenue from activities is presented in the appendix to the press release.Owned activities amounted to €109.6 million in the first nine months of the year  including:€52.1 million for Leasing revenue on owned equipment (+€2.5 million);€14.6 million for Ancillary services  down by -€3.4 million year-on-year due to normalisation on the container market in particular on pick-up charges;€43.0 million for Sales of owned equipment  a decrease of -€1.5 million year-on-year impacted by container price normalisation but partly compensated by Freight Railcars’ and Modular Building’s performance.As a reminder  the container business witnessed an exceptional price increase during the global pandemic until 2022  generating a temporary increase in revenues from ancillary services (i.e pick-up charges) and sales of equipment. The normalisation of the market and prices  which have returned to pre-pandemic levels  leads to a decline and therefore a “back to normal” situation of ancillary services and sales.Management activity amounts to €6.9 million during the 9-months period. Management fees remain stable and sales fees increase supported by more sales volume  while syndication fees decrease as the Group retains equipment on its balance sheet for longer.The increase of Leasing revenue on owned equipment and the slight decrease of Sales of owned assets demonstrate the resilience of the Group’s business model. Long-term contract brings recurring revenues. Thanks to business diversification (Freight Railcars  River Barges  Containers  Modular Buildings)  the impact of markets changes are limited. This year the container normalisation is offset by the performance of other business lines. With the management activity  the Group can also outsource some risks and generate commissions.ANALYSIS OF CONTRIBUTIONS BY DIVISIONThe Freight Railcars activity rose to €42.6 million (+5.3%) in the first nine months:Owned activity expanded by +€2.3 million  resulting from both a +4.9% increase in leasing revenue from owned equipment (+€1.6 million)  and a +€1.1 million increase of ancillary services related to re-invoicing of wagon repairs.The increase in leasing revenue is driven by a better utilisation rate (88.7% versus 87.1% over the same period in 2022) and an improved daily leasing rate (+11% in average); newly acquired railcars are also on lease.Management activity was however down during the period  due to the lack of syndication fees (assets are kept longer on the balance sheet  so no syndication fee was issued) and despite increasing management fees (+€0.25 million).The River Barges activity saw a boost in leasing revenue of +7% in a business context where the utilisation rate has been 100% since early 2023. However  the Division revenue was down by -€1.8 million due to a decrease of ancillary services related to the chartering activity on the Rhine River basin (also leading to a reduction in operating expenses for an almost equivalent level).The Containers activity posted a slowdown of -€11.5 million (-18.8%) compared with the same period in 2022  impacted by the normalisation in the Container business observed since the beginning of 2023 and mainly affecting ancillary services and sales of owned equipment. Nevertheless  the leasing revenue on owned equipment slightly increased by +€0.5 million despite a lower utilisation rate (94.8% vs. 98.1% during the 9-months 2022 period). The high production of new containers during the pandemic is generating a counter-cycle in 2023. With the redelivery of old containers and a very low production of new assets  the market overcapacity should be absorbed between now and the end of the year. This counter-cycle is combined with a normalisation of container prices and will have a beneficial effect on market stability.In this context  sales of owned equipment declined by -€8.6 million (-22.2%) owing to a primary container trading market less dynamic along with the price drop.

32745,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/what-s-up-with-xavier-niel-proximus-iliad-vodafone-48974/,What’s up with… Xavier Niel & Proximus  Iliad  Vodafone,Iliad owner Xavier Niel takes a stake in ProximusMove comes as Iliad reports impressive results“Much more to be done ” says Vodafone CEO,In today’s industry news roundup: Iliad’s owner and serial telecom entrepreneur Xavier Niel has snapped up a stake in Belgium’s national operator Proximus; Iliad  meanwhile  is doing very well across multiple markets  including Italy… which just happens to be the problem child market for which Vodafone now needs to find a strategic remedy  confirms CEO Margherita Della Valle as she delivers the telco’s H1 results; and more!Serial telecom industry innovator and entrepreneur Xavier Niel has identified Belgium as the latest European market where he might be able to generate some returns. The Frenchman is best known for founding and building Iliad (using its Free brand) into a major competitive telco in France before branching out into multiple other markets  including Italy and Poland (more on that later). He also snapped up a 2.5% stake in Vodafone  has taken a sizeable stake in Millicom (the operator that is now focused on the Latin American market) and has a majority ownership of Ireland’s national operator Eir via his investment firm Carraun. Now  using Carraun as his investment vehicle once again  Niel has taken a 6% stake in Proximus  Belgium’s national operator that is majority owned (53.5%) by the Belgian state. “As the undisputed domestic leader in fixed and mobile  Proximus has a strong track record among the European incumbents. Proximus has also managed to develop a successful international business via its affiliates BICS and Telesign  a unique position among EU incumbents ” noted Carraun in this announcement. Carraun is “supportive of the current strategy of Proximus top management  and in particular its ambitious FTTH rollout plan ” and is “willing to cooperate with Proximus management.” Niel noted: “We have built a pan-European telecom group over the past decade  always focusing on providing our customers with best value for money and relying on high-quality mobile and fixed network infrastructure. I have been attracted by the Belgian market for a long time with its strong economy and where a sound regulatory approach has led to a vibrant telecom sector  as demonstrated in the recently discussed fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) co-investment plan. I am very pleased that we now have the opportunity to invest in Proximus and hopefully create ties for the long term. Proximus is an iconic operator whose history is closely associated with Belgium. Over the years  Proximus has managed to adapt to a rapidly changing telecom environment and remain the national leader. It would be an honour if we could contribute as a long-term partner to the future evolution of Proximus.” The announcement lit a fire under the Proximus share price  which is up by more than 6% to €8.55 on the Euronext exchange today.News of the Carraun stake in Proximus came as Iliad published its third-quarter earnings  which the operator described as “excellent financial results for the first nine months of 2023 and a record sales performance in France and Italy. The results consolidate our European leadership in terms of revenue growth  and confirm our virtuous growth model.” Group revenues for the first three quarters increased by 10.1% to €6.8bn  while earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased by more than 5% to just over €2.5bn. Across its operations in France  Italy and Poland  Iliad ended September with 47.8 million customers  of which 38.3 million are mobile users and 9.5 million are fixed broadband users. A country-by-country breakdown is available in this press release. “These very good results were achieved thanks to our choices in terms of investment and defending our subscribers’ purchasing power ” noted Iliad CEO Thomas Reynaud. “They ensure that we can prepare for the future with confidence. Step by step  we are continuing to build a European telecoms group at the cutting edge of connectivity  the cloud and AI.” Oh yes  Niel has sunk his teeth into AI – for more on that see Iliad targets European AI lead with hefty investments.Niel is always on the lookout for a good investment opportunity and a way to build affordable scale in his business and  to that end  he made a somewhat cheeky but unsuccessful offer to acquire Vodafone’s Italian operations for a reported €11.25bn in early 2022 in partnership with private equity firm Apax. At the time  Vodafone said the offer was not in the best interests of its investors  but 18 months is a long time in the European telecom sector and the potential combination of Iliad and Vodafone in Italy cropped up again today as Vodafone unveiled its latest numbers. The operator suffered a big drop in operating profit during the first half of its current financial year  down by 44.2% to €1.66bn  as group revenues sunk by 4.3% to €21.94bn  though the operator attributed this to “adverse foreign exchange rate movements and the disposal of Vantage Towers  Vodafone Hungary and Vodafone Ghana in the prior financial year.” On a slightly more positive note  group service revenues increased by 4.2% to €19.2bn  with organic increases in Europe as well as Africa in local currencies: Notably in Europe  service revenues in the operator’s largest single market  Germany (31% of total sales)  have turned a corner  edging up during the second quarter on a year-by-year basis by 1.1% to €2.9bn. Vodafone Business  which provides services to enterprise customers  was a bright spot  reporting a 4.4% increase in organic service revenues during the six months to the end of September to just over €5.1bn  with organic growth recorded across all segments and in all markets except for Spain. Digital services sales (cloud  security  IoT) are growing at double-digit rates and accounted for 17% of Vodafone Business revenues in the first half of the fiscal year  with the operator ending September with 175 million internet of things (IoT) connections. “During the first half of the year  we have delivered improved revenue growth in nearly all of our markets and have returned to growth in Germany in the second quarter ” stated CEO Margherita Della Valle. “Vodafone’s transformation is progressing. Our focus on customers and simplifying our business is beginning to bear fruit  although much more needs to be done. We have also announced transactions to strengthen our position in the UK and exit the challenging Spanish market in order to right-size our portfolio for growth ” she added. The UK merger with Three UK still hangs in the balance as regulators assess the potential impact of reducing the number of major service providers from four to three  while in Spain  Vodafone recently announced the planned sale of its still shrinking operation to Zegona for €5bn. And now  as Reuters reports  the merger and acquisition (M&A) attention is turning to Italy  which Della Valle identified earlier in the year as one of the more challenging markets in the Vodafone portfolio that needed to be addressed. “We are considering a range of options ” the CEO said of Vodafone’s Italian business. “We don't have deadlines  we don't have timelines ” she added. So is Iliad still interested? You bet. While Reuters couldn’t get a direct comment from Iliad on the possibility of another takeover offer for Vodafone Italia  Reynaud told reporters that “if there is consolidation in Italy  we want to participate actively.” Game on! In the meantime  Vodafone is once again staring at a sliding share price  as its stock lost 2.8% of its value on the London Stock Exchange in Tuesday trading to sink to 75.2 pence.No doubt one person casting an eye over Vodafone’s results will be Nick Read  who until about this time last year was the operator’s CEO: He stepped down following pressure from investors that were disgruntled with the slow pace of the telco’s restructuring – see Vodafone CEO Nick Read quits as investor pressure takes its toll. Now he’s wearing a CEO badge again  except this time it’s at Exa Infrastructure  the alternative pan-European long-distance operator where he was appointed as chairman in June this year. Now he’s taken over from Martijn Blanken as CEO  at least for the time being while the company conducts “a comprehensive search process to identify a permanent CEO.” Might they just stick with Read?Ericsson has long been proud of its in-house chip development R&D  which is one of the radio access network (RAN) technology attributes it highlights to mobile operators. The Swedish vendor has now unveiled its new generation of RAN Compute processors “to help communications service providers (CSPs) get the most out of current and future radio access technology evolutions. The most advanced RAN Compute products to date are powered by Ericsson Silicon and built for the network demands of 5G Advanced and enhanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms ” the vendor noted in this press release. It added: “The two high-capacity processors  RAN Processor 6672 and Radio Processor 6372  offer four times the capacity compared to previous generation and can support up to six 4G and 5G modes  in a single unit. Advanced 5G markets typically utilise three to four modes in basebands at present. The additional modes made possible by the products announced today will allow CSPs to run more technologies simultaneously on one RAN Compute board  including 5G time division duplex (TDD) massive MIMO  4G and 5G frequency division duplex (FDD)  and more  with modes to spare for future needs.” As data traffic volumes ramp up  that kind of firepower is going to appeal to operators and put pressure on Ericsson’s rivals. And there’s another brief mention in the announcement worth highlighting: “The new RAN Compute products are also hardware prepared for Open RAN deployments ” the vendor noted  adding fuel to the Open RAN fire it started in earnest about a month ago – see Ericsson lights the Open RAN Fyuz.Samsung has emerged as one of  if not the  leading vendor partner for mobile operators such as Vodafone Group that are advancing their Open RAN strategies and this has been recognised by some of the industry analyst firms that are tracking the sector  as the vendor noted in this blog. That’s all very well  but Samsung doesn’t embellish its self-praise with any meaningful statistics to back up its bragging – some insights into the number of sites deployed  at the very least  would help put its Open RAN success into context.- The staff  TelecomTV,neutral,0.03,0.93,0.04,mixed,0.49,0.28,0.23,True,English,"['Xavier Niel', 'Proximus', 'Iliad', 'Vodafone', 'adverse foreign exchange rate movements', 'CEO Margherita Della Valle', 'Serial telecom industry innovator', 'ambitious FTTH rollout plan', 'Iliad CEO Thomas Reynaud', 'vibrant telecom sector', 'changing telecom environment', 'fixed network infrastructure', 'sound regulatory approach', 'record sales performance', 'subscribers’ purchasing power', 'prior financial year', 'European telecom sector', 'pan-European telecom group', 'problem child market', 'Latin American market', 'serial telecom entrepreneur', 'first three quarters', 'industry news roundup', 'undisputed domestic leader', 'strong track record', 'virtuous growth model', 'private equity firm', 'current financial year', 'European telecoms group', 'major competitive telco', 'multiple other markets', 'successful international business', 'excellent financial results', 'group service revenues', 'latest European market', 'first nine months', 'Proximus share price', 'European AI lead', 'Proximus top management', 'good investment opportunity', 'Euronext exchange', 'multiple markets', 'investment plan', 'Group revenues', 'Belgian market', 'European incumbents', 'European leadership', 'first half', 'investment firm', 'current strategy', 'strong economy', 'national leader', 'revenue growth', 'good results', 'latest numbers', 'strategic remedy', 'H1 results', 'The Frenchman', 'Free brand', 'majority ownership', 'investment vehicle', 'Belgian state', 'unique position', 'EU incumbents', 'past decade', 'best value', 'long term', 'long-term partner', 'broadband users', 'country breakdown', 'press release', 'cutting edge', 'hefty investments', 'affordable scale', 'best interests', 'potential combination', 'big drop', 'operating profit', 'Vantage Towers', 'positive note', 'organic increases', 'local currencies', 'Proximus management', 'high-quality mobile', 'long time', 'mobile users', 'national operator', 'iconic operator', 'future evolution', 'third-quarter earnings', '47.8 million customers', 'unsuccessful offer', 'Italian operations', 'sizeable stake', 'Xavier Niel', 'Vodafone Ghana', 'Carraun stake', '18 months', '2.5% stake', '6% stake', 'today', 'Belgium', 'Italy', 'returns', 'France', 'Poland', 'Millicom', 'Ireland', 'Eir', 'affiliates', 'BICS', 'Telesign', 'announcement', 'money', 'home', 'ties', 'history', 'years', 'honour', 'fire', 'terms', 'tax', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'EBITDA', 'choices', 'confidence', 'step', 'connectivity', 'cloud', 'teeth', 'lookout', 'way', 'end', 'cheeky', 'early', 'partnership', 'Apax', 'investors', 'disposal', 'Hungary', 'Africa']",2023-11-14,2023-11-15,telecomtv.com

In parallel  the enrolment of the first patient in our Phase 1 endocarditis infections study  expected around the end of the year  will be another major step forward for PHAXIAM in its strategic positioning to target indications of very high clinical value.”BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSa) Confirmed strategic focus on Phage Therapy in high-value indicationsPHAXIAM has been refocusing its clinical development programs in indications of high medical needs  for patients with severe resistant infections  often associated with high mortality and budget impact. This quarter’s clinical progress of PHAXIAM’s key therapeutic programs  particularly with its lead program targeting resistant S. aureus infections  confirms the Company's advanced positioning in phage therapy.b) Significant progress in the Clinical and Regulatory strategyS. Aureus programWith its lead S. aureus program  PHAXIAM pursues the ambition to propose a therapeutic solution to patients who failed traditional antimicrobial treatments in complex mono-bacterial S. aureus infections in several high-value indications  starting with Prosthetic Joint Infections and Endocarditis Infections.Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI)Leveraging on promising activity signals from real-life compassionate treatments  PHAXIAM is preparing the initiation of a global (EU/US) study for PJI patients having an open-surgery debridement (DAIR) in combination with antibiotics.PHAXIAM received feedback from FDA on the next steps for its clinical development plan in PJI  with the following key points:Confirmation of the value of a clinical development in this indication  Confirmation that PHAXIAM’s non-clinical data and CMC capabilities support a formal clinical development plan in the US  FDA provided PHAXIAM with clear guidelines for a Phase 2 study in the US.A Scientific Advice meeting with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to take place in January 2024 and its outcomes  combined with the recommendations from the FDA  will be the basis to design PHAXIAM’s future global (EU/US) clinical plan in PJI.Endocarditis Infections (EI)PHAXIAM is preparing the launch of a phase 1 trial (PK data) in Endocarditis Infections caused by S. aureus  to evaluate intravenous administration of phages for EI. The results  if positive  could allow PHAXIAM to use this administration route for other indications.In October  PHAXIAM obtained approvals from the French ANSM and South-East II-Lyon Ethics Committee to launch the study that should enroll 12 patients requiring replacement of an infected heart valve.The enrollment is targeted to start by the end of 2023 and the first study results are expected in mid-2024.Robust real-life activity data from compassionate treatmentsIn June 2022  the ANSM granted PHAXIAM an AAC (Autorisation d’Accès Compassionnel – early access program) and to date  more than 90 patients have been treated under the compassionate/AAC status. Data from the first 77 PJI patients evaluated so far show promising clinical data for infection control at 3 months  considered as a significant improvement over standard of care in this hard-to-treat patient population with severe resistant infections.The Company has applied for a second AAC regulatory validation for PJI patients  associated with P. aeruginosa resistance.c) Confirmed efficiency of Phagogram  PHAXIAM’s proprietary platform to assess phage activityPhagogram is an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test designed to determine the in-vitro activity of PHAXIAM’s phages to patients’ bacterial strains. It is the first CE-marked IVD test dedicated to phage activity evaluation.In October 2023  the Company announced that the data obtained from Phagogram showed 98% response rate over 105 clinical S. aureus strains  showing the highest spectrum of activity of the anti-S. aureus phages among other competing solutions.These data clearly demonstrate the efficiency of PHAXIAM’s phagogram for the current and upcoming clinical developments. It also proves how it is a unique asset for the development of other phages in PHAXIAM’s portfolio.d) Preclinical research programs initiated to reinforce PHAXIAM’s phage therapy platformPHAXIAM launched several strategic research programs to reinforce its current clinical programs and prepare future developments  including with the extension of the current phage bank for E. coli and P. aeruginosa to increase resistant infections coverage and the demonstration of a Pre-clinical POC for Endolysins.On September 19  2023  the Company announced the extension of its portfolio to Klebsiella pneumoniae  a new resistant aggressive bacterial target  very complementary to the first 3 pathogens (S. aureus  P. aeruginosa  E. coli)A strategic research program  PhageBac  targeting Bacteremia  has been initiated. Currently at preclinical stage  this program is aiming at controlling blood infection and the risk of secondary infection with mono-bacterial infection due to S. aureus  P. aeruginosa  or E. coli.In October 2023  PHAXIAM concluded a strategic research partnership with Vetophage  a biotechnology company specialized in veterinary phage therapy  to combine expertise in the research of new phages and phage endolysins. This agreement provides PHAXIAM with exclusive licensing options on specified phages and endolysins from the Vetophage platform  to further strengthen its product portfolio in human health.Q3 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS (unaudited)Key financial figures for the first nine months of 2023 compared with the same period of the previous year are summarized below. In the context of the Erytech-Pherecydes merger  PHAXIAM’s consolidated financial statements in IFRS standards include ex-Pherecydes financial results as from the date of the merger  i.e. June 23  2023. Consequently  PHAXIAM’s P&L information for the first 9 months of 2023 include 9 months of ex-Erytech activities and ex-Pherecydes activities since June 23  2023.In thousands of euros Q3 2023 ytd9 months(unaudited) Q3 2022 ytd9 months(unaudited) Revenues — — Net income from asset sale 9 24 351 Other income 475 1 423 Operating income 484 25 774 Research and development (6 756) (20 377) General and administrative (11 875) (10 870) Operating expenses (18 631) (31 248) Operating income (loss) (18 147) (5 474) Financial income 465 4 031 Financial expenses (417) (881) Financial income (loss) 48 3 150 Income tax 208 (3 838) Net loss (17 891) (6 163)Operating expenses of €18.6 million in the first nine months of 2023 were 40% lower (i.e. a €12.6 million reduction) than in the previous year  the decrease being driven by the 67% reduction of R&D expenses  mostly driven by the closing of Princeton operations and the termination of ex-Erytech clinical development activities. PHAXIAM’s G&A expenses in the first nine months of 2023 increased by €1.0 million (+9%) versus the previous year  an increase related to the merger transaction and other merger-related costs. Net loss for the first nine months of 2023 was €17.9 million  compared with a net loss of €6.2 million for the same period of 2022  which benefited from the €24.4 million net gain on the sale of the Princeton facility in April 2022.As of September 30  2023  PHAXIAM had cash and cash equivalents totaling €15.6 million (approximately $16.5 million)  compared with €38.8 million as of December 31  2022. The €23.2 million decrease in cash position during the first nine months of 2023 was the result of a €20.5 million net cash utilization in operating activities and investing activities and €2.6 million used in financing activities  mostly related to the reimbursement of the ‘PGE’ Covid-loan  while the variation of the U.S. dollar against the euro led to a €0.1 million negative currency exchange impact.The Company believes that its current cash position can fund its current programs and planned operating expenses into the second quarter of 2024.KEY NEWSFLOW AND MILESTONES EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHSRegulatory feedback from the EMA on the next clinical development in PJI (S. aureus) (Q1 2024)First Patient-In for Endocarditis study (S. aureus) (around year-end 2023)PhagoDAIR clinical data (H2 2024)Q3 2023 CONFERENCE CALL DETAILSPHAXIAM management will hold a conference call and webcast on Wednesday  November 15  2023  at 8:30am ET / 2:30pm CET on the Business and Financial Update for the Third Quarter of 2023.
