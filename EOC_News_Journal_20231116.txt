According to Mark Oigman  the founder of the international financial company SmartGen  these measures are a result of EU sanctions  particularly those imposed on Russians by Euroclear  a depositary based in Belgium.Euroclear  in the previous year  had frozen accounts at Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD)  through which Russian investors managed their assets in foreign jurisdictions. Euroclear's guidance dictated that if a Russian resident's investment portfolio exceeded €100 000 (USD108 000)  any coupon income  dividends  or proceeds from asset sales linked to it would be credited to a specially segregated account.This prevented Russian clients from managing their assets and provided Euroclear with a mechanism to block them in the event of sanctions violations  explained Vadim Pogosyan  a partner at the asset management firm Smartly to a news outlet.Initially  the restrictions were limited to financial institutions within the EU that held assets linked to Euroclear. However  the clearing house has now extended its instructions to its counterparties outside the EU  compelling them to adhere to the specified requirements.Previously  measures segregating Russian accounts were implemented at the UAE's NBD Bank and the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE). Media reports indicate that an order directing Israeli financial institutions to segregate accounts held by Russians took effect on November 13.MENAFN16112023000045015839ID1107439178,negative,0.03,0.43,0.54,negative,0.02,0.35,0.63,True,English,"['Russian accounts', 'EU sanctions', 'Israel', 'banks', 'segregation', 'reply', 'Several major Israeli banks', 'several news agencies', 'National Settlement Depository', 'Kazakhstan Stock Exchange', 'international financial company', 'Israeli financial institutions', 'asset management firm', 'asset sales', 'news outlet', 'Russian citizens', 'tax residents', 'Mark Oigman', 'previous year', 'Russian investors', 'foreign jurisdictions', 'Russian resident', 'investment portfolio', 'coupon income', 'Russian clients', 'sanctions violations', 'Vadim Pogosyan', 'clearing house', 'NBD Bank', 'Media reports', 'EU sanctions', 'Russian accounts', 'MENAFN', 'segregation', 'founder', 'SmartGen', 'measures', 'result', 'Russians', 'Euroclear', 'depositary', 'Belgium', 'NSD', 'assets', 'guidance', 'dividends', 'proceeds', 'mechanism', 'event', 'partner', 'restrictions', 'instructions', 'counterparties', 'requirements', 'UAE', 'KASE', 'order', 'effect', 'November']",2023-11-16,2023-11-16,menafn.com

32759,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/54-ownership-deutsche-b-rse-071207983.html,With 54% ownership  Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1) boasts of strong institutional backing,Key Insights Given the large stake in the stock by institutions  Deutsche Börse's stock price might be vulnerable,Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions  Deutsche Börse's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 25 shareholders own 39% of the companyUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research  one can better assess the future performance of a companyEvery investor in Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 54% ownership. That is  the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital  their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence  having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Deutsche Börse.Check out our latest analysis for Deutsche BörseWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Deutsche Börse?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Deutsche Börse already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed  they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else  they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time  you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Deutsche Börse's earnings history below. Of course  the future is what really matters.Institutional investors own over 50% of the company  so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Deutsche Börse. Our data shows that Massachusetts Financial Services Company is the largest shareholder with 5.2% of shares outstanding. Flossbach & Von Storch Vermoegensmanagement AG is the second largest shareholder owning 4.3% of common stock  and The Vanguard Group  Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register  suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company  it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock  so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Deutsche BörseThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders  capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However  it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members  especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However  on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data cannot confirm that board members are holding shares personally. Given we are not picking up on insider ownership  we may have missing data. Therefore  it would be interesting to assess the CEO compensation and tenure  here.General Public OwnershipWith a 46% ownership  the general public  mostly comprising of individual investors  have some degree of sway over Deutsche Börse. This size of ownership  while considerable  may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight  we need to consider other information  too.

The company recorded continued strong interest in investment projects related to the decarbonization of real assets. At EUR 15.3 million  adjusted earnings before taxes (EBT adj.) already exceeded the previous year's total of EUR 14.8 million after nine months of the current financial year.Solid recurring revenue base and increase in transaction proceeds in the third quarterThe MPC Capital Group's revenues in the first nine months of 2023 amounted to EUR 27.6 million (9M 2022: EUR 27.1 million). Recurring revenues from asset and investment management amounted to EUR 21.8 million (9M 2022: EUR 21.2 million). The loss of revenues from the Dutch real estate business  which was sold in the previous year  was compensated by growth in other business areas.After a transaction-intensive third quarter  revenues from the transaction business after nine months were on the level of the same period of the previous year at EUR 5.6 million (9M 2022: EUR 5.7 million). Transaction revenues mainly resulted from the purchase and sale of assets that MPC Capital managed for various investors in the shipping segment. This included a fleet of state-of-the-art container ships and the delivery of the first container ship from an extensive newbuilding program initiated by MPC Capital for a group of international investors in early 2022.In the Real Estate segment  MPC Capital acquired a further property in Berlin for its ESG residential real estate fund in a challenging market environment. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter and will then be reflected in MPC Capital's earnings.In the Renewables segment  activities in the third quarter focused on the further development of projects and portfolio optimization. A photovoltaic (PV) project in Colombia and a wind farm in Germany are expected to be commissioned before the end of the year. Further PV projects in Guatemala and Jamaica are at an advanced planning stage.Other operating income of the MPC Capital Group amounted to EUR 4.0 million in the first nine months of 2023 (9M 2022: EUR 24.2 million). The previous year was characterized by the book profit from the sale of the Dutch real estate activities as well as performance-based income from the Shipping segment.Further improvement in profitability in the operating businessThe profitability of the operating business was once again significantly improved thanks to a more efficient cost base. Other operating expenses decreased significantly to EUR 11.8 million in the first nine months of the year (9M 2022: EUR 17.9 million). At EUR 14.4 million  personnel expenses were also below the previous year's level (9M 2022: EUR 14.8 million).The financial result also contributed to a further improvement in profitability. It increased by 16 % from EUR 12.5 million in the previous year to EUR 14.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. It mainly consists of regular income from investments and associates and is therefore an important pillar of MPC Capital's business model.The operating EBT margin (adj.) thus improved from 45 % in the previous year to 55 % in the first nine months of 2023. Consolidated earnings before taxes (EBT) amounted to EUR 15.3 million. In the previous year  MPC Capital generated EBT of EUR 28.8 million. Adjusted for the one-off proceeds from the sale of the Dutch real estate business  EBT adj. for the previous year was EUR 12.3 million.Consolidated net profit amounted to EUR 13.6 million after the first nine months of 2023 (9M 2022: EUR 26.3 million).Financial assets  which mainly comprise the co-investments of MPC Capital  amounted to EUR 46.2 million as at September 30  2023 (December 31  2022: EUR 54.9 million). The change is mainly due to the sale of projects in the Shipping segment.Cash and cash equivalents (cash on hand and bank balances) increased slightly to EUR 71.3 million (December 31  2022: EUR 69.1 million). Equity amounted to EUR 126.8 million as at September 30  2023 (December 31  2022: EUR 123.2 million).

The company recorded continued strong interest in investment projects related to the decarbonization of real assets. At EUR 15.3 million  adjusted earnings before taxes (EBT adj.) already exceeded the previous year's total of EUR 14.8 million after nine months of the current financial year.Solid recurring revenue base and increase in transaction proceeds in the third quarterThe MPC Capital Group's revenues in the first nine months of 2023 amounted to EUR 27.6 million (9M 2022: EUR 27.1 million). Recurring revenues from asset and investment management amounted to EUR 21.8 million (9M 2022: EUR 21.2 million). The loss of revenues from the Dutch real estate business  which was sold in the previous year  was compensated by growth in other business areas.After a transaction-intensive third quarter  revenues from the transaction business after nine months were on the level of the same period of the previous year at EUR 5.6 million (9M 2022: EUR 5.7 million). Transaction revenues mainly resulted from the purchase and sale of assets that MPC Capital managed for various investors in the shipping segment. This included a fleet of state-of-the-art container ships and the delivery of the first container ship from an extensive newbuilding program initiated by MPC Capital for a group of international investors in early 2022.In the Real Estate segment  MPC Capital acquired a further property in Berlin for its ESG residential real estate fund in a challenging market environment. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter and will then be reflected in MPC Capital's earnings.In the Renewables segment  activities in the third quarter focused on the further development of projects and portfolio optimization. A photovoltaic (PV) project in Colombia and a wind farm in Germany are expected to be commissioned before the end of the year. Further PV projects in Guatemala and Jamaica are at an advanced planning stage.Other opeRating income of the MPC Capital Group amounted to EUR 4.0 million in the first nine months of 2023 (9M 2022: EUR 24.2 million). The previous year was characterized by the book profit from the sale of the Dutch real estate activities as well as performance-based income from the Shipping segment.Further improvement in profitability in the operating businessThe profitability of the operating business was once again significantly improved thanks to a more efficient cost base. Other operating expenses decreased significantly to EUR 11.8 million in the first nine months of the year (9M 2022: EUR 17.9 million). At EUR 14.4 million  personnel expenses were also below the previous year's level (9M 2022: EUR 14.8 million).The financial result also contributed to a further improvement in profitability. It increased by 16 % from EUR 12.5 million in the previous year to EUR 14.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. It mainly consists of regular income from investments and associates and is therefore an important pillar of MPC Capital's business model.The operating EBT margin (adj.) thus improved from 45 % in the previous year to 55 % in the first nine months of 2023. Consolidated earnings before taxes (EBT) amounted to EUR 15.3 million. In the previous year  MPC Capital generated EBT of EUR 28.8 million.

Equity amounted to EUR 126.8 million as at September 30  2023 (December 31  2022: EUR 123.2 million).

ARGAN developed this site  which will be operated by BACK EUROP FRANCE as part of a long-term commercial lease for a12-year fixed-term period.In the span of 30 years  BACK EUROP FRANCE has become the leading player in the distribution of raw materials  supplies and small equipment for food professionals  and more specifically for those who specialize in bakery & pastry (boulangerie & pâtisserie).Delivered as a turnkey site  this building is divided into three areas: ambient air  positive cold and negative cold  thus providing BACK EUROP FRANCE with the ability to manage all its catalogue of products on a single platform.St-Jean-sur-Veyle that is directly located on the A40 French highway  very near Mâcon and the A6 French highway  is a prominent location to develop transports and logistics businesses. ARGAN  which is already the owner of a 60 000 sq.m building operated by CARREFOUR on a land portion nearby  is thus strengthening its presence on a PRIME logistics area  close to Lyon along the North-South« logistics backbone ».As it is now the case for all ARGAN’s new developments  this site has the Aut0nom® label  i.e.  “the warehouse that generates and uses its own green energy”.

Also  gas is banned  and heating is provided by a system that captures the heat resulting from cold-production infrastructures.Our intention was to deliver a site that is a benchmark in terms of energy consumption  carbon footprint limitation and respect for biodiversity. These efforts and choices justify a BREEAM Very Good certification for this new ARGAN logistics platform.Financial calendar 2024 (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: 2023 Annual SalesJanuary 18: 2023 Annual Results and 2024 targetsMarch 21: Annual General MeetingAbout ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

This strategic partnership with Mondrian is designed to take advantage of AMP's modern architecture  allowing a progressive move of its business applications away from 'on-premises' to 'Software as a Service ('SaaS')'.Mondrian has partnered with Linedata for over twenty-five years; starting with Longview Order Management and then expanding to implement Linedata Compliance. Now  they've broadened their suite of solutions further by adopting the AMP Platform  which will allow future adoption of modules such as AMP APIs  Accumen  Exception Manager and Model Management. This upgrade signifies a pivotal step in Mondrian's operational strategy  leveraging AMP's 'access anywhere' functionality and configurable design supporting Mondrian's adoption of data virtualisation technology  thereby allowing easy integration of APIs to deliver data.Linedata's extensible and high-performance AMP Platform resonates with the dynamic needs of asset managers like Mondrian  specifically targeting challenges such as inefficient workflows and transparent portfolio management tools.

HoloDoppler is moving forward in partnership with the world’s most renowned research and hospital centers for ophthalmology: the Quinze-Vingts National Ophthalmology Hospital  the Adolphe de Rothschild foundation hospital and ESPCI Paris.The HoloDoppler project aims to create a next-generation medical device for quantitative and non-invasive angiography of the eye. It represents a response to an unmet medical need  making it possible to measure ocular blood flow with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to effectively diagnose and treat pathologies such as glaucoma or hypertension. The quantitative biomarkers provided in terms of ocular blood flow (speed  flow rate  resistivity) will lead to a companion diagnostic for personalizing patient treatments and follow-up.The €2.8m grant will cover 60% of the total amount of the project (€4.7m)  which aims to take this technology  which is already operational  to a sufficient level of maturity for it to be marketed globally. This involves creating databases taking into account several hundred clinical examinations and incorporating artificial intelligence to effectively capitalize on these data.The market for retina imaging devices is currently estimated at €800m per year. The aim is to bring HoloDoppler to the market within four years  targeting a market share in time of around 5%.Jean-Marc Gendre  Lumibird Medical CEO: “HoloDoppler is in line with our strategy to further strengthen our range of treatment lasers (glaucoma  diabetes) with a range of very high-performance and strong value-added imaging equipment. The French state’s support and the presence of world-renowned academic and clinical partners will enable us to accelerate the product’s development and place it with leading ophthalmology centers around the world with a view to its international launch within the next four years”.LUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading specialists in lasers. With 50 years of experience and a mastering of solid state laser  laser diodes and fiber laser technologies  the Group designs  manufactures and markets high performance lasers for scientific (laboratories and universities)  industrial (manufacturing  defense  Lidar sensors) and medical (ophthalmology  ultrasound diagnostic) markets.Born from the combination of Keopsys Group with Quantel in October 2017  LUMIBIRD has more than 1 050 employees and over €191 million of consolidated revenues in 2022 and is present in Europe  America and Asia.LUMIBIRD shares are listed on the Euronext Paris B Compartment.

Calculated using actual foreign exchange rates at transaction date. Total of realised proceeds and current fair value. The invested amount for Trilantic Capital Partners includes an initial payment of $ 10 million. PERFORMANCE NET ASSET VALUE The NAV comprises total assets less total liabilities  and equates to total equity under International Financial Reporting Standards. The decrease in the NAV of € 104 million during the period reflects decreases in the estimated fair value of certain investments including British American Tobacco p.l.c. (‘BAT’)  Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited (‘Pension Corporation’) and Prescient China funds  together with the dividend paid by the Company. Offsetting these decreases are dividends received from BAT and Pension Corporation together with increases in the fair value of certain investments including other listed investments  Trilantic Capital Partners  TruArc Partners and NanoDimension funds. Details of the Company’s NAV and details of movements in key investments can be found on pages 2 and 3 of this report. Reinet records its assets and liabilities in euro; the strengthening of sterling and the US dollar against the euro during the period has resulted in an overall increase in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying current period-end exchange rates to the March 2023 assets and liabilities would have resulted in an increase in the March 2023 NAV of some € 98 million. SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME As at 30 September 2023  there was no share buyback programme in progress. The Company repurchased 14 151 395 ordinary shares between November 2018 and May 2022 under five share buyback programmes. The cost of the ordinary shares repurchased amounted to € 222 million  plus transaction costs. Details of each completed share buyback programme to date can be found in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. All ordinary shares repurchased are held as treasury shares. NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE The NAV per share of the Company is calculated by dividing the NAV by the number of shares outstanding (excluding treasury shares) of 181 790 891 (31 March 2023: 181 790 891). 30 September 2023 31 March 2023 Shares in issue 195 942 286 195 942 286 Treasury shares (14 151 395) (14 151 395) Net shares 181 790 891 181 790 891 € m € m NAV (see page 2) 5 616 5 720 € per share € per share NAV per share 30.89 31.46 SHARE PRICE The Company’s indicative share price as quoted on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange increased by 4.3 per cent in the period from € 18.80 at 31 March 2023 to € 19.60 at 30 September 2023. The total shareholder return since inception (taking into account the initial price of € 7.1945 and including dividends paid) is 7.8 per cent per annum. The growth in NAV  including dividends paid  reflects an 8.5 per cent compounded increase since March 2009. The Company’s ordinary shares are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange; the listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is a secondary listing. Share prices as at 30 September 2023 and 31 March 2023 were as follows: 30 September 2023 31 March 2023 ZAR EUR ZAR EUR Luxembourg - 19.60 - 18.80 Amsterdam - 19.60 - 19.00 Johannesburg 415.73 - 365.06 - GLOBAL MARKETS BACKDROP Global markets continue to be impacted by the effects of the ongoing crises in Ukraine and recently also in the Middle East  increasing interest rates and rising inflation. Rising inflation continues to put significant pressure on households and consumers as many central banks continue to increase interest rates to mitigate the inflation concerns. The extent and impact of these factors remain uncertain. Reinet has no direct exposure to Russia  Ukraine or the Middle East through its underlying investments or banking relationships and has not experienced any significant direct impacts in respect of interest rate increases or rising inflation. Reinet has various banking relationships with highly rated institutions  and a well-diversified approach to cash and liquidity management. Reinet continues to value its investments in line with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (‘IPEV’) guidelines and its approved valuation procedures and methodologies. All investment valuations have been prepared using latest available data  including exchange rates and listed share prices as at 30 September 2023. Discussions have taken place with fund managers and investee companies to determine any significant changes in value and any impacts related to the various geo-political areas of conflict  volatility in stock and currency markets  interest rates  inflation and exposure to certain financial institutions. Future valuations will take into account any new impacts of the above  which could affect the valuation of underlying investments. INVESTMENTS Reinet seeks  through a range of investment structures  to build partnerships with other investors  specialised fund managers and entrepreneurs to find and develop opportunities for long-term value creation for its shareholders. Since its formation in 2008  Reinet has invested some € 3.6 billion  and at 30 September 2023 committed to provide further funding of € 630 million to its current investments. Details of the funding commitments outstanding are given in the table on page 13 of this report. New commitments during the period under review amounted to € 39 million  with a net total of € 51 million funded during the period. Major items impacting the NAV  significant changes in carrying value and new investments during the period under review are described below. LISTED INVESTMENTS BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C. The investment in BAT remains one of Reinet’s largest investments and is kept under constant review  considering the company’s performance  the industry outlook  cash flows from dividends  stock market performance  volatility and liquidity. During the period under review  dividend income recorded from BAT amounted to € 65 million (£ 56 million)  being BAT’s second 2023 interim dividend of some € 33 million (£ 28 million) received in August 2023 together with the third interim dividend of some € 32 million (£ 28 million) with a record date of 29 September 2023. The third interim dividend will be paid on 3 November 2023 and has been included as a receivable in the NAV as at 30 September 2023. The first 2023 interim dividend of some € 32 million (£ 28 million) was received in May 2023 and was recorded as a receivable in Reinet’s March 2023 results. Reinet holds 48.3 million shares in BAT (31 March 2023: 48.3 million)  representing some 2.16 per cent of BAT’s issued share capital. The value of Reinet’s investment in BAT amounted to € 1 436 million at 30 September 2023 (31 March 2023: € 1 561 million)  being some 25.6 per cent of Reinet’s NAV (31 March 2023: 27.3 per cent). The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange decreased from £ 28.405 at 31 March 2023 to £ 25.765 at 30 September 2023; however  this was offset by the effect of sterling strengthening against the euro in the period  resulting in a net decrease in value of € 125 million. In its 30 June 2023 half-year report  BAT’s newly appointed Chief Executive  Tadeu Marroco  reported that he was pleased with BAT’s resilient performance in the first half of 2023 and the renewed sense of energy across the organisation. High inflation and slower global growth are impacting consumers and businesses  yet revenue  profit from operations and earnings are all up. Despite global tobacco industry volume expected to be down some 3 per cent  partly due to the U.S.  Pakistan and uncertainty over the Ukraine crisis  BAT is expecting constant currency revenue growth of 3 to 5 per cent  with continued strong progress towards £ 5 billion new category revenue in 2025 and mid-single figure constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth. BAT also remains committed to dividend growth in sterling terms and a 65 per cent long-term dividend pay-out ratio. Further information on BAT is available at www.bat.com/annualreport.

In September 2023  Fitch affirmed Pension Insurance Corporation’s Insurer Financial Strength rating at A+ (Strong) and Long-Term Issuer Default rating at A. Reinet’s shareholding in Pension Corporation remained at 49.5 per cent in the period under review. Reinet’s investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of € 2 746 million at 30 September 2023 (31 March 2023: € 2 787 million). This value takes into account Pension Corporation’s adjusted equity own funds value at 30 June 2023 of some £ 6.0 billion (31 December 2022: £ 5.9 billion)  corresponding valuation multiples drawn from industry data for a selected UK insurance peer group as at 30 September 2023  and a discount of 10 per cent which takes into account the illiquid nature of Reinet’s investment. The decrease in Reinet’s estimated fair value of Pension Corporation over the six-month period is mainly due to a decrease in comparable company multiples derived from public information of listed peer group companies in the UK insurance sector  offset by the strengthening of sterling against the euro in the period and an increase in Pension Corporation’s adjusted equity own funds. The investment in Pension Corporation represented some 48.9 per cent of Reinet’s NAV at 30 September 2023  compared to 48.7 per cent at 31 March 2023. In its 30 June 2023 half-year report  Pension Corporation reports that it continued to create social value by investing strongly in the UK’s infrastructure  including funding the UK’s first reservoir for more than 30 years  and maintained a robust balance sheet  allowing it to fulfil its purpose of paying the pensions of its current and future policyholders. The significant anticipated new business pipeline and market opportunity  accelerated by improved funding levels of pension schemes  remains a key focus for the business. Pension Corporation also noted that its defensively positioned portfolio continued to perform in line with expectations  with no defaults recorded in the first half due to careful management of sector and key name exposures over the past few years; as a consequence it also avoided the contagion caused by the recent problems in the US regional banking sector.

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS Reinet holds cash on deposit principally in European-based banks and in liquidity funds holding highly rated short-term instruments. Reinet’s liquidity is measured by its ability to meet potential cash requirements  including unfunded commitments on investments and the repayment of borrowings  and at 30 September 2023 can be summarised as follows: Cash and liquid fundsUndrawn borrowing facilitiesCash required for unfunded commitments (refer to table above)Cash required to meet GBP borrowing obligations € 301 m€ 231 m(€ 630 m)(€ 231 m) The undrawn borrowing facilities comprise a revolving facility with Bank of America  N.A. and with Citibank N.A. (see below). Reinet may sell further BAT shares or use such shares to secure additional financing facilities from time to time. BANK BORROWINGS BORROWINGS BORROWINGS Reinet has a fixed-rate £ 100 million margin loan due to Citibank N.A.  which is repayable in August 2024.

Dividend income from Pension Corporation amounting to some € 57 million (£ 50 million) was received in May 2023. This is an inaugural dividend of 7.50 pence per ordinary share. Interest income is earned on bank deposits  investments and loans made to underlying investments. Realised losses on other investments were in respect of investments in Milestone funds  offset by realised gains in respect of investments in other fund investments. EXPENSES The management fee for the period ended 30 September 2023 amounts to € 24 million and is based on Reinet Fund’s NAV of € 5 721 million at 31 March 2023 (30 September 2022: € 26 million  based on Reinet Fund’s NAV of € 5 932 million at 31 March 2022).

A provision for the potential performance fee of € 12 million was accrued in respect of the six-month period ended 30 September 2023 (30 September 2022: € nil). Operating expenses of € 4 million include € 1 million in respect of charges from Reinet Investments Manager S.A. (the ‘General Partner’) and other expenses  including legal and other fees  which amounted to € 3 million. FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS The investment in 48.3 million BAT shares decreased in value by € 125 million during the period under review. Of this  € 148 million was attributable to the decrease in value of the underlying BAT shares in sterling terms  offset by an increase of € 23 million due to the strengthening of sterling against the euro during the period under review. The investment in Pension Corporation decreased in value by € 41 million which includes a decrease of € 152 million in respect of the decrease in market multiples  offset by an increase of € 72 million due to the movement on Pension Corporation’s adjusted equity own funds value and € 39 million due to the strengthening of sterling against the euro in the period under review (refer to page 7 for more detail). The unrealised fair value adjustment of € 40 million in respect of other investments includes an increase in the estimated fair value of Trilantic Capital Partners and TruArc Partners (refer to note 4 on page 24 for more details). The above amounts include the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates in the period under review. Borrowings are carried at estimated fair value reflecting the discounted cash flow value of future principal and interest payments taking into account prevailing interest rates. An unrealised loss of € 4 million arose during the period in respect of the Citibank N.A. and Bank of America  N.A. loans as a result of increased market interest rates together with the strengthening of sterling in the period. MINORITY INTEREST The minority interest expense arises in respect of the minority partner's share in the earnings of Reinet TCP Holdings Limited. DIVIDEND A cash dividend of some € 54.5 million or € 0.30 per share (excluding treasury shares held) was paid in September 2023  following approval at the annual general meeting on 29 August 2023.

In 2013 the Company sought clarification from the South African Revenue Service (‘SARS’) as to the treatment of any dividends to be declared by the Company and paid to holders of depository receipts issued by Reinet Securities SA in respect of Reinet ordinary shares. This ruling from SARS was renewed in 2018 and again in October 2023 for a further 5 years in respect of any dividends to be declared by the Company and paid to South African resident beneficial holders of the Company’s ordinary shares listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. SARS confirmed to the Company that any such dividends would be treated as ‘foreign dividends’ as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. CAPITAL STRUCTURE As at 30 September 2023 and 31 March 2023 there were 195 941 286 ordinary shares and 1 000 management shares in issue.

The financial statements3 were approved by the Board of Directors during its meeting today.Pierre Barnabé  Soitec’s CEO  commented: “With a sequential growth of over 50% compared to the first quarter  our second-quarter revenue rebounded significantly  as we had anticipated. This was particularly the case in Mobile Communications as the inventory correction across the smartphone value chain eased. We continue to leverage strong demand in Automotive to deploy our SmartSiCTM roadmap and we continue to progress actively with several customers. Overall  our first half revenue is in line with our expectations. We have maintained strong profitability and a solid financial position  while continuing to invest in R&D and industrial capacity  as well as building inventories to prepare for H2’24.Looking ahead  we maintain our growth perspectives for the second part of the fiscal year. We note however that the absorption of RF-SOI inventories at our customers level will last longer than anticipated. At the same time  we continue to expect sustained demand in Automotive & Industrial as well as in Smart Devices. Consequently  we now anticipate a full-fiscal-year revenue decline of around mid-single digit percentage  and an EBITDA margin of around 35%. After this transition year  we will resume our growth trajectory” added Pierre Barnabé.Second quarter FY’24 consolidated revenueQ2’24 Q2’23 Q2’24/Q2’23 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile communications 169 189 -10% -9% Automotive & Industrial 38 34 +12% +13% Smart devices 37 45 -18% -17% Total revenue 245 268 -9% -7%Soitec revenue reached 245 million Euros in the second quarter of FY’24  down 9% on a reported basis compared with 268 million Euros achieved in the second quarter of FY’23. At constant exchange rates and perimeter4  the revenue decreased 7%  lower volumes being only partially offset by a favorable mix effect.Sequentially  second quarter FY’24 revenue was up 56% excluding currency impact compared to the first quarter of FY’24.Mobile CommunicationsIn the second quarter of FY’24  Mobile Communications revenue reached 169 million Euros  up 91% sequentially compared to the first quarter of FY’24 and down 9% year-on-year at constant exchange rates compared to the second quarter of FY’23.As expected  the inventory digestion across the whole smartphone supply chain continued to impact our RF-SOI wafers sales  causing a decrease in revenue as compared to the second quarter of FY'23.On a sequential basis  however  RF-SOI wafer sales were much higher than in the first quarter of FY’24  supported by a greater penetration of high-end smartphones  with continued adoption of 5G and Wi-Fi 6/6E/7 requiring higher content of RF-SOI per smartphone. Further deployment of 5G infrastructure is also contributing to higher sales.Sales of POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafers continued to grow  partially compensating for the year-on-year decrease of RF-SOI wafers sales. Growth was driven by higher volumes from both existing and new customers. Additionally  the Group continues to work with several customers on qualifying Soitec’s POI technology.Sales of FD-SOI wafers continue to show strong year-on-year growth  further demonstrating the value they bring to front end modules integrated in both 5G Sub-6 GHz and 5G mmWave smartphones.Automotive & IndustrialAutomotive & Industrial revenue reached 38 million Euros in the second quarter of FY’24  a 1% sequential growth compared to the first quarter of FY’24 and a 13% year-on-year growth at constant exchange rates compared to the second quarter of FY’23.Demand from the automotive industry continues to be driven by the rise in semiconductor content embedded in the latest generations of vehicles. Soitec products are addressing increasing needs for multimedia and infotainment  functional safety  autonomous and assisted driving  as well as engine electrification.Growth in Automotive & Industrial mostly came from Power-SOI wafers sales  which increased significantly compared to the second quarter of FY’23  reflecting higher volumes and  to a lesser extent  a positive price / mix effect.FD-SOI wafers sales remained strong  mostly driven by adoption for automotive microcontrollers.In addition  Automotive & Industrial continues to benefit from revenue generated by Soitec’s SmartSiCTM technology. Soitec’s new plant dedicated to SmartSiC™ substrates for future generations of electric vehicles was inaugurated late September and production ramp-up is expected in FY’25.Smart DevicesSmart Devices revenue reached 37 million Euros in the second quarter of FY’24  a 21% sequential increase compared to the first quarter of FY’24  but a 17% decline at constant exchange rates compared to the second quarter of FY’23.Products dedicated to Smart devices are supporting the need for more complex sensors  higher connectivity functionalities and embedded intelligence  leading to more powerful and efficient chips for Edge Artificial Intelligence  Image Sensors  Data Centers and Cloud Computing.Compared to the second quarter of FY’23  performance was contrasted between the different products.Sales of FD-SOI wafers were much higher than in the second quarter of FY’23  supported by structural demand for Edge Computing devices across consumer and industrial sectors.Conversely  sales of Photonics-SOI wafers  providing high speed connectivity in the Cloud  and sales of Imager-SOI wafers for 3D imaging applications  were both lower than in the second quarter of FY’23.First half FY’24 consolidated revenueH1’24 H1’23 H1’24/H1’23 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile communications 258 341 -24% -24% Automotive & Industrial 75 57 +31% +31% Smart devices 68 73 -6% -6% Total revenue 401 471 -15% -15%Overall  consolidated revenue reached 401 million Euros in the first half of FY’24  down 15% both on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates and perimeter5 compared to 471 million Euros in the first half of FY’23. This 15% decline is in line with Soitec’s guidance.The decline in revenue essentially reflects lower volumes  partly offset by a small favorable mix effect. Performance was mixed across Soitec’s three end-markets:Mobile Communications revenue reached 258 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 (64% of total revenue)  down 24% on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates compared to the first half of FY’23. The decline essentially reflects the ongoing RF-SOI inventory adjustment across the entire smartphone supply chain. It was  however  partly offset by higher FD-SOI wafer sales and by a significant contribution from POI wafer sales.Automotive & Industrial revenue amounted to 75 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 (19% of total revenue)  up 31% on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates compared to the first half of FY’23. This strong performance was essentially driven by a solid increase in Power-SOI wafer sales  continued strength in automotive FD-SOI  and the revenue generated by SmartSiC TM technology.Smart devices revenue reached 68 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 (17% of total revenue)  down 6% on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates compared to the first half of FY’23. Strong growth in FD-SOI wafer sales was more than offset by lower sales of both Photonics-SOI and Imager-SOI wafers.revenue reached 258 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 (64% of total revenue)  down 24% on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates compared to the first half of FY’23. The decline essentially reflects the ongoing RF-SOI inventory adjustment across the entire smartphone supply chain. It was  however  partly offset by higher FD-SOI wafer sales and by a significant contribution from POI wafer sales.EBITDA1 margin2 maintained at a robust levelConsolidated income statement (part 1)(Euros millions) H1’24 H1’23 % change Revenue 401 471 -15% Gross profit 144 168 -14% As a % of revenue 36.0% 35.6% Net research and development expenses (34) (29) +17% Selling  general and administrative expenses (25) (28) -11% Current operating income 85 110 -23% As a % of revenue 21.3% 23.4% EBITDA1 132 167 -21% As a % of revenue 33.0% 35.5%Current operating income amounted to 85 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 moving from 23.4% of revenue in the first half of FY’23 to 21.3% of revenue in the first half of FY’24:Gross profit reached 144 million Euros in the first half of FY’24  down from 168 million Euros in the first half of FY’23 as a result of lower revenue. Gross margin however recorded a 0.4 point increase  from 35.6% of revenue in the first half of FY’23 to 36.0% of revenue in the first half of FY’24. Soitec achieved a robust gross margin thanks to a favorable mix effect  a good industrial performance  tight costs control  and a positive currency impact  offsetting inflationary cost increases including higher bulk material prices and higher depreciation. Industrial capacity utilization rate was maintained at a satisfactory level as the Group also produced wafers in anticipation of higher second half deliveries.reached 144 million Euros in the first half of FY’24  down from 168 million Euros in the first half of FY’23 as a result of lower revenue.

Selling  general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were down from 28 million Euros in the first half of FY’23 to 25 million Euros in the first half of FY’24  almost stable as a percentage of revenue at 6.3% of revenue compared to 6.0% in the first half FY’23. This is the result of further cost containment actions implemented by the Group.were down from 28 million Euros in the first half of FY’23 to 25 million Euros in the first half of FY’24  almost stable as a percentage of revenue at 6.3% of revenue compared to 6.0% in the first half FY’23. This is the result of further cost containment actions implemented by the Group. While maintaining strong cost control  the Group preserved strategic investments such as innovation for new products development. As a consequence  net R&D expenses increased from 29 million Euros in the first half of FY’23 to 34 million Euros in the first half of FY’24  representing 8.4% of revenue.The EBITDA1 from continuing operations amounted to 132 million Euros in the first half of FY’24  down 21% from 167 million Euros in the first half of FY’23. Soitec however recorded a 33.0% EBITDA1 margin2  a robust level  although lower than the 35.5% margin achieved in the first half of FY’23. This essentially reflect our choice of maintaining a strong level of R&D investment.Consolidated income statement (part 2)(Euros millions) H1’24 H1’23 % change Operating income 86 110 -22% Net financial result 2 (2) Income tax (8) (13) Net profit  Group share 80 95 -16% Basic earnings per share (in €) 2.24 2.72 -18% Diluted earnings per share (in €) 2.19 2.65 -17% Weighted average number of ordinary shares 35 620 925 35 001 682 Weighted average number of diluted ordinary shares 37 623 199 36 951 749The net financial result was a gain of 2 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 compared to a loss of 2 million Euros in the first half of FY’23. In the context of rising interest rates  the Group benefited from a 9 million Euros increase in financial income mainly from cash investments  which has more than offset a 4 million Euros increase in net financial expenses. In addition  the Group recorded a net foreign exchange gain of 3 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 compared to a gain of 4 million Euros in the first half FY’23.Income tax expense amounted to 8 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 compared to 13 million Euros in the first half of FY’23. The lower effective tax rate of 9% compared to 12% in the first half of FY’23 reflects a higher contribution from the Singapore subsidiary  Soitec Microelectronics Singapore Ltd.  to the Group’s results.Negative Free Cash Flow after further increase in capacity investmentsConsolidated cash-flows(Euros millions) H1’24 H1’23 Continuing operations EBITDA1 132 167 Change in working capital (69) (26) Tax paid (19) (15) Net cash generated by operating activities 45 126 Net cash used in investing activities (129) (120) Free Cash Flow (85) 7 Liquidity contract and other items (7) 0 New loans and debt repayment (including finance leases)  drawing on credit lines (32) (15) Financial expenses (6) (3) Net cash used in financing activities (45) (17) Impact of exchange rate fluctuations 2 26 Group net change in cash (127) 15The Group generated a negative Free Cash Flow of 85 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 compared to a 7 million Euros positive Free Cash Flow in the first half of FY’23  as result of lower EBITDA  higher working capital needs  as well as higher capital expenditure to support both the rebound expected in the second part of the fiscal year and future expansion.The cash outflow from working capital amounted to 69 million Euros in the first half of FY’24  compared to 26 million Euros in the first half of FY’23. This is essentially reflecting:a 65 million Euros increase in inventories in anticipation of higher deliveries projected in the second half of the fiscal year a 105 million Euros decrease in trade payables  including non-recurring down payments in connection with the signing of long-term supply agreements partly offset by a 106 million Euros decrease in trade receivables: the level of these receivables was high at the start of the fiscal year after the record level of revenue achieved in the fourth quarter of FY’23.The net cash used in investing activities amounted to 129 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 (120 million Euros in the first half of FY’23). It included 8 million Euros of financial income from cash investment and 138 million Euros of cash out related to capital expenditure reflecting mainly:300-mm SOI production capacity investments  both in Bernin and in Singapore  including refresh capacity in Bernin IV and work related to the extension of Singapore facility the installation of the first SmartSiC™ production capacities capitalized development costs (R&D investments of around 15 million Euros) other investments related to Innovation  Sustainability and IT.Net cash used in financing activities amounted to 45 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 essentially reflecting a net decrease in borrowings and related interest paid  as well as 8 million Euros dedicated to the implementation of a liquidity contract.In total  including a 2 million Euros positive impact of exchange rate fluctuations (26 million Euros in the first half of FY’23)  the net cash outflow reached 127 million Euros the first half of FY’24 (compared to a cash generation of 15 million Euros in the first half of FY’23) leading to a cash position of 661 million Euros on September 30th  2023.Strong Balance sheet maintainedSoitec has maintained a strong balance sheet as of September 30th  2023.Shareholders’ equity increased by 98 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 to 1.4 billion Euros on September 30th  2023  mainly attributed to the net profit generated during the period.Financial debt stood at 682 million Euros on September 30th  2023. This represents a 34 million Euros increase compared to March 31st  2023  mainly resulting from the arrangement of the first tranche of a new leasing debt secured for Bernin IV for 59 million Euros  that was partially offset by the repayment of borrowings for 35 million Euros.As a result of the 34 million Euros increase in financial debt combined with the 127 million Euros cash outflow  the Group went from a net cash position6 of 140 million Euros on March 31st  2023  to a net debt position6 of 21 million Euros on September 30th  2023.FY’24 outlookSoitec confirms growth recovery in the second half of FY’24. Against the backdrop of a weaker-than-expected smartphone market  the extent of the inventory correction at our customers level is greater than anticipated. We confirm strong traction for our Automotive & Industrial and Smart Devices divisions. We now anticipate our FY’24 revenue to slightly decline  by around a mid-single digit percentage  compared to FY’23  at constant exchange rates and perimeter.As a result  FY’24 EBITDA margin is now expected to be around 35% of revenue. The Group will continue to implement cost control measures  while further investing significantly in R&D.FY’24 Capital expenditure is expected to be around 290 million Euros in order to support growth beyond FY’24.Soitec’s growth outlook remain very strong: while the SOI content within end devices continues to increase  the ongoing penetration of the Group’s products across its three end markets and the successful deployment of its expansion into Compound Semiconductors with POI and SmartSiCTM becoming new significant growth drivers in the future.Key events of H1’24Soitec inaugurates new production facility in Bernin dedicated to SmartSiC™ substratesOn September 28th  2023  Soitec inaugurated its new plant in Bernin dedicated to SmartSiC™ substrates for future generations of electric vehicles. The ceremony took place in the presence of Thierry Breton  European Commissioner for the Internal Market and Roland Lescure  French Minister Delegate for Industry. Soitec aims at positioning SmartSiC™  a technology based on silicon carbide (SiC)  as a future electric-vehicle standard with improved efficiency for energy conversion systems. Soitec’s patented SmartCut™ technology allows each conventional monoSiC substrate to be re-used more than 10 times  reducing CO 2 emissions during wafer manufacturing by 70%. The new plant  a key step in the execution of Soitec’s growth ambitions  will be financed through a lease worth 90 million Euros  with a first tranche of 59 million Euros already commissioned. The financing of the new plant is reflected by a 59-million-Euro increase in both tangible assets and financial debt  and has no impact on the Group’s cash flows as of September 30  2023.# # #H1’24 results will be commented during an analyst and investor conference call to be held in English on November 16th  2023  at 8:00am CET.The live webcast and slide presentation will be available on:https://channel.royalcast.com/soitec/#!/soitec/20231116_1# # #AgendaQ3’24 revenue is due to be published on February 7th  2024  after market close.# # #DisclaimerThis document is provided by Soitec (the “Company”) for information purposes only.The Company’s business operations and financial position are described in the Company’s 2022-2023 Universal Registration Document (which notably includes the 2022-2023 Annual Financial Report) which was filed on June 14  2023 with the French stock market authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers  or AMF) under number D.23-0482.

The financial statements3 were approved by the Board of Directors during its meeting today.Pierre Barnabé  Soitec’s CEO  commented: “With a sequential growth of over 50% compared to the first quarter  our second-quarter revenue rebounded significantly  as we had anticipated. This was particularly the case in Mobile Communications as the inventory correction across the smartphone value chain eased. We continue to leverage strong demand in Automotive to deploy our SmartSiCTM roadmap and we continue to progress actively with several customers. Overall  our first half revenue is in line with our expectations. We have maintained strong profitability and a solid financial position  while continuing to invest in R&D and industrial capacity  as well as building inventories to prepare for H2’24.Looking ahead  we maintain our growth perspectives for the second part of the fiscal year. We note however that the absorption of RF-SOI inventories at our customers level will last longer than anticipated. At the same time  we continue to expect sustained demand in Automotive & Industrial as well as in Smart Devices. Consequently  we now anticipate a full-fiscal-year revenue decline of around mid-single digit percentage  and an EBITDA margin of around 35%. After this transition year  we will resume our growth trajectory” added Pierre Barnabé.Second quarter FY’24 consolidated revenueQ2’24 Q2’23 Q2’24/Q2’23 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile communications 169 189 -10% -9% Automotive & Industrial 38 34 +12% +13% Smart devices 37 45 -18% -17% Total revenue 245 268 -9% -7%Soitec revenue reached 245 million Euros in the second quarter of FY’24  down 9% on a reported basis compared with 268 million Euros achieved in the second quarter of FY’23. At constant exchange rates and perimeter4  the revenue decreased 7%  lower volumes being only partially offset by a favorable mix effect.Sequentially  second quarter FY’24 revenue was up 56% excluding currency impact compared to the first quarter of FY’24.Mobile CommunicationsIn the second quarter of FY’24  Mobile Communications revenue reached 169 million Euros  up 91% sequentially compared to the first quarter of FY’24 and down 9% year-on-year at constant exchange rates compared to the second quarter of FY’23.As expected  the inventory digestion across the whole smartphone supply chain continued to impact our RF-SOI wafers sales  causing a decrease in revenue as compared to the second quarter of FY'23.On a sequential basis  however  RF-SOI wafer sales were much higher than in the first quarter of FY’24  supported by a greater penetration of high-end smartphones  with continued adoption of 5G and Wi-Fi 6/6E/7 requiring higher content of RF-SOI per smartphone. Further deployment of 5G infrastructure is also contributing to higher sales.Sales of POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafers continued to grow  partially compensating for the year-on-year decrease of RF-SOI wafers sales. Growth was driven by higher volumes from both existing and new customers. Additionally  the Group continues to work with several customers on qualifying Soitec’s POI technology.Sales of FD-SOI wafers continue to show strong year-on-year growth  further demonstrating the value they bring to front end modules integrated in both 5G Sub-6 GHz and 5G mmWave smartphones.Automotive & IndustrialAutomotive & Industrial revenue reached 38 million Euros in the second quarter of FY’24  a 1% sequential growth compared to the first quarter of FY’24 and a 13% year-on-year growth at constant exchange rates compared to the second quarter of FY’23.Demand from the automotive industry continues to be driven by the rise in semiconductor content embedded in the latest generations of vehicles. Soitec products are addressing increasing needs for multimedia and infotainment  functional safety  autonomous and assisted driving  as well as engine electrification.Growth in Automotive & Industrial mostly came from Power-SOI wafers sales  which increased significantly compared to the second quarter of FY’23  reflecting higher volumes and  to a lesser extent  a positive price / mix effect.FD-SOI wafers sales remained strong  mostly driven by adoption for automotive microcontrollers.In addition  Automotive & Industrial continues to benefit from revenue generated by Soitec’s SmartSiCTM technology. Soitec’s new plant dedicated to SmartSiC™ substrates for future generations of electric vehicles was inaugurated late September and production ramp-up is expected in FY’25.Smart DevicesSmart Devices revenue reached 37 million Euros in the second quarter of FY’24  a 21% sequential increase compared to the first quarter of FY’24  but a 17% decline at constant exchange rates compared to the second quarter of FY’23.Products dedicated to Smart devices are supporting the need for more complex sensors  higher connectivity functionalities and embedded intelligence  leading to more powerful and efficient chips for Edge Artificial Intelligence  Image Sensors  Data Centers and Cloud Computing.Compared to the second quarter of FY’23  performance was contrasted between the different products.Sales of FD-SOI wafers were much higher than in the second quarter of FY’23  supported by structural demand for Edge Computing devices across consumer and industrial sectors.Conversely  sales of Photonics-SOI wafers  providing high speed connectivity in the Cloud  and sales of Imager-SOI wafers for 3D imaging applications  were both lower than in the second quarter of FY’23.First half FY’24 consolidated revenueH1’24 H1’23 H1’24/H1’23 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile communications 258 341 -24% -24% Automotive & Industrial 75 57 +31% +31% Smart devices 68 73 -6% -6% Total revenue 401 471 -15% -15%Overall  consolidated revenue reached 401 million Euros in the first half of FY’24  down 15% both on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates and perimeter5 compared to 471 million Euros in the first half of FY’23. This 15% decline is in line with Soitec’s guidance.The decline in revenue essentially reflects lower volumes  partly offset by a small favorable mix effect. Performance was mixed across Soitec’s three end-markets:Mobile Communications revenue reached 258 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 (64% of total revenue)  down 24% on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates compared to the first half of FY’23. The decline essentially reflects the ongoing RF-SOI inventory adjustment across the entire smartphone supply chain. It was  however  partly offset by higher FD-SOI wafer sales and by a significant contribution from POI wafer sales.Automotive & Industrial revenue amounted to 75 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 (19% of total revenue)  up 31% on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates compared to the first half of FY’23. This strong performance was essentially driven by a solid increase in Power-SOI wafer sales  continued strength in automotive FD-SOI  and the revenue generated by SmartSiC TM technology.Smart devices revenue reached 68 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 (17% of total revenue)  down 6% on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates compared to the first half of FY’23. Strong growth in FD-SOI wafer sales was more than offset by lower sales of both Photonics-SOI and Imager-SOI wafers.revenue reached 258 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 (64% of total revenue)  down 24% on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates compared to the first half of FY’23.

Gross margin however recorded a 0.4 point increase  from 35.6% of revenue in the first half of FY’23 to 36.0% of revenue in the first half of FY’24. Soitec achieved a robust gross margin thanks to a favorable mix effect  a good industrial performance  tight costs control  and a positive currency impact  offsetting inflationary cost increases including higher bulk material prices and higher depreciation.

This is the result of further cost containment actions implemented by the Group. While maintaining strong cost control  the Group preserved strategic investments such as innovation for new products development. As a consequence  net R&D expenses increased from 29 million Euros in the first half of FY’23 to 34 million Euros in the first half of FY’24  representing 8.4% of revenue.The EBITDA1 from continuing operations amounted to 132 million Euros in the first half of FY’24  down 21% from 167 million Euros in the first half of FY’23. Soitec however recorded a 33.0% EBITDA1 margin2  a robust level  although lower than the 35.5% margin achieved in the first half of FY’23. This essentially reflect our choice of maintaining a strong level of R&D investment.Consolidated income statement (part 2)(Euros millions) H1’24 H1’23 % change Operating income 86 110 -22% Net financial result 2 (2) Income tax (8) (13) Net profit  Group share 80 95 -16% Basic earnings per share (in €) 2.24 2.72 -18% Diluted earnings per share (in €) 2.19 2.65 -17% Weighted average number of ordinary shares 35 620 925 35 001 682 Weighted average number of diluted ordinary shares 37 623 199 36 951 749The net financial result was a gain of 2 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 compared to a loss of 2 million Euros in the first half of FY’23. In the context of rising interest rates  the Group benefited from a 9 million Euros increase in financial income mainly from cash investments  which has more than offset a 4 million Euros increase in net financial expenses. In addition  the Group recorded a net foreign exchange gain of 3 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 compared to a gain of 4 million Euros in the first half FY’23.Income tax expense amounted to 8 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 compared to 13 million Euros in the first half of FY’23. The lower effective tax rate of 9% compared to 12% in the first half of FY’23 reflects a higher contribution from the Singapore subsidiary  Soitec Microelectronics Singapore Ltd.  to the Group’s results.Negative Free Cash Flow after further increase in capacity investmentsConsolidated cash-flows(Euros millions) H1’24 H1’23 Continuing operations EBITDA1 132 167 Change in working capital (69) (26) Tax paid (19) (15) Net cash generated by operating activities 45 126 Net cash used in investing activities (129) (120) Free Cash Flow (85) 7 Liquidity contract and other items (7) 0 New loans and debt repayment (including finance leases)  drawing on credit lines (32) (15) Financial expenses (6) (3) Net cash used in financing activities (45) (17) Impact of exchange rate fluctuations 2 26 Group net change in cash (127) 15The Group generated a negative Free Cash Flow of 85 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 compared to a 7 million Euros positive Free Cash Flow in the first half of FY’23  as result of lower EBITDA  higher working capital needs  as well as higher capital expenditure to support both the rebound expected in the second part of the fiscal year and future expansion.The cash outflow from working capital amounted to 69 million Euros in the first half of FY’24  compared to 26 million Euros in the first half of FY’23. This is essentially reflecting:a 65 million Euros increase in inventories in anticipation of higher deliveries projected in the second half of the fiscal year a 105 million Euros decrease in trade payables  including non-recurring down payments in connection with the signing of long-term supply agreements partly offset by a 106 million Euros decrease in trade receivables: the level of these receivables was high at the start of the fiscal year after the record level of revenue achieved in the fourth quarter of FY’23.The net cash used in investing activities amounted to 129 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 (120 million Euros in the first half of FY’23). It included 8 million Euros of financial income from cash investment and 138 million Euros of cash out related to capital expenditure reflecting mainly:300-mm SOI production capacity investments  both in Bernin and in Singapore  including refresh capacity in Bernin IV and work related to the extension of Singapore facility the installation of the first SmartSiC™ production capacities capitalized development costs (R&D investments of around 15 million Euros) other investments related to Innovation  Sustainability and IT.Net cash used in financing activities amounted to 45 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 essentially reflecting a net decrease in borrowings and related interest paid  as well as 8 million Euros dedicated to the implementation of a liquidity contract.In total  including a 2 million Euros positive impact of exchange rate fluctuations (26 million Euros in the first half of FY’23)  the net cash outflow reached 127 million Euros the first half of FY’24 (compared to a cash generation of 15 million Euros in the first half of FY’23) leading to a cash position of 661 million Euros on September 30th  2023.Strong Balance sheet maintainedSoitec has maintained a strong balance sheet as of September 30th  2023.Shareholders’ equity increased by 98 million Euros in the first half of FY’24 to 1.4 billion Euros on September 30th  2023  mainly attributed to the net profit generated during the period.Financial debt stood at 682 million Euros on September 30th  2023. This represents a 34 million Euros increase compared to March 31st  2023  mainly resulting from the arrangement of the first tranche of a new leasing debt secured for Bernin IV for 59 million Euros  that was partially offset by the repayment of borrowings for 35 million Euros.As a result of the 34 million Euros increase in financial debt combined with the 127 million Euros cash outflow  the Group went from a net cash position6 of 140 million Euros on March 31st  2023  to a net debt position6 of 21 million Euros on September 30th  2023.FY’24 outlookSoitec confirms growth recovery in the second half of FY’24. Against the backdrop of a weaker-than-expected smartphone market  the extent of the inventory correction at our customers level is greater than anticipated. We confirm strong traction for our Automotive & Industrial and Smart Devices divisions. We now anticipate our FY’24 revenue to slightly decline  by around a mid-single digit percentage  compared to FY’23  at constant exchange rates and perimeter.As a result  FY’24 EBITDA margin is now expected to be around 35% of revenue. The Group will continue to implement cost control measures  while further investing significantly in R&D.FY’24 Capital expenditure is expected to be around 290 million Euros in order to support growth beyond FY’24.Soitec’s growth outlook remain very strong: while the SOI content within end devices continues to increase  the ongoing penetration of the Group’s products across its three end markets and the successful deployment of its expansion into Compound Semiconductors with POI and SmartSiCTM becoming new significant growth drivers in the future.Key events of H1’24Soitec inaugurates new production facility in Bernin dedicated to SmartSiC™ substratesOn September 28th  2023  Soitec inaugurated its new plant in Bernin dedicated to SmartSiC™ substrates for future generations of electric vehicles.
