Flak  InterDist and AS Labruna specialize in marine equipment and marine accessories  have an established distribution network in their home markets and primarily supply retailers whose range is aimed at sailors  boat owners and marine enthusiasts.In recent years  the marine leisure market in Europe has enjoyed increasing popularity and this trend is expected to continue in the future. To better tap the resulting potential  SFC Energy has expanded its partner network in the marine leisure sector in different country markets. Through the new cooperations with the three marine distributors  which are active in European countries with long coastlines  SFC Energy addresses an even larger group of end users with its fuel cell technology for sail and power boats. This gives even more end customers the opportunity to equip their dream boat with an EFOY fuel cell.With its fuel cell solutions  SFC Energy has nearly 20 years of expertise in powering recreational boats. Sailors and boaters benefit from this experience in the form of powerful and sustainable EFOY fuel cells  which are offered in several power classes up to a maximum output of 125 watts. SFC Energy's methanol-based energy harvesting systems are lightweight and compact  making them space-saving on board. They are connected directly to the onboard battery and produce environmentally friendly electricity on demand  which can be used to reliably power the complete onboard electronics without interruption. In addition  the electrical energy from the EFOY fuel cells can also be used to recharge the batteries of electric motors  thereby increasing their range. SFC Energy's fuel cells can also be combined with solar panels installed on the boat to supply the onboard battery with electricity in good weather. The EFOY then takes over the energy supply in bad weather  at night or in winter. Another advantage is that the SFC power sources automatically switch on when the battery needs to be charged and switch off again when the charge is sufficient. This eliminates long charging times for the battery  with energy transfer for the battery or electric motor occurring smoothly and quickly. In operation  the direct methanol fuel cell solution is virtually silent  unlike fossil-fueled generators  and is very economical with its operating fuel  methanol.""Anyone familiar with our company's beginnings knows that energy supply in the recreational boating sector is a tradition for us. For almost two decades  we have been offering sailors and boaters a reliable  self-sufficient and climate-friendly power source with our EFOY direct methanol fuel cells. By cooperating with marine distributors Flak  InterDist and Labruna  we have significantly strengthened our partner network and opened up new sales channels. Accordingly  this enables us to further advance the market penetration of our products in various countries. This will benefit our new partners  the sailing community and especially the environment "" says Christian Böhm  Senior Vice President Sales of SFC Energy AG.For more information on SFC Energy's Clean Energy and Clean Power Management solutions  visit www.sfc.com.SFC Energy AG (www.sfc.com) is a leading provider of hydrogen and direct methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions.

In the 4th quarter  we will focus on the planned deliveries for 2023 and continue building the future  while also preparing for the major sport events in 2024. All order intake secured in the final months of the year will contribute to support our growth in 2024.HighlightsRevenue performance continues the strong momentum from the first quarters of the year supporting our growth ambition for 2023.The secured revenue* allows EVS to confirm that the high-end range of the existing revenue guidance (EUR 160 - 170 million) is within reach.Gross margin levels continue to improve and operational expenses are under control  demonstrating our objective to realize a profitable growth in 2023.In line with the evolution of the revenue guidance  EVS confirms that the EBIT guidance is shaping up towards the high-end of the existing range (EUR 32.5 - 38.5 million).*secured revenue includes the already recognized revenue as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in 2023CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO  comments:“I am pleased to announce our third-quarter results and provide an update on EVS’ performance and outlook. As we enter the final quarter of the year  I am proud to report that we are well on track to deliver full-year revenue and profit results at the high end of our guidance. Our commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction remains at the forefront of our strategy  and we have seen strong affirmation of this at the recent IBC event in Amsterdam. The feedback we received from our customers on our solution offering and innovations  including Mediaception VIA MAP and our artificial intelligence-powered live video effects  such as XtraMotion  has been overwhelmingly positive.Notably  our Net Promoter Score (NPS) continues to increase  as indicated by the recent survey conducted by Devoncroft  reflecting the growing satisfaction of our customers. This serves as a testament to the dedication of our team members  as demonstrated by our yearly team member engagement survey  which underscores their strong commitment to our company's mission and values.We are equally delighted with our Environmental  Social  and Governance (ESG) progress  which was recently recognized with a Corporate Star Award at IBC in Amsterdam. Our ongoing efforts in this area reinforce our dedication to responsible business practices.While we remain optimistic about our company's trajectory  we must exercise caution in the face of global uncertainties. The ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza have the potential to impact our Western economy  which could  in turn  influence our industry. Additionally  the prospect of increasing interest rates and slowing advertisement spending might slow down the investment pace of some of our customers.We remain dedicated to delivering value to our customers and stakeholders and will continue to focus on innovation  customer satisfaction  and sustainable growth.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:“We continue to see momentum in our revenue performance and thanks to a sound margin and cost management  this momentum results into a profitable growth for 2023.Besides a strong income statement  we continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet. Our net cash position is at sound debt levels and our balance sheet metrics continue to improve compared to the year 2022.Securing 2023 is a top priority for our production team  however  the preparations for the Big Events of 2024 are starting at the same time resulting in part of our production capacity being reserved to prepare these.Based on the current metrics and the underlying market conditions  we are confident enough to confirm that the high-end range of our revenue guidance is within reach (EUR 170 million).Consequently  our EBIT performance is shaping up towards the high-end of the range (current range being EUR 32.5 - 38.5 million). This performance would mark a tremendous year for EVS. ”Market & customersThe main drivers of EVS in the “Premium Live Ecosystem” remain the same as in 2022 but with higher revenues  proving the success of the PlayForward strategy approach oriented towards solutions.On the LAB side  MediaCeption continues to successfully spread within EMEA region with a new multi-site installation that has gone “on-air” early September for Oman TV studios in Muscat & Salalah.On the LSP side  LiveCeption signature continues to support the upgrade of XT-VIA servers  as for CloudBass  the largest independent dedicated Outside Broadcast company in the United Kingdom and for VideoCraft  a prominent supplier of video production equipment and broadcast facilities in Australia. Both customers will upgrade their full fleet and beyond  leveraging the capabilities of LSM-VIA to deliver engaging live replays and highlights.The traction for MediaInfra products division continues  especially in NALA and in EMEA. Cerebrum is now successfully spreading in all regions as the reference for a multi-vendor control system. Neuron allows customers all over the planet to save energy while serving the different applications to transform broadcast signals.EVS continues to manage carefully the inventory of components to deliver the hardware based products according to the promise. EVS also continuously monitors inflation to reflect it progressively in the pricing and business model evolutions.TechnologiesEVS continues to materialize the Balanced Computing strategy through new solutions. At IBC  Besides XtraMotion Edge that can be deployed on-premise  EVS did show a range of new AI based XtraServices to create higher return on emotion.EVS also improved the LiveCeption solution  bringing a new version of XNET-VIA which decreases the delay when accessing content stored on a distant XT-VIA from a local XT-VIA. This brings unequalled support for remote production when the infrastructure is split between two different well connected sites.The VIA MAP (Media Asset Platform) – announced at IBC – is the new content management platform that brings together the world of live production and creation and that of content distribution and sharing in a cohesive  integrated and open environment.Neuron View – the new multiviewer on top of the carbon footprint optimized Neuron platform – is nicely complementing the portfolio of Media Infrastructure applications and increases the relevance of the platform for many customers and use cases.EVS’ Xeebra multi-review system recently obtained the FIFA Offside Technology (OT) and the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) certifications following a rigorous series of tests in Offenbach  Germany  reaffirming precision  speed & reliability.As an innovative end-to-end pilot project  EVS has designed a “Flex Production” solution utilizing many different capabilities of 5G technology  in collaboration with Orange Belgium  to bring live theater performances to schools in the Walloon and Brussels regions of Belgium  thus making cultural events accessible to more than 10 000 students.Corporate topicsWe focused our corporate efforts in 2023 on supporting our profitable and sustainable growth objective. Our corporate ditigtal transformation roadmap focusses on creating tools to ensure scale up and flawless operations. We are also focusing our attention to optimizing our cost structure with pro-active focus on travel expenses  trade shows  power consumption  etc.. Within Research and Development we ensure the required bandwith to ramp up our sustainability efforts  especially when it comes to the design and energy consumption of our solutions.From a tooling point of view we want to ensure that we have efficient processes in place that promote end-to-end collaboration across all our departments. Having an efficient operational back-bone is important to us. After an initial launch of a new global ERP system in October 2022  we have integrated in 2023 the final legal entities within this global framework. We are now operating at global scale on one footprint  with global operations and economies of scale. Next to the ERP we are also expanding our corporate digital footprint (CRM  Via Portal  LMS  Via Licensing  …)We continue to monitor the macro-economic environment and assess the profitability of our solutions. Our pricing strategy is reviewed regularly  as to ensure we stay ahead of the curve.When it comes to ESG  we have focused in 2023 on creating long term objectives for all the topics that are most relevant and important to us as a company. We have also reviewed our materiality matrix and we will start improvement tracks to measure our carbon footprint in a qualitative way. We will also create a data governance around ESG KPI’s in preparation of CSRD.In terms of team members  we have kept our base rather flat in the first half of 2023. In the second half  based also on the growth perspectives  we have decided to accelerate some hirings. As such  we expect a moderate increase in our team member base in the last quarter of the year.On November 24th  2023  EVS will hold its investor day at the EVS premises in Liège. Investors can subscribe using the link: https://evs.com/evs-investor-dayOutlookThe 2023 secured revenue allows us to confirm that the high-end range of the existing revenue guidance is within reach (EUR 160 - 170 million).Thanks to the strong topline performance  the gross margin for the full year 2023 is expected to increase . The investments from the past in our operations & support structure are fully covered by additional revenue growth. Next to that  we see the gross margin by solution growing  as a result of our pricing strategy.Operational expenses continue to be closely monitored and controlled. As our focus in 2023 is on profitable and sustainable growth  this balance is critically important. As such  we have seen little changes in our overall headcount position in 1H23. Since 3Q23 we are againg investing in additional team members  as to ensure we prepare for future growth. There will be a marginal increase in our overall headcount position in 2H 2023.Next to our revenue gudiance firming up  we also confirm that the high-end range of our EBIT guidance is within reach (EUR 32.5 - 38.5 million).Interim dividendThe Board of Directors has decided to pay an interim dividend of 0.50 EUR per share.

In the 4th quarter  we will focus on the planned deliveries for 2023 and continue building the future  while also preparing for the major sport events in 2024. All order intake secured in the final months of the year will contribute to support our growth in 2024.HighlightsRevenue performance continues the strong momentum from the first quarters of the year supporting our growth ambition for 2023.The secured revenue* allows EVS to confirm that the high-end range of the existing revenue guidance (EUR 160 - 170 million) is within reach.Gross margin levels continue to improve and operational expenses are under control  demonstrating our objective to realize a profitable growth in 2023.In line with the evolution of the revenue guidance  EVS confirms that the EBIT guidance is shaping up towards the high-end of the existing range (EUR 32.5 - 38.5 million).*secured revenue includes the already recognized revenue as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in 2023CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO  comments:“I am pleased to announce our third-quarter results and provide an update on EVS’ performance and outlook. As we enter the final quarter of the year  I am proud to report that we are well on track to deliver full-year revenue and profit results at the high end of our guidance. Our commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction remains at the forefront of our strategy  and we have seen strong affirmation of this at the recent IBC event in Amsterdam. The feedback we received from our customers on our solution offering and innovations  including Mediaception VIA MAP and our artificial intelligence-powered live video effects  such as XtraMotion  has been overwhelmingly positive.Notably  our Net Promoter Score (NPS) continues to increase  as indicated by the recent survey conducted by Devoncroft  reflecting the growing satisfaction of our customers. This serves as a testament to the dedication of our team members  as demonstrated by our yearly team member engagement survey  which underscores their strong commitment to our company's mission and values.We are equally delighted with our Environmental  Social  and Governance (ESG) progress  which was recently recognized with a Corporate Star Award at IBC in Amsterdam. Our ongoing efforts in this area reinforce our dedication to responsible business practices.While we remain optimistic about our company's trajectory  we must exercise caution in the face of global uncertainties. The ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza have the potential to impact our Western economy  which could  in turn  influence our industry. Additionally  the prospect of increasing interest rates and slowing advertisement spending might slow down the investment pace of some of our customers.We remain dedicated to delivering value to our customers and stakeholders and will continue to focus on innovation  customer satisfaction  and sustainable growth.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:“We continue to see momentum in our revenue performance and thanks to a sound margin and cost management  this momentum results into a profitable growth for 2023.Besides a strong income statement  we continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet. Our net cash position is at sound debt levels and our balance sheet metrics continue to improve compared to the year 2022.Securing 2023 is a top priority for our production team  however  the preparations for the Big Events of 2024 are starting at the same time resulting in part of our production capacity being reserved to prepare these.Based on the current metrics and the underlying market conditions  we are confident enough to confirm that the high-end range of our revenue guidance is within reach (EUR 170 million).Consequently  our EBIT performance is shaping up towards the high-end of the range (current range being EUR 32.5 - 38.5 million). This performance would mark a tremendous year for EVS. ”Market & customersThe main drivers of EVS in the “Premium Live Ecosystem” remain the same as in 2022 but with higher revenues  proving the success of the PlayForward strategy approach oriented towards solutions.On the LAB side  MediaCeption continues to successfully spread within EMEA region with a new multi-site installation that has gone “on-air” early September for Oman TV studios in Muscat & Salalah.On the LSP side  LiveCeption signature continues to support the upgrade of XT-VIA servers  as for CloudBass  the largest independent dedicated Outside Broadcast company in the United Kingdom and for VideoCraft  a prominent supplier of video production equipment and broadcast facilities in Australia. Both customers will upgrade their full fleet and beyond  leveraging the capabilities of LSM-VIA to deliver engaging live replays and highlights.The traction for MediaInfra products division continues  especially in NALA and in EMEA. Cerebrum is now successfully spreading in all regions as the reference for a multi-vendor control system. Neuron allows customers all over the planet to save energy while serving the different applications to transform broadcast signals.EVS continues to manage carefully the inventory of components to deliver the hardware based products according to the promise. EVS also continuously monitors inflation to reflect it progressively in the pricing and business model evolutions.TechnologiesEVS continues to materialize the Balanced Computing strategy through new solutions. At IBC  Besides XtraMotion Edge that can be deployed on-premise  EVS did show a range of new AI based XtraServices to create higher return on emotion.EVS also improved the LiveCeption solution  bringing a new version of XNET-VIA which decreases the delay when accessing content stored on a distant XT-VIA from a local XT-VIA. This brings unequalled support for remote production when the infrastructure is split between two different well connected sites.The VIA MAP (Media Asset Platform) – announced at IBC – is the new content management platform that brings together the world of live production and creation and that of content distribution and sharing in a cohesive  integrated and open environment.Neuron View – the new multiviewer on top of the carbon footprint optimized Neuron platform – is nicely complementing the portfolio of Media Infrastructure applications and increases the relevance of the platform for many customers and use cases.EVS’ Xeebra multi-review system recently obtained the FIFA Offside Technology (OT) and the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) certifications following a rigorous series of tests in Offenbach  Germany  reaffirming precision  speed & reliability.As an innovative end-to-end pilot project  EVS has designed a “Flex Production” solution utilizing many different capabilities of 5G technology  in collaboration with Orange Belgium  to bring live theater performances to schools in the Walloon and Brussels regions of Belgium  thus making cultural events accessible to more than 10 000 students.Corporate topicsWe focused our corporate efforts in 2023 on supporting our profitable and sustainable growth objective. Our corporate ditigtal transformation roadmap focusses on creating tools to ensure scale up and flawless operations. We are also focusing our attention to optimizing our cost structure with pro-active focus on travel expenses  trade shows  power consumption  etc.. Within Research and Development we ensure the required bandwith to ramp up our sustainability efforts  especially when it comes to the design and energy consumption of our solutions.From a tooling point of view we want to ensure that we have efficient processes in place that promote end-to-end collaboration across all our departments. Having an efficient operational back-bone is important to us. After an initial launch of a new global ERP system in October 2022  we have integrated in 2023 the final legal entities within this global framework. We are now operating at global scale on one footprint  with global operations and economies of scale. Next to the ERP we are also expanding our corporate digital footprint (CRM  Via Portal  LMS  Via Licensing  …)We continue to monitor the macro-economic environment and assess the profitability of our solutions. Our pricing strategy is reviewed regularly  as to ensure we stay ahead of the curve.When it comes to ESG  we have focused in 2023 on creating long term objectives for all the topics that are most relevant and important to us as a company. We have also reviewed our materiality matrix and we will start improvement tracks to measure our carbon footprint in a qualitative way. We will also create a data governance around ESG KPI’s in preparation of CSRD.In terms of team members  we have kept our base rather flat in the first half of 2023. In the second half  based also on the growth perspectives  we have decided to accelerate some hirings. As such  we expect a moderate increase in our team member base in the last quarter of the year.On November 24th  2023  EVS will hold its investor day at the EVS premises in Liège. Investors can subscribe using the link: https://evs.com/evs-investor-dayOutlookThe 2023 secured revenue allows us to confirm that the high-end range of the existing revenue guidance is within reach (EUR 160 - 170 million).Thanks to the strong topline performance  the gross margin for the full year 2023 is expected to increase . The investments from the past in our operations & support structure are fully covered by additional revenue growth. Next to that  we see the gross margin by solution growing  as a result of our pricing strategy.Operational expenses continue to be closely monitored and controlled. As our focus in 2023 is on profitable and sustainable growth  this balance is critically important. As such  we have seen little changes in our overall headcount position in 1H23. Since 3Q23 we are againg investing in additional team members  as to ensure we prepare for future growth. There will be a marginal increase in our overall headcount position in 2H 2023.Next to our revenue gudiance firming up  we also confirm that the high-end range of our EBIT guidance is within reach (EUR 32.5 - 38.5 million).Interim dividendThe Board of Directors has decided to pay an interim dividend of 0.50 EUR per share.

The event  held November 8 at the Society for Corporate Governance’s Middle Atlantic Chapter Fall Conference  centered on the importance of preparation for complying with one of the most significant regulations to impact small businesses in decades.The new reporting requirement will require millions of businesses to file a Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) Report with FinCEN. The new rule is part of the Corporate Transparency Act  with FinCEN issuing the regulation and providing the details on who must file a BOI report  when the report has to be filed  and what information has to be reported.Beverly Odom  Business Consultant at Wolters Kluwer CT Corporation  shared how service companies and law firms are developing processes and utilizing expert solutions to support companies and individuals who will need to comply with the federal rules. Pointing to a July 2023 Wolters Kluwer survey of 997 small businesses  law firms  and CPA firms  she noted that awareness about the rule was surprisingly low at that time  despite the significant number of companies that will be subject to the beneficial ownership reporting requirement.“We were surprised by the lack of awareness among survey respondents on new beneficial ownership rules taking effect in just a few months ” said Odom. “Of respondents whose organization is likely subject to the new requirements  74% acknowledged that they had not even heard of the new rule before they participated in our online survey.”She also pointed out how this regulation is a sea change in terms of entity creation by involving the federal government which  prior to this Act  did not require notification when entities were created at the state level. It was also noted that states are not obligated to notify those who are formulating a new entity about the new BOI requirement  adding a new twist to the traditional approach in entity formulation.“Our efforts in helping generate visibility around the new beneficial ownership reporting requirements is emblematic of how Wolters Kluwer is working across the industry to provide information  resources  and support for professional advisors and businesses to increase awareness about critical regulatory obligations such as those reflected in the Corporate Transparency Act ” said Odom.Phil Lam  Beneficial Ownership and Innovation Chief at FinCEN  encouraged attendees to get started promptly in exploring the various resources available at https://www.fincen.gov/boi  including confirming which entities are subject to the Act and the steps needed to comply.More information on navigating the new beneficial ownership rule is available by visiting the CTA Resources page.For more than 130 years  Wolters Kluwer CT Corporation has been the leading provider of registered agent services  incorporation services  and legal entity compliance.

This makes Nexium SafeCore the first and only NFVi system to be certified at this level.Nexium SafeCore is designed for armed forces  security services  governments  public agencies and defence contractors  as well as critical infrastructure providers with particularly high security requirements[2].Security and reliability: The advantages of network virtualisationWhether deploying special forces into a theatre of operations or setting up an emergency field hospital for civilian populations  it is becoming more and more important to be able to quickly project secure networks and communications into the areas where they are needed most. Off-the-shelf functions (routers  encryptors  firewalls  satcom links  4G/5G services and LOS radios) are typically used to meet the urgent need for connectivity and secure network solutions that are quick and easy to deploy. Critical infrastructure providers  working within strict information system security requirements  face similar challenges. Deployment of resilient critical infrastructure typically involves many different types of equipment  pushing up size  weight and power requirements and making vital through-life support and security maintenance ever more challenging.Virtualisation is the ideal technology for deploying these new networks  just as it is today for hosting applications.A network function virtualisation infrastructure abstracts a machine's hardware resources as software and pools them with the network for use by virtual machines (VMs). Nexium SafeCore's secure-by-design approach and proprietary source code make it possible to partition these VMs from each other  from the platform and from IP traffic passing through  keeping communications secure.""The ANSSI certification held by Nexium SafeCore  our sovereign network virtualisation solution  reflects its high levels of security and reliability for use in critical infrastructure and military theatres of operations  which demand unmatched agility  security and size  weight and power performance. It is the only solution with this level of certification to provide such a broad range of services and benefits. Its certification speaks to the successful deployment of Nexium SafeCore on various French defence ministry programmes "" said Jean-Claude Schmitt  VP Networks and Infrastructure Systems  Thales.Boosting operational capabilitiesBy bringing KVM-based virtualisation to standard x86 machines and adapting the technology to each use case  Nexium SafeCore offers forces significant operational gains. The solution reduces equipment size by a factor of three to five or more  cuts energy use by up to seven times depending on equipment type  and makes systems easier to transport  sustain and secure. In terms of security  the solution supports emergency deletion of security keys  remote addition of services such as Cybels Sensor  data encryption using MISTRAL  custom configurations and reliable reboot after unplanned power outages.The Nexium SafeCore solution is designed for use both by armed forces and by critical national infrastructure providers  offering flexible  scalable virtualisation without compromising on security or reliability.1Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure2Including France's Réferentiel général de sécurité (RGS) protection rules stipulated by Interministerial Order #901 and security recommendations published by ANSSI  ENISA and the DGA  France's defence procurement agency.About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies within three domains: Defence & Security  Aeronautics & Space  and Digital Identity & Security.

The need to finance this project of unprecedented scale radically transformed the US financial system  changing its destiny forever ” she said.The capital needs of railways sparked a dramatic scale up in size for capital markets and eventually a need for the SEC  created in the 1930s  to police the US as a single authority.The EU will also need a ""single rulebook"" for financial markets and a unified watchdog  ""that would empower private entities to expand their ambitions in fostering high-growth private investments "" she said.",neutral,0.16,0.76,0.08,negative,0.02,0.4,0.58,True,English,"['enlarged capital markets', 'powerful agency', 'ECB', 'Lagarde', 'EU', 'European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde', 'existing key capital markets infrastructure', 'Dublin stock market operator', 'new Corporate Enforcement Authority', 'A capital markets union', 'existing European Securities', 'powerful European Union', 'Irish Takeover Panel', 'unified capital market', 'regionally important hubs', 'large scale capital', 'genuine EU alternative', 'high-growth private investments', 'fragmented financial markets', 'US financial system', 'President Lagarde', 'Markets Authority', 'European agency', 'capital needs', 'fragmented landscape', 'important lesson', 'limited authority', 'single authority', 'unified watchdog', 'private entities', 'securities watchdog', 'US Securities', 'Exchange Commission', 'national level', 'emerging needs', 'climate change', 'economic transformation', 'broad mandate', 'Member states', 'overlapping responsibilities', '19th century', 'flung corners', 'United States', 'unprecedented scale', 'dramatic scale', 'single rulebook', 'EU agenda', 'EU reach', 'indispensable project', 'direct supervision', 'domestic agencies', 'US railroads', 'equivalent', 'speech', 'Friday', 'requirement', 'creation', 'CMU', 'Brexit', 'City', 'London', 'bloc', 'smaller', 'Paris', 'Frankfurt', 'Milan', 'progress', 'history', 'capacities', 'turn', 'problem', 'ESMA', 'Ireland', 'Euronext', 'CEA', 'example', 'powers', 'answer', 'challenges', 'globalisation', 'demographics', 'carbonisation', 'funding', 'far', 'destiny', 'railways', 'size', '1930s', 'ambitions']",2023-11-17,2023-11-18,independent.ie

These chips usually play a supporting role to the sexier “digital brain” that is the latest and greatest processor from Nvidia  Intel  AMD  Apple  or Qualcomm. While the digital brains get a lot more media attention  the supporting analog chips are as vital as those big expensive digital processors in driving value in electronic devices  which are becoming ubiquitous and intelligent throughout our lives. Anything with an on-off switch requires lots of these analog chips if it is going to relay input and output information with the physical world as well as manage the electrical power supply feeding the device.

(NYSE:CPNG) owns and operates an e-commerce business through its mobile applications and Internet websites primarily in South Korea. According to latest filings  the investment firm led by Rothschild owned 1.4 million shares in Coupang  Inc. (NYSE:CPNG) at the end of the third quarter of 2023 worth 23.9 million  representing 6.10% of the portfolio.On November 9  investment advisory Bank of America maintained a Neutral rating on Coupang  Inc. (NYSE:CPNG) stock and lowered the price target to $20 from $22  noting the firm remained one of the best-managed firms in the coverage of the advisory.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey  Dallas-based investment firm Maverick Capital is a leading shareholder in Coupang  Inc. (NYSE:CPNG) with 77 million shares worth more than $1.3 billion.In its Q3 2023 investor letter  Baron Funds  an asset management firm  highlighted a few stocks and Coupang  Inc. (NYSE:CPNG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Coupang is a leading Korean e-commerce company founded in 2010. It went public in March of 2021  and we have been investors in this Fund since the IPO. After spending half a day with management  touring the company’s fulfillment center  asking questions  and learning more about the reasons behind the remarkable success the company has achieved over the last 13 years  we decided we wanted to own it in this Fund as well. When we originally invested in Coupang  our thesis was constructed around the company’s wide product selection  low prices  and unrivaled convenience thanks to its investments in an end-to-end infrastructure that covers over 70% of Korea’s population  enabling over 99% of orders to be delivered within one day or less  rather than the industry norm of two to three days  driving customer satisfaction  which translates to higher customer retention rates and lifetime value. We thought that Coupang would continue to gain market share in the U.S. $500 billion-plus Korean retail market  while expanding its offerings into additional categories  expanding its ecosystem via a third-party marketplace  and continuing to invest in infrastructure density to further capture inefficiencies  enhancing the customer experience  and improving profit margins. The company has since outperformed our expectations  growing its market share to 25% (#1 in the industry)  despite not being a first mover  while building an unrivaled user experience with 99.8% of products delivered the next day (with the majority of them by dawn) and becoming profitable significantly faster than we expected. Our biggest takeaway from the visit was that despite all of Coupang’s success  there is still a long runway of growth ahead. For example  while most of the facility we visited is operated with pickers going to shelves to pick up items for orders  there was one room in which shelves drove themselves to pickers on the back of autonomous robots  which increased picker productivity by 3x. Additionally  while Coupang has been striving to reduce its reliance on distributors  which enables them to expand margins while lowering prices for consumers  a significant opportunity remains for further reduction. Lastly  we got plenty of examples of out-of-the-box thinking (no pun intended) from the company’s singulation process (improves the picking process by reducing the constraint to search for items order by order)  decreasing use of boxes (80% of shipments are now boxless)  enabling grocery delivery without cold-chain logistics (thanks to end-to-end supplychain efficiency)  or how Coupang is able to fill trucks so that each carries more than 2x the parcels a UPS or a FedEx truck can  despite being half the size. The 4% free-cash-flow yield  which is also negatively impacted by the significant reinvestments the company is making into its emerging offerings  also contributed to our decision to add to our Coupang position upon returning to New York.""6.

According to latest data  the Rothschild-led firm owned 275 800 shares in Intercontinental Exchange  Inc.

Sprecher made the acquisition because he recognized that the deregulation of the electric power industry in the United States had opened a market for surplus energy to be traded between power plants. Using eBay as a model  Sprecher aimed to develop a transparent marketplace for over-the-counter energy trading. Acquisitions of International Petroleum Exchange  New York Board of Trade  Creditex  Climate Exchange  NYSE Euronext  Interactive Data Corporation  and Ellie Mae followed  with the commonalities of successful acquisition consisting of small companies early in their growth trajectory that could be scaled on ICE’s platform  and large mature companies where ICE’s technological and operating expertise could reinvigorate and scale their growth trajectory. Today  Intercontinental Exchange is a transactional marketplace and subscription database business with global scale. Entrenched network effects in a wide range of asset class marketplaces provide a platform from which ICE usesits technology and operating expertise to layer on growth opportunities. After applying digital technology to increase the efficiency of marketplaces  ICE rolls out new innovations on top of its scalable infrastructure. Core competencies in collecting and cleansing unstructured data to build databases enforce ICE’s ability to capture the data exhaust from its marketplaces to provide recurring subscription-based revenue streams.“Additionally  we initiated a position in Intercontinental Exchange  Inc. (NYSE:ICE) (U.S.) during the quarter. Intercontinental Exchange is one of the largest and most successful financial exchange operators. The company was created through a series of shrewd acquisitions under founder and CEO Jeff Sprecher. We believe Sprecher is an excellent CEO with a history of astute capital allocation and an ability to adapt to opportunities and competitive threats. Today  Intercontinental Exchange competes in three primary segments: exchanges  fixed income/data services and mortgage technology. We believe each of these businesses exhibits attractive economic characteristics and will grow earnings faster than GDP over time. Investors today are concerned about Intercontinental Exchange’s mortgage segment as rising interest rates have depressed origination volumes. We agree that this segment will be pressured in the near term. However  only 7% of trailing 12-month revenues are sensitive to mortgage volumes  and we believe they will eventually revert to historical norms. Today  however  Intercontinental Exchange sells for what we believe is an underserved discount to its exchange peers and private market valuations.”Click to continue reading and see Jacob Rothschild Stock Portfolio: 5 Top Stock PicksSuggested Articles:Disclosure.

Its operations  which include the Spanish and Swiss stock exchanges  count as critical national infrastructure and this gives it a close relationship with governments and regulators in Madrid and Zurich.Those relationships are critical in an age where digital warfare makes financial infrastructure a prime target for hackers linked to hostile states. Jos Dijsselhof  the Dutch chief executive of the Swiss-based stock exchange group  is open about the scale of the challenge. “I employ a lot of hackers ” he says  tapping the table sharply. “Sometimes it takes one to know one.”The hack earlier this month on the Wall Street arm of China’s biggest bank  ICBC Financial Services  has put cybersecurity at the forefront of economic security debates again. The move disrupted the US Treasury market by forcing ICBC FS clients to reroute trades  with some settled by couriering the details across Manhattan on a USB stick.ICBC FS said it managed to contain the incident by disconnecting and isolating affected systems  and completed all the necessary trades. Still  the scale and nature of the ransomware onslaught – the same kind of attack that triggered a shutdown of money transfer service Travelex in 2020 – underlines the evolving risk such companies face.Six Group has invested in three tranches of cybersecurity  Dijsselhof says: walls to stop people getting in; containment systems for if they do get in; and recovery functions for when someone is “holding hostage” any part of the business.The Wall Street arm of Chinese bank ICBC was forced to courier trade data on USB sticks after being hacked this month. Photograph: Kim Kyung Hoon/Reuters“Attacks are getting more and more sophisticated at a phishing level. Also  I am seeing more and more attempts using telephone numbers  WhatsApps and so on  but also big mechanical push attacks on our systems  where several parts are under attack at once and then we get a demand for payment after they find a vulnerability ” he says.“It’s a race we’re in  with the attackers ever improving and the defenders always improving. We have to make sure our defences are high enough. The other thing you have to do is invest everywhere. Your standards have to be the same everywhere across your business.”Six Group has four main business activities: trading on its exchanges; listings; post-trade clearing and transaction processing; and data services. Its growing data business makes it a target for wider corporate espionage as well as cyber-attacks.After “social engineering” efforts using personal details to target staff were uncovered  badges no longer carry last names  clean-desk policies are far more strictly enforced and the processing and communication of sensitive information is now subject to higher bars of regular mandatory training.The business is small relative to its competitors  London Stock Exchange Group and EU-focused Euronext  but it still caused upset at the European Commission when it succeeded in buying the Spanish exchange operator  Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME)  for €2.8bn in 2020.The purchase flew in the face of EU plans to bring more of the bloc’s financial infrastructure into EU members’ hands  a long-term effort to “onshore” financial services. Euronext  headquartered in Amsterdam and Paris  has been the focal point of such efforts  buying up a range of financial infrastructure.Switzerland is not an EU member state  and had to battle this competitor. “We did it almost by stealth ” Dijsselhof says. “It’s almost not about the price; in fact  when it’s a country’s critical national infrastructure  the price is secondary.I’ve never seen initial public offerings as low as I’ve seen this year Jos Dijsselhof“They are the prominent force in our EU plans. And they knew that the Spanish stock exchange would not be absorbed by Paris or Frankfurt or London.”Six’s new London offices  near the Gherkin in the City  still smell of fresh paint. By contrast the economic backdrop is looking tired: high inflation  higher interest rates and low or no growth.“I’ve never seen IPOs [initial public offerings] as low as I’ve seen this year ” says Dijsselhof. “Trading is also very low: although there are some volatility moments  still there are a lot of people still on the sidelines. So from an exchange point of view  we had one of the slowest years ever.“But on the post-trade side  where we do the clearing  the settlement and the custody  both in Spain and Switzerland  and internationally where people hold balances with us  we benefit from the higher interest rates. And then there’s the data business  which is really  I think  a diamond in our crown.”This mixed business model helps even out the impact of a sluggish economy. Data services  as banks and other financial institutions need ever more data to train artificial intelligence programmes  offer a route for growth even in an economic downturn.Dijisselhof is still gloomy about the economic outlook and the prospect of further conflict in the Middle East  as well as Ukraine. He expects inflation to be “sticky” in the months ahead with a longer period of stagflation than many had predicted. Burgeoning conflicts in sensitive regions are also going to keep energy prices elevated  he believes: it’s going to be a bumpy ride.,neutral,0.06,0.68,0.27,mixed,0.06,0.21,0.73,True,English,"['stock exchange chief', 'lot', 'hackers', 'cyber-attacks', 'The Wall Street arm', 'big mechanical push attacks', 'IPOs [initial public offerings', 'four main business activities', 'Swiss-based stock exchange group', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'Spanish stock exchange', 'Dutch chief executive', 'US Treasury market', 'money transfer service', 'wider corporate espionage', 'regular mandatory training', 'Mercados Españoles', 'artificial intelligence programmes', 'new London offices', 'higher interest rates', 'Spanish exchange operator', 'Swiss stock exchanges', 'EU members’ hands', 'EU member state', 'critical national infrastructure', 'economic security debates', 'mixed business model', 'social engineering” efforts', 'other financial institutions', 'ICBC FS clients', 'growing data business', 'ICBC Financial Services', 'exchange point', 'Six Group', 'financial infrastructure', 'higher bars', 'other thing', 'EU plans', 'financial pipework', 'data services', 'economic backdrop', 'economic downturn', 'economic outlook', 'close relationship', 'digital warfare', 'hostile states', 'biggest bank', 'USB stick', 'ransomware onslaught', 'same kind', 'evolving risk', 'three tranches', 'recovery functions', 'Chinese bank', 'trade data', 'phishing level', 'telephone numbers', 'several parts', 'last names', 'clean-desk policies', 'sensitive information', 'European Commission', 'long-term effort', 'focal point', 'prominent force', 'fresh paint', 'high inflation', 'volatility moments', 'slowest years', 'post-trade side', 'sluggish economy', 'affected systems', 'containment systems', 'prime target', 'necessary trades', 'post-trade clearing', 'transaction processing', 'personal details', 'EU-focused Euronext', 'Jos Dijsselhof', 'profit', 'millions', 'billions', 'operations', 'governments', 'regulators', 'Madrid', 'Zurich', 'relationships', 'hackers', 'scale', 'challenge', 'lot', 'table', 'China', 'cybersecurity', 'forefront', 'move', 'Manhattan', 'incident', 'nature', 'shutdown', 'Travelex', 'companies', 'walls', 'people', 'someone', 'hostage', 'Photograph', 'Kim', 'Reuters', 'attempts', 'WhatsApps', 'demand', 'payment', 'vulnerability', 'race', 'attackers', 'defenders', 'defences', 'standards', 'listings', 'cyber-attacks', 'staff', 'badges', 'communication', 'competitors', 'upset', 'Bolsas', 'BME', 'purchase', 'face', 'bloc', 'Amsterdam', 'Paris', 'range', 'Switzerland', 'stealth', 'price', 'fact', 'country', 'Frankfurt', 'Gherkin', 'City', 'contrast', 'growth', 'Trading', 'sidelines', 'view', 'settlement', 'custody', 'Spain', 'balances', 'diamond', 'crown', 'impact', 'banks', 'route', 'Dijisselhof', 'prospect', 'conflict']",2023-11-18,2023-11-18,theguardian.com
