Fidelity joins VanEck  21Shares & ARK  Hashdex  Grayscale  and Invesco & Galaxy in the Ether ETF race.InThe post Fidelity joins Ethereum ETF race following BlackRock's filing appe…,The proposed ETF aims to list and trade its shares on the Cboe BZX Exchange.Fidelity joins VanEck  21Shares & ARK  Hashdex  Grayscale  and Invesco & Galaxy in the Ether ETF race.In a swift follow-up to BlackRock’s recent move  Fidelity has officially thrown its hat into the ring  seeking approval for its Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded fund [ETF].The filing  submitted to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 17th November  marks Fidelity’s entry into crypto-backed ETFs.The proposed ETF  named the Fidelity Ethereum Fund  aims to list and trade its shares on the Cboe BZX Exchange.Fidelity boasts a colossal $4.5 trillion in assets. Citing a gap in the market  Fidelity asserts that U.S. retail investors have been deprived of a low-risk avenue to expose themselves to Ethereum.The filing highlights the challenges faced by investors  including counter-party risk  legal uncertainty  and technical risk  when attempting to access the digital asset through existing methods.Interestingly  the filing draws attention to the disparity between U.S. and European investors. While European investors enjoy access to products trading on regulated exchanges  offering exposure to a broad range of spot crypto assets  their U.S. counterparts face limitations.Fidelity argues that the absence of a U.S.-regulated  exchange-traded vehicle for ETH exposure has left retail investors with limited options.Compelling case made for the benefits of an Ether ETFThe filing resonates with recent developments in Europe  where the Jacobi Bitcoin ETF became the first European spot Bitcoin ETF approved for listing on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange on 15th August.Fidelity’s move suggests a strategic response to the evolving global landscape  emphasizing the need to bridge the gap for U.S. investors.Furthermore  Fidelity makes a compelling case for the potential benefits of an Ether ETF in mitigating losses for U.S. investors. The filing suggests that had Spot ETH ETF been available earlier  losses incurred from now-defunct firms like FTX  Celsius Network  and BlockFi would have been considerably lower.This move by Fidelity comes hot on the heels of BlackRock’s filing for the iShares Ethereum Trust  officially submitted to the SEC on 16th November.Fidelity joins an illustrious list of firms seeking approval for an Ether ETF  including VanEck  21Shares & ARK  Hashdex  Grayscale  and Invesco & Galaxy.,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,mixed,0.39,0.31,0.3,True,English,"['Ethereum ETF race', 'Fidelity', 'BlackRock', 'filing', 'U.S.-regulated, exchange-traded vehicle', 'first European spot Bitcoin ETF', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', 'Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded fund', 'U.S. retail investors', 'U.S. counterparts', 'Jacobi Bitcoin ETF', 'U.S. investors', 'Cboe BZX Exchange', 'United States Securities', 'evolving global landscape', 'Spot ETH ETF', 'spot crypto assets', 'iShares Ethereum Trust', 'Ether ETF race', 'European investors', 'Exchange Commission', 'ETH exposure', 'swift follow-up', '17th November', 'crypto-backed ETFs', 'low-risk avenue', 'counter-party risk', 'legal uncertainty', 'technical risk', 'digital asset', 'existing methods', 'regulated exchanges', 'broad range', 'limited options', 'Compelling case', 'recent developments', '15th August', 'strategic response', 'Celsius Network', '16th November', 'illustrious list', 'potential benefits', 'defunct firms', 'recent move', 'Fidelity', 'VanEck', '21Shares', 'ARK', 'Hashdex', 'Grayscale', 'Invesco', 'Galaxy', 'BlackRock', 'hat', 'ring', 'approval', 'filing', 'entry', 'colossal $', 'gap', 'challenges', 'attention', 'disparity', 'access', 'products', 'limitations', 'absence', 'listing', 'need', 'losses', 'FTX', 'BlockFi', 'heels']",2023-11-18,2023-11-19,eng.ambcrypto.com
