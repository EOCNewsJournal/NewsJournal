It is focused on accelerating companies across the world to halve emissions before 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions before 2050.To date  fewer than 450 companies have received a similar SBTi validation.The validation reflects Euroclear’s approach to carbon reduction which encompasses infrastructure and property optimisation  energy consumption  business travel and the reduction of its suppliers’ carbon footprint.Euroclear has combined its climate change mitigation programme with directly funding global social and environmental projects. This is in line with Euroclear’s mission to support a sustainable financial marketplace as a central pillar in the business strategy.Paul Symons  chief sustainability officer at Euroclear  says: “As a major financial market infrastructure our net-zero commitments are a key element of our ambition to facilitate and accelerate a sustainable financial system.“To reach net-zero status before 2050  we will continue to reduce emissions materially across our business and that of our suppliers. We will report on our progress through our annual sustainability report.”,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,positive,0.51,0.47,0.02,True,English,"['carbon emissions', 'SBTi approval', 'Euroclear', 'Science Based Targets initiative', 'climate change mitigation programme', 'ambitious emissions reductions targets', 'major financial market infrastructure', 'carbon emissions reduction targets', 'latest climate science', 'sustainable financial marketplace', 'sustainable financial system', 'chief sustainability officer', 'annual sustainability report', 'suppliers’ carbon footprint', 'similar SBTi validation', 'carbon reduction', 'net-zero emissions', 'science-based net-zero', '1.5-degree scenario', 'The SBTi', 'global body', 'property optimisation', 'energy consumption', 'global social', 'environmental projects', 'central pillar', 'Paul Symons', 'net-zero commitments', 'key element', 'net-zero status', 'business travel', 'business strategy', 'SBTi approval', 'Euroclear', 'businesses', 'line', 'companies', 'world', 'date', 'fewer', 'approach', 'ambition', 'progress']",2023-11-20,2023-11-20,assetservicingtimes.com

The Offering consists of a maximum of 6 578 481 new shares (the ""Offer Shares"").SummaryApproximately maximum of EUR 2.63 million before transaction costs may be raised in the Offering if fully subscribed.BBS will give all its shareholders registered in BBS's shareholder register maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd (""Euroclear Finland"") one (1) book-entry subscription right (the ""Subscription Right"") for each share held on the Offering record date. Each one hundred (100) Subscription Rights entitles the holder to subscribe for forty-five (45) Offer Shares.The record date for the Offering will be 22 November 2023 with the last day of trading including the Subscription Rights on 20 November 2023 and the first day of trading excluding the Subscription Rights on 21 November 2023.The subscription price is EUR 0.40 per Offer Share. The subscription period for the Offer Shares (the ""Subscription Period"") will commence on 27 November 2023 at 10:00 a.m. Finnish time  and it is expected to end on 13 December 2023 at 4:00 p.m. Finnish time.Net proceeds from the Offering will be used inter alia for successful completion of the ongoing CE marking application process for BBS’ bone implant ARTEBONE® Paste  for initiating the commercialisation of ARTEBONE® Paste and for paying the loan repayments and interest.Story continuesReasons for the Offering and use of proceedsBBS is applying for the CE marking for its first product  ARTEBONE® Paste bone implant. On 9 March 2022  BBS submitted the CE marking application to the Notified Body in the Netherlands. The authorities’ original estimate for the processing time was 8 to 12 months from the filing. Subsequently  the processing times have lengthened  as indicated by a survey published by Medtech Europe  such that approvals for new products are not being granted within the original target time framework of one year. The delays are typically due to the authorities being overburdened  in part because the new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) necessitates the re-approval of existing products as well. Due to delays in the processing of the CE marking application  the Company must seek bridge financing to secure its funding until the CE marking is obtained.Despite the delays  ARTEBONE® Paste’s product approval process has made good progress with no significant non-conformities being reported. In May 2023  the Company was informed of the particularly critical decision regarding product classification. ARTEBONE has been a new type of borderline case between medical devices and medicines  and the company became a significant precedent from a regulatory point of view on how such products can overall be given approvals. This is also evidenced by the fact that the company was even included as an example in the industry manual published in 2018 (Manual on borderline and classification in the community regulatory framework for medical devices  version 1.19 (04 2018)).The first audit of the quality system was conducted in November 2022 and the following one in March 2023. On 2 November 2023  the Company announced it had received the quality system certificate from the authorities for advance commenting. The certificate will be officially approved by the relevant body. At the same time  the Company announced that according to the authorities the consultation with the Finnish Medicines Agency (FIMEA) will begin on 21 November 2023. The consultation is one of the final phases of the CE marking process. Alongside the consultation  the official product approval process is underway.The Company expects the CE marking application to be approved during the second quarter of year 2024. Based on the currently available information  the Company’s view is that there are no longer product risks associated with the remaining technical phases of the regulatory approval process. The main actual challenge is predicting the time it will take for the process  which the Company cannot entirely control  as the Notified Body makes decisions independently. In general  a medical device is granted approval if the product meets the safety requirements (its use does not cause harm)  and in addition  the products therapeutic efficacy must be demonstrated for its intended purpose. Both of these aspects are tested and verified through animal tests and clinical trials during the product development phase  before the regulatory approval process is initiated. BBS’s ARTEBONE® Paste has already passed these stages. The final ongoing regulatory approval phase mainly consists of consultations with the Medicines Agency and the finalization of the Company’s production and quality control processes  including test production batches.The Company anticipates that the net proceeds raised through the Offering will be used for executing the Company’s business plan  strengthening working capital and investments  and managing and repaying loans  including but not limited to the following items:1. The principal purpose of the proceeds to be raised is the successful completion of the application process for a CE marking for the BBS bone implant ARTEBONE® Paste  including certification of the Company’s quality system. The funds will also be used for product development  patent portfolio maintenance and production development  and also for the FDA approval application process for gaining marketing authorisation for ARTEBONE® Paste on the US market.2. For initiating the commercialisation of ARTEBONE® Paste  including sales and marketing asset recruitment and training  preparation of marketing materials as well as assessing and contacting initial potential customers.3. For payment of principal instalments and interest of EUR 0.5 million in Business Finland loans that are due in the next 12 months.The estimate of how the proceeds are intended to be used is based on the assumption that the Offering will be subscribed in fullThe estimated portions of the use of proceeds may differ depending on the amount of funds raised and the development of business operations. If the Offering is not subscribed in full  it may not be possible to carry out the planned actions in full  and cost-cutting measures will need to be introduced  which in turn may delay the start of production  marketing and sales.If the Offering is fully subscribed  according to the Company's management's estimate  the Company's working capital will be sufficient for approximately 8 months. The company can influence the sufficiency of the working capital by acquiring additional equity or debt capital or measures to save the Company's expenses.* MedTech Europe Survey -raportti. https://www.medtecheurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/medtech-europe-survey-report-analysing-the-availability-of-medical-devices-in-2022-in-connection-to-the-medical-device-regulation-mdr-implementation.pdfTerms of the OfferingThe Company will offer maximum of 6 578 481 Offer Shares for subscription in accordance with the shareholders' preferential subscription right.

A strategic location at the heart of Europe  political stability  a generous helping of regulatory expertise and an impressive  highly educated and multilingual workforce are the main components. Tax incentives  European integration and a commitment to financial innovation have provided the finishing touches.What is your own role in the success of the Luxembourg financial centre?“In its strategic location at the heart of Europe  Clearstream has certainly been a driver behind Luxembourg’s emergence as a global leader in the cross-border distribution of funds.

DBAG’s dividend policy now aims to ensure that shareholders participate in the financial surpluses of a financial year in the form of stable dividends of at least EUR 1.00 per dividend-entitled share. In addition  the Company plans to consider share repurchases on a more regular basis  as a flexible option enabling shareholders to achieve additional participation in the Company's positive development. This is intended to reflect the long-term orientation of DBAG's business model in its dividend policy.Implementing this policy  DBAG’s Board of Management today resolved to propose to the Supervisory Board – based on the preliminary  as yet unaudited financial statements for the 2022/2023 financial year – to distribute a dividend of 1.00 euros per dividend-entitled share (2021/2022 financial year: 0.80 euros). The dividend amount now to be proposed is below the market expectations for 2022/2023 dividends of 1.26 euros per share.The proposal for appropriation of profits is planned to be submitted to the Annual General Meeting  for the passing of a resolution on the appropriation of net retained profit  once DBAG’s audited financial statements have been confirmed. Subject to approval by the Supervisory Board in its meeting to discuss the financial statements on 29 November 2023  and shareholder approval at the Ordinary Annual General Meeting on 22 February 2024  the dividend of 1.00 euros per share now proposed translates into a dividend yield of 3.5 per cent  based on the average Xetra share price during the financial year 2022/2023.Based on preliminary  unaudited figures  DBAG achieved net income of around 106 million euros for the 2022/2023 financial year and net asset value of around 669 million euros as at the 30 September 2023 reporting date. These figures are in line with the Company’s forecast which was last updated on 17 July 2023.The Company intends to publish the full  audited financial statements and consolidated financial statements for 2022/2023 on 30 November 2023.The Board of ManagementFrankfurt/Main  20 November 2023Reporting person: Roland Rapelius  Head of Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsContact:Roland RapeliusManaging DirectorCorporate Communications & Investor RelationsE-Mail: Roland.Rapelius@dbag.dePhone: +49 69 95787 365,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,neutral,0.03,0.94,0.04,True,English,"['Deutsche Beteiligungs AG', 'dividend policy', 'EQS-Adhoc', 'DE000A1TNUT7', 'WKN', 'Board', 'Management', '1.00 euros', 'share', 'average Xetra share price', 'Ordinary Annual General Meeting', 'Roland RapeliusManaging DirectorCorporate Communications', 'full, audited financial statements', 'Deutsche Beteiligungs AG', 'net retained profit', 'net asset value', 'EQS Group AG', '30 September 2023 reporting date', 'unaudited financial statements', 'consolidated financial statements', 'preliminary, unaudited figures', '2022/2023 financial year', '2022/2023 dividends', 'net income', 'Roland.Rapelius', 'financial surpluses', 'EQS News', 'Reporting person', 'Key word', 'Dividend/Preliminary Results', 'inside information', 'Market Abuse', 'stable dividends', 'regular basis', 'flexible option', 'additional participation', 'positive development', 'long-term orientation', 'business model', 'market expectations', '3.5 per cent', 'Investor Relations', 'dividend-entitled share', 'share repurchases', 'dividend amount', 'dividend yield', 'Supervisory Board', 'shareholder approval', 'The Board', 'dividend policy', '106 million euros', '669 million euros', 'The Company', '1.00 euros', '0.80 euros', '1.26 euros', 'WKN', 'A1TNUT', 'Management', 'CEST', 'Disclosure', 'Article', 'Regulation', 'service', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'DBAG', 'shareholders', 'proposal', 'appropriation', 'profits', 'passing', 'resolution', '29 November', '22 February', 'line', 'forecast', '17 July', '30 November', 'Frankfurt/Main', '20 November', 'Head', 'Contact', 'dePhone']",2023-11-20,2023-11-20,stock-world.de
