While the entire nation grieve  Israel is fighting a war that has been imposed on us to rescue the hostages and make sure that such atrocities can never happen again. Our thoughts are with the fallen and we pray for the safe return of all hostages.TASE concludes another strong quarter  marked by continued and sustained organic growth in both revenue and profit across all core activities.The stability and continuity of TASE constitute a strong anchor for Israel's capital markets. Therefore  following the October 7 attack we swiftly mobilized to ensure the opening of the market on the 8th  while maintaining the safety and security of our employees. I would like to note that  since the outset of the events  local institutional investors have demonstrated their confidence in the Israeli economy  with a strong response to the very successful debt issuances by the State of Israel and support of the Israeli shares  which helped moderate the price drops triggered by the events. For the first time since the beginning of the year  in November retail investors renewed their purchases of mutual funds on local shares. Also  we are already seeing a more positive response from the foreign investors  most notable of which is Novo Nordisk's announcement of becoming an interested party in the TASE share  with an 8.5% holding after the purchase.We have confidence in the strength of the Israeli economy and constantly work to diversify TASE's growth channels  increase the international visibility of TASE and the Israeli companies and bring in additional investors and market participants  as reflected in the recent addition of new TASE members.""TEL AVIV  Israel  Nov. 21  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd. (TASE: TASE) today announced its financial results for Q3 2023 that ended on September 30  2023.The principal trends and data of the capital market since the beginning of the year and since the outset of the war:Since the break-out of the war  the Israeli Government has significantly increased its debt issuances in order to fund the wartime expenses. In view of the high costs of debt issuance on the global markets  most of the debt was raised on The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange  with a strong response by Israeli institutional investors. So far  the debt issuances have been very successful  totaling NIS 8.4 billion in October  1.2 times the planned amount. Another  larger  issuance of NIS 14 billion is planned in November  compared to a monthly average of NIS 5.6 billion from January to September 2023.T-bill issuances since the beginning of the war totaled NIS 68 billion  on top of the NIS 304 billion raised since the beginning of the year until the end of September. The average daily trading volume of T-bills reached NIS 1.7 billion since the outset of the war  compared to an average of NIS 1.4 million from January to September.Debt raising on the corporate bonds market was also strong  due to the companies' debt refinancing through marketable bonds  despite the higher interest rate. The business sector raised since the beginning of the year until the end of September NIS 62.8 billion in issuances and private placements of bonds to the public and to institutional investors - compared to NIS 70.4 billion raised in the corresponding period last year  and since the outset of the war to date the companies raised an additional NIS 5.2 billion.In the wake of the war  some foreign investors and retail investors pulled out of our equity market and we saw a decline in the equity market. However  the decline was nowhere near the level experienced at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. This is a testament to the financial maturity of the Israeli investor. Local institutional investors used the opportunity to access local shares offerings at more attractive valuations and increased their exposure to the Israeli equity market by 2.9 billion shekels. This is on top of the NIS 3.1 billion shekels increase in their holdings in the first nine months of the year. The contribution of the local institutional investors and the share purchases since the outset of the war have also helped moderate the sharp price drops on the capital market. For the first time since the beginning of the year  in November retail purchases of mutual funds have resumed. Also  we are seeing in November  a more positive response from the foreign investors  most notable of which is Novo Nordisk's announcement of becoming an interested party in the TASE share with an 8.5% holding.Share trading volumes increased to an average of NIS 2.2 billion since the beginning of the war to date  compared to an average of NIS 2 billion in the first nine months of the year. Bond ADV since October 7 also increased to NIS 4.3 billion up from NIS 3.7 billion January-September. Since the beginning of the year until the end of September  the average daily trading volume of shares was NIS 2 billion  compared to NIS 2.4 billion in the corresponding period last year  and the trading volume of bonds was NIS 3.7 billion  compared to NIS 3.5 billion in the corresponding period.Continued implementation of the strategic plan and upgrading of the capital marketEnhancement of liquidity - The reform of the TASE indices was launched in early November  aimed to improve the indices and boost their AUM  significantly enhancing liquidity for both the companies and the capital market. The reform of the bond market is also gaining traction – starting on December 3  the minimum order size will be reduced for government bonds  corporate bonds and T-bills  following the successful reduction of the minimum order size for shares last year. Also  to improve the public's access to COCO bonds  their minimum order size was reduced and credit card companies can now issue COCO bonds  alongside the banks and the insurance companies.Increasing foreign investors' activity and increasing the number of TASE members - TASE announces today the approval of one of the two international clearing houses operating in Europe  Clearstream Banking S.A.  as a CSD custodial member of the TASE Clearing House[1] (the second clearing house  Euroclear Bank  joined TASE as a custodial member already in September 2019). Clearstream is wholly owned by the holding company  Clearstream Holding AG  which is owned by Deutsche Borse AG. The company  based in Luxemburg  specializes in the provision of clearing  custodial and other auxiliary services for trading in securities  including the clearing of local and international financial assets in more than 60 markets worldwide.Additionally  Altshuler Shaham has been recently approved as a TASE member and a Clearing House member  and today the Board of Directors of TASE approved the acceptance of altshare  a fintech software company  as a new TASE member. The company will be offering trading services to close to 120 000 end customers in Israel and overseas  also engaging investors outside its customer base  helping enhance the competition in the Israeli capital market.It should be noted that fintech company  Blink  began operating as a TASE member a week ago  and TASE is confident that more significant members will join in the coming months  thereby enhancing competition and improving the access of local and international investors to Israeli companies and securities.TASE also reports on the status of the Company's share buyback plan. Since the initiation of the buyback plan in May 2022  until shortly after the reporting date  TASE purchased a total of 10.2 million shares for a consideration NIS 186 million  at an average price of NIS 18.25 per share  representing 9.9% of the Company's issued share capital. This concludes all of the buyback plans approved by the Board of Directors. In light of TASE's surplus liquidity of NIS 195 million  strong financial performance  organic growth and steady cash inflow  as also demonstrated this quarter  the Board of Directors of TASE has instructed the management of the Company to present to the Board of Directors for approval of a buyback by way of tender offer for up to NIS 50 million and the publication of specifications in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Regulations (Tender Offer)  2000. It is hereby clarified that  to date  a tender offer buyback has not yet been approved and will be presented to the Company's Board of Directors for approval in the coming weeks.Highlights of the results for Q3 2023:Revenue in Q3 2023 totaled NIS 95.5 million  compared to NIS 86.0 million in the corresponding quarter last year  an increase of 11%  with growth across all activities. Revenue from trading and clearing commissions totaled NIS 36.95 million  an increase of 11% compared to the corresponding quarter  stemming from the increase in revenue from T-bills  a 4% increase due  inter alia  to the higher trading volumes  the increase in T-bills issuances and the cancellation of the maximum commission on OTC transactions. Another 4% increase is due to revenue from mutual funds  and a 2% increase results from the increase in the trading volumes of derivatives. Listing fees and levies totaled NIS 20.49 million  a 3% increase compared to the corresponding quarter in 2022  Clearing House services increased by 10% to NIS 19.2 million  and data distribution and connectivity services increased by 26%  totaling NIS 18.1 million.The costs in Q3 2023 totaled NIS 72.1 million  compared to NIS 68.8 million in the corresponding quarter last year  an increase of 5%. The increase in costs is due mainly to the increase in employee benefit expenses and computer and communication expenses  which was partly offset by a reduction in the marketing expenses.Net financing income in Q3 2023 totaled NIS 2.0 million  compared to net financing expenses of NIS 4.1 million in the corresponding quarter last year. The transition to financing income this quarter resulted from a negative return of 0.1% on the Company's investments in marketable securities' portfolios comprising Israeli government bonds  compared to a negative return of 2.2% in the corresponding quarter last year  as well as from the raising of the Bank of Israel interest rate  which increased the interest on the deposits.The profit in Q3 2023 totaled NIS 18.2 million  compared to NIS 8.7 million in the corresponding quarter last year  an increase of 109%. The increase in profit was due mainly to the increase in revenue and the transition to financing income.The adjusted EBITDA in Q3 2023 totaled NIS 38.4 million  compared to NIS 30.5 million in the corresponding quarter last year  an increase of 26%  stemming mainly from the increase in revenue.The adjusted profit in Q3 2023 totaled NIS 20.1 million  compared to NIS 8.8 million in the corresponding quarter last year  an increase of 127%  stemming mainly from the increase in revenue and the transition to financing income as a result of the higher returns on the Company's investments in marketable securities' portfolios comprising Israeli Government bonds  compared to the corresponding quarter last year  and the increase in the interest on deposits.Equity as of September 30  2023 totaled NIS 615.6 million  compared to NIS 686.4 million as of December 31  2022  a 10% decrease. The decrease in the equity is due mainly to the buyback of Company shares in an amount of NIS 153.7 million  net of a profit of NIS 62.5 million accrued in the first nine months of 2023 and the excess consideration received from historic shareholders within the framework of the TASE ownership restructuring  in an amount of NIS 12.8 million during the period.Click here for the link to the full financial statements for Q3 2023:Click here for the link to the financial presentation of Q3 2023:This notification does not supersede that stated in the periodic financial statements of the Company  which contain the full and accurate information.The revenue of the Company from trading and clearing is affected  inter alia  by the number of trading and clearing days.

While the entire nation grieve  Israel is fighting a war that has been imposed on us to rescue the hostages and make sure that such atrocities can never happen again. Our thoughts are with the fallen and we pray for the safe return of all hostages.TASE concludes another strong quarter  marked by continued and sustained organic growth in both revenue and profit across all core activities.The stability and continuity of TASE constitute a strong anchor for Israel's capital markets. Therefore  following the October 7 attack we swiftly mobilized to ensure the opening of the market on the 8th  while maintaining the safety and security of our employees. I would like to note that  since the outset of the events  local institutional investors have demonstrated their confidence in the Israeli economy  with a strong response to the very successful debt issuances by the State of Israel and support of the Israeli shares  which helped moderate the price drops triggered by the events. For the first time since the beginning of the year  in November retail investors renewed their purchases of mutual funds on local shares. Also  we are already seeing a more positive response from the foreign investors  most notable of which is Novo Nordisk's announcement of becoming an interested party in the TASE share  with an 8.5% holding after the purchase.We have confidence in the strength of the Israeli economy and constantly work to diversify TASE's growth channels  increase the international visibility of TASE and the Israeli companies and bring in additional investors and market participants  as reflected in the recent addition of new TASE members.""TEL AVIV  Israel  Nov. 21  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd. (TASE: TASE) today announced its financial results for Q3 2023 that ended on September 30  2023.The principal trends and data of the capital market since the beginning of the year and since the outset of the war:Since the break-out of the war  the Israeli Government has significantly increased its debt issuances in order to fund the wartime expenses. In view of the high costs of debt issuance on the global markets  most of the debt was raised on The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange  with a strong response by Israeli institutional investors. So far  the debt issuances have been very successful  totaling NIS 8.4 billion in October  1.2 times the planned amount. Another  larger  issuance of NIS 14 billion is planned in November  compared to a monthly average of NIS 5.6 billion from January to September 2023.T-bill issuances since the beginning of the war totaled NIS 68 billion  on top of the NIS 304 billion raised since the beginning of the year until the end of September. The average daily trading volume of T-bills reached NIS 1.7 billion since the outset of the war  compared to an average of NIS 1.4 million from January to September.Debt raising on the corporate bonds market was also strong  due to the companies' debt refinancing through marketable bonds  despite the higher interest rate. The business sector raised since the beginning of the year until the end of September NIS 62.8 billion in issuances and private placements of bonds to the public and to institutional investors - compared to NIS 70.4 billion raised in the corresponding period last year  and since the outset of the war to date the companies raised an additional NIS 5.2 billion.In the wake of the war  some foreign investors and retail investors pulled out of our equity market and we saw a decline in the equity market. However  the decline was nowhere near the level experienced at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. This is a testament to the financial maturity of the Israeli investor. Local institutional investors used the opportunity to access local shares offerings at more attractive valuations and increased their exposure to the Israeli equity market by 2.9 billion shekels. This is on top of the NIS 3.1 billion shekels increase in their holdings in the first nine months of the year. The contribution of the local institutional investors and the share purchases since the outset of the war have also helped moderate the sharp price drops on the capital market. For the first time since the beginning of the year  in November retail purchases of mutual funds have resumed. Also  we are seeing in November  a more positive response from the foreign investors  most notable of which is Novo Nordisk's announcement of becoming an interested party in the TASE share with an 8.5% holding.Share trading volumes increased to an average of NIS 2.2 billion since the beginning of the war to date  compared to an average of NIS 2 billion in the first nine months of the year. Bond ADV since October 7 also increased to NIS 4.3 billion up from NIS 3.7 billion January-September. Since the beginning of the year until the end of September  the average daily trading volume of shares was NIS 2 billion  compared to NIS 2.4 billion in the corresponding period last year  and the trading volume of bonds was NIS 3.7 billion  compared to NIS 3.5 billion in the corresponding period.Continued implementation of the strategic plan and upgrading of the capital marketEnhancement of liquidity - The reform of the TASE indices was launched in early November  aimed to improve the indices and boost their AUM  significantly enhancing liquidity for both the companies and the capital market. The reform of the bond market is also gaining traction – starting on December 3  the minimum order size will be reduced for government bonds  corporate bonds and T-bills  following the successful reduction of the minimum order size for shares last year. Also  to improve the public's access to COCO bonds  their minimum order size was reduced and credit card companies can now issue COCO bonds  alongside the banks and the insurance companies.Increasing foreign investors' activity and increasing the number of TASE members - TASE announces today the approval of one of the two international clearing houses operating in Europe  Clearstream Banking S.A.  as a CSD custodial member of the TASE Clearing House[1] (the second clearing house  Euroclear Bank  joined TASE as a custodial member already in September 2019). Clearstream is wholly owned by the holding company  Clearstream Holding AG  which is owned by Deutsche Borse AG. The company  based in Luxemburg  specializes in the provision of clearing  custodial and other auxiliary services for trading in securities  including the clearing of local and international financial assets in more than 60 markets worldwide.Additionally  Altshuler Shaham has been recently approved as a TASE member and a Clearing House member  and today the Board of Directors of TASE approved the acceptance of altshare  a fintech software company  as a new TASE member. The company will be offering trading services to close to 120 000 end customers in Israel and overseas  also engaging investors outside its customer base  helping enhance the competition in the Israeli capital market.It should be noted that fintech company  Blink  began operating as a TASE member a week ago  and TASE is confident that more significant members will join in the coming months  thereby enhancing competition and improving the access of local and international investors to Israeli companies and securities.TASE also reports on the status of the Company's share buyback plan. Since the initiation of the buyback plan in May 2022  until shortly after the reporting date  TASE purchased a total of 10.2 million shares for a consideration NIS 186 million  at an average price of NIS 18.25 per share  representing 9.9% of the Company's issued share capital. This concludes all of the buyback plans approved by the Board of Directors. In light of TASE's surplus liquidity of NIS 195 million  strong financial performance  organic growth and steady cash inflow  as also demonstrated this quarter  the Board of Directors of TASE has instructed the management of the Company to present to the Board of Directors for approval of a buyback by way of tender offer for up to NIS 50 million and the publication of specifications in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Regulations (Tender Offer)  2000. It is hereby clarified that  to date  a tender offer buyback has not yet been approved and will be presented to the Company's Board of Directors for approval in the coming weeks.Highlights of the results for Q3 2023:Revenue in Q3 2023 totaled NIS 95.5 million  compared to NIS 86.0 million in the corresponding quarter last year  an increase of 11%  with growth across all activities. Revenue from trading and clearing commissions totaled NIS 36.95 million  an increase of 11% compared to the corresponding quarter  stemming from the increase in revenue from T-bills  a 4% increase due  inter alia  to the higher trading volumes  the increase in T-bills issuances and the cancellation of the maximum commission on OTC transactions. Another 4% increase is due to revenue from mutual funds  and a 2% increase results from the increase in the trading volumes of derivatives. Listing fees and levies totaled NIS 20.49 million  a 3% increase compared to the corresponding quarter in 2022  Clearing House services increased by 10% to NIS 19.2 million  and data distribution and connectivity services increased by 26%  totaling NIS 18.1 million.The costs in Q3 2023 totaled NIS 72.1 million  compared to NIS 68.8 million in the corresponding quarter last year  an increase of 5%. The increase in costs is due mainly to the increase in employee benefit expenses and computer and communication expenses  which was partly offset by a reduction in the marketing expenses.Net financing income in Q3 2023 totaled NIS 2.0 million  compared to net financing expenses of NIS 4.1 million in the corresponding quarter last year. The transition to financing income this quarter resulted from a negative return of 0.1% on the Company's investments in marketable securities' portfolios comprising Israeli government bonds  compared to a negative return of 2.2% in the corresponding quarter last year  as well as from the raising of the Bank of Israel interest rate  which increased the interest on the deposits.The profit in Q3 2023 totaled NIS 18.2 million  compared to NIS 8.7 million in the corresponding quarter last year  an increase of 109%. The increase in profit was due mainly to the increase in revenue and the transition to financing income.The adjusted EBITDA in Q3 2023 totaled NIS 38.4 million  compared to NIS 30.5 million in the corresponding quarter last year  an increase of 26%  stemming mainly from the increase in revenue.The adjusted profit in Q3 2023 totaled NIS 20.1 million  compared to NIS 8.8 million in the corresponding quarter last year  an increase of 127%  stemming mainly from the increase in revenue and the transition to financing income as a result of the higher returns on the Company's investments in marketable securities' portfolios comprising Israeli Government bonds  compared to the corresponding quarter last year  and the increase in the interest on deposits.Equity as of September 30  2023 totaled NIS 615.6 million  compared to NIS 686.4 million as of December 31  2022  a 10% decrease. The decrease in the equity is due mainly to the buyback of Company shares in an amount of NIS 153.7 million  net of a profit of NIS 62.5 million accrued in the first nine months of 2023 and the excess consideration received from historic shareholders within the framework of the TASE ownership restructuring  in an amount of NIS 12.8 million during the period.Click here for the link to the full financial statements for Q3 2023:Click here for the link to the financial presentation of Q3 2023:This notification does not supersede that stated in the periodic financial statements of the Company  which contain the full and accurate information.The revenue of the Company from trading and clearing is affected  inter alia  by the number of trading and clearing days.

This decrease is partially offset by the financing announced August 31  20235.Following the financing of €35.7 million (gross amount) consisting of a reserved capital increase and the issuance of royalty certificates announced by the company on August 31 20235  recorded by a decision of the Chairman and recorded by a decision of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on September 5  2023 (""August Capital Increase"")  and the receipt of the $10 million upfront payment from Hepalys Pharma  Inc. in October 2023  the Company believes  taking into account its current cost structure and forecast expenditure commitments  that its cash  cash equivalents and deposits should be sufficient to fund its operations until the beginning of the second quarter of 2024.In addition  the Company expects to meet the financial conditions for the disbursement of the second tranche of €25 million of the loan granted by the European Investment Bank (“EIB"") by the end of 2023 if it receives the anticipated $3 million milestone payment from Sino Biopharm  through its subsidiary Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co.  Ltd. (“CTTQ”)  upon the enrollment of the first patient in China in the ongoing pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3 (which is expected by the end of 2023). Considering its current cost structure and forecast expenditure commitments  the Company estimates that  including the anticipated CTTQ milestone payment and disbursement of the second tranche of €25 million of the EIB loan  the Company’s cash  cash equivalents and deposits would allow the Company to fund its operations until the beginning of the third quarter of 20244.Net cash used in operating activities amounted to (€69.0) million in the first nine months of 2023  compared to (€40.1) million for the same period in 2022. R&D expenses for the first nine months of 2023 were up 86 % compared to the same period in 2022. This increase is in line with the clinical development activities planned in 2023.Net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of 2023 amounted to (€3.5) million  compared to (€0.4) million for the same period of 2022. The change is mostly due to the change in deposits between both periods.Net cash provided by financing activities for the first nine months of 2023 amounted to €30.2 million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of €13.1 million for the same period of 2022. The increase is mainly due to the 35.7 million (gross proceeds) of the August Capital Increase. The net cash generated in financing activities in 2022 was mainly driven by the equity raised through the Company’s at-the-market program for approximately €9.4 million (gross proceeds) in June 2022  and three loan agreements with a syndicate French banks for a total amount of €5.3 million entered into in the first half of 2022. In the first nine months of 2023  the net cash used from financing activities was mainly due to loan reimbursement and medical imaging equipment debt rents.Over the first nine months of 2023  the Company recorded a negative exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of (€0.7) million  compared to a positive effect of €2.1 million for the same period of 2022  due to the evolution of EUR/USD exchange rate.RevenuesThe Company’s revenues for the first nine months of 2023 amounted to €1.9 million  stable from the first six months of 2023  compared to €0.1 million for the same period in 2022. The increase over the 2022 period is mainly due to the receipt of the first regulatory milestone payment of $2.0 million from CTTQ in July 2023. The milestone payment was triggered in May 2023 after CTTQ received the Investigational New Drug (“IND”) approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to initiate the clinical development in mainland China of lanifibranor in NASH.On September 20  2023  the Company announced that it entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Hepalys Pharma  Inc.  a company formed by Catalys Pacific  to develop and commercialize Inventiva’s proprietary drug candidate  lanifibranor  for the treatment of NASH and potentially other metabolic diseases in Japan and South Korea. Inventiva has exercised the option to acquire 30% of the shares Hepalys Pharma for the price of 300 yen. Pursuant to the terms of this licensing agreement  Inventiva received a $10 million upfront payment from Hepalys Pharma Inc. in October 2023  and will be eligible to receive up to $231 million in milestone payments if certain clinical  regulatory and commercial conditions are met. Subject to regulatory approval  Inventiva will additionally have the right to receive tiered royalties from mid double digits to low twenties based on net sales of lanifibranor in Japan and South Korea  if approved. Under IFRS 15  the above upfront milestone is expected to be recorded in Q4 2023  after the know-how and IP transfer in progress are fully completed.***Next key milestones expectedLast Patient First Visit of the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in NASH – targeted by the end of 2023Publication of the topline results of the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial of lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D – targeted for the end of the first quarter of 2024Upcoming investor conference participation42nd Annual J.P.

The Company may have based these estimate on assumptions that are incorrect  and the Company may end up using its resources sooner than anticipated. The extended estimate includes the expected €25 million second tranche of the loan agreement from the EIB  which is subject to certain conditions.

But with input incorporated into the regulations from a range of stakeholders including federal agencies  industry and community leaders  complying with the new CRA requirements will require significant adaptation  according to expert commentary by Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions.“Every bank is going to be touched by this in some way  no matter the size of the bank. This changes the status quo for everybody ” said Timothy Burniston  Senior Advisor  Regulatory Strategy at Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions.Burniston’s insights on finalization of a modernized CRA  were featured in a National Mortgage Professional magazine article  “Federal Reserve Approves Major CRA Overhaul After Nearly Three Decades” on the same day interagency finalization was achieved. The regulation is being published in the Federal Register and takes effect April 1  2024  with key provisions becoming applicable on January 1  2024.Burniston recommends that in addition to carefully reading the final rule and supplementary information  banks first consider how they may be affected by changes to assessment areas and CRA-eligible activities.“Understanding geographically where you’re going to be evaluated and determining if there are areas where you are not currently being evaluated but will be in the future  is an essential first step in trying to understand how this rule will impact your bank most ” he notes.Among the significant changes reflected in the final rule—compared to the proposed rule—is the extension of the implementation period from one year to two years. Burniston says that it will be important for regulators to keep the CRA regulations responsive to short- and long-term disruptions and current with continuing changes within the banking industry as the implementation process moves forward. The final rule also makes adjustments to other substantive provisions such as retail lending assessment areas  retail lending performance ranges  major product lines  and how automobile lending will be considered in performance evaluations.National Mortgage Professional is published by American Business Media.

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM)/(Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the first patient has been dosed in its Phase III pediatric clinical trial evaluating a new pediatric formulation of the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  in children ages one to six years  with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS).At sites in the U.S.  Japan  and the EU  the single-arm  open-label  multinational clinical trial will evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of leniolisib in 15 children  one to six years of age  who have a confirmed APDS diagnosis. These patients will receive a specific  pediatric granulated formulation of leniolisib. The study’s primary efficacy endpoints and secondary endpoints mirror those used to evaluate the clinical outcomes in previous leniolisib Phase II/III APDS trials for patients aged 12 and older.Dr. Eveline Wu  MD  MSCR  Division Chief  Paediatric Rheumatology & Associate Professor of Paediatric Rheumatology and Allergy/Immunology at The University of North Carolina School of Medicine  commented:“As a physician who has seen how significantly APDS can affect children’s lives  I’m excited that a targeted treatment may soon become available for even younger patients. While standard supportive therapies can ease some of the progressive  immune-related symptoms that characterize APDS  leniolisib is designed to help prevent those symptoms from arising. This could improve the standard of care for these children with the hope of a more full and enjoyable participation in the typical activities of childhood.”Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:“With the first patient dosed in this pediatric trial of leniolisib  using a new  granulated formulation  we are continuing to demonstrate Pharming’s ongoing commitment to providing new treatment options for younger pediatric patients with APDS. We look forward to generating the necessary supporting data to facilitate additional regulatory filings  thereby ensuring that patients from as broad an age range as possible can potentially benefit from this disease-modifying treatment.”This is the second pediatric clinical trial launched by Pharming this year for the study of leniolisib in pediatric patients with APDS. The first pediatric study  announced in February 2023  is ongoing and will evaluate 15 children  four to 11 years of age  receiving leniolisib’s tablet formulation as an investigational treatment for APDS.Leniolisib  marketed under the brand name Joenja® in the U.S.  received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of APDS in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older in March 2023.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body.

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM)/(Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the first patient has been dosed in its Phase III pediatric clinical trial evaluating a new pediatric formulation of the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  in children ages one to six years  with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS).At sites in the U.S.  Japan  and the EU  the single-arm  open-label  multinational clinical trial will evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of leniolisib in 15 children  one to six years of age  who have a confirmed APDS diagnosis. These patients will receive a specific  pediatric granulated formulation of leniolisib. The study’s primary efficacy endpoints and secondary endpoints mirror those used to evaluate the clinical outcomes in previous leniolisib Phase II/III APDS trials for patients aged 12 and older.Dr. Eveline Wu  MD  MSCR  Division Chief  Paediatric Rheumatology & Associate Professor of Paediatric Rheumatology and Allergy/Immunology at The University of North Carolina School of Medicine commented:“As a physician who has seen how significantly APDS can affect children’s lives  I’m excited that a targeted treatment may soon become available for even younger patients. While standard supportive therapies can ease some of the progressive  immune-related symptoms that characterize APDS  leniolisib is designed to help prevent those symptoms from arising. This could improve the standard of care for these children with the hope of a more full and enjoyable participation in the typical activities of childhood.”Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:“With the first patient dosed in this pediatric trial of leniolisib  using a new  granulated formulation  we are continuing to demonstrate Pharming’s ongoing commitment to providing new treatment options for younger pediatric patients with APDS. We look forward to generating the necessary supporting data to facilitate additional regulatory filings  thereby ensuring that patients from as broad an age range as possible can potentially benefit from this disease-modifying treatment.”This is the second pediatric clinical trial launched by Pharming this year for the study of leniolisib in pediatric patients with APDS. The first pediatric study  announced in February 2023  is ongoing and will evaluate 15 children  four to 11 years of age  receiving leniolisib’s tablet formulation as an investigational treatment for APDS.Leniolisib  marketed under the brand name Joenja® in the U.S.  received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of APDS in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older in March 2023.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing.

IHI and Vopak will furthermore assess a collaboration outside of Japan.The collaboration focuses on large-scale ammonia storage terminals  strategically positioned for the economical distribution of ammonia. Ammonia plays an important role as a fuel for reducing carbon emissions from thermal power generation and as a hydrogen carrier  both in Japan and abroad. In addition  the study will examine the possibility of streamlining the operation of ammonia terminals to enhance price competitiveness  as well as the conversion and supply of various hydrogen derivatives.IHI is currently working toward the realization of a decarbonized society through the development of integrated technologies from upstream to downstream  including fuel ammonia production  storage  and utilization. IHI is Japan's leading manufacturer of ammonia storage tanks  having designed and constructed approximately 70% of all ammonia storage tanks in Japan. Currently  IHI is developing comprehensive technology for large-scale ammonia receiving terminals utilizing the large storage tank technology that IHI has cultivated in the field of LNG storage tanks.With over 20 years of ammonia storage experience  Vopak has extensive knowledge on safe handling and storage of ammonia to facilitate the development of large-scale ammonia import  storage and distribution infrastructures. Currently  Vopak has ammonia storage operations in China  Saudi Arabia  Singapore  Malaysia and in the US. Most recently in the United States  Vopak and its global partners are collaborating on the pre-FEED for the development of a large-scale  low-carbon ammonia production and export project on the Houston Ship Channel.""We are pleased to begin joint discussions with Vopak on the development and operation of ammonia terminals. As demand for ammonia continues to grow  we recognize the need to rationalize terminal operations and strengthen price competitiveness in order to meet this demand. We will leverage the strengths of both companies to form a terminal that can be utilized in the future and to build a robust supply chain."" said Jun Kobayashi  Board Director  Managing Executive Officer  IHI Corporation.""We are excited to work with IHI and look forward to collaborating together as we advance the commitment of both companies towards a low-carbon future. As we embark on this journey  we envision synergies between both companies that will create innovative solutions to accelerate the development of new supply chains for the energy and feedstocks of the future "" said Chris Robblee  President of Asia & Middle East  Vopak.About the IHIIHI is a preeminent Japanese integrated heavy industry group that originated with the establishment of the nation's first modern shipyard in 1853.

The actions taken over the last several years to grow and optimize the Company’s fleet through vessel acquisitions and sales has reinforced our market-leading position and further increased the competitiveness of our fleet. This has been accomplished without compromising our low cash breakeven levels  which helps to ensure that the Company remains profitable during periods of market weakness while maintaining significant operating leverage. Looking forward  the market is well-balanced in the near term  supported by evolving trades that are expected to contribute to tonne-mile demand growth. The supply side picture remains very favorable  particularly in the Capesize segment  which supports a positive longer term market view.”The Board of DirectorsGolden Ocean Group LimitedHamilton  BermudaNovember 21  2023Questions should be directed to:Lars-Christian Svensen: Interim Chief Executive Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40Peder Simonsen: Chief Financial Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40The full report is available in the link below.Forward Looking StatementsMatters discussed in this earnings report may constitute forward-looking statements.

It remains headquartered and tax resident in Ireland.CRH was formed in 1970 through the merger of the already publicly quoted Irish Cement  which floated in 1936  and Roadstone companies. It was the largest company on the Irish market by a distance before it delisted.The company said group sales for the nine months ended September 30th amounted to $26.3 billion  which represents an increase of 8 per cent compared with the corresponding period in 2022  or 3 per cent on a like-for-like basis. Separately  it said it will buy a portfolio of cement and ready-mixed concrete assets in Texas  from Martin Marietta Materials in a deal worth $2.1 billion. The portfolio is expected to generate EBITDA of $170 million this year  it added. CRH shares rose 3.7 per cent in early trading in New York.READ MORE“The positive momentum experienced in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter  underpinned by strong commercial progress and positive underlying demand across key end-use markets ” the company told investors.The group’s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortisation (EBITDA) was $4.8 billion  which was 14 per cent ahead of last year  or 9 per cent ahead on a like-for-like basis.Davy said the company’s “impressive delivery” on margins  returns and cash generation was not only driving a strong financial performance in the present  but also supporting capital deployment in acquisitions  “thereby unlocking additional growth”.“This is a consistent theme at the company and the benefits continue to be highly attractive for shareholders ” the group said.[ Sorting out the nitty gritty of CRH’s move to New York Stock Exchange ]CRH is projecting its full-year depreciation and amortisation to be slightly higher than the $1.7 billion it was in 2022 due to the impact of acquisitions.Will a new direction for RTÉ ensure the broadcaster’s long-term future?

Impacts of events related to the conflict in Ukraine On February 24  2022  Russia launched a military operation in the east of Ukraine  resulting in the current conflict. The geo-political tensions involving Russia and Ukraine have prompted a major international humanitarian and social crisis  with significant impacts primarily for their populations  but also for internal economic activities and commercial trade in the area. These extraordinary events in terms of their nature and extent have prompted global repercussions on: i) supply chains  particularly with regard to raw material and energy supply and prices; ii) international market demand levels; iii) inflation and the consequent restrictive interest rate policies; iv) the strengthening of the dollar as a haven from risk and rising interest rates. The operating and financial impacts of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on the F.I.L.A. Group and on its Russian commercial subsidiary Fila Stationary O.O.O. are not considered significant  also in view of the fact that the revenue of the subsidiary accounts for approx. 0.1% of the Group's total. The F.I.L.A. Group does not have suppliers or production plant in the area. The Russian subsidiary has a net commercial exposure to third parties at September 30  2023 of Euro 323 thousand  which takes into account the impairment made by the Group on the basis of assessments upon their recoverability. Group management continues to monitor the recoverability of the net exposure to third parties of the Russian subsidiary. In light of these serious events  the Group is in addition monitoring the short-term situation so as to be ready to offset the impacts of all future decisions upon the presence in Russia. There are no F.I.L.A. Group companies in Ukraine at September 30  2023. At Group level  the effects and the criticalities generated by the inflation of raw and ancillary materials for production continue to be monitored  assessing the possibility of identifying alternative procurement sources where needed or undertaking adequate compensatory measures.

Speaking from Amsterdam on the day Prosus shares were listed  Sgourdos explained that since the strategy was announced  the shares’ discount to underlying assets has dropped from 45% to under 35%. That discount contracted still further today  delivering a further boost for owners of Naspers shares. He also shared how the listing went  what happens next and unpacked today’s SENS announcement relating to a R176m transaction on shares for the top three executives.No doubt today is a milestone in the company’s history. How does the actual listing in Amsterdam work?___STEADY_PAYWALL___Effectively what we’ve done is we’ve given our existing shareholders the opportunity to swap out some of the holding – that they have on the JSE – on the Euronext and that’s how we’ve created the liquidity. It’s quite similar to the JSE  so now those shares are registered on the Euronext. Shareholders are now making the election and remember we did give some shareholders the opportunity to pick an aspect if they wanted it  but the overwhelming demand is going to be for Prosus – in terms of the election – and we will know that outcome by the 16th of September which is next Monday. From there  Prosus now becomes Europe’s largest consumer Internet company. In fact  three times larger than its closest peer  it becomes the third largest company on the Euronext by market capitalisation.When you look at liquidity – because some of these companies have 100% of their stock on the exchange – we’re about the eighth largest on the Euronext in terms of volume traded. So it started off well this morning  we set an opening price driven off what Naspers’s closing price was yesterday  multiplied by the Naspers shares and divided that by the number of Prosus shares outstanding and that’s how we set the reference price. From there it’s moved up very quickly and as a result the discount at the Prosus level has narrowed considerably  but so has the discount at the Naspers level. Before we started all of this  we were at about a 45% discount to the underlying net asset value – as of yesterday we were about 30%. So that’s already a 10% reduction. Today it seems that Naspers has also opened up well with further narrowing in the discount. So overall – between these two moves – we’ve probably unlocked something like $20bn of value for our shareholders.That’s extraordinary. When you put it like that – all the hard numbers  all the hard work  all the criticism that you put up with – is worth it.Yes  I think our shareholders weren’t critical of us  they were asking us to find the right solution and it wasn’t a simple answer. This was a complex problem  it’s actually a unique problem. I don’t think it’s ever existed. I haven’t gone back hundreds of years  but certainly – in my professional career – I don’t think a company has ever had to solve the problem where you’re 25% of an exchange. How do you do this in a sensible manner? How do you do it in a way that protects shareholder value and doesn’t result in the incremental costs and leakage? So we worked tirelessly over the last 18 months to come to this approach. It’s just great to see that it’s delivering something for our shareholders. Is it done? No. Is there going to be more work? Absolutely I’m sure  because our ambitions are to keep building that market cap and building the valuation and therefore there’s going to be more things that we’ll have to do going forward.The discount has narrowed from 45% to under 35% – as you say it was a good day today – but in practical terms  what happens on a listing like this? Do you arrive – as in the old days at the JSE – with the big fanfare  people on the floor cheering for you? Obviously with electronic exchanges it doesn’t work like that but do they put on a bit of a show?Yeah. It was great. I woke up at five thirty this morning and I just took a moment to reflect on the journey we’ve been on and on the wonderful team that helped us get to this point. And then I arrived here this morning to see the branding and the colours all over the exchange. The Euronext have been fantastic hosts. The CEO was there  the entire executive team was there and the head of Euronext global markets was there – Anthony who also heads up Euronext Paris and our people in Amsterdam were there. We had a good breakfast together and a couple of moments of reflection and we then walked out on to the platform and Bob gave us a solid gong – loud and clear – and Euronext knew we were here. It was filled with people – business partners  employees  Euronext people – as well as some public on the floor. It was a great atmosphere. We also had Nicky from the JSE and that was wonderful. The JSE have been absolutely great over the years  they’re a big part of our success. We’re also inward listed on the JSE  so Prosus is now on two exchanges.It was interesting to see the JSE trading this morning where Naspers made up about a third of the trading and Prosus made up about 20% – more than half the two companies. Of course it’s the first day of listing  so it might be exaggerated  but there were concerns that the JSE would struggle because of this listing. It might actually go the other way  they might get a benefit from a higher trade.I hope that would be the case over the long term because – at the end of the day – this is the way I look at it. Prosus no longer has the structural issues of being too big for its exchange. It also had the advantage of opening up pools of capital that otherwise couldn’t invest in a South African company or an emerging market company  so by taking those two things away  you actually allow the markets to better price the underlying assets. Once the market prices it  you then look at Naspers and see you’re buying the same assets  so why should you pay more? There’s opportunity on the JSE – it’s fundamentally the same business. I would step in and buy some. I think that’s the sensible thing to do – certainly what I’m doing – and hopefully that momentum builds. We now have bigger pools of capital  better pricing of the asset and we certainly hope that it also reflects on on the JSE and Naspers and brings more money into South Africa. These are the same great assets that everyone’s so excited about  we can buy them at a good price here too. People indicated that to us going on the road shows. It’s great for the JSE and it’s great for Naspers in South Africa.Have you been surprised at the level of publicity that has surrounded this listing?No  is quite a unique thing and it was quite a unique problem that we were trying to solve and we are a big company. So yeah. lots of interest  many stakeholders involved and generally a lot of discussion.I suppose a little different now to have the FT and the big magazines from Europe and of course dealing with the big names – not that you haven’t been dealing with the likes of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. One last thing. What is the SENS announcement – this morning – about Naspers’s restricted stock plan trust. A R176m transaction. What is it and how do we understand that?Historically  management is incentivised at two levels. First of all we get e-commerce share appreciation rights. So that’s really everything excluding our listed assets like Tencent. We have to create value there and that accounts for about half of our compensation – Bob’s and mine. The balance is related to Naspers. It makes sure we take structural action to address things like the discount. Historically the way we’ve got exposure to Naspers  is through options. So what effectively happens now is we get actual stock – we only get that in three years time – and we only get it if we actually outperform the set of internet companies. It fundamentally aims to ensure that we continue to create value by outperforming a list of meaningful peers including the likes of Facebook  Google  Amazon and if we do that well – on a continuous basis – we get rewarded. If not  then we don’t.Thanks for articulating that. One last question. Capital gains that are now being set. How does that work? A lot of South African shareholders will be looking at their Prosus shares  they’ve sold their Naspers shares to get Prosus – and so on. What is the number going to be?Essentially you take Prosus shares as a South African retail/corporate investor – this doesn’t apply to institutional investors – you will pay capital gains on the full value of the Prosus shares  based on the closing today. That’s going to be more than paid for by the value gains. To bear in mind  it’s not an extra tax. It’s timing  because you would have paid capital gains tax eventually when you sold your Naspers shares  so it just brings things forward a little bit. I think most shareholders are going to pay – it’s not unique to South Africans – several other jurisdictions will face a similar type of tax.So the tax man is saying go Prosus share price because the higher it closes today  the more capital gains will go into the Treasury.Exactly.Basil  thanks for the chat. You leaving Amsterdam now and are you coming back to South Africa for a roadshow?We’ve done the road trips. We’ve got a global summit in San Francisco and it’s going to be a wonderful one this year. A lot to reflect on and be happy about.Basil Sgourdos is the financial director of Naspers talking to us from Europe.Visited 120 times  5 visit(s) today,neutral,0.06,0.92,0.01,mixed,0.71,0.15,0.13,True,English,"['Basil Sgourdos', 'Prosus listing', 'Naspers shareholders', 'Naspers Group CFO Basil Sgourdos', 'underlying net asset value', 'largest consumer Internet company', 'global internet assets', 'top three executives', 'third largest company', 'entire executive team', 'Euronext global markets', 'underlying assets', 'wonderful team', 'shareholder value', 'Naspers level', 'Rational Radio', 'Alec Hogg', 'SENS announcement', 'R176m transaction', 'overwhelming demand', 'closest peer', 'market capitalisation', 'opening price', 'closing price', 'reference price', 'two moves', 'hard numbers', 'right solution', 'simple answer', 'professional career', 'sensible manner', 'incremental costs', 'last 18 months', 'old days', 'big fanfare', 'electronic exchanges', 'fantastic hosts', 'good breakfast', 'solid gong', 'business partners', 'great atmosphere', 'big part', 'two exchanges', 'Naspers shares', 'complex problem', 'unique problem', 'The Euronext', 'Euronext Paris', 'hard work', 'good day', 'Prosus level', 'actual listing', 'practical terms', 'The JSE', 'JSE trading', 'Prosus shares', 'existing shareholders', 'shares’ discount', 'Euronext people', '45% discount', 'decision', 'Dutch', 'Amsterdam', 'strategy', 'boost', 'owners', 'milestone', 'history', 'opportunity', 'holding', 'liquidity', 'election', 'aspect', 'outcome', '16th', 'September', 'Europe', 'fact', 'companies', 'stock', 'volume', 'result', 'yesterday', '10% reduction', 'narrowing', 'something', 'criticism', 'hundreds', 'years', 'way', 'leakage', 'approach', 'No.', 'ambitions', 'valuation', 'things', 'floor', 'show', 'moment', 'journey', 'point', 'branding', 'colours', 'CEO', 'head', 'Anthony', 'couple', 'reflection', 'platform', 'Bob', 'employees', 'public', 'Nicky', 'success']",2019-09-11,2023-11-22,biznews.com
