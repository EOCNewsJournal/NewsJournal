The move follows a directive from Euroclear  the European Union's largest depositary  instructing partner banks to segregate accounts belonging to Russians to ensure compliance with European Union sanctions.Oigman highlighted that the majority of asset-holders were notified in advance by the banks about the potential segregation of their accounts. This preemptive communication allowed account holders ample time to sell or transfer their securities before the segregation took effect. Notably  the segregation specifically targets assets linked with Euroclear  and Russian residents still have the freedom to open accounts and engage in foreign securities trading through Israeli banks  provided these securities are outside the European Union's jurisdiction.The context for this action lies in the sanctions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine conflict  with the European Union and Switzerland restricting assets belonging to Russian citizens last year. These restrictions included a ban on receiving more than EUR100 000 in European Union-based accounts and a similar limit on investment accounts. In the case of investment portfolios exceeding EUR100 000  coupon income  dividends  or proceeds from asset sales were directed to a segregated account  inaccessible to the account owner. Euroclear gained the authority to block these funds in the event of sanctions violations.The implementation of asset segregation by Israeli banks underscores the global financial sector's role in enforcing sanctions and maintaining compliance with international regulations.As geopolitical dynamics continue to influence financial practices  the impact of such measures on account holders and the broader economic landscape remains a topic of interest for financial experts and policymakers.MENAFN23112023000045015687ID1107476441,neutral,0.02,0.9,0.08,negative,0.02,0.26,0.72,True,English,"['biggest bank', 'Russian properties', 'Media', 'Israel', 'account holders ample time', 'European Union (EU) sanctions', 'broader economic landscape', 'global financial sector', 'international financial company', 'Russian tax residents', 'three largest banks', 'European Union sanctions', 'European Union-based accounts', 'Russian residents', 'largest depositary', 'segregated account', 'account owner', 'international regulations', 'financial practices', 'financial experts', 'Russian citizens', 'sanctions violations', 'Discount Bank', 'Bank Hapoalim', 'Bank Leumi', 'partner banks', 'preemptive communication', 'Israeli banks', 'Ukraine conflict', 'similar limit', 'investment portfolios', 'coupon income', 'asset sales', 'geopolitical dynamics', 'Mark Oigman', 'potential segregation', 'investment accounts', 'asset segregation', 'foreign securities', 'MENAFN', 'adherence', 'assets', 'founder', 'SmartGen', 'Forbes', 'Wednesday', 'move', 'directive', 'Euroclear', 'Russians', 'compliance', 'majority', 'asset-holders', 'advance', 'effect', 'freedom', 'jurisdiction', 'context', 'action', 'Switzerland', 'restrictions', 'case', 'dividends', 'proceeds', 'authority', 'funds', 'event', 'implementation', 'role', 'impact', 'measures', 'topic', 'interest', 'policymakers']",2023-11-23,2023-11-23,menafn.com

Lhyfe has about 200 employees[1] dedicated entirely to renewable hydrogen production  with projects in 11 countries and a pipeline of over 10 GW[1] in Europe.The plant will be located in an industrial area in Vallmoll (Tarragona) and will address demand for green hydrogen from different industrial companies in the area.Potential clients include companies active in chemical and others industrial sectors which aim at replacing fossil fuels (grey hydrogen and natural gas) currently used in their production process with green hydrogen  as well as transport or logistics companies looking to replace their fleet (trucks  forklifts) with less polluting vehicles like hydrogen-powered electric vehicles.Lhyfe's project is one of only 14 across Spain in 2023 that were awarded grant financing through H2 Pioneros[2] (out of 81 projects submitted). The grant  which will fund the design phases  the supply of equipment and the construction work  represents about half of the total estimated investment in the project  with first kilos of green hydrogen to be produced in 2026.“We are very happy to have been awarded this grant  which we see as a clear reward of our efforts and as the recognition of our expertise in the production and delivery of green hydrogen to multiples customers over the last two years. It is also a proof of us going the right direction in Spain  and we would like to reiterate our commitment to the Spanish hydrogen strategy and welcome the fact that Spain is focusing on the rapid expansion of a hydrogen infrastructure based on renewable energies. This project will make a significant contribution towards providing competitive green hydrogen for many industrial and transport companies in the province of Tarragona. It will support our objective to increase the penetration of green hydrogen throughout Spain in other similar industrial processes""  says Taia Kronborg  Chief Business Officer at Lhyfe.The project's implementation is subject to the granting of operating authorizations and construction permits  as well as to financial investment decisions.About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

The Group successfully purchased three plots of land in Rüsselsheim am Main  strategically located at less than a 15 minutes’ drive from Frankfurt Airport.With a total area exceeding 700 000 m²  these plots were procured from Stellantis  a globally recognized automotive group and mobility provider. Stellantis is in the process of optimising its historic Opel production site in Rüsselsheim  a site with over a century of history. Initially  Stellantis will lease back the properties  gradually releasing them for redevelopment.VGP’s vision for this acquisition involves the creation of a business park spanning approximately 350 000 m2 tailored for industrial companies and small and medium-sized value-added businesses. In line with its commitment to responsible development  VGP will operate with care to optimize the benefits of the development for the local community in close coordination with the responsible authorities.This prime location offers unparalleled advantages  with Frankfurt Airport accessible within a 15-minute drive and through a direct connection from the railway station on the site. Furthermore the international finance centre of Frankfurt  Wiesbaden or Mainz can be reached within 20 minutes (direct connections from the railway station or by motorway)  offering links to ICE railway stations. The site’s strategic location is further enhanced by direct access to the State-B43 through road and convenient proximity to four national motorways (A3  A60  A67  A671). Additionally  with direct harbour access to the river Main  the site boasts tri-modality transport potential.VGP aims for an ambitious environmental approach for the park  committing to achieving a minimum DGNB Gold certification for all buildings. The new park will be largely independent from the grid as it will benefit from existing electricity facilities and water treatment and recycling services. Rooftops are expected to be equipped with photovoltaic panels and a geothermal system is projected to contribute to the facility’s energy and heating needs by 2025.This marks VGP’s second significant brownfield acquisition this month  following the purchase of a 194 000 m2 land plot in Vélizy  Paris region  France. The redevelopment of old industrial sites in collaboration with local communities is a core expertise of VGP and the Group has recently indicated to be working on several notable acquisitions in the pipeline as foundation stones of an ambitious future growth plan.With a growing presence  the Group now encompasses 40 locations in Germany and operates in seventeen European countries. The family-owned company is headquartered in Antwerp  Belgium  and operates a total of 112 parks across Europe.CONTACT DETAILS VGPInvestor RelationsTel: +32 (0)3 289 1433investor.relations@vgpparks.eu Karen HuybrechtsHead of Marketing Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial properties as well as a provider of renewable energy solutions.

This comprehensive partnership has been designed to tackle three key priorities – business transformation  financing and influence – which are essential to effectively tackle the current biodiversity crisis.As part of the partnership  four main initiatives are being rolled out  leveraging the expertise of Atos and WWF teams from all over the world.Atos to develop responsible IT solutions for WWF and its partnersAtos and WWF have defined the following projects by which conservation organizations and other stakeholders could benefit from Atos’ technological expertise.Automating biodiversity surveillance - The first project aims to bring automation to the monitoring of important ecosystems. Atos experts are working to combine the use of artificial intelligence to analyze satellite imagery with the development of algorithms which identify patterns over a given time period in order to identify irregular trends which might indicate a negative biodiversity impact. In the future  organizations will not only be able to identify the areas of greatest concern  but also benefit from predictive solutions for nature conservation. The first pilot  currently being developed  will analyze grasslands and savannahs in East Africa.- The first project aims to bring automation to the monitoring of important ecosystems.

The first pilot  currently being developed  will analyze grasslands and savannahs in East Africa. Predicting & preventing epidemic risk - The second project focuses on predicting hotspots of emergence for zoonoses – diseases that jump between species  including humans. Atos teams are developing machine learning algorithms to analyze demographic  environmental  animal health and pathogen data  in order to identify patterns and predict the risk of new diseases. These solutions will complement existing surveillance systems by providing predictive data  to help governments and organizations anticipate and take preventive actions before the threat of an epidemic becomes a reality. A pilot is being developed to analyze data available in the Mekong basin.- The second project focuses on predicting hotspots of emergence for zoonoses – diseases that jump between species  including humans.

These solutions will complement existing surveillance systems by providing predictive data  to help governments and organizations anticipate and take preventive actions before the threat of an epidemic becomes a reality. A pilot is being developed to analyze data available in the Mekong basin. Improving tech tools - The third project aims at improving an existing solution known as SMART - a Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool – which is already used by 50 000 agents in 80 countries to support wildlife and ecosystem conservation. Atos experts are developing a streamlined  more efficient process with SMART’s IT team  to enhance its usability in the field. In addition  they are developing improved dashboards and visualization options to give users greater and more granular insight into their data. They are also enhancing SMART with a tool to support users working to shift ‘conflict to coexistence’  that is  holistically manage conflicts between humans and wildlife to create mutual benefits of coexistence.Atos and WWF to help advance decarbonization initiatives for industriesAtos and WWF have envisioned to analyze every year  an industry which has a significant carbon footprint  to identify its main decarbonization levers and provide recommendations to accelerate their decarbonization efforts. The first report focuses on shipping  which accounted for around 80% of global trade by volume in 2022  and is responsible for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions*.Since the publication of the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee's new greenhouse gas (GHG) strategy in July 2023  Atos and WWF teams have compiled the literature devoted to the decarbonization of shipping into a comprehensive report. They found that most research focuses on new fuels and ship design  initiatives that could take a long time to have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions. In order to provide sustainability leaders with a clear and more achievable mid-term roadmap  the research focuses on energy efficiency  operational levers and concrete use cases where digital technology can help the shipping industry decarbonize its operations.Atos to support on-site WWF France biodiversity projectsAs part of the partnership  Atos supports two carbon capture and restoration projects managed by WWF France:the Posidonia project  which aims to protect the meadows of Posidonia  a plant noticeable by its extensive capacity to stock carbon  in the Mediterranean region the Nature Impact project for the conservation or restoration of forest biodiversity in France  using the approach developed by WWF based on Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES).Atos and WWF to encourage employee involvement in sustainability projects driven by WWFMany of Atos employees are already regularly involved in volunteer work and environmental preservation. Atos and WWF aim to facilitate and encourage their commitment with a dedicated program that will integrate onsite and digital volunteering opportunities in one platform compliant with CSR reporting frameworks. The first engagement programs for Atos employees will be launched in pilot countries in 2024.Kirsten Schuijt  Director General WWF  said “The devastating impacts of climate change and nature loss are felt everywhere. This dual crisis requires urgent  innovative and scalable solutions. Technology  if channeled in the right way  has the enormous potential to help address some of the pressing challenges we face today. We're excited about this new partnership with Atos as it will enable us to collaborate on advancing much-needed technological tools to support our efforts to stop and reverse nature loss at a policy level and in the field.”Véronique Andrieux  CEO WWF France  said ""We are very excited to announce our partnership with Atos  which is already delivering results on optimizing and increasing the reach of some of WWF's conservation projects. Helping us better identify changes in the habitats of Key Biodiversity Areas or modernizing some of the data collection and analysis tools used by our wildlife conservation teams are some of the outcomes already achieved by our common work. Our partnership with Atos represents a significant step forward  enabling us to harness technology for helping deliver our conservation objectives.""Nourdine Bihmane  Deputy CEO Atos and CEO Tech Foundations  said “We are excited to announce this strategic partnership with WWF which is in line with our respective ambitions and expertise. Atos has been committed for over 12 years to decarbonize its own operations as well as accompany its customers in their own efforts. I am extremely proud that our technological expertise is being put to work to accelerate decarbonization strategies and support WWF's conservation practices and biodiversity projects worldwide.”The Atos Group has been committed to minimize the environmental impact of its activities across the value chain worldwide for over 12 years.
