33076,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/587789-israel-banks-block-russian-assets/,Israel’s largest banks block Russian assets – media,Three financial institutions in Israel have segregated accounts that belong to Russians  Forbes reports Read Full Article at RT.com,The measures target securities connected with EU depository EuroclearThe three largest Israeli banks have segregated assets in accounts belonging to Russian citizens or Russian tax residents  Forbes reported on Wednesday  citing Mark Oigman  the founder of international financial company SmartGen.Previously  the EU’s largest depositary Euroclear demanded that its partner-banks separate accounts that belong to Russians in order to monitor compliance with EU sanctions.“We know that Israel’s three largest banks have already segregated [Russian accounts]: Discount bank  Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi ” Oigman said.According to the financier  most asset-holders have managed to secure their funds as banks notified them of the possible account segregation in advance  giving them ample time to sell or move their securities. Oigman added that the segregation only targeted assets linked with Euroclear  and Russian residents are still free to open accounts and trade in foreign securities through Israeli banks  if these securities are outside of EU jurisdiction.As part of sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine conflict  the EU and Switzerland placed restrictions on assets belonging to Russian citizens last year: they were banned from receiving more than €100 000 ($108 000) in their EU-based accounts. A similar limit was placed on investment accounts: if a Russian resident’s investment portfolio exceeded €100 000  any coupon income  dividends  or proceeds from the sale of assets linked to it were credited to a special segregated account. The account’s owner lost access to these funds  while Euroclear gained means to block them in the event of sanctions violations.Restrictions initially applied only to EU-based financial institutions which held Euroclear-linked assets  but the clearing house has since instructed its partners outside the bloc to comply with the requirements  including the UAE’s NBD Bank and the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE). An order instructing Israeli financial institutions to segregate accounts belonging to Russians reportedly came into force on November 13.According to earlier reports  Israeli banks are currently in talks with Euroclear over the details of asset segregations  as many account holders have dual Russian-Israeli citizenship  and it is unclear whether their accounts should fall under the depository’s restrictions.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.02,0.74,0.24,negative,0.01,0.21,0.77,True,English,"['largest banks', 'Russian assets', 'Israel', 'media', 'three largest Israeli banks', 'three largest banks', 'international financial company', 'Kazakhstan Stock Exchange', 'dual Russian-Israeli citizenship', 'Israeli financial institutions', 'special segregated account', 'EU-based financial institutions', 'many account holders', 'largest depositary Euroclear', 'Russian tax residents', 'possible account segregation', 'EU depository Euroclear', 'Russian residents', 'Russian citizens', 'Discount bank', 'Bank Hapoalim', 'Bank Leumi', 'most asset-holders', 'ample time', 'Ukraine conflict', 'similar limit', 'investment portfolio', 'coupon income', 'clearing house', 'NBD Bank', 'earlier reports', 'asset segregations', 'business section', 'EU jurisdiction', 'EU-based accounts', 'sanctions violations', 'EU sanctions', 'Mark Oigman', 'investment accounts', 'foreign securities', 'Euroclear-linked assets', 'measures', 'Forbes', 'Wednesday', 'founder', 'SmartGen', 'partner-banks', 'Russians', 'order', 'compliance', 'financier', 'funds', 'advance', 'trade', 'Switzerland', 'restrictions', 'dividends', 'proceeds', 'sale', 'owner', 'access', 'means', 'event', 'partners', 'bloc', 'requirements', 'UAE', 'KASE', 'force', 'November', 'talks', 'details', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-11-23,2023-11-24,rt.com

The London-listed miner  specializing in precious metals  has been working to mitigate the effects of sanctions that resulted in over 20% of its share capital being frozen earlier this year.The disruption began in June when operations between NSD and Euroclear were hindered due to EU sanctions  leading to considerable operational challenges for the company and its shareholders. In an effort to alleviate some of these issues  Polymetal completed a re-domiciliation from Jersey to the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC) on August 2023  followed by a First Exchange Offer which concluded on October 11  2023. This initial exchange involved acquiring treasury-held shares and was partially successful in resolving the matter.However  despite these measures  approximately 14% of Polymetal's shares remain under the influence of restrictions. To further address this issue  the company is targeting shareholders with Affected Shares through its Second Exchange Offer. The offer is specifically designed for participants who are not associated with Unfriendly Jurisdictions or sanctioned entities.The process leading up to this decision involved shareholders using AIX Registrar starting to cast their votes on Tuesday for resolutions related to the upcoming General Meeting. The crucial meeting is set to take place at the Sheraton Astana Hotel on Friday  December 8  2023. This gathering will be pivotal as it will not only sanction the Second Exchange Offer but also announce its initial outcomes.The upcoming General Meeting in December is expected to provide clarity and potentially offer relief to affected shareholders if the Second Exchange Offer is approved. Polymetal continues to navigate through these complex sanctions-related challenges with a focus on maintaining shareholder value and operational continuity amidst an evolving geopolitical landscape.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

This was mainly due to the expansion of the property portfolio and CPI-linked rent increases. The result from property management was negatively impacted by higher management costs and expenses relating to other periods and therefore rose only marginally. Funds from operations (""FFO"")  on the other hand  declined and fell by around 11.5% to EUR 36.2 million (previous year: EUR 41.1 million) or EUR 0.72 per share (fully diluted) (previous year: EUR 0.82 per share) and were in line with the guidance. This decrease was mainly due to higher net interest expenses  which were around EUR 3.1 million higher than in the previous year. Similarly  aFFO (FFO after deduction of capitalised modernisation measures) declined and amounted to around EUR 14.4 million (previous year: EUR 22.5 million) due to several major revitalisation measures (capex) at various properties. Property portfolio grows / property valuation leads to valuation loss of EUR 125 million As a result of the transfer of benefits and encumbrances of twelve properties acquired in the previous year less three properties sold in the financial year  the property portfolio has grown by a total of nine properties with an area of around 35 000 square metres and generates an annual rent of around EUR 79.2 million. The annual revaluation of the property portfolio as at 30 September 2023  on the other hand  results in a devaluation of around 9% (like-for-like) and a negative valuation result of around EUR 125 million  which is mainly caused by the significantly changed interest rate environment with much higher interest rates. After many years of revaluation uplifts fuelled by the low interest rate policy  the ECB's interest rate turnaround with ten interest rate hikes in a row has now resulted in a decline in valuation for the first time. Accordingly  DKR's real estate portfolio (including properties for sale) is valued at around EUR 997 million as at 30 September 2023 and thus at a valuation multiple of around 12.6x the annual rent (30 September 2022: EUR 1 051 million or 14 3x the annual rent). The gross acquisition yield of the overall portfolio averaged more than 10% as at 30 September 2023. Status of negotiations with Obotritia Capital KGaA regarding outstanding loan The Management Board is still in constructive negotiations with Obotritia Capital KGaA on the repayment of the outstanding loan receivable with the support of a specialised lawyer and has reached an agreement in principle. In addition to legal issues that still need to be clarified  further collateral is currently being identified and its recoverability validated  and the collateralisation methods are being determined. The collateral volume is intended to largely cover the outstanding loan receivable of currently EUR 65.7 million. In addition  a repayment agreement is to be concluded that defines the timing of the repayments. The notarisation of the agreement and the provision of collateral in rem are to take place in the course of December 2023. Despite the planned collateralisation of the outstanding receivable  the Management Board has decided to adjust the value of the outstanding loan receivable by around EUR 36 million or 55% as a precautionary measure (the amount of the value adjustment is currently the subject of the audit of the financial statements and may therefore still change). The value adjustment will lead to a significant increase in administrative expenses  which will initially have a strong negative impact on earnings in the past financial year. If the receivables that have now been written down are repaid in full at a later date  this will result in valuation income again. Initial accounting for taxes Furthermore  the Management Board has decided that  due to the unclear time perspective and the unclear outcome of the legal dispute with the tax authorities with regard to maintaining REIT status  all possible tax risks will be recognised for reasons of prudence. Accordingly  the previously recognised tax receivables are derecognised and deferred taxes are recognised for the first time. This leads to tax expenses totalling around EUR 72.5 million in the IFRS annual financial statements  of which around EUR 62.2 million comprises the first-time recognition of (non-cash) deferred tax liabilities. Overall result for the period of around EUR -203 million expected / No dividend for FY 2022/2023 For the full financial year 2022/2023  the overall result for the period is expected to be negative at around EUR -203 million  which is significantly influenced by non-cash expenses such as the property devaluation (EUR -125 million)  the value adjustment of the loan receivable from Obotritia Capital KGaA (EUR -36 million) and the first-time recognition of deferred tax liabilities (EUR -62.2 million). Due to the negative annual result according to IFRS as well as under German GAAP  no dividend can be proposed for the past financial year 2022/2023. EPRA NTA (fully diluted) at around EUR 7.99 per share / Net LTV increases to around 60.3% Based on the preliminary figures and after accounting for all of the aforementioned risks  the EPRA NTA (fully diluted) as at 30 September 2023 is around EUR 7.99 per share (30 September 2022: EUR 10.98 per share). The intrinsic value of the share is therefore significantly higher than the current share price. Due to the negative annual result  the net LTV increased to around 60.3% at the end of the financial year. Negotiations with loan and bond creditors With regard to the corporate bonds maturing in spring 2024  DKR is in negotiations with the bondholder in order to find a mutually beneficial solution as quickly as possible. Audited annual financial statements will be published on 19 December 2023 Deutsche Konsum REIT-AG will publish the final and audited results for the 2022/2023 financial year on 19 December 2023 in its annual report  which it will present during the webcast/teleconference.

This decrease was mainly due to higher net interest expenses  which were around EUR 3.1 million higher than in the previous year.Similarly  aFFO (FFO after deduction of capitalised modernisation measures) declined and amounted to around EUR 14.4 million (previous year: EUR 22.5 million) due to several major revitalisation measures (capex) at various properties.Property portfolio grows / property valuation leads to valuation loss of EUR 125 millionAs a result of the transfer of benefits and encumbrances of twelve properties acquired in the previous year less three properties sold in the financial year  the property portfolio has grown by a total of nine properties with an area of around 35 000 square metres and generates an annual rent of around EUR 79.2 million.The annual revaluation of the property portfolio as at 30 September 2023  on the other hand  results in a devaluation of around 9% (like-for-like) and a negative valuation result of around EUR 125 million  which is mainly caused by the significantly changed interest rate environment with much higher interest rates. After many years of revaluation uplifts fuelled by the low interest rate policy  the ECB's interest rate turnaround with ten interest rate hikes in a row has now resulted in a decline in valuation for the first time. Accordingly  DKR's real estate portfolio (including properties for sale) is valued at around EUR 997 million as at 30 September 2023 and thus at a valuation multiple of around 12.6x the annual rent (30 September 2022: EUR 1 051 million or 14 3x the annual rent).The gross acquisition yield of the overall portfolio averaged more than 10% as at 30 September 2023.Status of negotiations with Obotritia Capital KGaA regarding outstanding loanThe Management Board is still in constructive negotiations with Obotritia Capital KGaA on the repayment of the outstanding loan receivable with the support of a specialised lawyer and has reached an agreement in principle. In addition to legal issues that still need to be clarified  further collateral is currently being identified and its recoverability validated  and the collateralisation methods are being determined. The collateral volume is intended to largely cover the outstanding loan receivable of currently EUR 65.7 million. In addition  a repayment agreement is to be concluded that defines the timing of the repayments. The notarisation of the agreement and the provision of collateral in rem are to take place in the course of December 2023.Despite the planned collateralisation of the outstanding receivable  the Management Board has decided to adjust the value of the outstanding loan receivable by around EUR 36 million or 55% as a precautionary measure (the amount of the value adjustment is currently the subject of the audit of the financial statements and may therefore still change). The value adjustment will lead to a significant increase in administrative expenses  which will initially have a strong negative impact on earnings in the past financial year. If the receivables that have now been written down are repaid in full at a later date  this will result in valuation income again.Initial accounting for taxesFurthermore  the Management Board has decided that  due to the unclear time perspective and the unclear outcome of the legal dispute with the tax authorities with regard to maintaining REIT status  all possible tax risks will be recognised for reasons of prudence. Accordingly  the previously recognised tax receivables are derecognised and deferred taxes are recognised for the first time. This leads to tax expenses totalling around EUR 72.5 million in the IFRS annual financial statements  of which around EUR 62.2 million comprises the first-time recognition of (non-cash) deferred tax liabilities.Overall result for the period of around EUR -203 million expected / No dividend for FY 2022/2023For the full financial year 2022/2023  the overall result for the period is expected to be negative at around EUR -203 million  which is significantly influenced by non-cash expenses such as the property devaluation (EUR -125 million)  the value adjustment of the loan receivable from Obotritia Capital KGaA (EUR -36 million) and the first-time recognition of deferred tax liabilities (EUR -62.2 million).Due to the negative annual result according to IFRS as well as under German GAAP  no dividend can be proposed for the past financial year 2022/2023.EPRA NTA (fully diluted) at around EUR 7.99 per share / Net LTV increases to around 60.3%Based on the preliminary figures and after accounting for all of the aforementioned risks  the EPRA NTA (fully diluted) as at 30 September 2023 is around EUR 7.99 per share (30 September 2022: EUR 10.98 per share). The intrinsic value of the share is therefore significantly higher than the current share price.Due to the negative annual result  the net LTV increased to around 60.3% at the end of the financial year.Negotiations with loan and bond creditorsWith regard to the corporate bonds maturing in spring 2024  DKR is in negotiations with the bondholder in order to find a mutually beneficial solution as quickly as possible.Audited annual financial statements will be published on 19 December 2023Deutsche Konsum REIT-AG will publish the final and audited results for the 2022/2023 financial year on 19 December 2023 in its annual report  which it will present during the webcast/teleconference.About the CompanyDeutsche Konsum REIT-AG  Broderstorf  is a listed real estate company focusing on German retail properties for everyday goods in established micro-locations.

The company's Supervisory Board approved the proposal to pay the special dividend today. Based on the number of 76 464 319 shares issued in the company  this corresponds to an amount of € 103 226 830.65 to be distributed from the net retained profits for the 2022 financial year.The special dividend is to be paid in addition to the dividend already paid out to shareholders on 1 September 2023. For this purpose  the resolution on the appropriation of profits for the 2022 financial year already adopted by the company's Annual General Meeting on 29 August 2023 is to be adjusted at the upcoming Extraordinary General Meeting and the partial amount of € 500 000 087.94 carried forward to new account at that time is to be reduced by the above-mentioned additional amount to be distributed to € 396 773 257.29. Subject to a corresponding resolution by the Extraordinary General Meeting  payment of the special dividend is then planned for 11 January 2024.The distribution is in line with the Company's strategy of reorganising its capital and financing structure and using cash that is not required to meet the Deutsche EuroShop Group's liquidity requirements to increase dividend payments or pay a special dividend. In this context  the Company recently reviewed the Deutsche EuroShop Group's liquidity requirements. In addition  companies of the Deutsche EuroShop Group  in particular those in which the Deutsche EuroShop Group acquired additional shares at the beginning of 2023  are currently in the process of increasing existing loans. With regard to the corresponding companies  the additional borrowing ultimately serves to subsequently increase the debt ratio in relation to the respective shopping centers and  from a Group perspective  also to increase the debt ratio. As a result  the Deutsche EuroShop Group now has cash that can be distributed to shareholders in the short term.The Company reserves the right to adjust its proposed resolution on the distribution of the special dividend before or at the latest at the Annual General Meeting if this should prove possible and expedient for the distribution of a higher dividend due to new circumstances  in particular the creation of further liquidity through the conclusion of loan agreements expected from today's perspective.Issued by: Nicolas Lissner  Senior Manager Investor & Public Relations",neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,neutral,0.05,0.92,0.04,True,English,"['Extraordinary General Meeting', 'Deutsche EuroShop', 'special dividend', 'early January', 'resolution', 'upcoming Extraordinary General Meeting', 'Annual General Meeting', 'respective shopping centers', 'Senior Manager Investor', 'Deutsche EuroShop AG', 'Deutsche EuroShop Group', 'EQS Group AG', 'Group perspective', 'Key word', 'inside information', 'EU) No', 'EQS News', 'Executive Board', 'Supervisory Board', '2022 financial year', 'new account', 'financing structure', 'existing loans', 'additional borrowing', 'debt ratio', 'short term', 'new circumstances', 'loan agreements', 'Nicolas Lissner', 'Public Relations', 'special dividend', 'dividend payments', 'higher dividend', 'partial amount', 'additional amount', 'liquidity requirements', 'early January', 'additional shares', 'corresponding companies', 'corresponding resolution', 'The Company', '8 January', '76,464,319 shares', '11 January', 'Dividend/AGM/EGM', 'Nov', 'CET', 'CEST', 'Disclosure', 'Article', 'MAR', 'Regulation', 'service', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'Hamburg', 'proposal', 'number', 'net', 'profits', 'shareholders', '1 September', 'purpose', 'appropriation', '29 August', 'time', 'distribution', 'line', 'strategy', 'capital', 'cash', 'context', 'beginning', 'process', 'regard', 'result', 'right', 'creation', 'conclusion', 'today']",2023-11-24,2023-11-24,stock-world.de

When all the solar panels are operating at maximum capacity  together they will provide enough electricity to supply up to 7.5 % of Co-op’s total electricity needs per year.Over the course of a full year  they are expected to produce around 34 000 megawatt hours of electricity  which is enough to power over 170 Co-op Food Stores  500 Co-op Funeralcare homes  or indeed  provide electricity for around 12 500 UK homes.Co-op’s commitment will now unlock the investment required to build the solar plant and in doing so will help to add additional renewable generation to the United Kingdom  an important step as Co-op continues to call for energy market reform and work towards reaching Net Zero for its operations by 2035.Shirine Khoury-Haq  Group CEO at the Co-op said: “The signing of this Corporate PPA is a significant milestone demonstrating Co-op’s goal to green the energy grid and create transparency in the renewable energy market. Not only will this agreement unlock more green energy  it will also enable energy security  drive economic growth and move us closer to net zero. That’s why we still believe that grid decarbonisation should be an absolute priority for the Government. Whilst businesses have a part to play  reform to allow much more rapid progress for projects such as the Eastgate solar project is urgently needed. Whilst the significant progress the United Kingdom has made to date is to be applauded  as a country we remain too reliant on fossil fuels  and ambitious targets alone won’t deliver the benefits that a Net Zero grid will deliver  from energy security to lower generation costs to the better outcome for the planet that’s so desperately needed.”The signing of this contract with Co-op reaffirms Voltalia’s position as a leader in PPA solutions for corporates and organisations.

The Company has a comprehensive plan to foster its Circular Economy ambitions with a 360-degree approach based on the 4R strategy: Reman  Repair  Reuse  and Recycle.The primary objectives of the state-of-the-art Circular Economy Hub are to extend the life of parts and vehicles  ensuring that they last for as long as possible. When that is no longer possible  the material is collected for recycling from the remanufacturing activity  and from the end-of-life vehicle dismantling activity  and then returned to the manufacturing loop to build new vehicles and parts. The CE Hub initially hosts four activities implementing the 4R strategy  with the scope set to expand further:Remanufacturing (Reman): used  worn  or defective components  such as engines  gearboxes and EV batteries are disassembled  cleaned  and remanufactured to original OEM specifications  without compromising quality. The goal is to offer a sustainable and affordable alternative available under the SUSTAINera label within the Stellantis spare parts offer. The facility expects to manage over 50 000 remanufactured parts by 2025  rising to 150 000 by 2030.Sorting Center (Reman  Recycle): an estimated 2.5 million worn parts  known as cores  will supply the facility’s remanufacturing and recycling activities by 2025  increasing to 8 million by 2030.Vehicle Reconditioning (Repair  Reman  and Reuse): vehicles will be repaired aesthetically and mechanically using new  remanufactured or used parts and then reintroduced through SPOTiCAR  Stellantis’ manufacturer-certified used-vehicle program  and the Stellantis &You  Sales and Services network.Vehicle Dismantling (Recycle  Reman  and Reuse): at the end of their life cycle  vehicles become a precious resource for parts to be remanufactured  reused or as material for recycling. Specifically  the used OEM parts managed by the CE Hub will integrate the stock available from our partner B-Parts to source the SUSTAINera Reuse offer.The high-performance CE Hub will generate efficiencies and synergies among the activities and vertical integration of materials and processes.Stellantis is building its capabilities  teams  and facilities to change its consumption model  creating a smart  integrated ecosystem to reduce the environmental impact and better manage the Company’s aggressive decarbonization target of reaching carbon net zero by 2038.John Elkann  Chairman of Stellantis  and Carlos Tavares  CEO of Stellantis  inaugurated the operations and attended the ribbon cutting. The opening of the Circular Economy Hub in the Mirafiori Complex  in addition to the recently announced Battery Technology Center  reinforces Stellantis’ commitment to Italy and its workforce there.“The Circular Economy Hub brings together a powerhouse of skills and activities aimed at creating a high-performing center of excellence in Europe ” said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares. “We are industrializing the recovery and sustainable reuse of materials  building new technologies and advanced capabilities as we grow in this area. We know that our commitment to remanufacturing  repairing  reusing and recycling will not only take pressure off our planet  but it will also bring financial value to Stellantis  safeguarding our shared future as we quickly transform our production and consumption business model.”“This additional investment of our company here in Turin demonstrates the commitment of Stellantis to Italy in the context of the evolution of our industry  and also the ability of our communities to renew themselves by building their future ” said Stellantis Chairman John Elkann. “When all stakeholders and Stellantis share the same ambition and agree on a common path  ideas become reality  and the Circular Economy Hub we inaugurate today is proof of this. It will be a blueprint plant in the automotive sector that combines environmental respect with economic development.”Stellantis took a circular economy mindset in bringing the site to life enabled by an investment of €40 million. The CE Hub occupies a total area of 73 000 sq. meters  of which 55 000 sq. meters have been recovered from a partially unused facility. Stellantis also recycled more than 5 000 tons of metal of obsolete assets in the process. Equipment and machinery for the facility was repurposed from other locations bringing a 55% saving compared to purchasing new machinery and equipment. The site currently employs 170 upskilled employees. This number is projected to increase to approximately 550 people by 2025.In addition to supporting its primary activities  the Circular Economy Hub also complements Stellantis’ recent actions to strengthen its global electrification ecosystem and support its carbon neutrality ambitions  including:partnering with Orano for the pre-treatment within the EV batteries recycling process to reclaim cobalt  nickel  and lithium from end-of-life vehicles and scrap from gigafactories;for the pre-treatment within the EV batteries recycling process to reclaim cobalt  nickel  and lithium from end-of-life vehicles and scrap from gigafactories; forming the SUSTAINera Valorauto SAS joint venture with Galloo to manage end-of-life vehicles;to manage end-of-life vehicles; teaming up with Qinomic to develop electric retrofitting of light commercial vehicles.

Its 15-month double-blind period ended August 2023[1]. The next step is to lock the database on December 1st. Following this major step  Pharnext expects to receive first study results on December 8th. The Company should then be able to announce topline results of the PREMIER trial on December 11th  after preliminary analysis.Hugo Brugière  Manager of Pharnext  said: “We are delighted to successfully complete this Phase III clinical trial  and look forward to receiving topline results in two weeks' time. Our PXT3003 has already shown early signs of efficacy in previous Phase II and Phase III trials in CMT1A. We hope to be able to bring this innovative therapeutic solution to patients who currently have no alternative to palliative options.”As a reminder; the PREMIER trial  initiated in March 2021  is an international  randomized  double-blind  two-arm placebo-controlled  pivotal Phase III study  where the primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PXT3003 versus placebo in mild-to-moderate CMT1A patients  over a 15-month double-blind period. The dose of PXT3003 tested in the PREMIER trial corresponds to the high dose (HD) tested in the prior Phase III clinical study  the PLEO-CMT trial  and its ongoing open-label extension Phase III study  the PLEOCMT-FU trial. As agreed with regulatory agencies  the primary efficacy endpoint is the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‘ONLS') which measures functional motor disability. A total of 387 patients with mild-to-moderate CMT1A were enrolled in the PREMIER trial.After completion of the double-blind period  CMT1A patients enrolled in the PREMIER trial were all offered continued treatment with PXT3003 by rolling over an open-label extension period named PREMIER-OLE (Open-Label Extension). This extension study was designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of PXT3003 in patients who have completed the PREMIER trial.The first patient entered the PREMIER-OLE period in September 2022[2]. To date  310 patients are receiving high-dose PXT3003  and have the opportunity to continue until the treatment is commercially available  should PXT3003 be approved in the US and Europe  respectively by the FDA and the EMA.About Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A (‘CMT1A')Charcot-Marie-Tooth (‘CMT') disease encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited  severe  debilitating  progressive and chronic peripheral neuropathies. CMT1A  the most common type of CMT  is an orphan disease with a prevalence of 1/5000 people affecting about 150 000 people in Europe and the U.S. and about 1 500 000 people worldwide. The genetic mutation responsible for CMT1A is a duplication of the PMP22 gene coding for a peripheral myelin protein. The duplication of this gene results in overexpression of the PMP22 protein and failure of Schwann cells to produce normal myelin (neuronal sheath). The lack of a normal myelin structure and function leads to abnormal peripheral nerve conduction and axonal loss. As a result of peripheral nerve degradation  patients suffer from progressive muscle atrophy in both the legs and arms causing problems with walking  running and balance as well as abnormal hand functioning. They might also suffer from mild to moderate sensory disorders. First symptoms usually appear during adolescence and will progressively evolve throughout life. Patients with the most severe form of CMT1A end up in wheelchairs  representing at least 5% of cases. To date  no curative or symptomatic medications have been approved and treatment consists of supportive care such as orthotics  leg braces  physical and occupational therapy or surgery.

The Company wishes to point out that this is not the first dilutive financing transaction it has undertaken.Investors are invited to familiarize themselves with the risks associated with these transactions  as mentioned in the press release above.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions. Pharnext has a first-in-class drug candidate  PXT3003  in development for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)  a rare  debilitating  inherited peripheral neuropathy. PXT3003 benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. In 2018  PXT3003 completed a Phase III clinical trial  the PLEO-CMT trial  with encouraging topline results. This trial was followed by an open-label extension study  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial  with 120 patients continuing treatment with PXT3003. Long-term data suggest a sustained benefit  safety  and efficacy  after 6 years of total trial time. An international pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003  the PREMIER trial  enrolling 387 CMT1A patients was completed in August 2023. PREMIER topline results are expected in December 2023.
