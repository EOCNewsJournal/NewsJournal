The items 7 a) – b) are one proposal to be approved together in one resolution at the general meeting. A resolution in accordance with this item 7 is conditional upon that the meeting also resolves in accordance with item 8. A valid resolution requires that the resolution is supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the extraordinary general meeting. Item 7 a) – The board of directors’ proposal to amend § 4 of the articles of association To enable the reduction of the share capital under item 7 b)  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves that the share capital limits in § 4 of the articles of association be amended as follows. § 4 in the articles of association is proposed to have the following wording. Current wording The share capital may not be less than SEK 25 000 000 and no more than SEK 100 000 000. Proposed wording The share capital may not be less than SEK 14 500 000 and no more than SEK 58 000 000. Item 7 b) – The board of directors’ proposal to reduce the share capital The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on a reduction of the company’s share capital by SEK 21 956 434.80. The reduction shall be made without cancellation of shares. The reduction amount shall be allocated as non-restricted equity. The reduction is made in order to reduce the quota value of the shares to enable the issuance proposed under item 8. Following the reduction  the company’s share capital will amount to SEK 14 637 623.20 divided between 36 594 058 shares in total (prior to the issuance of units)  each share having a quota value of SEK 0.40. The board of directors’ statement pursuant to Chapter 20  Section 13  fourth paragraph of the Swedish Companies Act The effect of the board of directors’ proposal is that the company’s share capital is reduced by SEK 21 956 434.80 from SEK 36 594 058 to SEK 14 637 623.20. The new issuance of units  pursuant to item 8  increases the share capital by up to SEK 29 275 246.40. By carrying out new issuance of units at the same time as the share capital reduction  the share capital increases by at least the reduction amount. The company may thus execute the reduction without approval from the Swedish Companies Registration Office or public court  since the measures taken together do not result in a decrease in the company’s restricted equity nor share capital. Item 8 – Resolutions to amend the articles of association and on a issue of units with preferential rights for the company's shareholders General information regarding the board of directors' proposals under item 8 To enable the registration of the resolution on an issuance of units under item 8 b) below  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves that the limits to the share capital in § 4 and the number of shares in § 5 of the articles of association be amended. The board of directors  the CEO  or anyone appointed by the board of directors or the CEO  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments to the above resolution as may be necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or Euroclear Sweden AB or due to other formal requirements. The items 8 a) – b) are one proposal to be approved together in one resolution at the general meeting. A resolution in accordance with this item 8 is conditional upon that the meeting also resolves in accordance with item 7. A valid resolution requires that the resolution is supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the extraordinary general meeting. Item 8 a) – The board of directors' proposal to amend § 4 and § 5 of the articles of association § 4 in the articles of association is proposed to have the following wording. Current wording The share capital may not be less than SEK 14 500 000 and no more than SEK 58 000 000. Proposed wording The share capital may not be less than SEK 33 600 000 and no more than SEK 134 400 000. § 5 in the articles of association is proposed to have the following wording. Current wording The number of shares may not be fewer than 25 000 000 or more than 100 000 000. Proposed wording The number of shares may not be fewer than 84 000 000 or more than 336 000 000.

This landmark approval positions OneWeb India as the first organization to attain such authorization from the Indian space regulator.IN-SPACe  a pivotal entity under the Government of India  is tasked with the regulation of space activities within the country. The authorization from IN-SPACe paves the way for Eutelsat OneWeb to initiate commercial connectivity services following the allocation of the required spectrum by the Government.The Chairman of Bharti Group and Vice-President (Co-Chair) of the Board of Directors of Eutelsat Group  Sunil Bharti Mittal  remarked on this milestone  stating  ""We are pleased to note the Indian space regulator's green light to launch Eutelsat OneWeb's commercial satellite broadband services in India. This will be a critical step forward to meet India's ambition of providing internet connectivity for all and will enable the Hon'ble Prime Minister's vision of Digital India. Eutelsat OneWeb is ready to deploy as soon as it receives the final spectrum authorization to launch commercial services.""Echoing this sentiment  Cyril Dujardin  Co-General Manager of Connectivity at Eutelsat Group  emphasized the collaborative effort needed to bridge the connectivity gap globally. He noted  ""Bridging the connectivity gap around the world requires collaboration across business but also with governments and regulators. We are pleased to have received these approvals from the space regulator that bring the country a significant step closer to providing high-speed connectivity to even the most remote locations. Having completed our LEO constellation last year  we are perfectly placed to deliver this vital connectivity service to businesses across India.""The approval from IN-SPACe strengthens Eutelsat OneWeb's foothold in the Indian market. OneWeb India already possesses the required licenses from the Department of Telecommunications for providing broadband services using satellite connectivity. Moreover  the company has obtained in-principle approval to establish and operate two gateways in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. These gateways are crucial for ensuring the delivery of high-speed  low-latency internet connectivity across India  marking a paradigm shift in the nation's broadband landscape.Eutelsat OneWeb's LEO satellite constellation  completed last year  is set to play a pivotal role in delivering these services.

Thanks to investments in support of our brands and the quality of our Champagnes  we are once again seeing a favourable price/mix effect.The Laurent-Perrier Group is thus maintaining the course of its value strategy by continuing to rely on the quality of its champagnes  the strength of its brands  the commitment of its teams and the control of its distribution. ""Change in turnover :During the period from 1 April 2023 to 30 September 2023  the champagne market recorded a decline in volumes shipped of -11.8% compared with the previous year  although the latter was a high basis for comparison. This decline reflects a return to normal consumption levels after the sharp rise seen in the post-Covid period.Over the same period  the Group's sales volume was down -12.8% on the previous year. As a reminder  the 1st half of the previous year had been exceptional and had required the introduction of volume allocations over the 2nd half. The strength of the Group's brands and the quality of its champagnes have enabled it to pursue its value policy  generating a price-mix effect of +9.6% over the first half  offsetting most of the decline in volumes.First-half consolidated sales (champagne sales) thus stands at €153.4 million at current exchange rates.Change in profit :During the first half of 2023-2024  the Group continued to invest for the long term  particularly in support of its brands and in business development. This investment in sales enhancement contributes to the strength of the brands and the price/mix effect. The Group's operating margin reached 37.4% at current exchange rates. The financial result was negatively impacted by the increase in interest rates because some of our debt is at variable rates. The Group share of net profit reached €38.6 million at current exchange rates  up +4.7%  and thus represents 24.4% of the Group's consolidated turnover.Changes in operating cash flow and financial structure:The increase in working capital required (mainly linked to the necessary replenishment of inventories) weighed on operating cash flow  which came to -€13.1m.The interim consolidated balance sheet at 30 September 2023 reaffirms the strength of the Group's financial structure. Shareholders' equity  Group share  amounted to €574.6 million and net debt (*) stood at €203.8 million including available cash of €61.6 million. Gearing remains at an excellent level  at 0.35 at 30 September 2023  compared with 0.33 at 31 March 2022.(*) Net debt: financial liabilities and other non-current debts + current debts – available cashOutlook :The Laurent-Perrier Group notes that the results published for the first half of the year cannot be extrapolated to its full 2023-2024 financial year. Indeed  the geopolitical context and strong inflationary pressure mean that we need to be very cautious about the outlook for the coming months.The Laurent-Perrier Group is confidently and attentively pursuing its 2021-2025 business plan and maintaining its value strategy based on the following four pillars:Exclusive focus on producing and selling high-end Champagne winesQuality supply based on a partnership policyA portfolio of strong  complimentary brandsWell-controlled worldwide distributionLaurent-Perrier is one of the rare family groups of champagne houses which is listed on the stock market  and which is exclusively dedicated to champagne  and focused on the high-end market.

Thanks to investments in support of our brands and the quality of our Champagnes  we are once again seeing a favourable price/mix effect.The Laurent-Perrier Group is thus maintaining the course of its value strategy by continuing to rely on the quality of its champagnes  the strength of its brands  the commitment of its teams and the control of its distribution. ""Change in turnover :During the period from 1 April 2023 to 30 September 2023  the champagne market recorded a decline in volumes shipped of -11.8% compared with the previous year  although the latter was a high basis for comparison. This decline reflects a return to normal consumption levels after the sharp rise seen in the post-Covid period.Over the same period  the Group's sales volume was down -12.8% on the previous year. As a reminder  the 1st half of the previous year had been exceptional and had required the introduction of volume allocations over the 2nd half. The strength of the Group's brands and the quality of its champagnes have enabled it to pursue its value policy  generating a price-mix effect of +9.6% over the first half  offsetting most of the decline in volumes.First-half consolidated sales (champagne sales) thus stands at €153.4 million at current exchange rates.Change in profit :During the first half of 2023-2024  the Group continued to invest for the long term  particularly in support of its brands and in business development. This investment in sales enhancement contributes to the strength of the brands and the price/mix effect. The Group's operating margin reached 37.4% at current exchange rates. The financial result was negatively impacted by the increase in interest rates because some of our debt is at variable rates. The Group share of net profit reached €38.6 million at current exchange rates  up +4.7%  and thus represents 24.4% of the Group's consolidated turnover.Changes in operating cash flow and financial structure:The increase in working capital required (mainly linked to the necessary replenishment of inventories) weighed on operating cash flow  which came to -€13.1m.The interim consolidated balance sheet at 30 September 2023 reaffirms the strength of the Group's financial structure. Shareholders' equity  Group share  amounted to €574.6 million and net debt (*) stood at €203.8 million including available cash of €61.6 million. Gearing remains at an excellent level  at 0.35 at 30 September 2023  compared with 0.33 at 31 March 2022.(*) Net debt: financial liabilities and other non-current debts + current debts – available cashOutlook :The Laurent-Perrier Group notes that the results published for the first half of the year cannot be extrapolated to its full 2023-2024 financial year. Indeed  the geopolitical context and strong inflationary pressure mean that we need to be very cautious about the outlook for the coming months.The Laurent-Perrier Group is confidently and attentively pursuing its 2021-2025 business plan and maintaining its value strategy based on the following four pillars:Exclusive focus on producing and selling high-end Champagne winesQuality supply based on a partnership policyA portfolio of strong  complimentary brandsWell-controlled worldwide distributionLaurent-Perrier is one of the rare family groups of champagne houses which is listed on the stock market  and which is exclusively dedicated to champagne  and focused on the high-end market.

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALTME)  a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME)  announced today the launch of a 100% guaranteed capital increase through issuance of new shares for €2.7 million gross proceeds with associated warrants potentially raising up to €2.2 million of additional gross proceeds in order to secure financing to reach key regulatory milestones in 2024. The guaranteed amount is secured by a group of Dutch investors. The transaction is expected to extend the company's cash runway into May 2024 with possibility to extend further into July 2024 if the associated warrants expiring in February 2024 are exercised in full  and to September 2024 if both sets of warrants are fully exercised by July 2024. The operation offers current shareholders subscription rights to maintain their holding in the company without being diluted. ""This guaranteed capital injection provides TME Pharma with financing into May 2024  with the possibility of extending our cash runway even further should all the warrants be fully exercised while ensuring minimal dilution to existing shareholders who continue to support our venture "" said Aram Mangasarian  CEO of TME Pharma. ""This will allow us to achieve our next clinical and regulatorymilestones with our lead asset NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients  including further maturing of the survival data  an Investigational New Drug filing  and potential access to expedited regulatory pathways in the US  such as Fast-Track. We are also announcing the repurchase of almost half our existing outstanding convertible debt  with the remainder locked up until April next year. This is the latest step in our commitment to our shareholders to end the use of convertible bond financing so we can remain focused on our goal of developing novel therapies for cancer patients and bringing them to market."" Key Preferential Rights Issue details1: Preferential subscription right: 1 preferential subscription right (PSR) will be awarded for 1 ordinary share held on November 27  2023Subscription rate: Each 3 PSRs give right to subscribe for 5 ABSA Y (5 new shares with 5 Warrants Y attached)Subscription price: €0.25 per ABSA YSubscription period: From November 30 to December 11  2023 (inclusive) ABSA are shares with warrants attached. There are two types of ABSA: ABSA Y  containing one new share and one Warrant Y  and ABSA Z  containing one new share and one Warrant Z. Warrants Y: Each series of 5 Warrants Y entitle a holder to subscribe for 2 ABSA Z (2 new shares with 2 Warrants Z attached) Warrant Y will have an exercise price of €0.25 Warrant Y maturity: February 16  2024  with two periods of exercise. Warrants Y that have not been exercised by the end of the exercise period will become null and void. See Warrants Terms & Conditions for further details. Warrants Z: Each series of 4 Warrants Z entitle a holder to subscribe for 5 new shares o Warrant Z will have an exercise price of €0.20o Warrant Z maturity: June 30  2025  with one period of exercise per quarter. Warrants Y that have not been exercised by the end of the exercise period at the latest will become null and void  without value. See Warrants Terms & Conditions for further details. Illustrative example A shareholder holding 300 shares of TME Pharma as of November 27  2023  would be awarded 300 preferential subscription rights (PSRs). Having 300 PSRs entitles the shareholder to acquire 500 ABSA Y  composed of 500 new shares and 500 Warrant Y  for an amount of €125. The 500 Warrant Y entitle them to subscribe for 200 ABSA Z for €50. These 200 ABSA Z are composed of 200 new shares and 200 Warrant Z. The 200 Warrant Z can be exercised for €50 granting 250 new TME Pharma shares. Thus  if this shareholder participates fully in the transaction  they would hold 1250 shares. 1 Full details of the transaction can be found on TME Pharma's website.Buyback and Lock-up of Convertible Debt key details2: The company plans to reduce the outstanding convertible debt with part of the guaranteed proceeds from this transaction. As announced on April 18  2023  the company terminated the agreement with Atlas Special Opportunities  LLC (ASO) other than with regard to already issued convertible bonds (CBs). One of the conditions of the investor group guaranteeing this financing is that TME Pharma repurchase 898 out of 1 898 outstanding convertible bonds for the total amount of €942 900 including 5% premium3. Furthermore  ASO agrees to a lock-up of the remaining 1 000 convertible bonds until April 1  2024  in exchange for a flat fee of 100 additional CBs. The redemption and lock-up prevent further conversion of CBs to shares and reiterate the company's commitment to methodically end its reliance on convertible bond financing.

The company's oncology-focusedpipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-linedata from the NOX-A12three dose-escalationcohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12 radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-linedata with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in combination with Merck's Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-linetherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved inFrance  Spain and the United States. The company's second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system.

Third quarter 2023 and recent corporate highlights: • On August 24  2023  the Company announced that it has obtained commitments from Fortress  Tolefi and other longstanding existing shareholders to subscribe to a capital increase of up to €9.8 million in 2 tranches: • A first tranche of 2.0 million was disbursed in the context of authorized capital as of September 4  2023; and • A second tranche to be subscribed by Fortress is subject to the approval by the extraordinary shareholders' meeting. Following this private placement  the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient  based on the current scope of activities  to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2025. • Celyad Oncology has relocated from September 25  2023 into a new research facility which fits better its current needs after the strategic shift. The Company remains headquartered at the Axis Parc  Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium but with its new business location at Dumont 9. Operational highlights • shRNA multiplexing platform: • Data validating our microRNA (miRNA)-based multiplex shRNA approach  which allows to down-regulate several genes simultaneously  were presented at the 4th International Conference on Lymphocyte Engineering (ICLE) in Munich (September 12-14) and at the 38th Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) in San Diego (November 1-5) and posters are available on the company's website  at https://celyad.com/our-science-technology/publications/; Page 1 of 4Press Release - Regulated Information • With our approach we proved the feasibility of the simultaneous knock-down of 4 co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1 LAG-3 TIM-3 and CD95) to decrease the expression of exhaustion markers at the surface of CAR T-cells and the feasibility of this approach to improve allogeneic CAR T-cell viability by allowing evasion from graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)  host-versus-graft (HvG) reaction and CD95L-induced autophagy. • The results detailing the technical aspects of the development of this platform and showcasing the easiness  efficiency  and tunability of this technology to knock-down up to four target genes simultaneously have been published in Molecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids as of September 20. • NKG2D-based CAR T-cells: • We have developed different CD19/NKG2DL  BCMA/NKG2DL and PSMA/NKG2DL multi-specific CAR T-cells  utilizing both tandem constructs - that encompass the extracellular domain of the natural NKG2D receptor fused to a scFv targeting CD19  BCMA or PSMA  or dual constructs - that co-express the NKG2D-based CAR with an anti-CD19  anti-BCMA or anti-PSMA CAR  respectively; • Our data provides the proof-of-concept that NKG2DL are valuable targets in a multispecific CAR approach; • Specifically  we showed that CD19/NKG2DL multispecific CAR T-cells  and in particular dual receptors  are highly effective in vitro against CD19+ and CD19- cell lines and against CD19+ primary B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells. In vivo  CD19/NKG2DL tandem CAR T-cells outperforms dual CAR T-cells in controlling tumor growth in an aggressive B-ALL relapse model. • In vitro data generated with BCMA/NKG2DL and PSMA/NKG2DL multispecific CAR T-cells further validate this approach and its application in other hematological and solid indications. • Preliminary data were presented at the 4th ICLE conference in Munich (September 12-14) and at the 38th SITC meeting in San Diego (November 1-5) and posters are available on the company's website  at https://celyad.com/our-science-technology/publications/ . Financial highlights - Third quarter 2023 financial review As of September 30  2023  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €2.3 million. Net cash burn during the third quarter of 2023 amounted to €2.7 million  in line with expectations. The Company projects that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2024. After due consideration of detailed budgets and estimated cash flow forecasts for the years 2023 and 2024  the Company continues to project that its existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund its estimated operating and capital expenditures over at least the next 12 months from the date that this release is issued. On August 24  2023  the Company announced that it has obtained commitments from Fortress  Tolefi and other longstanding existing shareholders to subscribe to a capital increase of up to €9.8 million (whose €2.0 million related to the first tranche has been already proceeded as of September 4  2023). Taking into account the Management's assumptions regarding estimated cash-flows for the years 2023  2024 and 2025  the Company believes that following the close of the second tranche subscribed by Fortress which is subject to approval by the extraordinary shareholders' meeting  its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient  based on the current scope of activities  to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2025. Upcoming Anticipated Milestones • More data and evidence in the context of the multi-specific CAR platform and shRNA multiplexing approach will be shared in the first quarter of 2024  with the aim of a clinical evaluation of assets and initiation of clinical trials either by the Company and/or through strategic partnerships afterwards.

This represented a 40% increase over 2022 and the highest distribution since inception  an excellent result particularly considering the wider market backdrop.During the reporting period  the NAV per share saw an increase from 100.97 to 102.71  a rise of 1.72%. The Company’s net assets increased from £725m to £768m and the NAV per share total return for the reporting period was 8.50%.Market OverviewThe start of the reporting period saw wider financial markets sailing into calmer waters  following the regional US regional banking turmoil  which gave the market the necessary stability and favourable backdrop to support primary issuance in a meaningful way.Fundamentals have played their part in the overall performance of the sector. While traditional fixed income markets have been dominated by discussions around central bank policy and peak rates  with multiple increases in key rates by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank  the floating rate Asset Backed Securities (""ABS"") and Collateralised Loan Obligations (“CLOs"") markets have benefitted from the anticipated higher for longer rate environment.In the UK  headline inflation is moderating – although core inflation remains challenging. House prices have been steadily falling over the reporting period and the Nationwide House Price Index fell 5.3% year on year to September 2023. Housing market activity remains weak with just 45 400 mortgage approvals in August  which is around 30% below the monthly average prevailing in 2019 prior to the pandemic. This subdued picture is not surprising given rising mortgage rates and the challenging picture for housing affordability  however  swap rates stabilised over the reporting period and some lenders started to reduce mortgage lending rates.The unemployment rate over the reporting period continued to be very low. As job losses are generally the biggest driver of mortgage arrears  the actual losses remain minimal. However  the job market is weakening and while wage growth continues to be strong; cracks are starting to appear and mortgage arrears have increased this year. TwentyFour Asset Management LLP (the ""Portfolio Manager"") highlighted this development in previous reports to you  so it isn’t a surprise and they have positioned the portfolio for this. The levels of arrears are low  and the portfolio has seen no defaults. Most of the asset class’s underperformance has been seen in legacy (pre-Global Financial Crisis) non-conforming mortgage portfolios. None of these are held by the Company.The debate around rates has shifted from how high rates might go  to how long rates might remain elevated. Deutsche Bank analysis recently noted that from a UK RMBS perspective one thing is clear: that the vast majority of borrowers who reverted from a fixed rate to a floating mortgage in 2023 (the cohort that in theory  should be most exposed to affordability stress)  have so far  weathered the shock. Actual losses remain almost non-existent within UK and European RMBS and ABS securitisation pools and the 12-month trailing leveraged loan default rate remains low at 1.5%  which is well below the levels that had been forecast. There have been no losses in any tranches of any deals which the Company holds.DividendThe Company aims to distribute all its investment income to ordinary shareholders. The Company is currently targeting quarterly payments equivalent to an annual dividend of at least 8p per year. The fourth interim dividend is used to distribute residual income (if any)  generated in the year. Dividends paid by the Company for the reporting period totalled 6.46p per ordinary share.The increase in dividends for the financial year ending March 2023 was driven by two main factors; the increase in the Bank of England Rate (which rose by 1% from 4.25% to 5.25% in the six-month period to 30 September 2023)  and the deployment of available capital from bond amortisations in the portfolio of the Company  along with share issuance by the Company. This enabled the Portfolio Manager to invest at the then prevailing higher yields; which was accretive to the income of the Company.Premium/Discount and Share Capital ManagementIn contrast to the wider investment company market  which saw trading at large discounts across the board  the Company traded close to NAV for the majority of the reporting period  at an average of only a -0.82% discount.Due to shareholder demand coupled with the ability to purchase accretive assets  the Company was able to issue £29.8m of new shares between April and the end of June 2023.Annual General MeetingThe Company’s 2023 Annual General Meeting was held on 14 September 2023  with all resolutions being passed.Board CompositionRichard Burwood retired as Non-Executive Director of the Company and as the Chair of the Management Engagement Committee  effective from 14 September 2023.I would like to thank Richard for all his hard work and valued contribution to the Board and to the Company during his tenure.With effect from 14 September 2023  Paul Le Page was appointed as Chair of the Management Engagement Committee.OutlookThe market consensus is that we are close to terminal rates in the UK and Europe and the market is pointing towards a soft-landing next year. In this scenario  the economic conditions for European ABS remains favourable as unemployment and corporate defaults are expected to remain low. This in turn could mean that we see central banks keeping interest rates at higher levels for longer  further supporting the return profile of the Company’s asset class.Bronwyn Curtis OBEChair23 November 2023PORTFOLIO MANAGER’S REPORTfor the period from 1 April 2023 to 30 September 2023TwentyFour Asset Management LLPTwentyFour Asset Management LLP  in our capacity as Portfolio Manager to the TwentyFour Income Fund Limited  are pleased to present our report on the Company’s progress for the six-month period ended 30 September 2023 (“the reporting period”).Market EnvironmentThe reporting period has seen around €47bn of gross issuance in ABS markets  including CLOs  which culminated in September being the busiest single month for ABS  since the onset of the Global Financial Crisis (“GFC”). This included €16bn of Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (""RMBS"")  €17bn of auto and consumer ABS and €11.5bn of CLOs. Issuance was from a very geographically diverse sector across the UK and Europe and saw debut deals from new borrowers together with repeat issuers and from platforms that have not been seen in the market for a number of years.One noted feature in the RMBS market was the welcome return of many bank lenders  which was clearly due to the rolling off  of Central Bank funding schemes.It is becoming clear that banks are focussed on not only diversification of funding but also on diversification of capital sources  following the Credit Suisse AT1 write down. The market saw an increasing number of significant risk transfer (“SRT”) transactions (which gives banks a way of deleveraging their balance sheets by transferring the risk of a tranche of a loan portfolio to an investor in such a way that they obtain regulatory capital relief) and full capital structures (which allows banks to sell whole loan portfolios rather than adopt alternative strategies that can obtain capital relief) being issued; mainly by European banks. We welcome this supply  as the collateral generally includes the core business (and best performing collateral) of the issuing bank  which should offer the Company the opportunity to further diversify its portfolio  in the coming months.The European CLO market was active  seeing issuance during the reporting period of €11.5bn  which took the CLO issuance for the full year-to-date to around €18bn by the end of September. This was despite the challenges that the market has endured for most of the year  mainly based on the weighted average cost of capital as AAA spreads have remained stubbornly wide; but also due to a lack of underlying leveraged loan supply.We continue to see value in BB rated securities  which at the end of the reporting period yielded around 13% (in GBP). Commercial Mortgage-Backed Security (""CMBS"") activity remains  understandably  near non-existent over the reporting period  with just one deal (with low levels of leverage) from Last Mile Logistic being pre-placed into the market.However  the over-riding theme for the whole year to date  has really been the very strong supply-demand technical that has been in play  evidenced by the oversubscription levels seen across all deals  in particular mezzanine tranches  which were generally oversubscribed multiple times.PerformanceThe Company returned 8.50% in the reporting period  on a total return basis  a strong performance mainly driven by CLO and RMBS returns.Portfolio EventsThe fundamentals of CLOs and European ABS have been in focus for quite some time as the market has dealt with multiple headwinds. As spreads have gradually tightened during this volatile period we have gradually reduced leverage from 5.4% to just under 1% in the Company as we continue to value liquidity and flexibility in the portfolio.One further aspect to consider is the rating performance of the ABS transactions themselves. Since the GFC  securitisation structures have been robust and rating performance has reflected this with upgrades being significantly higher than downgrades. There have been no defaults or underlying issues with the assets in the portfolio of the Company and the core focus has remained on western European  secured assets (mortgages and leveraged loans). Wider market volatility is likely to remain elevated and a deterioration of fundamental performance is expected  and we have taken the opportunity in certain instances to improve the credit profile in certain sectors. This has been achieved through selling lower rated bonds and in their stead purchasing other bonds with a higher rating or by reducing exposure to assets where our deal monitoring has shown that the performance of those assets is has reduced. We have also pared back the portfolio’s exposure to UK RMBS equity through refinancing in the region of £32m during the reporting period.Portfolio StrategyOur focus during the reporting period  has been and will continue to be on investing in higher-yielding floating-rate ABS  which  in an environment of higher-for-longer rates  should continue to deliver ongoing  attractive levels of income; this should enable the Company to deliver on its annual target dividend. At the end of the reporting period  the Company had a very healthy gross purchase yield of 11.3% and a mark-to-market yield of 13.8%. While the overall performance of UK and European mortgage market is understandably deteriorating  the levels of losses observed within RMBS and ABS transactions currently do not give us any cause for concern. The robust nature of the ABS structures and our internal stress tests indicate that the performance of the underlying assets would need to deteriorate by many multiples of the levels that were seen in the GFC before significant losses would be seen on the transactions.The issues in the commercial real estate sector are well documented and will take a long time to be resolved  this suggests that refinancing in the sector will become more challenging and most CMBS deals are likely to extend in the near term. As a result  we have re-underwritten all the CMBS holdings and reduced the CMBS allocation  in the portfolio  to just 3.8%.Spreads have generally tightened during the reporting period  whilst senior issuance spreads have been mostly range-bound  without strong moves in either direction  as the market expects further issuance in the last quarter. Most of the spread performance has been in mezzanine and sub-investment grade bonds. Given the elevated volumes of primary and secondary trading were well absorbed  the market is well positioned in a good technical situation. The liquidity which the Company has available could be deployed in the event of elevated market stress to take advantage of any investment opportunities. We currently expect to increase the allocation to SRT investments instead of future RMBS equity and junior non-prime transactions.Key Risks:We believe the key risks currently perceived by the market are:The risk of the central bank rate increases having a lagged impact on economic fundamentals.The risk that central banks overly extend monetary tightening in their fight against high inflation  resulting in a greater economic slowdown than intended.The escalation of geopolitical risk due to the ongoing Ukraine - Russia conflict and Middle East conflict.Market Outlook:A soft economic landing remains our base case expectation  but a recession in the EU  UK and/or US cannot be ruled out. We have therefore focussed on keeping the credit spread duration and leverage of the portfolio relatively low.While corporate and consumer fundamentals are likely to deteriorate  we do not expect this to be problematic for bond holders.We expect short term rates to remain elevated for longer. Market sentiment has already priced in rate cuts in the fixed rate market and floating rate bonds should benefit in the medium term from higher income due to elevated base rates.Protection from broader market volatility is very strong  supported by relatively short maturities and high income.Given the current uncertainty in the global economy  we believe that flexibility and liquidity remain important and remain of the view that raising the credit quality of the portfolio seems prudent at this time.TwentyFour Asset Management LLP23 November 2023TOP TWENTY HOLDINGSas at 30 September 2023Nominal/ Asset Backed Security Fair Value Percentage of Net Asset Value Security Shares Sector* £ UK MORTGAGES CORP?FDG DAC KPF1 A 0.0% 31/07/2070 20 056 444 RMBS 21 621 569 2.81 UK MORTGAGES CORPORATE F 'KPF4 A' 0.00% 30/11/2070 24 273 696 RMBS 20 627 326 2.69 SYON SECURITIES 19-1 B CLO FLT 19/07/2026 17 508 622 RMBS 16 912 787 2.20 TULPENHUIS 0.0% 18/04/2051 19 538 092 RMBS 16 674 636 2.17 UKDAC MTGE 'KPF3 A' 0.0% 31/7/2070 18 386 135 RMBS 14 647 940 1.91 EQTY.

The Company’s principal risks are therefore market or economic in nature.The principal risks disclosed can be divided into the various areas as follows:Market Risk and Investment ValuationsMarket risk is the risk associated with changes in market factors including spreads  interest rates  economic uncertainty  changes in laws and political circumstances.Due to inflation concerns and existing geo-political tensions  both the UK and Europe could go into a prolonged recessionary period  therefore  risk premiums demanded by the market could continue to rise as risk sentiment deteriorates and wider spreads could result in lower cash prices.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the risk that the portfolios may not be able to sell securities at a given price and/or over the desired timeframe. Investments made by the Company may be relatively illiquid. Some investments held by the Company may take longer to realise than others and this may limit the ability of the Company to realise its investments and meet its target dividend payments in the scenario where the Company has insufficient income arising from its underlying investments.Credit Risk and Investment PerformanceCredit risk arises when the issuer of a settled security held by the Company experiences financing difficulties or defaults on its payment obligations resulting in an impact to the security market price.The Company holds Asset Backed Securities which comprises debt securities issued by companies  trusts or other investment vehicles which  compared to bonds issued or guaranteed by governments  are generally exposed to greater risk of default in the repayment of the capital provided to the issuer or interest payments due to the Company. The amount of credit risk is indicated by the issuer’s credit rating which is assigned by one or more internationally recognised rating agencies. This does not amount to a guarantee of the issuer’s creditworthiness but generally provides a strong indicator of the likelihood of default. Securities which have a lower credit rating are generally considered to have a higher credit risk and a greater possibility of default than more highly rated securities. There is a risk that an internationally recognised rating agency may assign incorrect or inappropriate credit ratings to issuers. Issuers often issue securities which are ranked in order of seniority which  in the event of default  would be reflected in the priority in which investors might be paid back. Whilst they have been historically low since the inception of the Company  the level of defaults in the portfolio and the losses suffered on such defaults may increase in the event of adverse financial or credit market conditions.In the event of a default under an Asset Backed Security  the Company’s right to financial recovery will depend on its ability to exercise any rights that it has against the borrower under the insolvency legislation of the jurisdiction in which the borrower is incorporated. As a creditor  the Company’s level of protection and rights of enforcement may therefore vary significantly from one country to another  may change over time and may be subject to rights and protections which the relevant borrower or its other creditors might be entitled to exercise. Information regarding investment restrictions that are currently in place in order to manage credit risk can be found in the note 16.Foreign Currency RiskThe Company is exposed to foreign currency risk through its investments in predominantly Euro-denominated assets. The Company’s share capital is denominated in Sterling and its expenses are incurred in Sterling. The Company’s financial statements are presented in Sterling. Amongst other factors affecting the foreign exchange markets  events in the Eurozone may impact upon the value of the Euro which in turn will impact the value of the Company’s Euro-denominated investments. The Company manages its exposure to currency movements by using spot and forward foreign exchange contracts  which are rolled forward periodically.Counterparty Credit RiskWhere a market counterparty to an Over the Counter (OTC) derivative transaction fails  any unrealised positive mark to market profit may be lost. The Company mitigates this risk by only trading derivatives against approved counterparties which meet minimum creditworthiness criteria and by employing central clearing and margining where applicable.Settlement RiskSettlement risk is the risk of loss associated with any security price movements between trade date and eventual settlement date should a trade fail to settle on time (or at all). The Company mitigates the risk of total loss by trading on a delivery versus payment (DVP) basis for all non-derivative transactions and central clearing helps to ensure that trades settle on a timely basis.Reinvestment RiskThe Portfolio Manager is conscious of the challenge to reinvest any monies that result from principal and income payments and to minimise reinvestment risk. Cash flow analysis is conducted on an ongoing basis and is an important part of the Portfolio Management process  ensuring such proceeds can be invested efficiently and in the best interests of the Company.The Portfolio Manager expects £61.7m of assets to have a Weighted Average Life of under 1 year. While market conditions are always subject to change  the Portfolio Manager does not currently foresee reinvestment risk significantly impacting the yield nor affecting each quarter’s minimum dividend and recognises the need to be opportunistic as and when market conditions are particularly favourable in order to reinvest any proceeds or in order to take advantage of rapidly evolving pricing during periods of market volatility.Operational RisksThe Company is exposed to the risk arising from any failures of systems and controls in the operations of the Portfolio Manager  Administrator  AIFM  Independent Valuer  Custodian and the Depositary amongst others. The Board and its Audit Committee regularly review reports from key service providers on their internal controls  in particular  focussing on changes in working practices. The Administrator  Custodian and Depositary report to the Portfolio Manager any operational issues for final approval of the Board as required.Accounting  Legal and Regulatory RisksThe Company is exposed to the risk that it may fail to maintain accurate accounting records or fail to comply with requirements of its Admission document and fail to meet listing obligations. The accounting records prepared by the Administrator are reviewed by the Portfolio Manager. The Portfolio Manager  Administrator  AIFM  Custodian  Depositary and Corporate Broker provide regular updates to the Board on compliance with the Admission document and changes in regulation. Changes in the legal or the regulatory environment can have a major impact on some classes of debt. The Portfolio Manager monitors this and takes appropriate action.Income Recognition RiskThe Board considers income recognition to be a principal risk and uncertainty. The Portfolio Manager estimates the remaining expected life of the security and its likely terminal value  which has an impact on the effective interest rate of the Asset Backed Securities which in turn impacts the calculation of interest income. This risk is considered on behalf of the Board by the Audit Committee as discussed in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2023 and is therefore satisfied that income is appropriately stated in all material aspects in the Financial Statements.Cyber Security RisksThe Company is exposed to risk arising from a successful cyber-attack through its service providers. The Company requests of its service providers that they have appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate the risk of cyber-attacks (including minimising the adverse consequences arising from any such attack)  that they provide regular updates to the Board on cyber security  and conduct ongoing monitoring of industry developments in this area. The Board is satisfied that the Company’s service providers have the relevant controls in place to mitigate this risk.Geopolitical Risk and Economic DisruptionThe Company is exposed to the risk of geopolitical and economic events impacting on the Company  Portfolio Manager and Shareholders  including elevated levels of global inflation  recessionary risks and the current conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The Company does not hold any assets in Ukraine  Belarus  Russia  or the Middle East  however  the situation in the impacted regions and wider geopolitical consequences remain volatile and the Board and Portfolio Manager continue to monitor the situation carefully and will take whatever steps are necessary and in the best interests of the Company’s Shareholders. The Company’s key suppliers do not have operations in Ukraine  Russia  Belarus  or the Middle East and there is not expected to be any adverse impact from military operations on the activity (including processes and procedures) of the Company.Climate Change RiskClimate change risk is the risk of the Company not responding sufficiently to pressure from stakeholders to assess and disclose the impact of climate change on investment portfolios and address concerns on what impact the Company and its portfolio has on the environment.Regular contact is maintained by the Portfolio Manager and Broker with major stakeholders and the Board receives regular updates from the Portfolio Manager on emerging policy and best practice within this area and can take action accordingly.Environmental  Social  and Governance (“ESG”) factors are assessed by the Portfolio Manager for every transaction as part of the investment process. Specifically for ABS  for every transaction an ESG assessment is produced by the Portfolio Manager and an ESG score is assigned. External ESG factors are factors related to the debt issuers of ABS transactions and they are assessed through a combination of internal and third-party data. Climate risks are incorporated in the ESG analysis under environmental factors and taken into consideration in the final investment decision. CO2 emissions are tracked at issuer and deal level where information is available. Given the bankruptcy-remoteness feature of securitisation transactions the climate risks which the manager considers more relevant and that are able to potentially impact the value of the investment are the ones related to the underlying collateral which include physical and transitional risks. Those risks are also assessed and considered as environmental factors in the ESG analysis.The Board and Portfolio Manager do not consider these risks to have changed materially and these risks are considered to remain relevant for the remaining six months of the financial year.The Board’s process of identifying and responding to emerging risks is disclosed under the Statement of Principal Risks and Uncertainties in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2023.Going ConcernThe Directors believe that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements in view of the Company’s holdings in cash and cash equivalents and the liquidity of investments and the income deriving from those investments  meaning the Company has adequate financial resources and suitable management arrangements in place to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements.The Company’s articles provide for a realisation opportunity (“Realisation Opportunity”) under which Shareholders may elect to realise some or all of their holdings of Ordinary Shares at each third Annual General Meeting  with the next Realisation Opportunity being in September 2025.The Company’s continuing ability to continue as a going concern  in light of the external geo-political and macro factors  the increased risk of default due to rising inflation  increasing global interest rates and the next Realisation Opportunity has been considered by the Directors and no material doubts to going concern have been identified.STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIESWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:these Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34  ""Interim Financial Reporting"" and give a true and fair view of the assets  liabilities  equity and profit or loss of the Company as required by DTR 4.2.4R.the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by:(a) DTR 4.2.7R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules  being an indication of important events that have occurred during the period from 1 April 2023 to 30 September 2023 and their impact on the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements; and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year; and(b) DTR 4.2.8R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules  being related party transactions that have taken place during the period from 1 April 2023 to 30 September 2023 and that have materially affected the financial position or performance of the Company during that period as included in note 14.By order of the BoardBronwyn Curtis John Le PoidevinChair Director23 November 2023The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website  and for the preparation and dissemination of financial statements.

A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries  primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters  and applying analytical and other review procedures. We read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and consider whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of financial statements.A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly  we do not express an audit opinion.Conclusions relating to going concernBased on our review procedures  which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Scope of review section of this report  nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that are not appropriately disclosed.This conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410. However future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern  and the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Company will continue in operation.Directors’ responsibilitiesThe half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of  and has been approved by  the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the interim financial report in accordance with the DTR of the UK FCA.As disclosed in note 2  the annual financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. The directors are responsible for preparing the condensed set of financial statements included in the half-yearly financial report in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.In preparing the half-yearly financial report  the directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern  disclosing  as applicable  matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations  or have no realistic alternative but to do so.Our responsibilityOur responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review. Our conclusion  including our conclusions relating to going concern  are based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures  as described in the scope of review paragraph of this report.The purpose of our review work and to whom we owe our responsibilitiesThis report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our engagement letter to assist the Company in meeting the requirements of the DTR of the UK FCA. Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law  we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company for our review work  for this report  or for the conclusions we have reached.Rachid FrihmatFor and on behalf of KPMG Channel Islands LimitedChartered AccountantsGuernsey23 November 2023CONDENSED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEfor the period from 1 April 2023 to 30 September 2023For the period For the period from 01.04.23 to 30.09.23 from 01.04.22 to 30.09.22 Notes £ £ (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Income Interest income on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 39 617 803 27 159 169 Net foreign currency gains/(losses) 7 6 714 557 (11 081 941) Net gains/(losses) on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 8 18 179 471 (95 521 570) Total income/(loss) 64 511 831 (79 444 342) Operating expenses Portfolio management fees 14 (2 785 136) (2 516 061) Directors' fees 14 (136 245) (149 846) Administration and secretarial fees 15 (175 947) (161 765) Audit fees (78 000) (65 000) Custody fees 15 (37 139) (33 548) Broker fees (24 939) (25 057) AIFM management fees 15 (126 343) (115 684) Depositary fees 15 (50 155) (45 695) Legal and professional fees (28 635) (31 216) Listing fees (12 500) (14 105) Registration fees (44 030) (19 783) Other expenses 56 041 (152 697) Total operating expenses (3 443 028) (3 330 457) Total operating profit/(loss) 61 068 803 (82 774 799) Finance costs on repurchase agreements 11 (383 505) (255 413) Total comprehensive income/(loss) for the period* 60 685 298 (83 030 212) Earning/(loss) per Ordinary Share 3 0.0817 (0.1299)All items in the above statement derive from continuing operations.The Company’s income and expenses are not affected by seasonality or cyclicity.The notes below form an integral part of these Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements.*There was no other comprehensive income during the current and prior periods.CONDENSED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITIONas at 30 September 202330.09.23 31.03.23 Notes £ £ Assets (Unaudited) (Audited) Non-current assets Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss - Investments1 8 757 872 773 739 385 970 Current assets Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss - Derivative assets: Forward currency contracts 17 28 274 2 281 253 Other receivables 9 8 319 864 6 976 028 Cash and cash equivalents 15 024 303 27 235 318 Total assets 781 245 214 775 878 569 Liabilities Current liabilities Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss - Derivative liabilities: Forward currency contracts 17 3 763 080 1 509 Amounts payable under repurchase agreements 11 5 921 313 49 827 700 Amounts due to broker 2 342 079 - Share issue costs payable - 5 219 Other payables 10 1 094 157 1 061 379 Total liabilities 13 120 629 50 895 807 Net assets 768 124 585 724 982 762 Equity Share capital account 12 780 213 410 750 558 986 (Accumulated losses) (12 088 825) (25 576 224) Total equity 768 124 585 724 982 762 Ordinary Shares in issue 12 747 836 661 718 036 661 Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share (pence) 5 102.71 100.971 The entire balance of investments in Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss was reclassified from current assets to non-current assets.

Earnings/(Loss) per Ordinary Share – Basic & DilutedThe earnings per Ordinary Share – Basic is calculated by dividing a company's income or profit by the number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per Ordinary Share takes into account all potential dilution that would occur if convertible securities were exercised or options were converted to stocks.As the Company has not issued options  only the Basic Earnings per Share has been calculated.Basic earnings per Ordinary Share has been calculated based on the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares of 742 733 383 (30 September 2022: 638 959 048) and a net gain of £60 685 298 (30 September 2022: net loss of £83 030 212).4. Income Equalisation on New IssuesIn order to ensure there are no dilutive effects on earnings per share for current holders of shares (“Ordinary Shares”) issued by the Company (“Shareholders”) when issuing new Ordinary Shares earnings are calculated in respect of accrued income at the time of purchase and a transfer is made from share capital to income to reflect this. The transfer for the period is £242 649 (30 September 2022: £16 079).5. Net Asset Value per Ordinary ShareThe net asset value (“NAV”) of each Ordinary Share of £1.03 (31 March 2023: £1.01) is determined by dividing the value of the net assets of the Company attributed to the Ordinary Shares of £768 124 585 (31 March 2023: £724 982 762) by the number of Ordinary Shares in issue at 30 September 2023 of 747 836 661 (31 March 2023: 718 036 661).6.

Amounts payable under repurchase agreementsThe Company  as part of its investment strategy  may enter into repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement is a short-term loan where both parties agree to the sale and future repurchase of assets within a specified contract period. Repurchase agreements may be entered into in respect of securities owned by the Company which are sold to and repurchased from counterparties on contractually agreed dates and the cash generated from this arrangement can be used to purchase new securities  effectively creating leverage. The Company still benefits from any income received  attributable to the security. Under the Company’s Global Master Repurchase Agreement it may from time to time enter into transactions with a buyer or seller under the terms and conditions as governed by the agreement.Finance costs on repurchase agreements have been presented separately from interest income for the period end 30 September 2023.Finance costs on repurchase agreements amounted to £383 505 (30 September 2022: £255 413).

Financial Risk ManagementThe Company’s objective in managing risk is the creation and protection of Shareholder value. Risk is inherent in the Company’s activities  but it is managed through an ongoing process of identification  measurement and monitoring.The Company’s financial instruments include investments classified at fair value through profit or loss  cash and cash equivalents  derivative liabilities and amounts payable under repurchase agreements. The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are market risk  credit risk and liquidity risk. The techniques and instruments utilised for the purposes of efficient portfolio management are those which are reasonably believed by the Board to be economically appropriate to the efficient management of the Company.Market RiskMarket risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes currency risk  interest rate risk  reinvestment risk and price risk. The Company’s strategy on the management of market risk is driven by the Company’s investment objective of generating attractive risk adjusted returns principally through investment in ABS.The underlying investments comprised in the Portfolio are subject to market risk. The Company is therefore at risk that market events may affect performance and in particular may affect the value of the Company’s investments. Market risk involves changes in market prices or rates  including interest rates  availability of credit  inflation rates  economic uncertainty  changes in law  national and international political circumstances.(i) Price RiskThe price of an Asset Backed Security can be affected by a number of factors  including: (i) changes in the market’s perception of the underlying assets backing the security; (ii) economic and political factors such as interest rates  levels of unemployment and taxation which can have an impact on arrears  foreclosures and losses incurred with respect to the pool of assets backing the security; (iii) changes in the market’s perception of the adequacy of credit support built into the security’s structure to protect against losses caused by arrears and foreclosures; (iv) changes in the perceived creditworthiness of the originator of the security or any other third parties to the transaction; (v) the speed at which mortgages or loans within the pool are repaid by the underlying borrowers (whether voluntary or due to arrears or foreclosures).The Company’s policy also stipulates that no more than 10% of the Portfolio value can be exposed to any single Asset Backed Security or issuer of ABS.(ii) Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the fair value of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.The tables below summarise the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk:Floating rate Fixed rate Non-interest bearing Total £ £ £ £ (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) As at 30 September 2023 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 757 872 773 - - 757 872 773 Derivative assets - - 28 274 28 274 Other receivables (excluding prepayments) - - 8 271 345 8 271 345 Cash and cash equivalents 15 024 303 - - 15 024 303 Repurchase agreements - (5 921 313) - (5 921 313) Amounts due to brokers - - (2 342 079) (2 342 079) Other payables - - (1 094 157) (1 094 157) Derivative liabilities - - (3 763 080) (3 763 080) Net current assets 772 897 076 (5 921 313) 1 100 303 768 076 066 Floating rate Fixed rate Non-interest bearing Total £ £ £ £ As at 31 March 2023 (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 739 385 970 - - 739 385 970 Derivative assets - - 2 281 253 2 281 253 Other receivables (excluding prepayments) - - 6 870 412 6 870 412 Cash and cash equivalents 27 235 318 - - 27 235 318 Repurchase agreements - (49 827 700) - (49 827 700) Share issue costs payable - - (5 219) (5 219) Other payables - - (1 061 379) (1 061 379) Derivative liabilities - - (1 509) (1 509) Net current assets 766 621 288 (49 827 700) 8 083 558 724 877 146The Company only holds floating rate financial assets and when short-term interest rates increase  the interest rate on a floating rate will increase. The time to re-fix interest rates range from daily to a maximum of 6 months. As at period end  the Company had 0.69% exposure to fixed-rate Asset Backed Securities and therefore the Company has minimal interest rate risk. However  the Company may choose to utilise appropriate strategies to achieve the desired level of interest rate exposure (the Company is permitted to use  for example  interest rate swaps and repurchase agreements to accomplish this). The value of asset backed securities may be affected by interest rate movements. Interest receivable on bank deposits or payable on bank overdraft positions will be affected by fluctuations in interest rates  however the underlying cash positions will not be affected. Please see note 11 for details of the amounts payable under repurchase agreements.The Company’s continuing position in relation to interest rate risk is monitored on a weekly basis by the Portfolio Manager as part of its review of the weekly NAV calculations prepared by the Company’s Administrator.(iii) Foreign Currency RiskForeign currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company invests in some Euro assets while its Shares are denominated in Sterling and its expenses are incurred in Sterling. Therefore the Statement of Financial Position may be affected by movements in the exchange rate between Euro and Sterling. The Company manages the exposure to currency movements by using spot and forward foreign exchange contracts  rolling forward on a periodic basis.Foreign currency risk Open forward currency contracts Contractvalues Outstanding contracts Mark to market equivalent Unrealised gains/(losses) 30.9.2023 30.9.2023 30.9.2023 30.9.2023 Two Euro forward foreign currency (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) contracts totalling: Settlement date 18 October 2023 €15 700 000 £13 652 270 £13 623 996 £28 274 Three Euro forward foreign currency contracts totalling: Settlement date 18 October 2023 €453 283 432 £389 582 904 £393 345 984 (£3 763 080) (£3 734 806) Unrealised gains/(losses) Contract values Outstanding contracts Mark to market equivalent 31.03.2023 31.03.2023 31.03.2023 31.03.2023 (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) Three Sterling forward foreign currency contracts totalling: Settlement date 12 April 2023 €416 268 352 £368 081 043 £365 820 527 £2 260 516 One Euro forward foreign currency Settlement date 12 April 2023 (€7 463 014) (£6 539 339) (£6 558 567) £19 228 £2 279 744Contract values represent the contract’s notional value. Outstanding contracts are the contract’s notional values  translated at the contracted FX rate from Euro to Sterling  or from Sterling to Euro.As at 30 September 2023 and as at 31 March 2023  the Company held the following assets and liabilities denominated in Euro  with the effective net exposure of open Euro forward currency contracts:As at As at 30.9.2023 31.03.2023 £ £ Assets/(Liabilities): (Unaudited) (Audited) Investments 402 715 424 361 420 402 Cash and cash equivalents 1 351 492 970 272 Other receivables 6 259 074 5 083 861 Amounts due to broker (2 342 079) - Open forward currency contracts (406 969 980) (359 261 960) 1 013 931 8 212 575The tables below summarise the sensitivity of the Company’s assets and liabilities to changes in foreign exchange movements between Euro and Sterling at 30 September 2023 and 31 March 2023. The analysis is based on the assumption that the relevant foreign exchange rate increased/decreased by the percentage disclosed in the table  with all other variables held constant. This represents management’s best estimate of a reasonable possible shift in the foreign exchange rates  having regard to historical volatility of those rates.As at As at 30.9.2023 31.03.2023 £ £ Impact on Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income in response to a: (Unaudited) (Audited) - 20% increase (36 990) (1 321 137) - 20% decrease 448 754 2 123 313 Impact on Statement of Changes in Equity in response to a: - 20% increase (36 990) (1 321 137) - 20% decrease 448 754 2 123 313(iv) Reinvestment RiskReinvestment risk is the risk that future coupons from a bond will not be reinvested at the prevailing interest rate when the bond was initially purchased.A key determinant of a bond’s yield is the price at which it is purchased and  therefore  when the market price of bonds generally increases  the yield of bonds purchased generally decreases. As such  the overall yield of the Portfolio  and therefore the level of dividends payable to Shareholders  would fall to the extent that the market prices of ABS generally rise and the proceeds of ABS held by the Company that mature or are sold are not able to be reinvested in ABS with a yield comparable to that of the Portfolio as a whole.The Company assesses reinvestment risk on at least a monthly basis by calculating the projected amortisation profile of the Company across the next three years. In addition  changes in the Company’s yield and income are assessed over the same timeframe as securities redeem or mature to identify any periods where reinvestment risk may be more significant.(v) Price Sensitivity AnalysisThe analysis below shows the Company’s sensitivity to movement in market prices based on a 10% increase or decrease  representing management’s best estimate of a reasonable possible shift in market prices  having regard to historical volatility.At 30 September 2023  if market prices had been 10% higher with all other variables held constant  the increase in net assets attributable to Shareholders would have been £75 787 277 (31 March 2023: £73 938 597). An equal change in the opposite direction would have decreased the net assets attributable to Shareholders by the same amount. This price sensitivity analysis covers the market prices received from price vendors  brokers and those determined using models (such as discounted cash flow models) on the assumption that the prices determined from these sources had moved by the indicated percentage.As noted in Note 17  the valuation models used (typically discounted cash flow models) include unobservable inputs that may rely on assumptions that are subject to judgement. The sensitivity analysis of such inputs was available for the period ended 30 September 2023 and year ended 31 March 2023.Actual trading results may differ from the above sensitivity analysis and those differences may be material.Credit RiskCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company. The Portfolio Manager monitors exposure to credit risk on an on-going basis.The main concentration of credit risk to which the Company is exposed arises from the Company’s investments in ABS. The Company is also exposed to counterparty credit risk on forwards  cash and cash equivalents  amounts due from brokers and other receivable balances. During the period  none of the Company’s investments in ABS defaulted (31 March 2023: none).The Company’s policy to manage this risk is by no more than 20% of the value of the Portfolio being backed by collateral in any single country (save that this restriction will not apply to Northern European countries). The Company also manages this credit risk by no more than 10% of the Portfolio being exposed to any single Asset Backed Security or issuer of ABS  no more than 40% of the Portfolio being exposed to issues with a value greater than 5%  and no more than 10% of the Portfolio value being exposed to instruments not deemed securities for the purposes of the Financial Services and Market Act  2000.The Portfolio of ABS by ratings category using the highest rating assigned by Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”)  Moody’s Analytics (Moody’s”) or Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”):30.09.23 31.03.23 (Unaudited) (Audited) AAA 1.72% 0.23% AA - 0.68% AA- 2.14% 1.92% A+ 4.47% 3.82% A 3.14% 2.93% A- 4.11% 2.95% BBB+ 6.36% 8.47% BBB 1.34% 1.73% BBB- 4.94% 4.90% BB+ 6.92% 5.37% BB 4.52% 3.71% BB- 12.06% 10.58% B+ 6.33% 5.94% B 5.54% 5.04% B- 11.15% 10.81% CCC - 0.17% NR* 25.26% 30.75% 100.00% 100.00%*The non-rated exposure within the Company is managed in exactly the same way as the exposure to any other rated bond in the Portfolio. A bond not rated by any of Moody’s  S&P or Fitch does not necessarily translate as poor credit quality. Often smaller issues/tranches  or private deals which the Company holds  will not apply for a rating due to the cost of doing so from the relevant credit agencies. The Portfolio Manager has no credit concerns with the unrated  or rated  bonds currently held  as there have been no defaults in the period.To further minimise credit risk  the Portfolio Manager undertakes extensive due diligence procedures on investments in ABS and monitors the on-going investment in these securities. The Company may also use credit default swaps to mitigate the effects of market volatility on credit risk.The Company manages its counterparty exposure in respect of cash and cash equivalents and forwards by investing with counterparties with a “single A” or higher credit rating. All cash is currently placed with The Northern Trust Company. The Company is subject to credit risk to the extent that this institution may be unable to return this cash. The Northern Trust Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Northern Trust Corporation  a publicly traded constituent of the S&P 500 with a credit rating of A+ from Standard & Poor's and A2 from Moody's.The Company’s maximum credit exposure is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised as at the Condensed Statement of Financial Position date  as summarised below:Maximum credit exposure As at As at 30.09.23 31.03.23 £ £ (Unaudited) (Audited) Investments 757 872 773 739 385 970 Cash and cash equivalents 15 024 303 27 235 318 Unrealised gains on derivative assets 28 274 2 281 253 Other receivables 8 271 345 6 870 412 781 196 695 775 772 953Investments in ABS that are not backed by mortgages present certain risks that are not presented by Mortgage-Backed Securities (“MBS”). Primarily  these securities may not have the benefit of the same security interest in the related collateral. Therefore  there is a possibility that recoveries on defaulted collateral may not  in some cases  be available to support payments on these securities. The risk of investing in these types of Asset Backed Securities is ultimately dependent upon payment of the underlying debt by the debtor.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash resources to settle its obligations as they fall due or can only do so on terms that are materially disadvantageous.Investments made by the Company in ABS may be relatively illiquid and this may limit the ability of the Company to realise its investments.

The capital structure of the Company consists of Shareholders’ equity  which comprises Share Capital and other reserves. To maintain or adjust the capital structure  the Company may return capital to Shareholders or issue new Shares. There are no regulatory requirements to return capital to Shareholders.(i) Share BuybacksThe Company has been granted the authority to make market purchases of up to a maximum of 14.99% of the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue at a price not exceeding the higher of (i) 5% above the average of the mid-market values of the Ordinary Shares for the 5 business days before the purchase is made or  (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current investment bid for the Ordinary Shares.In deciding whether to make any such purchases  the Directors will have regard to what they believe to be in the best interests of the Company as a whole  to the applicable legal requirements and any other requirements in its Articles. The making and timing of any buybacks will be at the absolute discretion of the Board and not at the option of the Shareholders  and is expressly subject to the Company having sufficient surplus cash resources available (excluding borrowings). The Listing Rules prohibit the Company from conducting any share buybacks during close periods.(ii) Realisation OpportunityA Realisation Opportunity takes place at the annual general meeting of the Company every three years  the most recent of which was on 21 October 2022. The next Realisation Opportunity is expected to take place in Autumn 2025  subject to the aggregate NAV of the continuing Ordinary Shares on the last Business Day before Reorganisation being not less than £100 million.The Company will attempt  where possible to offset realisation requests with a simultaneous placing programme. If this is not possible it has the ability to designate realisation assets as a realisation pool and to convert ordinary shares to realisation shares to prevent any adverse impact on the liquidity of its investment portfolio. In the event that Realisation shares are issued  it is anticipated that the ability of the Company to make returns of cash to the holders of these Shares will depend in part on the ability of the Portfolio Manager to realise the portfolio.It is anticipated that realisations will be satisfied by the assets underlying the relevant shares being managed on a realisation basis  which is intended to generate cash for distribution as soon as practicable and may ultimately generate cash which is less than the published NAV per Realisation Share.In the event that the Realisation takes place  it is anticipated that the ability of the Company to make returns of cash to the holders of Realisation Shares will depend in part on the ability of the Portfolio Manager to realise the Portfolio.(iii) Continuation VotesIn the event that the Company does not meet the dividend target in any financial reporting period as disclosed in note 19  the Directors may convene a general meeting of the Company where the Directors will propose a resolution that the Company should continue as an Investment Company.17. Fair Value MeasurementAll assets and liabilities are carried at fair value or at amortised cost  which equates to fair value.IFRS 13 requires the Company to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:(i) Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).(ii) Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly (that is  as prices) or indirectly (that is  derived from prices including interest rates  yield curves  volatilities  prepayment speeds  credit risks and default rates) or other market corroborated inputs (Level 2).(iii) Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is  unobservable inputs) (Level 3).The following tables analyse within the fair value hierarchy the Company’s financial assets and liabilities (by class) measured at fair value for the period ended 30 September 2023 and year ended 31 March 2023.Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total £ £ £ £ (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Assets Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Asset Backed Securities: Auto Loans - 24 747 741 - 24 747 741 CLO - 268 922 889 - 268 922 889 CMBS - 29 034 217 - 29 034 217 Consumer ABS - 16 537 013 - 16 537 013 RMBS - 243 074 974 161 754 064 404 829 038 SME 8 674 368 - 8 674 368 Student Loans - 5 127 507 - 5 127 507 Forward currency contracts - 28 274 - 28 274 Total assets as at 30 September 2023 - 596 146 983 161 754 064 757 901 047 Liabilities Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Forward currency contracts - 3 763 080 - 3 763 080 Total liabilities as at 30 September 2023 - 3 763 080 - 3 763 080 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total £ £ £ £ (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) Assets Financial assets at fair",neutral,0.01,0.87,0.12,mixed,0.3,0.23,0.46,True,English,"['Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements', 'Interim Management Report', 'TwentyFour Income Fund', 'NAV Northern Trust International Fund Administration Services', 'European Asset Backed Securities', 'attractive risk adjusted returns', 'target annual net total return', 'TWENTYFOUR INCOME FUND LIMITED', 'Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements', 'TwentyFour Asset Management', 'Net Asset Value', 'Total Net Assets', 'excellent income story', 'active primary market', 'Bronwyn Curtis OBE', 'London Stock Exchange', 'global interest base-rates', 'Regulatory News Service', 'INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS', 'INTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT', 'Classified Regulated Information', 'rising rate environment', 'base rate hikes', 'target return shoul', 'last business day', 'annual target dividend', 'portfolio coupon rates', 'stand-out share activity', 'sole share class', 'UK Listing Authority', 'strong NAV performance', 'mid-market share price', 'The Issue Price', 'investment company market', 'closed-ended investment company', 'Target Returns', 'income levels', 'income distributions', 'Guernsey) Limited', 'strong supply', 'SUMMARY INFORMATION', 'Premium Listing', 'unaudited NAV', 'The Report', 'Investment Objective', 'Investment Policy', 'Investment Companies', 'OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS', 'credit concerns', 'Aza Teeuwen', 'accretive additions', 'credit profile', 'significant discounts', 'Official List', 'FTSE 250 Index', 'Ongoing Charges', 'profit forecast', 'financial year', 'Portfolio Manager', 'diversified portfolio', 'Ordinary Share', 'DTR 6 Annex', 'NSM website', '6-month period', '3-month period', 'The Company', 'quarterly dividends', 'shares', '1 April', '30 September', 'LEI', '549300CCEV00IH2SU369', 'section', 'accordance', 'twentyfouram', 'inspection', 'morningstar', '102.71 pence', 'FYE', '100.97 pence', '4 pence', '9.46 pence', 'track', '6.46 pence', '7.27 pence', 'defaults', 'Partner', 'rise', 'Chair', 'bulk', 'TFIF', '11 January', '16 September', 'ABS', 'issuer', 'times', 'annum', '24 February', 'equivalent', '8 pence', 'respect', '21 September', '23 February', 'increase', 'decrease', 'start', 'period/year', 'investors', 'Association', 'AIC', 'methodology', '23 November', 'Administrator', 'week', 'basis', 'Note', 'assurance', '99']",2023-11-24,2023-11-25,marketscreener.com
