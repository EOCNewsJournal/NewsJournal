A former US official explains the mystery,A large swath of China's US-bond holdings is not accounted for in official Treasury data  Brad Setser wrote for the Council on Foreign Relations.,"ReutersChina is not dumping its stockpile of US bonds  Brad Setser  a former Treasury official  wrote.A large part of China's holdings is not accounted for in official US data  he said.While it has sold some Treasurys  Beijing has bought up US debt in the form of agency bonds.China isn't fueling the bond-market rout with a large sale of its Treasury holdings but is instead reshuffling its US debt assets  Brad Setser  a former Treasury official  wrote for the Council on Foreign Relations.After US Treasury yields surged to highs not seen in 16 years  economists have looked for explanations for what is now one of the worst market crashes in history.Apollo Global Management's Torsten Sløk also pointed to China recently  citing official US data that showed the country had sold $300 billion worth of Treasurys since 2021. And in August  a $21.2 billion dump of US assets by China was largely made up of Treasurys.But Setser said such data presented an incomplete picture. Drawing on other sources  he estimated that China's overall US-bond holdings had been relatively stable since 2015.Though China's holdings appear to be slipping in official US Treasury International Capital data  the metric reflects only foreign holdings in US custodians  or the financial institutions that safeguard the assets  Setser said.""If a simple adjustment is made for Treasuries held by offshore custodians like Belgium's Euroclear  China's reported holdings of US assets look to be basically stable at between $1.8 and $1.9 trillion "" he wrote.Brad Setser/Council on Foreign RelationsAdded to that  the US data fails to capture US asset holdings that were handed over to third-party management. China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange is known to hold accounts at global bond and hedge funds  as well as private-equity firms  Setser said.He added that even where China had reduced its Treasury holdings  the sales were much smaller than other data suggested and purchases of US debt in other forms  such agency bonds  had increased.Story continuesAgency bonds are issued by government-sponsored enterprises  and some of the top issuers are US-backed firms such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.In fact  Beijing's agency bonds once outpaced its Treasury assets  Setser said. Though it moved away from that market during the Federal Reserve's quantitative-easing era  soaring yields on agency debt have brought back China's buying habit.In 2022 and the first six months of 2023  China purchased over $100 billion in agency debt and sold just $40 billion in Treasurys  he estimated.""Bottom line: the only interesting evolution in China's reserves in the past six years has been the shift into Agencies "" he wrote. ""That has resulted in a small reduction in China's Treasury holdings — but it also shows that it is a mistake to equate a reduction in China's Treasury holdings with a reduction in the share of China's reserves held in US bonds or the US dollar.""Read the original article on Business Insider",neutral,0.04,0.8,0.16,negative,0.01,0.16,0.83,True,English,"['former US official', 'Treasury bonds', 'China', 'yields', 'mystery', 'official US Treasury International Capital data', 'Torsten Sløk', 'first six months', 'former Treasury official', 'official US data', 'worst market crashes', 'Apollo Global Management', 'past six years', 'overall US-bond holdings', 'US Treasury yields', 'US asset holdings', 'US debt assets', 'Treasury assets', 'Treasury holdings', 'other data', 'US bonds', 'US assets', 'US custodians', 'US dollar', 'third-party management', 'global bond', 'soaring yields', 'agency debt', 'large part', 'agency bonds', 'bond-market rout', 'large sale', 'Foreign Relations', '$300 billion worth', '$21.2 billion dump', 'incomplete picture', 'other sources', 'financial institutions', 'simple adjustment', 'offshore custodians', 'State Administration', 'Foreign Exchange', 'hedge funds', 'private-equity firms', 'other forms', 'government-sponsored enterprises', 'top issuers', 'US-backed firms', 'Fannie Mae', 'Freddie Mac', 'Federal Reserve', 'quantitative-easing era', 'buying habit', 'Bottom line', 'interesting evolution', 'original article', 'Business Insider', 'foreign holdings', 'Brad Setser', 'small reduction', '16 years', 'Reuters', 'China', 'stockpile', 'Treasurys', 'Beijing', 'Council', 'highs', 'economists', 'explanations', 'history', 'country', 'August', 'metric', 'Treasuries', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'accounts', 'sales', 'purchases', 'fact', 'reserves', 'shift', 'Agencies', 'mistake', 'share']",2023-11-25,2023-11-26,finance.yahoo.com
