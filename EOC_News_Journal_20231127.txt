Photograph: Nick BradshawAirport operator DAA should ignore the 32 million passenger limit at Dublin Airport  according to Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary  reports the Business Post.“It’s entirely arbitrary  it is to do with surface access at Dublin Airport and what are Fingal going to do? Stop the planes flying? It is nonsense and rubbish ” he said.“But it is another example of just arrant mismanagement of transport by a Green minister.”In response to the comments  a spokesman for Fingal County Council told the Business Post that the limit on numbers was imposed by An Bord Pleanála in 2007 and if the local authority received any complaints about it  it would “act accordingly”.READ MOREMr O’Leary also criticised the DAA for not moving earlier to seek to have the cap increased. Planning permission to raise it to 40 million is expected to take two years to be processed.RTÉ contractorsRTÉ has started the process of contacting some employees to tell them their contracts will not be renewed as part of its recently announced cost-cutting plans  reports the Sunday Independent.Staff on short-term and non-permanent contracts have been told their contracts will expire in the coming weeks. Some employees on “acting up” contracts have also been affected  with their time substituting for other staff on a higher grade set to come to an end.An RTÉ source told the Sunday Independent’s Niamh Horan that the mood within Montrose was one of “paranoia and insecurity” as staff wait to hear further details of director Kevin Bakhurst’s cutbacks plan  which will be implemented to close a gap between the broadcaster’s total funding and its annual costs.It is targeting €10 million in cuts next year  while 400 employees are set to leave the organisation between now and 2028.Stock exchange requestGovernment officials said it was a “notion” to say the State could create rules to stimulate the struggling Irish equity market and declined a request from Euronext Dublin to be included in a key strategy on financial services  reports the Business Post.The operator of the Irish stock exchange wrote to the Government last year seeking inclusion in an update to the Ireland for Finance strategy – a document that sets out the State’s priorities for financial services in the coming years.However  officials expressed scepticism about the idea that Government intervention could improve the situation. The refreshed strategy makes no mention of public markets or stimulating initial public offer (IPO) activity in Ireland  despite concerns expressed about the future of the stock exchange amid an exodus of big companies.Eir dividendsEir  the former State-owned telecoms company  paid out dividends of €119 million to its shareholders in the three months to the end of September  bringing total distributions since the start of last year to more than €1 billion.In total Eir has this year paid out €237 million in regular dividends to shareholders  led by the French billionaire Xavier Niel.Last year the company made a distribution of €800 million following the sale of a minority stake in its fibre network to InfraVia Capital Partners  a French investment fund.Eir last week reported a 4 per cent fall in earnings for the quarter  despite higher revenues.Kildare Village boostRevenue at Value Retail Dublin  the company behind the Kildare Village shopping outlet  jumped 54 per cent last year as the luxury retail destination bounced back from Covid restrictions  reports the Sunday Independent.Value Retail Dublin delivered an operating profit of €2.5 million in 2022  compared with €368 000 in the previous year and also received a €10.4 million boost from a change in the fair value of Euribor interest rate swaps. After finance costs  the pretax profit was €6.2 million  compared with a loss of €5.5 million in 2021.Revenue for 2022 was €18.5 million  up from just under €12 million in 2021  when Kildare Village was closed for 136 days.Occupancy was just over 90 per cent at the end of last year.

After 13 years of relentless exploration and dedication  and 12 months since breaking ground  the company has successfully reached the Segele gold ore body underground  marking a significant milestone in the company's history.This achievement also highlights Akobo Minerals as one of few mining companies that have successfully navigated the path from exploration to mining. With an average grade of 22.7 grams of gold per ton of ore  Segele is one of the world's highest concentration gold resources. This high grade translates to remarkably low operating costs  especially noteworthy given the current gold price close to $2 000/oz.Jørgen Evjen  CEO of Akobo Minerals  expressed  ""After first encountering the mineralization in the early part of 2020 and now finally hitting this unique discovery underground  it is a significant moment for our organisation and all our supporters out there. ""He continued  ""Only a handful of exploration companies successfully transition into mining operations. Witnessing the ore body and knowing that our processing plant is nearing completion fills me with great hope for the future. It has been a journey marked by hard work and countless challenges  and I am deeply grateful to the entire team for their unwavering dedication.""However  hitting the ore body has been delayed by several months due to rectifying major mistakes by the former contract miner. The knowledge acquired by the Akobo Minerals team during this period will enable more accurate extraction estimates from the underground mine and refined production schedules for the plant.Evjen added  ""With the lessons learned from overcoming challenges  we are better positioned to make precise production estimates and schedules. The commissioning of the main plant will kick off as soon as we extract meaningful material with gold from the mine. Further details will be provided in the Q3 presentation.""The next step for Akobo Minerals is to commence production from the pilot plant  which is already operational. In that regard the company together with the Ministry of Mines plan an official opening of the Segele mine with top federal officials  pending their availability.Akobo Minerals is poised for the next phase of its journey  with the successful identification of the ore body marking a crucial step toward becoming a key player in the Ethiopian mining industry.- Ends -For more information  contact:Jørgen Evjen  CEO  Akobo MineralsMob: (+47) 92 80 40 14Mail: jorgen@akobominerals.comLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/akobomineralsWeb: www.akobominerals.comAbout Akobo MineralsAkobo Minerals is a reputable Scandinavian-based gold exploration and boutique mining company.
