After a fierce battle in the North Sea  you have destroyed but not sunk a German vessel. Before returning to port  you will do something that many other captains have done before you: seize the defeated enemy ship on behalf of your government. Such a step is a perfectly legal practice enshrined in the Prize Law  which dates back to the 18th century. The rule may sound obscure  but it remains in effect: In 2016  Israel invoked the Prize Law to seize the Zaytouna-Olivia  a Dutch-flagged ship that had attempted to break Israel’s maritime blockade of Gaza. The reasoning was that modern-day Israel is a successor to British Palestine  so that the British Naval Prize Act of 1864 applied. The Prize Law shows that the confiscation of enemy assets in wartime has a long tradition. Britain even gave a share of the seized ships’ value to victorious captains  a practice it only stopped in 1948.Imagine you are the captain of a British Royal Navy battleship in World War I.

The Prize Law shows that the confiscation of enemy assets in wartime has a long tradition. Britain even gave a share of the seized ships’ value to victorious captains  a practice it only stopped in 1948.Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  experts have been pondering whether Western governments should seize the portion of Russian central bank reserves deposited in the West. These assets  worth around $300 billion  are already frozen (or “immobilized” in legalese). The debate is about actually seizing these holdings—like those foreign ships—and transferring them to Ukraine to finance Kyiv’s war effort or reconstruction. Like many debates on Russia  the discussion is polarized  with two camps presenting seemingly irreconcilable views. On one side  those arguing in favor of seizing Russia’s state assets explain that the moral case for doing so is strong. On the other side  many legal experts have serious reservations about the legality of such a course of action. But focusing on these moral and legal arguments eclipses the broader picture: Seizing Russian central bank reserves comes with economic  financial  and geopolitical implications that need to be taken into account to reach a balanced decision on this tricky debate.1. Definitions matter: Seizing Russia’s central bank reserves would not be a sanction. Sanctions are temporary policies that inflict economic pain in order to provoke a change in the behavior of their target. Sanctions are both sticks and carrots  and they are meant to be lifted if they are successful. In particular  sanctions on Moscow seek to degrade Russia’s ability to wage war  for example by curbing the country’s revenues from hydrocarbon exports. As such  seizing Russia’s assets does not meet the definition of a sanction. It would be a permanent  punitive step that would not affect Moscow’s budget directly. Central bank reserves serve to prop up currencies  not plug fiscal deficits.2. Confiscating Moscow’s assets would not make a big financial difference for the Kremlin. Russia’s central bank holdings are already frozen  and there is virtually no chance that the Kremlin could regain access to them as long as the war is raging. If Russian reserves are not transferred to Ukraine during the course of the war  there is a high likelihood that these assets will be part of the reparations that Moscow will eventually have to pay as part of a peace agreement with Kyiv. This explains why some policymakers—most notably former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and former World Trade Organization chief Robert Zoellick—argue that transferring the assets now  as a deposit against future reparations  makes sense.3. Seizing Russia’s assets is unlikely to fuel global de-dollarization efforts. A key argument for those who oppose seizing Russia’s reserves is that such a move will accelerate attempts by emerging economies to shift away from Western currencies (a move also known as de-dollarization). This is only partly convincing: De-dollarization is a long-term  structural trend that predates sanctions on Russia. Data from both the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve show that global de-dollarization efforts have not accelerated meaningfully since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  both when it comes to currencies used for trade (the dollar and euro dominate) and foreign purchases of U.S. securities (they are broadly stable).4. Transferring Russia’s reserves would require cooperation from Euroclear. Russia’s immobilized reserves are mostly made up of European government bonds held in electronic form. Three-quarters of these assets are held by Euroclear  a Belgian company that acts as a trusted depository for global securities. Euroclear and three other Western firms—Clearstream in Luxembourg  DTCC in the United States  and Jasdec in Japan—dominate the global market for such services  which are at the core of global financial market infrastructure. In practice  transferring Russia’s reserves to Ukraine would require collaboration from Euroclear.5. Weaponizing Western financial channels like Euroclear fuels financial fragmentation. In 2012  the United States and European Union cut Iran off from Swift  the Belgium-based cooperative connecting banks across the world. This was a turning point for many rogue states  which started to design alternative financial mechanisms that would be sanctions-proof. If Euroclear were to facilitate the seizure of Russian reserves  emerging economies could take note that  like Swift  Western securities depositories have become untrustworthy. Non-Western alternatives to Euroclear  such as China’s Securities Depository and Clearing  could become more appealing for non-G7 economies  fueling financial fragmentation.6. Financial fragmentation undermines the long-term effectiveness of sanctions. The risk of further eroding trust in Western financial channels explains why the United States does not want to act alone when it comes to seizing Russia’s reserves: Washington would very much prefer to spread the potential blowback that such a step would entail across like-minded allies. The bigger picture is that financial fragmentation comes with massive consequences. Over time  the rise in alternative financial mechanisms risks making Western sanctions ineffective. It would also make it harder for Western security services to track the financial transactions of groups involved in  say  terrorism or nuclear proliferation.7. Getting Russia’s reserves could be a double-edged sword for Kyiv. Receiving $300 billion—an amount roughly twice Ukraine’s current GDP—would obviously help Kyiv to finance its war effort. However  there are two other  longer-term factors to consider. First  those American politicians who advocate ending financial support to Ukraine would probably find it easier to advance their views if they can explain that Kyiv has just received a massive pot of money. Second  receiving and possibly spending the reserves now would deprive Kyiv from the option of using these assets as a bargaining chip in peace negotiations.8. Seizing Russia’s reserves risks fueling resentment against Western states. Outside Western countries  the dominant view is that the war in Ukraine should stop as soon as possible  even if it means that Kyiv cedes part of its territory  a view that partly stems from Russia’s successful disinformation efforts in non-Western states  notably in Africa. Yet this view also reflects rising resentment against Western countries. The debate on Russia’s reserves is closely followed around the world and could fuel this trend  with policymakers in many emerging economies voicing serious reservations about seizing these assets.9. Seizing Russia’s assets could fuel the perception of double standards. The intense controversies that have emerged around the legality of seizing Russia’s reserves show that such a move is far from straightforward under international law. Whatever their outcomes  these fights fuel the growing perception that Western states are happy to tweak the rules-based order if it suits their priorities  for instance by creating new legislation that is tailor-made to seize Russia’s reserves  as Canada has already done. To these critics  this reinforces the sentiment that the West is applying a double standard in Ukraine  reacting far more strongly to war on its doorstep than to wars elsewhere.10. Confiscating Moscow’s reserves could set a precedent that Beijing or others could use. Western countries are on the right side of the moral argument to support Kyiv  not to mention that a Russian victory would be a catastrophe for those who support Western liberal values. However  there is no reason to believe that in the future  China  India or other emerging economies will not assume that they are also on the right side of whatever conflict that could arise between them and Western states (for instance  around Taiwan). If Western democracies have previously set a precedent by seizing Russia’s assets  how will these states manage to convince anyone that China or India have no right to confiscate Western holdings if they so wish?Would the debate around Russia’s reserves be as intense if the amount at stake were smaller? It is probably the massive number that makes a seizure so tempting. However  confiscating the Russian central bank’s foreign-exchange reserves would come with huge economic  financial  and geopolitical unintended consequences. Perhaps the moral arguments in favor of seizing these assets outweigh the consequences. Acknowledging these impacts  however  is the first step towards reaching a balanced conclusion in this thorny debate.,neutral,0.03,0.59,0.38,mixed,0.09,0.3,0.62,True,English,"['Unintended Consequences', 'Russian Assets', 'The', 'former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers', 'former World Trade Organization chief Robert Zoellick', 'U.S. Federal Reserve', 'British Royal Navy battleship', 'British Naval Prize Act', 'Russian central bank reserves', 'U.S. secur', 'European Central Bank', 'World War I', 'big financial difference', 'long-term, structural trend', 'central bank holdings', 'global de-dollarization efforts', 'The Prize Law', 'many other captains', 'permanent, punitive step', 'many legal experts', 'Russian reserves', 'British Palestine', 'many debates', 'other side', 'victorious captains', 'legal arguments', 'fierce battle', 'North Sea', 'German vessel', 'enemy ship', '18th century', 'Dutch-flagged ship', 'maritime blockade', 'long tradition', 'ships’ value', 'Western governments', 'foreign ships', 'two camps', 'irreconcilable views', 'one side', 'serious reservations', 'broader picture', 'geopolitical implications', 'balanced decision', 'temporary policies', 'economic pain', 'hydrocarbon exports', 'fiscal deficits', 'high likelihood', 'peace agreement', 'key argument', 'emerging economies', 'foreign purchases', 'war effort', 'legal practice', 'moral case', 'tricky debate', 'future reparations', 'modern-day Israel', 'enemy assets', 'state assets', 'Western currencies', 'something', 'behalf', 'rule', 'effect', 'Zaytouna-Olivia', 'Gaza', 'reasoning', 'successor', 'confiscation', 'wartime', 'Britain', 'share', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'portion', 'legalese', 'Kyiv', 'reconstruction', 'discussion', 'favor', 'legality', 'course', 'action', 'account', 'Definitions', 'sanction', 'order', 'change', 'behavior', 'target', 'sticks', 'carrots', 'Moscow', 'ability', 'example', 'country', 'revenues', 'budget', 'Kremlin', 'chance', 'access', 'part', 'policymakers', 'deposit', 'sense', 'move', 'attempts', 'Data']",2023-11-27,2023-11-28,foreignpolicy.com

These also replace the previous mid-term planning up to 2025.As part of the growth plan up to 2028  an increase in Group sales to EUR 400 to 500 million is planned. Furthermore  the Management Board reaffirms its goal of achieving a sustainable adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 15% prior to 2028.The near quadrupling of sales by the year 2028 compared to the forecast for the current financial year is based on SFC's three-pillar growth strategy: (1) further market penetration and regional expansion  (2) technological expansion & IP development  and (3) inorganic/acquisitive growth.Over the past three years  SFC has grown organically at a CAGR of around 30% while simultaneously expanding its margins faster than originally expected. In contrast  the inorganic expansion strategy of 2021  which was intended to deliver an additional sales contribution of up to EUR 250 million by 2025  was deliberately adjusted to the changing market conditions. On the one hand  a globally adapted acceptance of hydrogen technologies aligned with the entire energy transition is emerging  and this process is taking longer than previously assumed. On the other hand  the planned expansion of business activities in Southeast Asia  as part of the ongoing cooperation with Toyota Tsusho  has been temporarily delayed due to the COVID pandemic.In contrast  regional expansion in India and the USA is progressing significantly faster than expected and is proving successful. Non-European growth  in particular  is currently developing very dynamically and is set to accelerate further. In addition to the planned establishment of a dedicated presence to further develop the rapidly growing US market  India serves as a prime example of expansion in Asia. The expansion of capacity in India aligns with the ""Make in India"" initiative and will make an important contribution to the environmentally friendly orientation of the Indian economy.Another focus of strategic mid-term planning is the continued expansion of technological leadership. This includes further penetrating existing market segments and exploration of new ones with more powerful fuel cells. The market launch of a modular hydrogen fuel cell solution with an output of up to 200 kW is planned for the end of 2024.Central to this is also the integration and further development of proprietary membrane technology. In addition to securing a stable supply chain and increasing the proportion of value-added  SFC aims for long-term advantages in improved longevity and cost savings as a competitive edge.Dr. Peter Podesser  CEO of SFC Energy AG: ""Four key features define our fuel cells: self-sufficient  reliable  quiet  and without environmentally harmful emissions. They are therefore ideally suited to support the global shift away from fossil fuels. This megatrend will continue to gain momentum in the coming years  driven by the ambitious climate targets set by many countries. We  as SFC Energy AG  will also strongly benefit from this trend. Targeted acquisitions are also intended to contribute to the acceleration of our growth. The focus here is on complementary technologies to deepen the value chain  as seen in the acquisition of the proprietary membrane technology for our fuel cells. Acquiring system integrators in growth markets  particularly in the USA and Asia  is also a priority to expedite market access. We operate without time pressure and carefully assess potential acquisition targets. The increasing consolidation of the industry  in which SFC clearly stands out from its peer group with profitable growth  also presents numerous opportunities.""About SFC Energy AGSFC Energy AG (www.sfc.com) is a leading provider of hydrogen and direct methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions.

33163,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/eurex-focused-on-harmonising-onto-one-risk-management-framework/,Eurex focused on harmonising onto one risk management framework,Risk management top of the agenda across Eurex’ business offerings on both the trading and clearing side  senior executives have affirmed.,At a recent roundtable  Deutsche Börse Group derivatives exchange  Eurex  shared its plan to harmonise onto one risk management infrastructure over the next two years.Speaking to the priorities for the business generally  Michael Peters  chief executive of Eurex Frankfurt AG  asserted that “risk management is top of the agenda for both the trading side and the clearing side.”Almost a decade ago  back in 2014  Eurex clearing was a leading innovator when it came to real-time risk management. Today  the attention for the next two years is on harmonising onto one risk management infrastructure. Peters specifically highlighted putting Eurex’s MTF and trading pools onto one joint offering which would also likely include European Energy Exchange (EEX) and European Commodity Clearing (ECC) on the commodity side  as well as the repo business.Matthias Graulich  chief strategy officer at Eurex and global head of fixed income  funding and financing strategy and development at Deutsche Börse Group  expanded on this  explaining: “The intention is to offer all financial products denominated in euro within the same legal  operational and risk management framework.“In terms of what belongs in this ecosystem are long-term European government bond futures and options (Eurex is in the advanced stages of launching an EU bond future potentially in 2024)  euro denominated interest rate swaps  futures and options on short-term Euro interest rates Euribor and €STR  as well as the repo business.”Currently  Eurex’s offering allows clients to trade repos with more than 160 registered participants and allows participants to raise or place cash against over 13 000 securities  both domestic and international.Earlier this year  Eurex confirmed that it had seen a significant increase in trading activities and reached record volumes in its cleared repo markets – doubling across all markets year on year as of August 2023.Speaking at this most recent roundtable  Graulich expanded on the growth of the repo business: “What we have seen is that this business has gotten more and more attractive again because excess liquidity in the market is shrinking as central banks take a step back out of this market.”The execs also discussed the growth of their pension fund client base amid the changes being seen  emphasising that pension funds are moving into the repo market as they bank on more reliable liquidity in times of market stress.“We see that pension funds are very interested in cleared repo because they get better rates  it’s operationally quicker  and they have a much broader choice of execution counterparties and ultimately face the CCP  which is also from a credit perspective preferable  said Graulich.Speaking to this shift in more detail  he added: “The main reason why pension funds were for so long exempted from swaps clearing was the risk that if there was a large interest rate move that they wouldn’t have access to sufficient liquid resources to fund variation margin on the swap side.“Now one driver for these pension funds to go into the cleared repo market is that this liquidity pool is much more reliable in market stress situations relative to the bilateral repo market. In particular when it comes to market stress liquidity in the cleared market increased whereas it dried up usually in the bilateral market.”Read more: Eurex lures euro clearing volumes to Europe post-Brexit with new buy-side incentive schemeElsewhere  Graulich highlighted that credit index futures are also seeing more appetite from the market and are continuing to progress.“While these volumes and activities are still small  we see a lot of interest.

Additionally  end clients in particular are showing interest also in the credit future side because it’s such an efficient tool to manage risks and take a perspective on credit.”,neutral,0.01,0.93,0.06,mixed,0.32,0.33,0.35,True,English,"['one risk management framework', 'Eurex', 'Deutsche Börse Group derivatives exchange', 'long-term European government bond futures', 'new buy-side incentive scheme', 'pension fund client base', 'large interest rate move', 'one risk management infrastructure', 'European Energy Exchange', 'short-term Euro interest rates', 'EU bond future', 'real-time risk management', 'risk management framework', 'next two years', 'sufficient liquid resources', 'interest rate swaps', 'European Commodity Clearing', 'one joint offering', 'credit index futures', 'chief strategy officer', 'credit future side', 'Eurex Frankfurt AG', 'market stress liquidity', 'bilateral repo market', 'one driver', 'commodity side', 'swaps clearing', 'chief executive', 'financing strategy', 'clearing side', 'pension funds', 'stress situations', 'bilateral market', 'trading side', 'excess liquidity', 'reliable liquidity', 'swap side', 'liquidity pool', 'Clearing brokers', 'liquidity providers', 'recent roundtable', 'leading innovator', 'trading pools', 'global head', 'fixed income', 'financial products', 'advanced stages', 'euro denominated', 'significant increase', 'central banks', 'broader choice', 'execution counterparties', 'main reason', 'efficient tool', 'credit perspective', 'repo business', 'Eurex clearing', 'Michael Peters', '160 registered participants', 'trading activities', 'repo markets', 'end clients', 'record volumes', 'Matthias Graulich', 'plan', 'priorities', 'agenda', 'attention', 'MTF', 'EEX', 'ECC', 'funding', 'development', 'intention', 'operational', 'terms', 'ecosystem', 'options', 'Euribor', '€STR', 'repos', 'cash', '13,000 securities', 'August', 'growth', 'step', 'execs', 'changes', 'times', 'CCP', 'shift', 'detail', 'access', 'variation', 'margin', 'Brexit', 'appetite', 'lot', 'topic', 'risks']",2023-11-28,2023-11-28,thetradenews.com

""If we were to mobilise part of the capital available in Europe  then we would have a similar depth of market to the U.S.""His comments come amid a dearth of IPOs across the Western world due to economic uncertainty and higher borrowing costs.So far  Germany has only seen three major listings this year - IONOS  ThyssenKrupp Nucera and Schott Pharma - with other local candidates such as lender OLB Bank  tank gearbox maker Renk and on-road payments group DKV Mobility being forced to defer their listing ambitions.While making predictions is ""super difficult""  Maassen said he hoped to see around 10 to 15 IPOs in Frankfurt next year  as markets get better visibility over interest rates and confidence rises.Story continuesBesides market turbulence  European exchanges also face the risk of local champions listing on a U.S. exchange in search of better liquidity and higher valuations.Earlier this year  Germany's Birkenstock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in a much-anticipated IPO  but the iconic sandal maker has since traded below its issue price.""If you look at European companies that have listed in the U.S.  few have been successful. And there's not a single U.S. institutional investor that can't invest here "" he said.Maassen praised initiatives like Germany's Financing for the Future Act  recently approved by the country's lower house of parliament  which lowers the requirements for start-ups to pursue an initial public offering and increases tax breaks for employee share schemes.The EU is debating new legislation meant to simplify IPOs across the 27-member bloc known as the Listing Act.Maassen urged policymakers to speed up the implementation of the Capital Markets Union  a longstanding project to create a single market for capital beyond national borders.""We need to build an EU framework that's implemented at country level "" he said.Since Brexit  the European Union has had greater opportunity to deepen capital markets  as financial firms can no longer passport services from the UK and instead need to create hubs on the continent.Earlier this month  European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde called for a capital markets union  with a single supervisor and trading infrastructure  to finance its digitalisation and green transition.European startups attract less than half the funding of U.S. counterparts  Lagarde noted.($1 = 0.8025 pounds)(Reporting by Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro; Editing by Anousha Sakoui and Christina Fincher)",neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,mixed,0.12,0.32,0.56,True,English,"['UK capital market reforms', 'Frankfurt bourse official', 'EU', 'German share price index DAX graph', 'European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde', 'single U.S. institutional investor', 'up to 75 billion pounds', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt', 'German household assets', 'lender OLB Bank', 'employee share schemes', 'institutional asset managers', 'Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro', 'three major listings', 'tank gearbox maker', 'road payments group', 'U.S. exchange', 'iconic sandal maker', 'initial public offering', 'U.S. counterparts', 'other local candidates', 'individual savings accounts', 'higher borrowing costs', 'local stock listings', 'former investment banker', 'big pension funds', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'US capital markets', 'Capital Markets Union', 'issue price', 'European Union', 'new legislation', 'single supervisor', 'European exchanges', 'European companies', 'European startups', 'single market', 'local champions', 'stock market', 'cash accounts', 'higher valuations', '10 to 15 IPOs', ""savers' money"", 'right direction', 'policy change', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'UK government', 'extra capital', 'growth companies', 'autumn budget', 'unlisted equities', 'tax-free allowance', 'British companies', 'Forty percent', 'similar depth', 'Western world', 'economic uncertainty', 'ThyssenKrupp Nucera', 'Schott Pharma', 'DKV Mobility', 'listing ambitions', 'interest rates', 'confidence rises', 'Future Act', 'lower house', 'tax breaks', '27-member bloc', 'Listing Act', 'longstanding project', 'national borders', 'financial firms', 'passport services', 'trading infrastructure', 'green transition', 'Anousha Sakoui', 'Christina Fincher', 'market turbulence', 'country level', 'greater opportunity', 'continental Europe', 'EU framework', 'Stefan Maassen', '0.8025 pounds', 'LONDON', 'Reuters', 'Britain', 'reforms', 'step', 'official', 'Germany', 'bourse', 'terms', 'realisation', 'head', 'Corporates', 'initiatives', 'efforts', 'measures', 'allocation', 'ISAs', 'idea', 'consideration', 'comments', 'dearth', 'IONOS', 'Renk', 'predictions', 'visibility', 'Story', 'risk', 'search', 'better', 'liquidity', 'Birkenstock', 'Financing', 'parliament', 'requirements', 'start-ups', 'policymakers', 'implementation', 'Brexit', 'hubs', 'digitalisation', 'less', 'half', 'funding', 'Editing']",2023-11-28,2023-11-28,finance.yahoo.com

This transaction involves (1) a share consolidation with respect to all outstanding Company shares by means of a 1-for-10 reverse stock split  which was completed on November 13  2023 (the ""Share Consolidation"")  after which ten former Company shares are represented by one new Company share (each new Company share  a ""Share"")  and each ADS represents one new Share  (2) listing the Shares on Nasdaq  (3) the Mandatory ADS Exchange  (4) a repositioning of the Shares from the Euronext Brussels trading system to the Nasdaq trading system  and (5) following a transition period of at least three weeks after the Mandatory ADS Exchange  the de-listing of the Shares from listing and trading on Euronext Brussels.Folllowing the completion of the Share Consolidation on November 13  2023  the Company completed the Mandatory ADS Exchange  effective today.

The MAA was granted accelerated assessment1 last month by EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) based on the vaccine candidate’s “major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation”2.Accelerated assessment reduces the timeframe for EMA’s CHMP to review a MAA once it is accepted for review from 210 days under the standard review procedure to 150 days. This does not  however  include clock stops when applicants must provide additional information during the review process  which is common in review procedures.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “We welcome EMA’s MAA review acceptance and will work closely with them to bring VLA1553 to market. Chikungunya virus  or CHIKV  has already spread to over 110 countries and the risk of chikungunya spreading in Europe is relatively high due to the possibility of infected travelers3. No vaccine or specific treatments are currently available for this debilitating disease which therefore constitutes an unmet medical need. Following approval of VLA1553 in the United States4  we will continue to work diligently to bring VLA1553 to other territories as soon as possible.”VLA1553 received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)5 at the beginning of the month under the brand name IXCHIQ®. In the U.S.  the vaccine is indicated for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV.Mid-November  Valneva also reported positive pivotal Phase 3 immunogenicity data in adolescents for VLA1553 which are intended to support label extension in this age group6. The trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite7. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20328. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries9. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas10 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. In Europe  there is no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 110 countries11. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 202212  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202213  positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202214 and positive pivotal Phase 3 data in adolescents in November 202315.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA155316. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201917  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.VLA1553 received FDA approval in November 2023 under the brand name IXCHIQ® and is indicated for the prevention of disease caused by CHIKV in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. Continued approval of IXCHIQ® in the United States is contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation and accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020 and 2023 respectively.The Company intends to commercialize this vaccine by leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Nantes Saint-Nazaire Port wanted to offer a solution to encourage the development of the hydrogen industry in the region.As part of this project  Lhyfe will build an industrial unit with a production capacity of up to 85 tonnes per day of green and renewable hydrogen (installed electrolysis capacity of 210 MW) located in the north of bulk port terminal. This site should be operational by 2028.Lhyfe produces green and renewable hydrogen through the electrolysis of water  at production units powered by renewable energy. The company's first site has already been in operation since the latter half of 2021  and seven other sites are currently in construction throughout Europe (France  Germany and Sweden).This project will contribute to the decarbonization of the industrial port complex and of the maritime transport. It is consistent with the action program for the development of a ""Low Carbon Industrial Zone"" (ZIBaC)  supported by the Association des Industriels Loire Estuaire (AILE)  Saint-Nazaire Agglomération  the Estuaire and Sillon areas and the Pays de la Loire Region. An ambition and a roadmap have been drawn up to transform the Loire Estuaire territory into a low-carbon energy hub. This project confirms this ambition and the momentum that has been built up to accelerate the energy transition in the industrial port area of the Loire estuary.The project's implementation is subject to the granting of operating authorizations and construction permits  as well as to financial investment decisions.About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen. Its production sites and portfolio of projects intend to provide access to green and renewable hydrogen in industrial quantities  and enable the creation of a virtuous energy model capable of decarbonising entire sectors of industry and transport.In 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the first industrial-scale green hydrogen production plant in the world to be interconnected with a wind farm. In 2022  Lhyfe inaugurated the first offshore green hydrogen production pilot platform in the world.Lhyfe is represented in 12 European countries and had 192 staff at the end of June 2023.

The deal  which is an all-stock agreement  allows Forward Partners’ shareholders to exchange their holdings for new Molten shares at a ratio of one for nine  representing a 7.3% discount based on the closing prices from Friday. As a result of the acquisition  Molten shareholders will hold approximately 91% of the enlarged entity.In conjunction with the acquisition  Molten Ventures is set to increase its financial muscle by raising an additional £50 million. This capital raise will be executed at a price of 270p per share  with significant investment pledges from BlackRock and the British Business Bank  who have committed up to £25 million and £10 million  respectively. Additionally  Molten is targeting just under £3 million in extra funds by offering up to 1.1 million new shares to the market at the same price point.The strategic acquisition brings key assets into Molten’s fold  including innovative companies like Bea Fertility and Gravity Sketch  as well as Robin AI. Moreover  it encompasses successful exits such as Skimlinks  Airsupply  and Cazoo  enhancing Molten's position in what CEO Martin Davis describes as a buyer's market. This move is expected to provide Molten Ventures with a competitive edge in supporting its portfolio companies.To further its financial strategy  Molten Ventures is pursuing additional funding through placements on the London Stock Exchange and Euronext Dublin. The firm has garnered major investments from shareholders such as Blackrock (NYSE: ) and British Patient Capital  with retail investors also being given the opportunity to participate through PrimaryBid. These strategic financial maneuvers are projected to boost Molten’s liquidity to over £100 million  taking into account their revolving credit facilities with J.P.

Focused on translational research  i.e.  converting results in basic research into results that directly benefit humans  RHU projects involve academic  hospital  and business stakeholders.For this sixth wave  an international jury reviewed 62 applications based on criteria of scientific quality  innovation  and potential for medical and socio-economic impact. It proposed to select and fund 19 projects covering various therapeutic areas and medical needs. These 19 projects will receive an exceptional grant of 160 million euros from the Future Investments Program.As part of this call for projects  the SICKMAST project  funded with 9.2 million euros  aims to:First  identify and validate  from a database of 1500 patients (including 700 already identified)  biomarkers highlighting the role of mast cells and basophils in orchestrating acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease.Second  demonstrate in a phase 2 clinical trial the efficacy of masitinib in the treatment of acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease in patients identified based on biomarkers.The Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) will be the promoter of these phase 2 studies. AB Science will mainly be involved in supplying masitinib and monitoring masitinib pharmacovigilance data. AB Science remains free to carry out  as it sees fit  any potential phase 3 development following the success of phase 2.A new patent has been filed  which  if granted  will extend the international protection of masitinib in sickle cell disease until 2040. As part of the consortium agreement established for its patents  AB Science will pay royalties to APHP in the event of commercialization of masitinib in sickle cell disease.Prof. Olivier Hermine  Necker-Enfants malades AP-HP  coordinator of the SICKMAST program  said  ""We are delighted to be among the laureates of this program  recognized for its extremely rigorous selection of innovative and medically impactful projects. Sickle cell disease represents a major public health challenge due to the number of affected individuals and the early mortality it causes. This program should allow us to demonstrate the relevance of selectively targeting two key immune cells in the treatment of this disease and identifying patients most likely to respond through new biomarkers.""Alain Moussy  President and co-founder of AB Science  said  ""We are very pleased with this collaboration with APHP  one of the largest promoters of clinical studies in France  whose research excellence is globally recognized. This project demonstrates the full potential of masitinib in targeting certain key immune cells involved in numerous pathologies. It opens an extremely promising new development avenue for masitinib and offers partnership prospects that we will explore to enable the registration and commercialization of masitinib in this indication under the best conditions.""A webcast with experts in sickle cell disease will be held on November 30  2023  to provide a more detailed presentation of this project. Login details for this live webcast will be provided later.Scientific rationaleInflammation mediated by innate immune cells and promoting vaso-occlusion has recently been shown to play a major role in sickle cell disease. In particular  our clinical observations and experimental work in mice  have revealed the involvement of mast cells and basophils in complications associated with sickle cell disease:The degree of mast cell activation in patients with sickle cell disease may contribute to the heterogeneity of inflammation and chronic and acute complications.The potential role of basophils in sickle cell disease has not been studied  however  given their role in various diseases and their ability to release substance P and histamine  they could also play important roles in the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease.Masitinib is an inhibitor of KIT  LYN  and FYN  three major kinases involved in the activation of mast cells and basophils.EpidemiologySickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. Although life expectancy has increased over the last 20 years  acute and chronic complications still result in comorbidities  high social burden and premature death at around 40 years. Approximately 1.1% of couples worldwide are at risk of having a child with a hemoglobin disorder (sickle cell disease or thalassemia)  and 2.3 conceptions per 1 000 are affected by sickle cell disease. Estimates suggest that each year  around 300 000 children are born with sickle cell disease  and this number could reach 400 000 by 2050 [1]. Sickle cell disease affects over 100 000 children and adults in the United States. In France  approximately 26 000 patients are affected (50% children  50% adults).Medical needThe classic view of sickle cell disease pathophysiology  involves polymerization of mutated hemoglobin (HbS) leading to red blood cell (RBC) sickling with subsequent hemolytic anemia  painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and acute chest syndrome (ACS).Current treatment options such as hydroxycarbamide  chronic transfusion or anti-P-selectin antibodies  do not fully prevent life-threatening acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy are available only for a minority of patients  are associated with toxicity and are very expensive  which limits their use.There is a significant medical need to prevent the acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease.Reference[1] Piel FB  Steinberg MH  Rees DC.

Regions : Europe leads the way with 31% of listed real estate companies setting net zero targets on all three scopes compared with 14% in Asia and only 8% in North America.: Europe leads the way with 31% of listed real estate companies setting net zero targets on all three scopes compared with 14% in Asia and only 8% in North America. Measurement: 39% of listed real estate companies report on scopes 1 and 2 emissions  unchanged from our inaugural report last year  although the proportion which measure and report across all 3 scopes (externally verified) has risen from 15% to 20%.Governance: 34% of listed real estate companies have appointed board-level oversight for greenhouse gas emissions targets. This is up 13 percentage points year on year.Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management analysed the environmental pathway frameworks of listed real estate companies globally in order to assess how the sector is progressing towards the Paris Climate Change goals. The analysis represents 92% of the total listed real estate market capitalisation constituting almost $2 trillion worth of real estate worldwide.The wordwide real estate sector (both listed and privately owned) contribute to approximately 40% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  but only 15% of the listed real estate companies worldwide have set comprehensive targets to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions on all three scopes (externally verified) by 2050  according to research by Van Lanschot Kempen’s Real Assets Team.While this represents an improvement from 12 months ago  when only 10% had set such targets  accelerated action is needed from the sector if it hopes to meet its net zero ambitions. This year we see progress  but its still from a very low starting base.DisclaimerThis is a marketing message.Capital at risk.

Targets: Only 15% of listed real estate companies have set net…,Official VAN LANSCHOT KEMPEN N.V press releaseAmsterdam/London  27 November 2023Listed real estate sector has made progress over past 12 months but accelerated action is needed from the industry to meet net zero targets.Targets : Only 15% of listed real estate companies have set net zero targets on all three scopes (externally verified)  up from 10% last year.: Only 15% of listed real estate companies have set net zero targets on all three scopes (externally verified)  up from 10% last year. Regions : Europe leads the way with 31% of listed real estate companies setting net zero targets on all three scopes compared with 14% in Asia and only 8% in North America.: Europe leads the way with 31% of listed real estate companies setting net zero targets on all three scopes compared with 14% in Asia and only 8% in North America. Measurement: 39% of listed real estate companies report on scopes 1 and 2 emissions  unchanged from our inaugural report last year  although the proportion which measure and report across all 3 scopes (externally verified) has risen from 15% to 20%.Governance: 34% of listed real estate companies have appointed board-level oversight for greenhouse gas emissions targets. This is up 13 percentage points year on year.Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management analysed the environmental pathway frameworks of listed real estate companies globally in order to assess how the sector is progressing towards the Paris Climate Change goals. The analysis represents 92% of the total listed real estate market capitalisation constituting almost $2 trillion worth of real estate worldwide.The wordwide real estate sector (both listed and privately owned) contribute to approximately 40% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  but only 15% of the listed real estate companies worldwide have set comprehensive targets to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions on all three scopes (externally verified) by 2050  according to research by Van Lanschot Kempen’s Real Assets Team.While this represents an improvement from 12 months ago  when only 10% had set such targets  accelerated action is needed from the sector if it hopes to meet its net zero ambitions. This year we see progress  but its still from a very low starting base.DisclaimerThis is a marketing message.Capital at risk.

Based on the latest discussions with the candidates  these offers would generate a cash flow for Pharnext of up to €400m  excluding royalties indexed to sales of the future drug.Given the closeness between the receipt of these offers and the publication of the publication of topline results from the pivotal Phase III clinical trial (PREMIER trial)  planned for December 11  the Company has decided not to sign any exclusivity agreement at this stage. Confident indeed in the quality of the forthcoming clinical results  the Company decided to wait for their announcement before signing an exclusivity agreement with one of the pharmaceuticals. This additional time should enable candidates to adjust their offers on the basis of the new calendar  and potentially allow other candidates to come forward.Hugo Brugière  Manager of Pharnext  said: “We are now just a few days away from revealing the clinical results of our Phase III trial  and thus confirming the value of our drug candidate. It would have been easier for us to sign an agreement right away  with the assurance of immediately receiving a few million euros. But we're faced with a potential deal worth hundreds of millions euros  and we mustn't tremble when making choices. So we're waiting calmly and conscientiously for the clinical results before choosing a partner to bring this new product to market..”As a reminder  this future agreement would complement the licensing agreement already signed in 2017 granting GeneNet (a research and development joint venture controlled by Tasly Pharmaceutical and owned 30% by Pharnext) with the commercialization rights for PXT3003 in CMT1A in Greater China (Mainland China  Hong Kong  Taiwan and Macau)  and already generated an investment of €30m by Tasly in Pharnext.The signature of such agreements could cover Pharnext's financing needs  and thus terminate the OCEANE-BSA financing line subscribed by Global Tech Opportunities 13.DisclaimerPharnext arranged convertible bonds financing (OCEAN-BSA) with Global Tech Opportunities 13 which  after receiving the shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of these instruments  will not remain shareholder of the Company.The shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of the above-mentioned securities will generally be sold on the market at very short notice  which may create strong downward pressure on the share price.Shareholders may suffer a loss of their invested capital due to a significant fall in the Company's share price  as well as significant dilution due to the large number of securities issued to Global Tech Opportunities 13.Investors are advised to exercise extreme caution before deciding to invest in the securities of a listed company that carries out such dilutive financing transactions  particularly when they are carried out in succession. The Company wishes to point out that this is not the first dilutive financing transaction it has undertaken.Investors are invited to familiarize themselves with the risks associated with these transactions  as mentioned in the press release above.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions. Pharnext has a first-in-class drug candidate  PXT3003  in development for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)  a rare  debilitating  inherited peripheral neuropathy. PXT3003 benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. In 2018  PXT3003 completed a Phase III clinical trial  the PLEO-CMT trial  with encouraging topline results. This trial was followed by an open-label extension study  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial  with 120 patients continuing treatment with PXT3003. Long-term data suggest a sustained benefit  safety  and efficacy  after 6 years of total trial time. An international pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003  the PREMIER trial  enrolling 387 CMT1A patients was completed in August 2023. PREMIER topline results are expected in December 2023. PXT3003 originated from the Pleotherapy™ R&D approach. Pharnext draws the attention of investors to the financial and other risk factors detailed in its financial reports.

The second Dupixent® (dupilumab) investigational Phase 3 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) trial (NOTUS) has shown that Dupixent significantly reduced (34%) exacerbations  confirming positive published results from the landmark Phase 3 BOREAS trial. The NOTUS trial also confirmed that treatment with Dupixent led to rapid and significant improvements in lung function by 12 weeks and were sustained at 52 weeks. The NOTUS trial evaluated the investigational use of Dupixent compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (triple therapy) with uncontrolled COPD and evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL). These results were from an interim analysis and  given the overwhelming positive efficacy of the primary endpoint  will be considered the primary analysis of the trial. Sanofi and Regeneron plan to submit the data from this replicate trial  along with positive results from the Phase 3 BOREAS trial  to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of the year.Naimish Patel  M.D.Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi“This is the first and only time an investigational biologic in COPD has shown a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in exacerbations in two Phase 3 trials and we are pleased that we can potentially deliver Dupixent faster to patients in need where no new advancements have been identified in over a decade. These data validate our belief that Dupixent has the potential to transform the treatment of moderate-to-severe COPD and given the significant unmet needs for patients with uncontrolled COPD  we are not stopping with Dupixent.

These results demonstrate the important role of type 2 inflammation in yet another chronic and debilitating disease  and the ability of Dupixent to address this inflammation. We are working to submit these data rapidly to the FDA.”The NOTUS trial included 935 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 85 years and randomized to receive Dupixent (n=470) or placebo (n=465)  which was added to maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy. Patients receiving Dupixent compared to placebo experienced:34% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p=0.0002)  the primary endpoint.Improved lung function from baseline by 139 mL at 12 weeks compared to 57 mL for placebo (p=0.0001)  with the benefit versus placebo sustained at week 52 (115 mL for Dupixent versus 54 mL for placebo  p=0.0182)  both of which were key secondary endpoints.The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AE) were 67% for Dupixent and 66% for placebo.

AEs more commonly observed with placebo compared to Dupixent included COPD (7.8% placebo  4.9% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were 2.6% for Dupixent and 1.5% for placebo.Detailed results from the NOTUS trial are planned for presentation at a future scientific forum.The efficacy results in NOTUS were consistent with the previously announced results in BOREAS. BOREAS results showed:30% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p=0.0005)  the primary endpoint.Improved lung function from baseline by 160 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL for placebo (p<0.0001)  with the benefit versus placebo sustained through week 52 (p=0.0003).The safety results in NOTUS were also consistent with those previously announced in BOREAS.

AEs more commonly observed with placebo compared to Dupixent included upper respiratory tract infection (9.8% placebo  7.9% Dupixent)  hypertension (6.0% placebo  3.6% Dupixent) and COVID-19 (5.7% placebo  4.1% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were 1.5% for Dupixent and 1.7% for placebo.The European Medicines Agency is reviewing Sanofi and Regeneron’s application for Dupixent for the treatment of uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation; this application is based on results from the BOREAS trial. Discussions with other regulatory authorities around the world are ongoing.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent in COPD are currently under clinical investigation and have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About COPDCOPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide and a life-threatening respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough  breathlessness and excessive mucus production that may not only impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  but can also lead to anxiety  depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization or even death. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. In the U.S. alone  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramNOTUS and BOREAS are replicate  randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD aged 40 to 85 years in NOTUS and 40 to 80 years in BOREAS. Enrolling a total of 1 874 patients  all patients in NOTUS and BOREAS had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per µL. Patients with a diagnosis or history of asthma were excluded from the trials.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in NOTUS and BOREAS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists (LABA)  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint for NOTUS and BOREAS evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those: requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV 1 ]) at 12 and 52 weeks.Data from BOREAS were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.About Sanofi and Regeneron’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD. Across both programs  four Phase 3 trials are ongoing and designed to inform next-generation treatments for people with COPD who might not have other options.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. Approximately 750 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops  and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

Across both programs  four Phase 3 trials are ongoing and designed to inform next-generation treatments for people with COPD who might not have other options.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. Approximately 750 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops  and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the second Dupixent® (dupilumab) investigational Phase 3 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) trial (NOTUS) showed that Dupixent significantly reduced (34%) exacerbations  confirming positive results from the landmark Phase 3 BOREAS trial. The NOTUS trial also confirmed that treatment with Dupixent led to rapid and significant improvements in lung function by 12 weeks and were sustained at 52 weeks.The NOTUS trial evaluated the investigational use of Dupixent compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (triple therapy) with uncontrolled COPD and evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL). These results were from an interim analysis and  given the overwhelming positive efficacy of the primary endpoint  will be considered the primary analysis of the trial. Regeneron and Sanofi plan to submit the data from this replicate trial  along with positive results from the Phase 3 BOREAS trial to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of the year.“We are highly encouraged by these remarkable results from NOTUS showing a 34% reduction in COPD exacerbations compared to placebo  confirming the unprecedented results from our first Phase 3 trial  BOREAS ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board Co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “These results demonstrate the important role of type 2 inflammation in yet another chronic and debilitating disease  and the ability of Dupixent to address this inflammation. We are working to submit these data rapidly to the FDA.”Earlier this year  the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with uncontrolled COPD associated with a history of exacerbations and an eosinophilic phenotype based on the positive results from BOREAS.“This is the first and only time an investigational biologic in COPD has shown a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in exacerbations in two Phase 3 trials and we are pleased that we can potentially deliver Dupixent faster to patients in need where no new advancements have been identified in over a decade ” said Naimish Patel  M.D.  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. “These data validate our belief that Dupixent has the potential to transform the treatment of moderate-to-severe COPD and given the significant unmet needs for patients with uncontrolled COPD  we are not stopping with Dupixent. Our second program in COPD  itepekimab  continues with data expected in 2025. If positive  Dupixent and itepekimab could emerge as treatments for approximately 80% of those suffering from moderate-to-severe COPD with recurrent exacerbations.”The NOTUS trial included 935 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 85 years and randomized to receive Dupixent (n=470) or placebo (n=465)  which was added to maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy. Patients receiving Dupixent compared to placebo experienced:34% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p=0.0002)  the primary endpoint.Improved lung function from baseline by 139 mL at 12 weeks compared to 57 mL for placebo (p=0.0001)  with the benefit versus placebo sustained at week 52 (115 mL for Dupixent versus 54 mL for placebo  p=0.0182).The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AE) were 67% for Dupixent and 66% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5% and ≥1% imbalance) compared to placebo included COVID-19 (9.4% Dupixent  8.2% placebo)  nasopharyngitis (6.2% Dupixent  5.2% placebo) and headache (7.5% Dupixent  6.5% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo compared to Dupixent included COPD (7.8% placebo  4.9% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were 2.6% for Dupixent and 1.5% for placebo.Detailed results from the NOTUS trial are planned for presentation at a future scientific forum.The efficacy results in NOTUS were consistent with the previously announced results in BOREAS. BOREAS results showed:30% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p=0.0005)  the primary endpoint.Improved lung function from baseline by 160 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL for placebo (p<0.0001)  with the benefit versus placebo sustained through week 52 (p=0.0003).The safety results in NOTUS were also consistent with those previously announced in BOREAS. Overall rates of AEs in BOREAS were 77% for Dupixent and 76% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included headache (8.1% Dupixent  6.8% placebo)  diarrhea (5.3% Dupixent  3.6% placebo) and back pain (5.1% Dupixent  3.4% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo compared to Dupixent included upper respiratory tract infection (9.8% placebo  7.9% Dupixent)  hypertension (6.0% placebo  3.6% Dupixent) and COVID-19 (5.7% placebo  4.1% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were 1.5% for Dupixent and 1.7% for placebo.The European Medicines Agency is reviewing Regeneron and Sanofi’s application for Dupixent for the treatment of uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation; this application is based on results from the BOREAS trial. Discussions with other regulatory authorities around the world are ongoing.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent in COPD are currently under clinical investigation and have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough  breathlessness and excessive mucus production that may not only impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  but can also lead to anxiety  depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. In the United States  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramNOTUS and BOREAS are replicate  randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD aged 40 to 85 years in NOTUS and 40 to 80 years in BOREAS. Enrolling a total of 1 874 patients  all patients in NOTUS and BOREAS had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per µL. Patients with a diagnosis or history of asthma were excluded from the trials.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in NOTUS and BOREAS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists (LABA)  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint for NOTUS and BOREAS evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those: requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV 1 ]) at 12 and 52 weeks.Data from BOREAS were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation.

The study did not meet the primary endpoint of a sustained platelet count response in chronic ITP patients.Additional analyses of the dataset are ongoing and the full results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and in a peer-reviewed publication.""This is not the outcome we had hoped for patients  but setbacks are part of pioneering a new class of medicines and these data will provide insights into the broader understanding of FcRn and ITP "" said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. ""We are very grateful to everyone involved in the ADVANCE-SC study  especially the patients and their families  the investigators  and our internal team who worked tirelessly to complete this global study. We remain committed to the ITP patient community who urgently needs additional treatment options to manage this challenging disease  and continue to move forward in our deeper analysis of these results.""ADVANCE-SC Study DataADVANCE-SC is the second of two registrational trials conducted as part of the ongoing ITP development program for VYVGART and enrolled 207 adult patients with chronic and persistent ITP. Patients were heavily pre-treated and 75% of patients had received three or more prior ITP therapies.Primary endpoint was not met (p=0.5081); 13.7% (17/124) of treated patients demonstrated a sustained platelet count response compared to 16.2% (11/68) of placebo patientsSecondary endpoints were not met  including additional endpoints on International Working Group (IWG) responder status and mean platelet count change from baselineVYVGART Hytrulo was well-tolerated in ADVANCE-SC; the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with ADVANCE-IV and the confirmed safety profile of VYVGART and VYVGART HytruloResults from the first study in the ITP registrational program  ADVANCE-IV  were reported in May 2022. The study met its primary and key platelet-derived secondary endpoints. ADVANCE-IV formed the basis of the regulatory submission for approval of VYVGART IV for ITP in Japan  where a decision is expected in the first quarter of 2024.VYVGART is currently being evaluated in 13 severe autoimmune diseases  including the registrational ADDRESS study for pemphigus from which topline results are expected around year-end 2023.Conference Call Detailsargenx will host a conference call today at 2:30 pm CET (8:30am ET) to discuss the ADVANCE-SC results.

Patients were on a stable dose of at least one ITP treatment prior to randomization and had received at least one prior therapy. Concomitant medications permitted included corticosteroids  nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  fostamatinib or TPO-RAs. The study patients who were on 'watch and wait' at baseline were required to have received at least 2 prior treatments for ITP. ​Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. The primary endpoint was measured by the proportion of patients with chronic ITP with a sustained platelet count response defined as achieving platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50x109/L for at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24. Patients who received rescue therapy at week 12 or later  or for whom dose and/or frequency of concurrent ITP therapies increased at week 12 or later  were considered non-responders. ​Key secondary endpoints included extent of disease control over 24-week treatment period  proportion of overall population with sustained platelet count response  an extended primary endpoint analysis between weeks 17 and 24  and the incidence and severity of WHO-classified bleeding events.About Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies destroy platelets and reduce platelet production  which can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising. In rare cases  ITP can lead to severe anemia and life threatening gastrointestinal or intracranial hemorrhages. ITP is also associated with debilitating fatigue and significant impacts on mental health  including anxiety  fear and depression. Many ITP patients are inadequately controlled on current therapies so a significant unmet need exists for additional treatment options.About VYVGART HytruloVYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART®  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVGART Hytrulo results in the reduction of circulating IgG.VYVGART Hytrulo is the proprietary name in the U.S. for subcutaneous efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20. It is marketed in Europe as VYVGART and may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.
