33163,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/eurex-focused-on-harmonising-onto-one-risk-management-framework/,Eurex focused on harmonising onto one risk management framework,Risk management top of the agenda across Eurex business offerings on both the trading and clearing side  senior executives have affirmed.,At a recent roundtable  Deutsche Börse Group derivatives exchange  Eurex  shared its plan to harmonise onto one risk management infrastructure over the next two years.Speaking to the priorities for the business generally  Michael Peters  chief executive of Eurex Frankfurt AG  asserted that “risk management is top of the agenda for both the trading side and the clearing side.”Almost a decade ago  back in 2014  Eurex clearing was a leading innovator when it came to real-time risk management. Today  the attention for the next two years is on harmonising onto one risk management infrastructure. Peters specifically highlighted putting Eurex’s MTF and trading pools onto one joint offering which would also likely include European Energy Exchange (EEX) and European Commodity Clearing (ECC) on the commodity side  as well as the repo business.Matthias Graulich  chief strategy officer at Eurex and global head of fixed income  funding and financing strategy and development at Deutsche Börse Group  expanded on this  explaining: “The intention is to offer all financial products denominated in euro within the same legal  operational and risk management framework.“In terms of what belongs in this ecosystem are long-term European government bond futures and options (Eurex is in the advanced stages of launching an EU bond future potentially in 2024)  euro denominated interest rate swaps  futures and options on short-term Euro interest rates Euribor and €STR  as well as the repo business.”Currently  Eurex’s offering allows clients to trade repos with more than 160 registered participants and allows participants to raise or place cash against over 13 000 securities  both domestic and international.Earlier this year  Eurex confirmed that it had seen a significant increase in trading activities and reached record volumes in its cleared repo markets – doubling across all markets year on year as of August 2023.Speaking at this most recent roundtable  Graulich expanded on the growth of the repo business: “What we have seen is that this business has gotten more and more attractive again because excess liquidity in the market is shrinking as central banks take a step back out of this market.”The execs also discussed the growth of their pension fund client base amid the changes being seen  emphasising that pension funds are moving into the repo market as they bank on more reliable liquidity in times of market stress.“We see that pension funds are very interested in cleared repo because they get better rates  it’s operationally quicker  and they have a much broader choice of execution counterparties and ultimately face the CCP  which is also from a credit perspective preferable  said Graulich.Speaking to this shift in more detail  he added: “The main reason why pension funds were for so long exempted from swaps clearing was the risk that if there was a large interest rate move that they wouldn’t have access to sufficient liquid resources to fund variation margin on the swap side.“Now one driver for these pension funds to go into the cleared repo market is that this liquidity pool is much more reliable in market stress situations relative to the bilateral repo market. In particular when it comes to market stress liquidity in the cleared market increased whereas it dried up usually in the bilateral market.”Read more: Eurex lures euro clearing volumes to Europe post-Brexit with new buy-side incentive schemeElsewhere  Graulich highlighted that credit index futures are also seeing more appetite from the market and are continuing to progress.“While these volumes and activities are still small  we see a lot of interest. Clearing brokers are getting ready to support the product and liquidity providers are already engaging in the topic. Additionally  end clients in particular are showing interest also in the credit future side because it’s such an efficient tool to manage risks and take a perspective on credit.”,neutral,0.01,0.93,0.06,mixed,0.32,0.33,0.35,True,English,"['one risk management framework', 'Eurex', 'Deutsche Börse Group derivatives exchange', 'long-term European government bond futures', 'new buy-side incentive scheme', 'pension fund client base', 'large interest rate move', 'one risk management infrastructure', 'European Energy Exchange', 'short-term Euro interest rates', 'EU bond future', 'real-time risk management', 'risk management framework', 'next two years', 'sufficient liquid resources', 'interest rate swaps', 'European Commodity Clearing', 'one joint offering', 'credit index futures', 'chief strategy officer', 'credit future side', 'Eurex Frankfurt AG', 'market stress liquidity', 'bilateral repo market', 'one driver', 'commodity side', 'swaps clearing', 'chief executive', 'financing strategy', 'clearing side', 'pension funds', 'stress situations', 'bilateral market', 'trading side', 'excess liquidity', 'reliable liquidity', 'swap side', 'liquidity pool', 'Clearing brokers', 'liquidity providers', 'recent roundtable', 'leading innovator', 'trading pools', 'global head', 'fixed income', 'financial products', 'advanced stages', 'euro denominated', 'significant increase', 'central banks', 'broader choice', 'execution counterparties', 'main reason', 'efficient tool', 'credit perspective', 'repo business', 'Eurex clearing', 'Michael Peters', '160 registered participants', 'trading activities', 'repo markets', 'end clients', 'record volumes', 'Matthias Graulich', 'plan', 'priorities', 'agenda', 'attention', 'MTF', 'EEX', 'ECC', 'funding', 'development', 'intention', 'operational', 'terms', 'ecosystem', 'options', 'Euribor', '€STR', 'repos', 'cash', '13,000 securities', 'August', 'growth', 'step', 'execs', 'changes', 'times', 'CCP', 'shift', 'detail', 'access', 'variation', 'margin', 'Brexit', 'appetite', 'lot', 'topic', 'risks']",2023-11-28,2023-11-29,thetradenews.com

On July 6  2023  the Parent requested the NYSE for additional time to file its 2022 Annual Report as well as its 2023 Semi-Annual Report due to continued delays in the completion of audit and review of its internal control over financial reporting.On July 13  2023  the NYSE suspended trading in the Parent's shares and commenced delisting proceedings (the ""Delisting Decision""). On July 26  2023  the Parent submitted a request for a review of the delisting determination by the NYSE. Following the review  the NYSE Committee reached a final decision to uphold the delisting determination on October 30  2023. On October 31  2023  the NYSE filed a Form 25 notification of removal from listing with the SEC. The removal of the Parent's shares from listing on the NYSE became effective on November 13  2023. Currently  the Parent's shares are only available to trade on the over-the-counter (or OTC) ""expert"" market  where quotations are only directly available to broker dealers and professional investors (not to retail investors).Following the delisting from the NYSE  the Parent will continue to adhere to its SEC reporting obligations as long as it is a reporting company under the Exchange Act. However  there can be no assurance whether or when the Parent's shares would again be listed for trading on the NYSE or another U.S. exchange. The delisting could also result in other negative outcomes  including the potential loss or reduction of confidence by customers  business partners and employees  the potential loss or reduction of investor interests  and fewer business and strategic opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Parent's results of operations  cash flows and financial conditions.The Parent's failure to deliver its audited consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of its subsidiaries violates covenants in certain of its financing agreements and could materially and adversely affect its business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows.Timely submission of financial statements of the Parent and/or its subsidiaries is a key covenant in most of its financing agreements. The Parent secured various time extensions from its lenders in respect of these covenants. The Parent has received time extensions from several lenders for its external indebtedness but not16from all lenders. In this regard  the Parent's auditors have provided in their audit report that these ""events raise a substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.""The Parent is currently under discussions with the remaining lenders to obtain the requisite time extensions and expects to receive the same in due course. The lenders which have not granted such extensions have rights under the respective financing agreements to take actions including (but not limited to) acceleration of the repayment of all or some of the indebtedness owed to them and/or security enforcement under the terms of the applicable financing agreements. Any such actions by lenders also could result in cross-defaults or cross-accelerations of other indebtedness and could materially and adversely affect the Parent's business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows.In addition  due to the Parent's inability to meet these information covenants to date and/or downgrade in credit ratings  some of its lenders have started charging it penalty interest rates and/or upward revised the rate of interest. These penalty rates of interest and higher rates of interest have increased the finance costs for the projects to which these loans relate. While the penalty interest may cease to be charged upon finalization and submission of the delayed financial statements  the rate of interests which have been revised upwards may not revert to pervious levels  and  therefore  may result in continued higher cost of funds for the Parent's debt borrowings for these projects.The Parent has conducted investigations into whistle-blower claims and other allegations against certain directors  officers and employees and former officers and directors of the Parent. The Parent has reported the allegations and its findings to the SEC and the Department of Justice and continues to cooperate with these authorities.In May 2022  the Parent received a whistle-blower complaint that alleged health and safety lapses  procedural irregularities  misconduct by certain employees  improper payments and false statements relating to one of its projects belonging to a project subsidiary. Following extensive investigation by the Ethics Committee  supervised by the Board's Audit and Risk Committee and by external counsel and forensic professionals  the Parent identified evidence of manipulation and misrepresentation of project data by some employees at that project site. Weak controls over payments to a vendor and failures to provide accurate information both internally and externally were found  but no direct evidence that any improper payment was made to any government official was identified. Further  in fiscal year 2023  the Parent reported to the Solar Energy Corporation of India (""SECI"") that this project had (i) shortfalls in generation and (ii) that it failed to timely complete and commission the requisite contractually required capacity. On January 3  2023 and January 4  2023  SECI advised the Parent  inter alia  that the project may be liable for damages and penalties for shortfalls in generation and for not commissioning the full capacity required under its power purchase agreement (""PPA"") in a timely manner.In September 2022  the Parent received an additional whistle-blower complaint primarily making similar allegations of misconduct as raised in the May 2022 complaint  as well as allegations of misconduct related to joint ventures and land acquisition  allegations of its failure to be transparent with the market and advisors and other allegations. The Ethics Committee  supervised by the Board's Audit and Risk Committee  with the support of external counsel and forensic accounting professionals  investigated these September 2022 allegations. The investigation of the September 2022 complaint identified significant control issues in the process of acquiring land and land use rights in relation to one of the Parent's projects. The investigation specified that third party land aggregators may have been involved in improper payments but no improper transfer of money by the Group was identified. The Parent has made an adjustment (de-capitalization) in the books of accounts of INR 138 million (US$ 1.8 million) on estimate  as a prudent measure in the given project. Further  the Parent has reviewed the entire amount paid to land aggregators in other projects to identify any similar issue and after an assessment a further adjustment (decapitalisation) aggregating to INR 118 million (US$ 1.6 million) has been17made in the books of account on estimate  as a prudent measure  though no improper payments by the Group could be identified.The Parent also identified potential misrepresentations made by former executives to the Board in July 2021 regarding an asset purchase transaction for the development of a wind project. In addition  it appears the Parent's former executive officers may have circumvented internal policies in connection with the approval of another transaction related to another wind project. The Parent was not able to identify any evidence of improper payments related to either of these transactions. Considering the observations regarding the transactions  the Parent has reassessed the valuation of the asset purchase and related government orders and did not find any adjustment that needed to be made in the books of account.The Parent's investigation did not substantiate other portions of this September 2022 whistle-blower complaint.As part of its investigations of the May 2022 and September 2022 whistle-blower complaints  the Parent also widened its review to include a review of projects commissioned in fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2023 to ensure that similar weaknesses were not present. As part of the investigations  the Parent identified inconsistencies in project data in certain of its projects  but it identified no improper payments made in connection with these projects.The Parent has taken a range of actions due to these findings  and the employees involved in the misconduct are no longer associated with the Parent. In accordance with the recommendations of the Ethics Committee  the Board's Audit and Risk Committee and their legal and forensic advisors  the Parent is implementing remedial measures in both project control and monitoring. Further  the Parent reported the findings from its investigations of the May 2022 and September 2022 whistle-blower complaints to the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice  and it continues to cooperate with these authorities.In addition  a Special Committee of the Board of Directors (the ""Special Committee"") was convened in August 2022 to review certain material projects and contracts over a three-year period for anti-corruption and related compliance issues. Independent outside counsel and forensic advisors were engaged to support the Special Committee. The Special Committee's investigation has identified evidence that individuals formerly affiliated with the Parent may have had knowledge of  or were involved in  an apparent scheme with persons outside the Parent to make improper payments in relation to certain projects. To date  the Special Committee has not identified related improper payments or transfers by the Group. The Special Committee's investigation is still ongoing. The Special Committee's review and its findings could impact the decision-making of the Parent  in connection with such projects. The Parent has disclosed the details of the Special Committee's investigation to the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice  and the Group continues to cooperate with those agencies.The Group including the subsidiaries with respect to affected projects could be exposed to liabilities under the relevant contractual and tender documents (including levy of damages and liquidated damages  reduction of PPA tariffs and/or short closure of capacity)  administrative actions (including the risk of PPA cancellation  risk of being debarred from SECI's future contracts  withdrawal or nullification of commissioning certificates and/or revocation of commissioning extensions) and penalties from customers and other civil liabilities  all of which could adversely impact the revenue  profitability and capitalization of the affected projects. In addition  fines and/or penalties by regulatory authorities (including by the SEC  the U.S. Department of Justice and applicable Indian regulatory authorities) could be imposed on the Group. Any such fines or penalties could materially and adversely affect the Parent's business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future periods. In addition  the Group could be exposed to future litigation in connection with any findings of fraud  corruption  or other misconduct by its employees and former employees and executives.18An action alleging violations of U.S. securities laws has been brought against the Parent in New York.A class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York  case number 1:22-cv-07432  against the Parent and certain of its current and former directors and officers  alleging violations of U.S. securities laws. The Parent sees no merit in the claims asserted in the lawsuit and intends to defend the case vigorously. Risks associated with the lawsuit are difficult to assess and quantify  and its existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. Further  this lawsuit could result in substantial cost and a diversion of the Parent's management's attention and resources which could have a material adverse impact on the Parent.Certain unaudited consolidated operating and financial information provided by the Parent may differ materially from the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Parent's annual report on Form 20-F for fiscal year 2023 when filed with the SEC.The Parent provided certain estimated unaudited consolidated operating and financial information of the Group with respect to fiscal year 2023 in a current report on Form 6-K on July 13  2023. The financial and operating information that the Parent will include in its annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year 2023  when filed with the SEC  will be audited and consequently may differ from the information provided in the Form 6-K in ways that could be material. In addition  the Form 6-K does not include detailed notes and other disclosures that may be important. As such  the financial information included in the Form 6-K should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2023 when they become available as well as the Parent's annual report on Form 20-F for fiscal year 2023 when filed with the SEC.Risks Relating to the Consent SolicitationThe consummation of the Consent Solicitation may be terminated  delayed or amendedWe are not obligated to complete the Consent Solicitation under certain circumstances and unless and until certain conditions are satisfied. Even if the Consent Solicitation is completed  it may not be completed on the schedule described in this Consent Solicitation Statement. Unless the Execution Date has occurred  we  subject to certain limits  have the right to amend the terms of the Consent Solicitation prior to the Consent Expiration Deadline and we may choose to terminate or amend certain parts of the Consent Solicitation  but retain other aspects unchanged. If we make a material change in the terms of the Consent Solicitation  we will issue a press release setting forth such changes or other public announcement  disseminate additional materials  if appropriate  and will extend the Consent Solicitation to the extent required by law. Any material changes or amendments to the Proposed Amendments  which would adversely affect the rights or obligations of  or impose any additional obligations on  any Noteholder  will require a new consent solicitation process. New consents will need to be provided in relation to any new consent solicitation process and any Consent provided in relation to the Proposed Amendments will lapse.The Consent Solicitation instructions may be irrevocableSubject to Section 9.04 of each Indenture  consent instructions will be irrevocable once delivered unless the Consent Expiration Deadline has not occurred on or before the Longstop Date. You should carefully inform yourself of the considerations relevant to the Consent Solicitation prior to consenting to the Proposed Amendments pursuant to the Consent Solicitation.Consents by Sanctions Restricted Persons will not be acceptedA Noteholder who is a Sanctions Restricted Person may not participate in the Consent Solicitation. No steps taken by a Sanctions Restricted Person to deliver its Consent to the Proposed Amendments pursuant to the Consent Solicitation will be accepted by the Issuers and the Issuers will not pay the Consent Fee to such Sanctions Restricted Persons  who will not be eligible to receive the Consent Fee in any circumstances.The Deemed New Notes may be issued with original issue discount (""OID"") for U.S. federal income tax purposesAs described below under ""Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences to Noteholders-Adoption of the Proposed Amendments "" the payment of the Consent Fee is expected to create a ""deemed"" exchange of the 2024 Notes for Deemed New 2024 Notes  and although the matter is not entirely clear  is likely to create a deemed exchange of the 2026 Notes for Deemed New 2026 Notes (each as defined in ""Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences to Noteholders"") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the stated principal amount of the Deemed New Notes of the relevant series exceeds their issue price by an amount equal to or more than 0.25% multiplied by the product of the stated redemption price at maturity and the ""weighted average maturity"" from the issue date  the Deemed New Notes will be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event  in addition to the stated interest on the Deemed New Notes  a holder of the Deemed New Notes subject to U.S. federal income taxation will be required to include the OID in gross income (as ordinary income)  on a constant yield to maturity basis  in advance of the receipt of the cash payment thereof and regardless of such holder's regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See ""Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences to Noteholders-Original Issue Discount.""Tax consequences of the Deemed New Notes not trading under a separate CUSIPAs the Deemed New Notes held by U.S. Holders (as defined under ""Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences to Noteholders"") receiving the Consent Fee are not expected to be traded under a separate CUSIP from the relevant Notes held by holders that do not receive the Consent Fee  then  to the extent the Deemed New Notes are considered to be issued with original issue discount  the Notes held by U.S. Holders that do not receive the Consent Fee may also be treated by agents and other intermediaries as issued with original issue discount. In such case  such original issue discount would be reported to such U.S. Holders as ordinary income on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method  regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes  which method would generally have them include such original issue discount in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. See ""Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences to Noteholders-Original Issue Discount"" and ""-Tax Consequences of the Deemed New Notes Not Trading Under a Separate CUSIP.""19Special ConsiderationsAdverse effect of the Proposed Amendments on non-consenting NoteholdersNoteholders who do not consent to the Proposed Amendments at or prior to the Consent Expiration Deadline will not be eligible to receive any Consent Fee even though the Proposed Amendments will be binding upon them upon execution and delivery of the Supplemental Indentures and the payment of the Consent Fee by the relevant Issuer to the relevant Noteholders  which is expected to occur on the Consent Settlement Date.

Each Noteholder should carefully review this entire Consent Solicitation Statement before delivering a Consent. Noteholders may obtain copies of the Indentures without charge from the Information and Tabulation Agent.Background to the Consent SolicitationThe Parent filed Form 12b-25 on August 1  2022 and August 16  2022 in connection with its annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended March 31  2022 (the ""2022 Annual Report"") and filed its 2022 Annual Report on October 12  2023. The delay was due to  among others  the Parent's review of its internal control and compliance framework and the delay in the audit of its annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31  2022.In connection with the delayed filing of the 2022 Annual Report  the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") filed a Form 25 on October 31  2023  following which the Parent's shares were removed from listing on the NYSE on November 13  2023 (the ""delisting""). Notwithstanding the delisting  the Parent remains subject to the reporting obligations under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  as amended (the ""Exchange Act"")  and has filed and furnished  and continues to file and furnish  periodic reports with or to the SEC.Accordingly  the Issuers have been and expect to continue to remain in compliance with Section 4.03  as well as the other provisions  of the Indentures. Nevertheless  following inquiries from certain Noteholders  the Issuers desire to provide Noteholders with (i) a schedule by which the Parent will provide to the Trustee the 2023 Annual Report and its semi-annual report on Form 6-K for the six months ended September 30  2023 (the ""2024 Semi-Annual Report"") and (ii) specific deadlines by which the Issuers are required to provide future financial reports of the Parent to the Trustee.In connection with the Consent Solicitation  and subject to the terms hereof  the Issuers shall undertake to make mandatory offers (i) to purchase an outstanding principal amount of US$40 000 000 of 2024 Notes on or prior to March 25  2024  and (ii) to purchase an outstanding principal amount of US$12 000 000 of 2026 Notes on or prior to March 25  2024 and an outstanding principal amount of US$8 000 000 of 2026 Notes on or prior to August 26  2024  in each case  at a purchase price of 100% of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest.In addition  APSEPL is seeking to make certain amendments to the Restricted Payments and limitations on amendments of onshore debt covenants in the 2024 Indenture to allow for the implementation of a cash-neutral intercompany transaction.Proposed Amendments to the 2024 IndentureBy delivering a Consent  each consenting Noteholder of the 2024 Notes will be deemed to have authorized  directed and requested that the Trustee and the Collateral Agents  upon receipt of the Requisite Consents  enter into the Supplemental Indenture to the 2024 Indenture to give effect to the Proposed Amendments  which will become operative upon the execution of the Supplemental Indenture and the payment of the Consent Fee.24Proposed Amendments relating to mandatory offer to purchaseSection 3 of the 2024 Indenture would be amended by inserting a new Section 3.11 as follows:""Section 3.11 Mandatory Offer to PurchaseThe Company shall make an offer to purchase to all Holders on a pro rata basis of an aggregate principal amount of US$40 000 000 of Notes at a purchase price of 100% of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on the Notes repurchased to (but not including) the repurchase date (the ""Repurchase Date"")  which date shall be on or prior to March 25  2024 (the ""Mandatory Offer"").On or before the Repurchase Date  the Company will  to the extent lawful  accept for payment  on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary  but subject to Section 3.02  all Notes tendered pursuant to the Mandatory Offer  and will deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee a markdown instruction letter stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.11 and authorizing the cancellation of such principal amount of the Notes. The Company  the Depositary or the Paying Agent  as the case may be  will promptly (but in any case not later than five days after the Repurchase Date) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes tendered by such Holder and accepted by the Company for purchase. The Company will publicly announce the results of the Mandatory Offer on the Repurchase Date.The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of the Mandatory Offer in accordance with the preceding paragraph.

Proving the bond investor's appetite and their confidence in the Group's credit profile  this issuance was close to 4 times oversubscribed.The proceeds will be used to finance or refinance Eligible Green Portfolio as defined in the Sustainable Bond Framework  including the refinancing of outstanding Green Bonds.The spread of the Bond issuance is 168 bps at 8.5 years for a coupon of 4.625%.

Under this selection  Ebusco will offer the Ebusco 2.2 to Italian authorities and operators without the need to issue a European tender.Consip is the National Public Administration Procurement Center of Italy which enables local governments to perform public purchases while stimulating a competitive participation of bidders in public tenders. The Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) is the sole shareholder of Consip.Through an extensive tender process  Ebusco was selected as a supplier for electric suburban buses. Operators can order a pre-defined Ebusco 2.2 low floor bus with a battery pack of more than 400 kWh through the Consip system. If operators want to deviate from the standardised configuration  they can issue a mini tender to the selected OEMs. The total number of buses rewarded under the suburban lot for the selected group of six suppliers is 250 buses over the next 18 months with a possible extension of 6 months. This framework agreement allows Ebusco to enter the Italian market in an efficient way with the Ebusco 2.2.Peter Bijvelds  CEO of Ebusco comments: ""We are proud and honoured to be selected by Consip and it is clearly a next step to expand our footprint in Europe. With the Ebusco 2.2  we continue to have a modern electric bus with excellent energy consumption performance leading to a competitive Total Cost of Ownership.

The study did not meet the primary endpoint of a sustained platelet count response in chronic ITP patients.Additional analyses of the dataset are ongoing and the full results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and in a peer-reviewed publication.“This is not the outcome we had hoped for patients  but setbacks are part of pioneering a new class of medicines and these data will provide insights into the broader understanding of FcRn and ITP ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “We are very grateful to everyone involved in the ADVANCE-SC study  especially the patients and their families  the investigators  and our internal team who worked tirelessly to complete this global study. We remain committed to the ITP patient community who urgently needs additional treatment options to manage this challenging disease  and continue to move forward in our deeper analysis of these results.“ADVANCE-SC Study DataADVANCE-SC is the second of two registrational trials conducted as part of the ongoing ITP development program for VYVGART and enrolled 207 adult patients with chronic and persistent ITP. Patients were heavily pre-treated and 75% of patients had received three or more prior ITP therapies.Primary endpoint was not met (p=0.5081); 13.7% (17/124) of treated patients demonstrated a sustained platelet count response compared to 16.2% (11/68) of placebo patientsSecondary endpoints were not met  including additional endpoints on International Working Group (IWG) responder status and mean platelet count change from baselineVYVGART Hytrulo was well-tolerated in ADVANCE-SC; the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with ADVANCE-IV and the confirmed safety profile of VYVGART and VYVGART HytruloResults from the first study in the ITP registrational program  ADVANCE-IV  were reported in May 2022. The study met its primary and key platelet-derived secondary endpoints. ADVANCE-IV formed the basis of the regulatory submission for approval of VYVGART IV for ITP in Japan  where a decision is expected in the first quarter of 2024.VYVGART is currently being evaluated in 13 severe autoimmune diseases  including the registrational ADDRESS study for pemphigus from which topline results are expected around year-end 2023.Conference Call Detailsargenx will host a conference call today at 2:30 pm CET (8:30am ET) to discuss the ADVANCE-SC results.

Patients were on a stable dose of at least one ITP treatment prior to randomization and had received at least one prior therapy. Concomitant medications permitted included corticosteroids  nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  fostamatinib or TPO-RAs. The study patients who were on 'watch and wait' at baseline were required to have received at least 2 prior treatments for ITP. ​Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. The primary endpoint was measured by the proportion of patients with chronic ITP with a sustained platelet count response defined as achieving platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50x109/L for at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24. Patients who received rescue therapy at week 12 or later  or for whom dose and/or frequency of concurrent ITP therapies increased at week 12 or later  were considered non-responders. ​Key secondary endpoints included extent of disease control over 24-week treatment period  proportion of overall population with sustained platelet count response  an extended primary endpoint analysis between weeks 17 and 24  and the incidence and severity of WHO-classified bleeding events.About Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies destroy platelets and reduce platelet production  which can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising. In rare cases  ITP can lead to severe anemia and life threatening gastrointestinal or intracranial hemorrhages. ITP is also associated with debilitating fatigue and significant impacts on mental health  including anxiety  fear and depression. Many ITP patients are inadequately controlled on current therapies so a significant unmet need exists for additional treatment options.About VYVGART HytruloVYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART®  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVGART Hytrulo results in the reduction of circulating IgG.VYVGART Hytrulo is the proprietary name in the U.S. for subcutaneous efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20. It is marketed in Europe as VYVGART and may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

Photograph: Alan BetsonDavy chief executive Bernard Byrne told staff on Tuesday he plans to quit next year after half a decade with the stockbroking and wealth-management firm  having stepped up in 2021 to take charge of the business and oversee its sale to Bank of Ireland in the wake of a Central Bank fine.Mr Byrne (55) joined Davy as head of its capital markets division in May 2019  having previously served as chief executive of AIB.He took up the interim role at Davy in March 2021 after chief executive Brian McKiernan  deputy chairman Kyran McLaughlin and head of bonds Barry Nangle resigned their positions in the country’s largest stockbroking firm amid the fallout from a €4.1 million Central Bank fine over a controversial bond trade in 2014.Mr Byrne was confirmed as chief executive early last year  months before the €427 million Bank of Ireland deal was completed.READ MORE“Post the successful integration of Davy under Bank of Ireland ownership  continuing strong momentum and a positive outlook  next year feels like the right time for a leadership transition to drive the next phase of growth for Davy and its clients ” said Mr Byrne.“The Davy team is now over 900 strong  still growing and motivated to deliver for clients.

The volumes sold during the second half of 2023 increased by +52% compared with the first half of 2023  but still remain about half of what was observed during the last peak semester in 2021  prior to this market segment’s collapseGross profit per vehicle sold (GPU) of €2 161  still well above the Group’s peers and displaying an improvement compared with FY 2022 (€2 142)  despite the dilutive impact of acquisitions in Austria and Italy. Restated for these acquisitions  the GPU stands at €2 267  up +5.8% from 2022Adjusted EBITDA of €9.6 million  in positive territory in line with the Group’s commitments. Excluding acquisitions in Austria and Italy  it amounts to €13.2 million  compared with -€10.7 million in FY 2022Net result of -€32.3 million  reflecting a significant improvement compared with FY 2022 (-€60.2 million)Net debt of €82.3 million  showing a significant reduction of -€27.8 million compared withMarch 31  2023. Positive cash generation of €3.9 million in FY 2023  before factoring in cash outflows relating to the companies acquired. On September 30  2023  the Group also had €173 million of undrawn credit lines without conditions2024 full-year guidance: at a constant perimeter  the volumes of B2C vehicles sold by Aramis Group will exceed the milestone of 100 000 units  and the Group’s adjusted EBITDA will be at least twice as high as that achieved in 2023Nicolas Chartier and Guillaume Paoli  co-founders3 of Aramis Group:“Aramis Group maintained its strategic course in 2023 and achieved its objectives  generating profitable and sustainable growth. The Group once again demonstrated its outstanding adaptability: faced with a further deteriorating and demanding market  our teams showed a high level of responsiveness  ensuring our customers received quality vehicles at the best prices throughout the year. The beginning of the year was still affected by a shortage of supply  particularly a very low availability of pre-registered cars. The situation gradually improved over 2023  with vehicle prices and supply conditions that slowly eased (notably  the pre-registered vehicle segment began to normalize)  allowing for an improvement in our offering and our margins. Coupled with cost discipline and active inventory management  we were able to return to profitability and cash generation  before considering the outflows relating to the acquisition of other companies.Aramis Group operates at the heart of the circular economy; we are convinced that we can deliver sustainable growth in the short  medium  and long term. While the used car market will remain uncertain for several more quarters  the start of our 2024 fiscal year is in line with the positive trend observed in recent months  and we approach it with confidence. We are convinced that our competitive advantages will be unique assets to further consolidate our leadership this year  and allow us to achieve our ambition of becoming the preferred platform for Europeans willing to buy a used car online.”MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN 2023In 2023  Aramis Group continued the implementation of its strategy  despite a still volatile market context.The year was marked primarily by the Group’s continued geographic expansion in European countries with strong potential  in line with the second pillar from its growth strategy. Illustrating this  Aramis Group acquired Onlinecars  the market leader for used car sales in Austria  and Brumbrum  Italy’s only fully online distributor of used vehicles  following Cazoo's exit from Continental Europe. Extensive work was carried out in 2023 to integrate these new subsidiaries  leading to a major reduction in the level of inventory held by Onlinecars (c.-€17 million at end-September 2023 compared with at the time of the acquisition)  in addition to gradually relaunching the activities and rationalizing the organization of Brumbrum  which expects to see strong sales growth in 2024.Alongside this  in February 2023  Aramis Group inaugurated a second refurbishing center in the UK. Located in Hull  Yorkshire  this center will significantly increase the refurbishing capacity in place in this country  while delivering productivity and efficiency gains for vehicle processing.In several countries  the Group’s teams have also adapted their industrial processes to changes in their local market. For instance  Clicars  Aramis Group’s Spanish subsidiary  following six years of exponential growth  launched an optimization of several of its industrial flows. First of all  at its Villaverde refurbishing center (south of Madrid)  to adapt its production methods in line with the diversification of the vehicle types to be refurbished (increase in the proportion of vehicles purchased from private owners) and to further gain productivity to continue fueling its growth. Then  in its logistics and customer approach  with two customer centers opened in addition to the longstanding Villaverde hub: one in Saragossa (2 000 sq.m of showroom space  opened in October 2023) and another in Valencia (upcoming).Finally  Aramis Group recently announced two in-house promotions that will contribute to the continuation of its profitable growth trajectory and the achievement of its ambition to become the preferred platform for Europeans for buying a used car online. Fabien Geerolf  previously CFO of Aramisauto  Aramis Group’s French subsidiary  who has developed his expertise in a challenging environment over the last two years  was appointed as the Group’s Chief Financial Officer. Ivan Velasco  previously CTO of Clicars  who was instrumental in developing all of the brand's technological tools and played a key role in establishing its leadership in the online sale of used vehicles in Spain  was appointed as the Group’s Chief Technology Officer.2023 FULL-YEAR ACTIVITYFor the year ended September 30  2023  the Group recorded €1 944.8 million of revenues  up +9.9% from 2022 on a reported basis and +0.7% excluding the acquisitions in Austria and Italy. Despite the deterioration in the market  Aramis Group was able to maintain a positive trend for its B2C vehicle sales  capitalizing on the competitive advantages generated by its unique and vertically integrated business model.Overview of volumes and revenues2023 full-year B2C volumesIn units Reported basis FY 2023 FY 2022 Change (%) Refurbished cars 78 441 69 384 +13.1% Pre-registered cars 13 622 12 347 +10.3% Total B2C volumes 92 063 81 731 +12.6%2023 full-year revenuesBy segmentIn million of euros Reported basis FY 2023 FY 2022 Change (%) Refurbished cars 1 391.7 1 215.0 +14.5% Pre-registered cars 244.1 245.3 -0.5% Total B2C 1 635.8 1 460.3 +12.0% Total B2B 205.3 217.9 -5.8% Total services 103.7 90.7 +14.4% Revenues 1 944.8 1 768.9 +9.9%By countryIn million of euros Reported basis FY 2023 FY 2022 Change (%) France 802.2 725.7 +10.5% Belgium 249.3 240.8 +3.5% Spain 340.1 369.5 -8.0% United Kingdom 390.5 432.8 -9.8% Austria 147.6 - - Italy 15.2 - - Revenues 1 944.8 1 768.9 +9.9%Analysis of the change in volumes and revenuesB2C – sales of cars to private customers (84% of revenues)Revenues for the B2C segment – corresponding to sales of refurbished and pre-registered cars to private customers – climbed to €1 635.8 million in 2023  up +12.0% from 2022. For the 2022 scope  i.e. excluding the acquisitions in Austria and Italy  B2C segment revenues show a +1.9% increase.Revenues for the refurbished cars segment totaled €1 391.7 million  up +14.5% from 2022 on a reported basis and +2.4% for the 2022 scope. In total  78 441 vehicles were delivered in 2023  up +13.1% from 2022  with +1.2% excluding the acquisitions in Austria and Italy. Although it focused more on profitability and inventory rotation in 2023  Aramis Group maintained its trend for positive growth and outperformed the market for less than eight years old used vehicles4  which contracted by -5.3%5 over the same period  on average across the Group’s six geographies.This performance reflects the Group’s effective management of the various key success factors for the business of buying and selling used vehicles online. Thanks to its knowledge of local consumers and the sourcing network that it has successfully built up over the years across Europe  Aramis Group has developed an outstanding ability to identify and offer models that are aligned with its customers’ needs. In addition  its pricing is always competitive in relation to the quality of the products and services offered  thanks in particular to its industrial-scale vehicle refurbishing capabilities.Revenues for the pre-registered cars segment6 came to €244.1 million  with a slight contraction of-0.5% versus 2022. This performance reflects negative price and mix effects  masking the gradual upturn in volumes for this business line over the months. In total  13 622 units were delivered over the full year in 2023  up +10.3%. Volumes for the second half of 2023 came in +82% higher than the second half of 2022 and +52% higher than the first half of 2023  confirming the reacceleration on the pre-registered vehicle market. In comparison  volumes for the first half of 2023 were down -31% versus the first half of 2022. Despite this significant improvement  the volumes of pre-registered vehicles sold by Aramis Group during the second half of 2023 were still around half the level from the previous half-year performance peak  recorded in 2020 prior to this market segment’s collapse.B2B – sales of cars to professional customers (11% of revenues)Revenues for the B2B segment came to €205.3 million in 2023  down -5.8% from 2022. This activity’s development reflects the pricing trends on the market and the sourcing of vehicles from private owners  some of which are resold to professionals (mainly vehicles over eight years old or 150 000 km). As the origins for sourcing used vehicles for refurbishing rebalanced in 2023  with 52% purchased from private owners and 48% from professionals  compared with 57% and 43% respectively in 2022  the change in B2B revenues is logical.Services (5% of revenues)Services generated €103.7 million of revenues in 2023  up +14.4% compared with 2022. The average penetration rate for financing solutions over the year was 46%  compared with 49% in 2022  with this slight dip linked to the dilutive impact of the new companies acquired in Austria and Italy  whose average penetration rate for financing solutions is significantly lower than the companies from the 2022 scope. On a constant perimeter  it stands at 49%  stable compared with 2022.Geographically  the +10.5% revenue growth in France to €802.2 million benefited from the marked upturn in pre-registered vehicle sales  as well as the solid performance for refurbished vehicle sales  despite the potential trade-offs made by consumers between these two types of vehicles. The total volume of B2C vehicle sales is up c.+14% compared with 2022  in a market7 that is down c.-10%. The price and mix effects had a negative impact of c.-2% on revenues from vehicles sold to private owners over the period.The -9.8% fall in UK revenues to €390.5 million is linked to a c.-3% drop in the volume of B2C vehicle sales for CarSupermarket  Aramis Group’s subsidiary in this country  in a market7 that is down c.-7% compared with 2022. The price and mix effects had a c.-6% impact on revenues from B2C vehicle sales over the period  with CarSupermarket looking to offer its customers products whose ranges  ages and mileage levels make them more accessible.Lastly  the -8.0% drop in revenues in Spain to €340.1 million is linked mainly to Clicars  Aramis Group’s subsidiary in this country  adjusting the production methods at its Villaverde refurbishing center  which temporarily impacted its production levels and therefore the number of vehicles offered on its website and its volumes sold.INCOME STATEMENTIn 2023  Aramis Group was able to not only maintain a positive trend for its B2C vehicle sales  but also return to profitability  in line with the commitments set out by the Group. The income statement for the period highlights three key elements: 1/ the good business trends independently from the still challenging market context  2/ the solidity of the gross profit per unit generated on each vehicle sold  highlighting the robustness of the business model  3/ the effective management of overheads  enabling the Group to return to a positive adjusted EBITDA.Condensed income statementIn million of euros Reported basis FY 2023 FY 2022 Change (%) Revenues 1 944.8 1 768.9 +9.9% Gross margin 198.9 175.1 +13.6% Gross profit per B2C vehicle sold - GPU (€) 2 161 2 142 +0.9% Adjusted EBITDA 9.6 (10.7) n.a. Operating income (20.9) (51.8) n.a. Net profit (loss) (32.3) (60.2) n.a.Gross profitThe gross profit for 2023 is up +13.6% from 2022 to €198.9 million. The gross profit per unit generated per B2C vehicle sold (GPU) came to €2 161  representing an improvement from 2022  despite the dilutive impact of the consolidation of the companies acquired in Austria and Italy. Restated for these acquisitions  it represents €2 267  up +5.8% compared with 2022. This GPU is a benchmark for listed operators in Europe  reflecting Aramis Group’s effective management and expertise across all the links in the value chain  built up since it was founded 22 years ago.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA for 2023 came to €9.6 million  materializing an improvement by more than €20 million compared with 2022. For the 2022 scope  excluding the acquisitions in Austria and Italy  it totaled €13.2 million  with the company acquired in Austria generating a positive adjusted EBITDA of €1.5 million and the company in Italy posting a -€5.1 million loss.Throughout the year  Aramis Group maintained its discipline with the management of its sales  general and administrative costs (SG&A). They totaled €189.3 million in 2023  with a limited increase of +1.9% versus 2022 on a reported basis and a marked reduction of -4.9% for the 2022 scope  despite the higher volumes recorded over the period  which increased the variable component.Within this amount  marketing costs represent €31.1 million  down -20.3% from 2022  following Aramis Group’s decision to adapt its brand building and traffic acquisition strategy to the market environment. Personnel expenses recognized in SG&A totaled €97.5 million  up +13.3% from 2022  primarily reflecting the impact of the integration of the new subsidiaries. Vehicle delivery costs totaled €27.4 million  down-9.4% despite the increase in the volumes sold  as the Group rationalized some of its logistics flows. Lastly  other SG&A  which include overheads and head office costs  represent €33.3 million  up +9.5% compared with 2022  once again linked mainly to the impact of the integration of the new subsidiaries.Operating incomeOperating income for 2023 totaled -€20.9 million  compared with -€51.8 million in 2022. This amount includes -€10.0 million of personnel expenses relating to acquisitions  -€1.0 million of personnel expenses linked to share-based payments  -€2.1 million of transaction-related costs  and -€31.5 million of depreciation charges. It also includes restructuring costs for -€1.3 million  as well as a fair value surplus (badwill) of +€15.4 million  reflecting Brumbrum’s acquisition for a symbolic price.Net profit (loss)The net loss for 2023 came to -€32.3 million  compared with -€60.2 million in 2022  with the Group nearly halving its losses. It factors in -€11.4 million of financial income and expenses  including -€5.8 million for the cost of net financial debt  -€4.1 million of financial expenses on lease liabilities (IFRS 16)  and -€1.5 million of other net financial expenses linked mainly to the cancellation of a local credit line in connection with Brumbrum’s integration.CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL STRUCTUREIn addition to the Group’s return to a positive adjusted EBITDA  FY 2023 was also characterized by a return to positive cash generation before factoring in cash outflows relating to the acquisitions of companies. This performance was achieved thanks in particular to the Group’s strong focus on inventory management and therefore the effective management of operating working capital requirements.Inventory and operating working capital requirementsIn million of euros Reported basis Sep 30  2023 Sep 30  2022 Change (€mn) Inventories 220.3 184.8 +35.5 Trade receivables 39.0 36.1 +2.8 Other current assets (excl. non-operational items) 30.1 27.6 +2.5 Trade payables 78.3 50.2 +28.1 Other current liabilities (excl. non-operational items) 44.2 46.3 -2.1 Other items 2.6 2.3 +0.3 Operating working capital requirements 164.4 149.8 +14.6 Non-cash effect of changes in the scope of consolidation (46.5) - - Operating working capital requirements cash effect 117.8 149.8 -32.0Inventory represented €220.3 million on September 30  2023. The €35.5 million increase compared with September 30  2022  is linked to the inclusion of the new subsidiaries in Aramis Group’s basis for consolidation  while inventory levels for the 2022 scope show a slight decrease. The Group has carried out extensive work to rationalize the inventory of Onlinecars  the company acquired at the start of FY 2023 in Austria  reducing local vehicle stock levels by around €17 million. In all its other subsidiaries  Aramis Group has also worked to keep its inventory at levels that are effectively in line with demand and ensure the level of its gross profit per unit (GPU).The impact of the scope effects on operating working capital requirements represents €46.5 million. The cash impact of the change in operating working capital requirements over the period corresponds to €32.0 million of cash generation.

(""CoolCo"" or the ""Company"").This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231127928743/en/Q3 Highlights and Subsequent EventsGenerated total operating revenues of $92.9 million in Q3  compared to $90.3 million for the second quarter of 2023 (""Q2"" or ""Q2 2023"");Net income of $39.2 1 million in Q3  compared to $44.6 1 million for Q2  decrease was primarily due to lower unrealized mark-to-market gains on our interest rate swaps;million in Q3  compared to $44.6 million for Q2  decrease was primarily due to lower unrealized mark-to-market gains on our interest rate swaps; Achieved average Time Charter Equivalent Earnings (""TCE"") 2 of $82 400 per day for Q3  compared to $81 100 per day for Q2;of $82 400 per day for Q3  compared to $81 100 per day for Q2; Adjusted EBITDA 2 of $62.8 million for Q3  compared to $59.9 million for Q2;of $62.8 million for Q3  compared to $59.9 million for Q2; Subsequent to the Quarter  the Company announced that it had entered into sale and leaseback financing arrangements (the “Sale and Leasebacks”) with Huaxia Financial Leasing Co. Ltd for the two state-of-the-art MEGA LNG carriers (the ""Newbuilds"");Declared a dividend for Q3 of $0.41 per share  to be paid to shareholders of record on December 7  2023.Richard Tyrrell  CEO  commented:""In the third quarter  we benefited from strong operational performance  a seasonal uplift on our variable rate contract and the fleet’s fixed-rate  medium- and long-term charter coverage. Additionally  we took measured exposure to the charter market in the form of one vessel that we chose to deploy directly in the spot market while waiting for the right term opportunity. The net result was a sequentially higher TCE level at $82 400 per day. While not currently reaching the levels seen in the months following the Russian invasion of Ukraine  rates in the early fourth quarter have settled in at levels above historic norms for both the industry and for the CoolCo fleet. This provides us upside on legacy contracts as they renew and scope to maintain TCE performance.""During the second half of 2023  newbuild deliveries have been limited and overall fleet supply has remained well-balanced against demand. The last two newbuilds in the market from independent owners that deliver ahead of CoolCo’s 2024 deliveries have now secured long-term employment  positioning our Newbuilds as both the next in line and some of the only uncommitted newbuilds currently available before 2026. Newbuild pricing has remained elevated relative to historical levels at approximately $260 million per vessel  which along with the current interest rate environment is providing significant support to the long-term charter rates available for newbuilds while also discouraging incremental newbuild orders. Moving forward  a continued strength in gas prices and tightening regulations are expected to put increasing pressure on the large number of remaining steam turbine vessels in the market  likely resulting in heavy scrapping in the coming years.""As the weather begins to turn colder in the Northern Hemisphere  seasonal support for LNG Carrier demand typically ratchets up. We have thus far seen only limited term chartering activity ahead of the 2023/24 winter market  but with the continued absence of Europe’s traditional supply backstop from Russian pipeline gas and few vessels currently employed as floating storage  the potential for weather events to produce volatility  and thus demand for LNG carriers  is heightened. Ultimately  energy security remains a top priority for many LNG importing nations  and we expect European demand to remain strong and Asian demand to continue its recovery. In the meantime  CoolCo is financially well positioned with $1.5 billion of contracted revenue backlog as of quarter end and built-in near-term earnings growth from its fully financed Newbuilds. We plan to maintain a patient  long-term perspective in our vessel chartering decisions intended to provide attractive returns and well-supported dividends for our shareholders.”Financial HighlightsThe table below sets forth certain key financial information for Q3 2023  Q2 2023  9M 2023 and the nine month period ended September 30  2022 (""9M 2022"")  split between Successor and Predecessor periods  as defined below.Q3 2023 Q2 2023 9M 2023 9M 2022 (in thousands of $  except TCE) Successor Successor Successor Successor Predecessor Total Time and voyage charter revenues 84 523 82 071 257 761 104 535 37 289 141 824 Total operating revenues 92 901 90 316 281 864 122 723 43 456 166 179 Operating income 48 336 45 484 145 844 62 055 27 728 89 783 Net income 1 39 170 44 646 153 952 54 431 23 244 77 675 Adjusted EBITDA2 62 754 59 894 190 466 75 964 33 473 109 437 Average daily TCE2(to the closest $100) 82 400 81 100 82 400 66 500 57 100 63 800Note: As noted previously  the commencement of operations and funding of CoolCo and the acquisition of its initial tri-fuel diesel electric (""TFDE"") LNG carriers  The Cool Pool Limited and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited (""Golar"") were completed in a phased process. It commenced with the funding of CoolCo on January 27  2022 and concluded with the acquisition of the LNG carrier and FSRU management organization on June 30  2022  with vessel acquisitions taking place on different dates over that period. Results for the nine months that commenced January 1  2022 and ended September 30  2022 have therefore been split between the period prior to the funding of CoolCo and various phased acquisitions of vessel and management entities (the ""Predecessor"" period) and the period subsequent to the various phased acquisitions (the ""Successor"" period). The combined results are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and consist of the aggregate of selected financial data of the Successor and Predecessor periods. No other adjustments have been made to the combined presentation. We cannot adequately benchmark the operating results for the nine month period ended September 30  2023 against the previous period reported in our comparative unaudited financial information without combining the applicable Successor and Predecessor periods and do not believe that reviewing the results of the periods in isolation would be useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding our overall operating performance.LNG Market ReviewThe average Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") for the Quarter was $11.81/MMBtu compared to $11.06/MMBtu for Q2 2023. The Quarter commenced with Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $10.91/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $69 250 per day. The Quarter concluded with TTF at $12.61/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $188 750 per day. The TFDE headline spot rate has subsequently fallen to $167 500 per day  however  achieving this rate is very much dependent on vessel position given market illiquidity.Coming out of the seasonally quieter summer months in the northern hemisphere  the LNG carrier market has continued to be characterized by a relative lack of chartering liquidity. Both trading opportunities that rely on LNG carriers for floating storage capacity and periods of West-East arbitrage have been limited. Despite European gas storage reaching full capacity  concerns about security of supply have supported gas prices  leading to LNG being regasified rather than held in floating storage.With Russian pipeline gas still off limits to the majority of Europe  importers have a limited buffer to the risk of natural gas demand spikes during winter weather events. In this context  exacerbated by LNG carrier positioning and recent constraints in the Panama Canal  there is an increased potential for volatility  regional arbitrage  and atypical trading and chartering activity if importers find themselves facing a gas shortage.The ultimate outcome of the upcoming winter market is yet to be seen  but volatility in the LNG market is likely to be a significant feature in the coming months and years. This is especially true as more destination-flexible volumes enter the market  and energy traders play an increasingly prominent role.Operational ReviewCoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with a Q3 fleet utilization of 97.3% with the remaining covered by a ballast bonus  compared to 100% for the first half of the 2023. There are no drydocks planned for 2023  with the next drydock expected during the second quarter of 2024.Subsequent to the Quarter  a ship management services customer has decided to transfer up to nine vessels for which CoolCo currently provides technical management to managers that solely provide ship management services over the course of 2024. This is not expected to materially impact CoolCo's earnings and we expect to incur some immaterial restructuring costs to adjust our operations in light of this change.Business DevelopmentOn June 28  2023  the Company announced that it had exercised its option to acquire the Newbuilds  Kool Tiger and Kool Panther from affiliates of EPS Ventures Ltd. (“EPS”). The Newbuilds are scheduled to be delivered from Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries (""HHI"") in Korea in September and December of 2024. The two Newbuilds have been acquired for an amount of approximately $234 million per vessel. The initial option exercise price was $56.9 million per vessel  resulting in a total of $113.8 million paid to EPS on July 3  2023.In October 2023  the Company announced that it had entered into Sale and Leasebacks for the Newbuilds with Huaxia Financial Leasing Co. Ltd. The Sale and Leasebacks are on a fixed rate per day basis for 10 years  with extension options  an implied fixed interest rate just under 6% and a minimum loan-to-value of 80%  with potential for additional capacity contingent upon the terms of the charter employment that the Company anticipates securing in advance of the Newbuilds' deliveries. The Sale and Leaseback financing also offers pre-delivery financing of the Newbuilds.CoolCo continues to be in discussions with multiple potential charterers seeking employment for the Newbuilds.Financing and LiquidityIn July 2023  the Company announced that the syndicate of existing lenders in the $570 million bank facility approved a reduction of the interest rate margin from 225 basis points to 220 basis points after the Company achieved the sustainability criteria outlined in the loan agreement.As of September 30  2023  CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $152.2 million and total short and long-term debt  net of deferred finance charges  amounted to $1 045.3 million. Total Contractual Debt1 stood at $1 161.4 million  which comprised of $494.8 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027  $481.3 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility  maturing in May 2029  and $185.3 million in respect of the two sale and leaseback facilities maturing in the first quarter of 2025 (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin).Overall  the Company’s interest rate on its debt is fixed or hedged for approximately 85% of the notional amount of debt  adjusting for existing cash on hand.Corporate and Other MattersAs of September 30  2023  CoolCo had 53 688 462 shares issued and outstanding. Of these  31 254 390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22 434 072 (41.8%) were publicly owned.In line with the Company’s variable dividend policy  the Board has declared a Q3 dividend of $0.41 per ordinary share. The record date is December 7  2023 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around December 15  2023  while due to the implementation of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway  the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or around December 20  2023.OutlookSince the end of the Quarter  TTF has increased to $14.51/MMBtu and TFDE spot rates have increased to $167 500 per day.In the coming years  the global supply of LNG is set to increase by more than 50% based on projects that have already reached Final Investment Decision (""FID""). At least 40 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of capacity have reached FID in 2023 alone  equivalent to approximately 10% of total LNG production in 2022. To understand the current 51% orderbook-to-fleet ratio (by volume)  it is critical to recognize that the orderbook has overwhelmingly been built based on long-term contracts to service new liquefaction facilities. The timing and quantity of their deliveries are intended to match the commencement of new production. Furthermore  to the extent that project development delays result in vessels delivering to their charterers before their intended startup time  we would expect to see a dynamic similar to that which has recently prevailed. In such a scenario  the market is sharply divided between charterers seeking to fill interim periods in the spot market and owners such as CoolCo  who are in a position to offer multi-year time charters. Numerous liquefaction projects are still under development in North America  the Middle East  and various other geographies. This supply is expected to meet gas demand arising from the continued strong and widespread desire to decarbonize both through complementing renewables with gas and gas substituting for the vast amounts of coal still being consumed.Among LNG carriers currently on the water  the older  less efficient vessels in the charter market are expected to face growing competitive pressure over time  particularly among the steam turbine vessels that continue to make up over 30% of the global fleet by volume. The imposition of the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) carbon intensity indicator (CII) rules from the beginning of this year  as well as forthcoming European carbon pricing set to come into effect next year  are set to increase the relative advantage of modern  efficient TFDE and 2-stroke tonnage  such as those in the CoolCo fleet.The limited supply of modern vessels available for time charter employment through the medium-term is concentrated among a small number of owners  including CoolCo. Given the improved bargaining position afforded by a combination of scarcity and concentration  such owners have remained focused primarily on longer-term charters that would bridge the period from now until the next wave of LNG supply is expected to arrive in 2026-2027. A newbuild vessel ordered today would have a lead time of approximately four years and a purchase price exceeding $260 million  limiting the likelihood of unforeseen newbuild tonnage during that period while providing support for the rate benchmark against which the overall fleet is priced.1 Net income includes mark-to market gain on interest rate swaps amounting to $9.7 million for Q3 2023  $16.7 million for Q2 2023 and $20.4 million for 9M 2023. 2 Refer to 'Appendix A' - Non-GAAP financial measures and definitions  for definitions of these measures and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release and any other written or oral statements made by us in connection with this press release include forward-looking statements.

On January 26  2022  CoolCo entered into various agreements (the ""Vessel SPA"") with Golar  as amended on February 25  2022  pursuant to which CoolCo acquired all of the outstanding shares of nine of Golar’s wholly-owned subsidiaries on various dates in March and April 2022. Eight of these entities were each the registered or disponent owner or lessee of the following modern LNG carriers: Crystal  Ice  Bear  Frost  Glacier  Snow  Kelvin and Seal (disposed subsequently). The Cool Pool Limited was the entity responsible for the marketing of these LNG carriers. For CoolCo  for the three and nine month periods ended September 30  2022  the successor period reflects the period beginning from January 27  2022 with the closing of CoolCo’s Norwegian equity raise and the date CoolCo operations substantially commenced and were considered meaningful. Vessel SPA acquisition dates were staggered reflecting results  as the successor  from the date CoolCo obtained control of the respective vessel entities. (2) Predecessor period includes results derived from the carve-out of historical operations from Golar entities acquired by CoolCo as part of the Vessel SPA and ManCo SPA until the day before the

addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP)  this earnings release and the associated investor presentation and discussion contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures which are included in the table below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business  enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance  and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP  and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are not uniformly defined by all companies  and may not be comparable with similar titles  measures and disclosures used by other companies. The reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.Non-GAAP measure Closest equivalentUS GAAP measure Adjustments to reconcile toprimary financial statementsprepared under US GAAP Rationale for adjustments Performance Measures Adjusted EBITDA Net income '+/- Other non-operating income +/- Net financial expense  representing: Interest income  Interest expense  Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments and Other financial items  net +/- Income taxes  net + Depreciation and amortization - Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities - charter agreements  net Increases the comparability of total business performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies by removing the impact of other non-operating income  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and liabilities -charter agreements  net  financing and tax items.

Liquidity measures Total Contractual Debt Total debt (current and non-current)  net of deferred finance charges + VIE Consolidation and fair value adjustments upon acquisition + Deferred Finance Charges We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities (for the vessels Ice and Kelvin). This means that on consolidation  our contractual debt is eliminated and replaced with the Lessor VIEs’ debt. Contractual debt represents our actual debt obligations under our various financing arrangements before consolidating the Lessor VIEs. The measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and the split of our debt (current and non-current) based on our underlying contractual obligations. Total Company Cash CoolCo cash based on GAAP measures: + Cash and cash equivalents + Restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) - VIE restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) We consolidate lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities. This means that on consolidation  we include restricted cash held by the lessor VIEs. Total Company Cash represents our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) before consolidating the lessor VIEs. Management believes that this measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and aids comparability with our competitors.Reconciliations - Performance Measures Adjusted EBITDA For the three months ended Jul-Sep2023 Apr-Jun2023 Jul-Sep2022 (in thousands of $) Successor(Consolidated) Successor(Consolidated) Successor(Consolidated) Net income 39 170 44 646 36 772 Other non-operating income — (21 ) Interest income (2 176 ) (2 791 ) (330 ) Interest expense 20 379 19 863 8 500 Gains on derivative instruments (9 689 ) (16 705 ) (9 527 ) Other financial items  net 605 414 868 Income taxes  net 47 78 141 Depreciation and amortization 18 936 18 898 13 447 Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities - charter agreements  net (4 518 ) (4 488 ) (7 434 ) Adjusted EBITDA 62 754 59 894 42 437For the nine months ended Jan-Sep2023 Jan-Sep2022 (in thousands of $) Successor(Consolidated) Successor(Consolidated)1 Predecessor(CombinedCarve-out)2 Net income 153 952 54 431 23 244 Other non-operating income (42 549 ) — — Interest income (6 484 ) (389 ) (4 ) Interest expense 59 727 15 172 4 725 Gains on derivative instruments (20 393 ) (9 527 ) — Other financial items  net 1 411 2 227 (622 ) Income taxes  net 180 141 385 Depreciation and amortization 57 732 28 413 5 745 Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities - charter agreements  net (13 110 ) (14 504 ) — Adjusted EBITDA 190 466 75 964 33 473Average daily TCEFor the three months ended Jul-Sep2023 Apr-Jun2023 Jul-Sep2022 (in thousands of $  except number of days and average daily TCE) Successor(Consolidated) Successor(Consolidated) Successor(Consolidated) Time and voyage charter revenues 84 523 82 071 54 713 Voyage  charter hire and commission expenses  net (1 137 ) (877 ) (855 ) 83 386 81 194 53 858 Calendar days less scheduled off-hire days 1 012 1 001 736 Average daily TCE (to the closest $100) $ 82 400 $ 81 100 $ 73 200For the nine months ended Jan-Sep2023 Jan-Sep2022 (in thousands of $  except number of days and average daily TCE) Successor(Consolidated) Successor(Consolidated)1 Predecessor(CombinedCarve-out)2 Time and voyage charter revenues 257 761 104 535 37 289 Voyage  charter hire and commission expenses  net (3 512 ) (1 212 ) (1 229 ) 254 249 103 323 36 060 Calendar days less scheduled off-hire days 3 084 1 553 631 Average daily TCE (to the closest $100) $ 82 400 $ 66 500 $ 57 100(1) The commencement of operations and funding of CoolCo and the acquisition of its initial TFDE LNG carriers  The Cool Pool Limited and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited (""Golar"") was completed in a phased process. On January 26  2022  CoolCo entered into various agreements (the ""Vessel SPA"") with Golar  as amended on February 25  2022  pursuant to which CoolCo acquired all of the outstanding shares of nine of Golar’s wholly-owned subsidiaries on various dates in March and April 2022. Eight of these entities are each the registered or disponent owner or lessee of the following modern LNG carriers: Crystal  Ice  Bear  Frost  Glacier  Snow  Kelvin and Seal (disposed subsequently). The Cool Pool Limited was the entity responsible for the marketing of these LNG carriers. For CoolCo  for the three and six month periods ended June 30  2022  the successor period reflects the period beginning from January 27  2022 with the closing of CoolCo’s Norwegian equity raise and the date CoolCo operations substantially commenced and were considered meaningful. Vessel SPA acquisition dates were staggered reflecting results  as the successor  from the date CoolCo obtained control of the respective vessel entities. (2) Predecessor period includes results derived from the carve-out of historical operations from Golar entities acquired by CoolCo as part of the Vessel SPA and ManCo SPA until the day before the staggered acquisition date per legal entity during the period beginning from January 1  2022 to June 30  2022.Reconciliations - Liquidity measuresTotal Contractual Debt(in thousands of $) At September 30 2023 At December 31 2022 Total debt (current and non-current) net of deferred finance charges 1 045 338 1 138 302 Add: VIE consolidation and fair value adjustments 109 958 106 829 Add: Deferred finance charges 6 057 6 186 Total Contractual Debt 1 161 353 1 251 317Total Company Cash(in thousands of $) At September 30 2023 At December 31 2022 Cash and cash equivalents 152 179 129 135 Restricted cash and short-term deposits 4 017 3 942 Less: VIE restricted cash (3 549 ) (3 435 ) Total Company Cash 152 647 129 642Other definitionsContracted Revenue BacklogContracted revenue backlog is defined as the contracted daily charter rate for each vessel multiplied by the number of scheduled hire days for the remaining contract term.

These positions continue to demonstrate their credentials as fintech market leaders  growing revenues by an average of over 1 200% since the Company’s investment and are either profitable or capitalised until projected profitability.• Cushon  the workplace pensions and savings provider  completed their majority shareholding acquisition by NatWest Group in June 2023  which delivered a return of 2.1x multiple on invested capital with proceeds of £22.8 million and a 62% IRR.• Tide  the SME business bank  now services 1 in 10 UK small and mid-sized businesses  representing 550 000 UK businesses. Since expanding into India in December 2022  Tide now has more than 150 000 members in the country.• Zopa Bank  the digital-first consumer bank and lender  announced in September 2023 that it had successfully raised £75 million in Tier 2 capital to fuel its continuous growth and rapid expansion. This financing follows £75 million of equity funding raised earlier this year  in which Augmentum participated. Zopa Bank now serves 1 million customers and expects to hit full-year profitability for the first time this year.• Monese  the mobile-only current accounts and banking as a service (BaaS) provider  announced the launch of XYB  an end-to-end ‘coreless’ banking platform provider  in May 2023.• Wematch.live  the capital markets trading platform  surpassed $200 billion in ongoing notional volume of Total Return Swaps on equities in August 2023. Wematch.live also reached an average daily matched volume (ADMV) of $11 billion in EMEA in July 2023.• A number of acquisitions were made across the portfolio  including by Onfido  the global leader in automated identity verification  who acquired Airside  the US-headquartered shareable digital identity technology company and FullCircl  the company intelligence and risk solution provider for frontline teams  who acquired RegTech provider W2 Global Data Solutions.• The Company remains a highly selective investor. Since the start of 2022 it has consciously slowed deployment as the valuation environment has continued to re-rate. During the period  the Company made three follow-on investments  totaling £6.9 million  including £5.3 million into Volt  the account-to-account payment provider  as part of a $60 million Series B round. The Company also took up their pro rata shareholder rights to invest a total of £1.6 million in Grover  the consumer tech subscription platform  and Habito  the digital mortgage broker and direct lender.Notes:1 The Board considers NAV per share after performance fee to be the most appropriate measure of NAV per share attributable to shareholders.2 Annualised IRR on invested capital and realisations since inception using valuations at the last reporting date before performance fee.3 Revenue growth taken as the LTM to September 2023 vs the LTM to September 2022. Any outliers (>250%) have been capped to 250% to improve comparability.Neil England  Chairman of Augmentum Fintech plc  commented:“The Company’s NAV per share after performance fee was 160.2p  a gain of 0.8% over the reporting period. This continues the Company’s unbroken NAV per share increase over every one of the eleven reporting periods since our IPO in 2018  notwithstanding the recent ongoing challenging market conditions.“Whilst the Company’s shares have continued to trade at a discount to NAV  in order to convey to the market the Board’s confidence in the value of the portfolio  and to take advantage of the accretion to shareholders offered by the wide discount  we continued to buy-back shares over the period under review. These shares are held in treasury and may be reissued when the share price returns to a premium.“Our Manager has retained their investment discipline over the last six months and at the end of the reporting period the Company held net free cash of £48 million. The Augmentum model has been proven through five successful realisations to date  and the Company’s track record coupled with the expected reduction in interest rates in 2024 may be the trigger for the re-rating that the Board believes is deserved.”Tim Levene  CEO of Augmentum Fintech Management Limited  commented:“Despite a strong pipeline of opportunities  our bar for investment has remained high and we have retained our uncompromising standards for new investments. We made no additions to our portfolio during the period under review although have invested £6.9 million in three of our existing portfolio companies. Our three largest holdings  Tide  Grover and Zopa  are category defining digital leaders in large and growing markets. They are currently growing at an average of 79% year on year and are either profitable or funded to profitability.”“We continue to apply a rigorous approach to valuations. This can be seen in our five exits to-date  where proceeds have been realised above or on-par with previously reported valuations. In this reporting period Cushon’s acquisition by NatWest Group brought in proceeds of £22.8 million  representing a 2.1 multiple on invested capital and an uplift of 47% on the previous valuation. Our approach to valuation  we believe  sets us apart from many other funds.”“Markets are exhibiting the early signs of a shift in sentiment with interest rates being held steady first in the UK and then in the US. This signals a cautious yet hopeful economic outlook. This  combined with the continual move towards the digitisation of financial services and Augmentum’s disciplined approach to both investment and valuation will  we believe  offer exceptional opportunities for us to deliver a stand-out vintage in 2024 and 2025.”EnquiriesAugmentum Fintech Tim Levene (Portfolio Manager) Georgie Hazell Kivell (Marketing and IR) +44 (0)20 3961 5420 georgie@augmentum.vc Quill PR Nick Croysdill  Sarah Gibbons-Cook (Press and Media) +44 (0)20 7466 5050 press@augmentum.vc Peel Hunt LLP Liz Yong  Luke Simpson  Huw Jeremy (Investment Banking) +44 (0)20 7418 8900 Singer Capital Markets Harry Gooden  Robert Peel  James Fischer (Investment Banking) +44 (0)20 7496 3000 Frostrow Capital LLP Paul Griggs (Company Secretary) +44 (0)20 3709 8733About Augmentum FintechAugmentum invests in fast growing fintech businesses that are disrupting the financial services sector. Augmentum is the UK’s only publicly listed investment company focusing on the fintech sector in the UK and wider Europe  having launched on the main market of the London Stock Exchange in 2018  giving businesses access to patient capital and support  unrestricted by conventional fund timelines and giving public markets investors access to a largely privately held investment sector during its main period of growth..----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Augmentum Fintech plcHalf Year Report for the six months ended30 September 2023.Chairman’s StatementIntroductionThis report covers your Company’s progress in the six months to 30 September 2023 and its financial position at that date.Investment StrategyYour Company invests in early stage European fintech businesses which have technologies that are disruptive to the traditional financial services sectors and/or support the trend to digitalisation and market efficiency. A typical investment will offer the prospect of high growth and the potential to scale. Our objective is to provide long-term capital growth to shareholders by offering them exposure to a diversified portfolio of private fintech companies during their period of rapid growth and value accretion.PerformanceYour Company’s NAV per share after performance fee at 30 September 2023 was 160.2p  a 0.8% gain across the period under review (158.9p as at 31 March 2023). NAV per share has increased in every one of the eleven half year reporting periods since the Company’s IPO in 2018  albeit at a much reduced level during the past year. This lower increase is largely due to valuations being affected by lower sales or earnings multiples in the public market comparators that we use in our valuations  together with some sensible provisions that we have made against those businesses that have faced challenges.The operational performance of the vast majority of our portfolio companies has continued to be strong  with average revenue growth of 74% across the top 10 in the last 12 months. There have been some standout results  in some cases ahead of expectations  and the majority have over 2 years of cash runway. Crucially  our top 5 investments; Tide  Grover  Zopa Bank  Volt and BullionVault  are all growing strongly.Shareholders will note that we have not experienced the NAV write-downs that have been a feature from several other investment companies that focus on venture and early stage private equity. This is testament to our rigorous and disciplined approach to investment selection and valuations. As I have reported previously  as a result of this discipline  we did not write up the value of our investments to the levels that others did when we were in a bull market for fintech. It follows that we have not needed to make major corrections now. This approach is best illustrated by our five realisations  all of which have been at or above their pre-disposal valuation.The world is an uncertain place as I write  and there have been capital flows away from equities into safer havens such as cash and gold. It is expected that equity markets will remain tough in the coming months. High interest rates and uncertainty over future rates have continued to be a major negative factor affecting investment companies that focus on growth. The assumption is that these companies will need cash to fund that growth and that will be expensive and/or difficult to get. Unfortunately  the market is not differentiating between those companies with genuine issues in this regard and those that have no such needs  as is the case with the bulk of our portfolio. The result is that the price at which the shares traded continued to significantly under-represent the NAV throughout the period  ending at 94.0p per share  down 3.0p from the price at 31 March 2023 and representing a discount to the NAV per share after performance fee of 41.3%. When stripping out our cash from the balance sheet  the implied discount on our investment portfolio is around 51%. As at 30 September 2023  the valuation of our top three positions in Tide  Grover  and Zopa Bank  plus cash  was above our market capitalisation  attributing no value to our £125 million of other investments.Portfolio and TransactionsOur portfolio stands at 24 companies  diversified across the main fintech verticals  European markets  and at the various stages that we told our IPO investors that we would build to. Our Top 10 investments represent 82.3% of the portfolio value.In the period  the Company received proceeds of £22.8 million from the completion of NatWest Group’s acquisition of Cushon  significantly ahead of its prior valuation and representing a 2.1x multiple on invested capital.The Company made follow-on investments to support Volt (£5.3 million) and Grover (£1.4 million). No new investments were established during the period  despite the team reviewing many opportunities  illustrating the discipline of our investment model. At the period end  the Company had net free cash of £48 million.The Portfolio Manager’s report  beginning on page 8  includes a detailed review of the portfolio  individual company performance and investment transactions in the period.ValuationsYour Board considers its governance role in the valuations process to be of utmost importance. Together with our advisers we consider and challenge all of the investment valuations used for the full and half year financial statements. We have carefully reviewed both the status and the forecasts of all of the portfolio companies. The valuations have been arrived at using appropriate and consistent methodologies  and we sense check and debate our conclusions on the assets themselves and their market context. Also  we benefit from some of our investments occupying a senior position in the capital structures of these companies  providing some protection against downside risk.Portfolio ManagementWe are active investors with a team that works closely with the companies we invest in  typically taking either a board or an observer seat and working with management to guide strategy consistent with long-term value creation. We have built a balanced portfolio across different fintech sectors and maturity stages and are committed to a responsible and sustainable investment approach  believing that the integration of environmental  social and governance factors helps to mitigate risk.Discount ControlAs reported above  the Company’s shares continued to trade at a discount to NAV during the period under review and up to the date of this report. Buybacks are one of several mechanisms your board actively consider to reduce this discount.To convey to the market our confidence in the value of the portfolio and take advantage of the accretion to shareholders offered by the wide discount we continued to buy back shares in the period under review. All shares purchased by the Company are being held in treasury and will potentially be reissued when the share pricereturns to a premium.3 918 878 shares were bought back into treasury during the six months to 30 September 2023  at an average price of 99.2p per share  representing an average discount to the 31 March 2023 NAV after performance fee of 37.9% and accreting 1.4p per share. A further 366 308 shares have been bought back since September  at an average price of 86.3p per share  representing an average discount to the updated NAV after performance fee as at 30 September 2023 of 46.2%.The use of our cash reserves is a matter of regular Board review. We aim to balance the benefits of highly accretive buybacks when discounts are high against ensuring that we hold appropriate reserves to fund follow on investments and capture the best of the new investment opportunities that we continue to see.OutlookInflation and interest rates remain elevated and early stage growth portfolios continue to be out of favour. However  the need to digitalise and transform last century’s infrastructure remains  as nearly all financial services sectors continue to be dominated by traditional businesses whose operations cannot ignore the rapid development of less costly  and in many cases more secure  business models.Augmentum has proved its model through the successful realisations to date and we are confident in the promise that our current investments offer.Several commentators have highlighted the potential value in the Augmentum portfolio  but as yet  this has not produced the re-rating that your Board believe is deserved. A reduction in interest rates could be the trigger for this. UK inflation appears to have peaked and this may produce a base rate reduction as early as Q2 2024.The current share price does not reflect the tangible value creation we have seen across our top 10 investments and their potential for further growth. This leads your Board to continue to expect that the patient shareholder will be well rewarded.Neil EnglandChairman27 November 2023.Investment Objective and PolicyInvestment objectiveThe Company’s investment objective is to generate capital growth over the long term through investment in a focused portfolio of fast growing and/or high potential private financial services technology (“fintech”) businesses based predominantly in the UK and wider Europe.Investment policyIn order to achieve its investment objective  the Company invests in early or later stage investments in unquoted fintech businesses. The Company intends to realise value through exiting these investments over time.The Company seeks exposure to early stage businesses which are high growth  with scalable opportunities  and have disruptive technologies in the banking  insurance and wealth and asset management sectors as well as those that provide services to underpin the financial sector and other cross-industry propositions.Investments are expected to be mainly in the form of equity and equity-related instruments issued by portfolio companies  although investments may be made by way of convertible debt instruments. The Company intends to invest in unquoted companies and will ensure that the Company has suitable investor protection rights where appropriate. The Company may also invest in partnerships  limited liability partnerships and other legal forms of entity. The Company will not invest in publicly traded companies. However  portfolio companies may seek initial public offerings from time to time  in which case the Company may continue to hold such investments without restriction.The Company may acquire investments directly or by way of holdings in special purpose vehicles or intermediate holding entities (such as the Partnership*).The Management Team has historically taken a board or board observer position on investee companies and  where in the best interests of the Company  will do so in relation to future investee companies.The Company’s portfolio is expected to be diversified across a number of geographical areas predominantly within the UK and wider Europe  and the Company will at all times invest and manage the portfolio in a manner consistent with spreading investment risk.The Management Team will actively manage the portfolio to maximise returns  including helping to scale the team  refining and driving key performance indicators  stimulating growth  and positively influencing future financing and exits.Investment restrictionsThe Company will invest and manage its assets with the object of spreading risk through the following investment restrictions:• the value of no single investment (including related investments in group entities or related parties) will represent more than 15% of NAV  save that one investment in the portfolio may represent up to 20% of NAV;• the aggregate value of seed stage investments will represent no more than 1% of NAV; and• at least 80% of NAV will be invested in businesses which are headquartered in or have their main centre of business in the UK or wider Europe.In addition  the Company will itself not invest more than 15% of its gross assets in other investment companies or investment trusts which are listed on the Official List of the FCA.Each of the restrictions above will be calculated at the time of investment and disregard the effect of the receipt of rights  bonuses  benefits in the nature of capital or by reason of any other action affecting every holder of that investment. The Company will not be required to dispose of any investment or to rebalance the portfolio as a result of a change in the respective valuations of its assets.Hedging and derivativesSave for investments made using equity-related instruments as described above  the Company will not employ derivatives of any kind for investment purposes. Derivatives may be used for currency hedging purposes.Borrowing policyThe Company may  from time to time  use borrowings to manage its working capital requirements but shall not borrow for investment purposes. Borrowings will not exceed 10 per cent. of the Company’s Net Asset Value  calculated at the time of borrowing.Cash managementThe Company may hold cash on deposit and may invest in cash equivalent investments  which may include short-term investments in money market type funds and tradeable debt securities.There is no restriction on the amount of cash or cash equivalent investments that the Company may hold or where it is held. The Board has agreed prudent cash management guidelines with the AIFM and the Portfolio Manager to ensure an appropriate risk/return profile is maintained. Cash and cash equivalents are held with approved counterparties.It is expected that the Company will hold between 5% and 15% of its Gross Assets in cash or cash equivalent investments  for the purpose of making follow-on investments in accordance with the Company’s investment policy and to manage the working capital requirements of the Company.Changes to the investment policyNo material change will be made to the investment policy without the approval of Shareholders by ordinary resolution. Non-material changes to the investment policy may be approved by the Board. In the event of a breach of the investment policy set out above or the investment and gearing restrictions set out therein  the Management Team shall inform the AIFM and the Board upon becoming aware of the same and if the AIFM and/or the Board considers the breach to be material  notification will be made to a Regulatory Information Service.* Please refer to the Glossary on page 43..Portfolioas at 30 September 2023Fair value ofholding at31 March2023£’000Netinvestments/(realisations)£’000Impact of FX rate changes£’000Investmentreturn£’000 Fair value ofholding at30 September2023£’000% ofportfolio Tide 35 692 - - 5 767 41 459 15.2% Grover 43 150 1 368 (579) (2 655) 41 284 15.1% Zopa Bank^ 30 093 - - 3 810 33 903 12.4% Volt 14 216 5 300 - 4 223 23 739 8.7% BullionVault^ 11 565 - - 404 11 969 4.3% Monese 11 683 - - (1 588) 10 095 3.7% AnyFin 9 304 - (369) 770 9 705 3.6% Onfido 10 242 - (51) (486) 9 705 3.6% Intellis 8 412 - 113 352 8 877 3.2% Iwoca 7 882 - - 3 7 885 2.9% Top 10 Investments 182 239 6 668 (886) 10 600 198 621 72.7% Other Investments* 49 266 211 131 (6 893) 42 715 15.6% Cushon 22 790 (22 790) - - - 0.0% Total Investments 254 295 (15 911) (755) 3 707 241 336 88.3% Cash & cash equivalents 40 015 51 772 18.9% Net other current liabilities (186) (1 979) (0.7)% Net Assets 294 124 291 129 106.5% Performance Fee accrual (16 819) (17 756) (6.5)% Net Assets after performance fee 277 305 273 373 100.0%^ Held via Augmentum I LP* There are fourteen other investments (31 March 2023: fifteen) held in the portfolio. See page 14 for further details..Portfolio Manager’s ReviewOverviewAs I write  markets are exhibiting the early signs of a shift in sentiment. The Bank of England's decision to hold rates steady since September  followed by the Federal Reserve's similar stance in early November  signals a cautious yet hopeful economic outlook. While the months ahead present likely challenges with persistently high rates  the encouraging performance of growth stocks in response to these developments suggests a return to more positive equity market performance. Patience is required  as confidence and capital gradually reinvigorate the markets. However  reaching the apex of this rate tightening cycle marks a significant turning point  steering us towards a more optimistic future.Despite these positive shifts  the UK equity market continues to grapple with deep-rooted demand issues  even amidst numerous strategic efforts to enhance its competitiveness. The overwhelming preference for passive investment strategies  coupled with the US market's dominance  remains a formidable challenge for trading volumes. This trend has led to reduced liquidity in domestic European exchanges  with our pension funds and wealth managers disproportionately investing in US markets.My responsibility extends beyond reporting our progress; it’s about charting our future course. Investing in Augmentum today means accessing a portfolio and a pan-European investment platform that has evolved significantly since the Company’s IPO. The portfolio's robustness positions us favourably for the promising investment landscape in European fintech.Each new advance in technology  such as those seen this year with AI  adds momentum to the structural trends driving digitalisation across the economy. Momentum meets opportunity in financial services  penetration of fintech market share remains well below 2% and global fintech revenue is forecast to reach US$1.5 trillion in 2030 (BCG  2023). The companies that make up our portfolio and current pipeline are at the forefront of this huge opportunity and Augmentum remains a unique way for investors to share in it too.Combined with clear strategy and a disciplined approach  market conditions are such that returns from 2024-25 private investment vintages have the potential to be exceptional.Portfolio OverviewThe Company’s portfolio stands at 24 fintech companies  with diversification across fintech verticals  European markets  and maturity stages  as we told investors we would build during the Company’s IPO. Since listing  we have delivered £84 million in realisations  across five exits and from dividends  despite the macroeconomic backdrop. The portfolio’s top 10 companies employ over 4 000 people and generate close to £1 billion in annual revenues  with year-on-year growth continuing at an average of 74%. Four of this group are profitable and the remaining six have an average cash runway to their next funding round of 29 months.The three largest holdings  Tide  Grover and Zopa Bank are category defining digital leaders in large and growing markets. They are growing revenue at an average of 79% year-on-year and are profitable or expected to reach profitability without further funding. Each has built an exceptional team and technology platform. True to our model  we have supported these companies from their early stages with capital and strategic support. Revenue growth since our initial investment has been over 2 000% on average. We will continue to work to optimise the exits of the Company’s positions in the years ahead.The resilience of our portfolio is notable against the macro backdrop of the last 18 months. Whilst in the broader venture and tech landscape  stress is starting to show through in rates of company failure as cash runways come to an end. Meanwhile  the companies in the portfolio continue to attract investment  raising over £200 million in equity funding in the last 12 months. With insight on performance and strategic direction  we have continued to build the positions in the portfolio’s top performers through follow-on investments.Following a period of depressed investment activity in the sector over the course of 2022 and early 2023  we have seen the beginning of a meaningful return in activity and importantly quality in the last quarter. This has been accompanied by the start of a reset in valuations to longer-term accepted stage-appropriate levels. Bolstered by our fifth portfolio exit of Cushon to NatWest Group  the Company’s balance sheet position is strong with £48 million of free cash and no debt. We believe that the period ahead will be an opportune time to invest.Investment ActivityOur deployment into new companies slowed while markets were correcting in 2022 and the first half of 2023. We have continued to assess opportunities  but prospects and deal dynamics  in particular valuations  have not met our bar for investment. We remain committed to a long-term  sector-focussed approach that is built not just on quality companies  but quality investments. Reduced deployment has been the right course in a market absent of the right investment at the right price.During the period we invested £5.3 million into existing portfolio company Volt as part of the company’s US$60 million Series B round. Volt is addressing a huge opportunity in real-time payments that sits at the intersection of trends in ecommerce  payment behaviours  and increasing focus on payment costs and security. Since Augmentum’s first investment in December 2020  Volt has consistently delivered double-digit month-on-month revenue growth as a leading provider of real-time payment connectivity to global merchants and payment service providers. The series B round was led by US investor IVP who will support the company’s expansion into North American markets  building on their existing presence in the UK  Europe  Brazil and Australia.We also took up our pro rata shareholder rights to invest a total of £1.6 million in small additional rounds at Grover and Habito.Post-period end  we invested £4.2 million in an oversubscribed primary and secondary transaction at Tide  which is now our largest holding. As the leading digital banking platform for small businesses in the UK  Tide has now achieved 10% share of the UK market with more than 550 000 members. Tide is profitable in the UK and moving into a new phase of maturity  delivering strong revenue diversification through product cross-sell across a large and stable base of business customers. To further diversify from a predominantly UK revenue focus  Tide has launched in India  and in less than 12 months has attracted more than 150 000 new members.The portfolio’s second largest holding  Grover  continues to define a new category at the intersection of fintech and ecommerce  fundamentally changing how retail and business customers consume technology products. Part payment-method  part-financing  Grover’s technology subscriptions offer the flexibility and choice that underpin the secular trend towards an access-rather than ownership-economy. During the period annual recurring revenue reached €266 million (September 2022: €202 million)  with 320 000 active customers across 5 core markets. In the last 18 months Grover adjusted marketing spend to move towards profitability in 2024. Following the recent €23 million transaction that Augmentum participated in  Grover is funded to reach this milestone. The revaluation of our holding by £3.2 million reflects currency impact and the terms of the transaction. The company continues to track its profitability-focused year-on-year revenue growth target of 30% with EBIT and net income margin performing ahead of expectations due to a close focus on costs.Zopa Bank’s performance demonstrates the powerful combination of exceptional technology  a world class team  and a strong balance sheet. The company is profitable  and performing ahead of budget year-to-date and further strengthened its balance sheet raising £75 million in Tier 2 regulatory capital. The upward movement in the valuation of the Company’s holding by £3.8 million follows year-on-year revenue growth of 92% and returns the full position above cost of investment for the first time since the write down event that coincided with their securing a banking licence in 2019. The transformation of the business since  and a 17 year lending track record  have seen Zopa Bank continue along an ambitious growth trajectory.BullionVault has enjoyed a strong year of trading and is on track to deliver record profits. Performance follows from investor demand for gold and other precious metals as an inflationary hedge  and net interest income earned on fiat balances held by users on exchange. BullionVault is a mature position in the portfolio and serves a hedging function within the Augmentum portfolio during times of heightened market uncertainty. The moderate uplift of the Company’s position by £0.4 million reflects this performance  but also the degree of cyclicality we believe is exhibited in these elevated levels of earnings.Investor interest in the banking-as-a-service market remains high and Monese’s business-to-business coreless banking platform ‘XYB’ has proven competitive amongst a strong peer set. The opportunity is clear; having tried and failed to launch internally-built digital propositions  incumbent financial services firms are seeking partnership with fintech players. Monese’s client list  including HSBC and Investec  is reflective of the high quality of the technology platform  originally built and proven out through the consumer business. As Monese’s revenue mix is increasingly built on long-term licensing revenues from XYB  the valuation comparables of the company will adjust. Our downward adjustment to the fair value of our holding by £1.6 million reflects the basket of public market comparators we have used.Founded in Sweden  Anyfin supports financial wellbeing for consumers. The core product of credit refinancing is combined with saving accounts  budgeting tools and subscription management services driving high retention across their prime-credit user base. Year-on-year revenue growth has remained strong  although higher costs of capital have impacted at the gross margin level. The experienced management team has demonstrated strong capability while navigating a more challenging macro environment.Onfido provides identity verification services to enterprise clients in financial services. These clients have proven to be a resilient base  although rates of customer onboarding have reduced since peaks seen in 2021  with some verticals hit harder than others. Onfido has a leading position in the US and Europe through diversification across the financial services sector  and entry into new areas including healthcare. The downward adjustment to the fair value of our holding by £0.5 million is reflective of the contraction in valuation multiples amongst Onfido’s listed peers. The business is a highly strategic asset which will have strong exit opportunities as the macroeconomic environment improves.The £0.4 million uplift of the Company’s holding in Intellis follows a period of profitability for the business  despite falling market volatility. Intellis remains a unique proposition in the market and in the portfolio  deploying advanced proprietary AI trading strategies in foreign exchange markets with highly automated execution and a very lean cost base. Operating under a fully licensed fund structure  the road is set to enable the business to scale  both in current focus markets  and potentially in other adjacent asset classes.iwoca’s return to performance  and to the Company’s top 10  exemplifies the resilience and capability of the teams that make up our portfolio. In 2020  Covid funding support schemes dislocated iwoca’s market overnight. As these schemes have ended  and high-street lenders have once again retreated from small business funding  iwoca’s trading performance has progressed from strength-to-strength. Revenue run rate is now above £140 million with year-on-year growth at 141%. Achieving profitability in January 2023 and building this consistently month on month  iwoca is another example of the profit potential of lending businesses that harness digital technologies to drive significant operating leverage at scale.We retain a cautious approach to the digital asset sector  although crypto-asset pricing has seen recovery following positive regulatory news on ETF products approvals in the US. Our combined holdings in this area equate to 4.7% of the portfolio  which we believe to be an appropriate level of exposure to a market opportunity that has the potential to deliver upside value if demand continues to return.Outside the top 10 there were two notable fair value movements  with bothGemini and Previse adjusted downwards during the period in light of trading performance at both companies. In the US  Gemini continue to act as an agent in the recovery of customer assets lent through a third-party program known as ‘Earn’. This case has attracted legal action towards the third-party operator of the program and Gemini  and we continue to monitor the situation as it evolves.ExitsIn June  our fifth portfolio exit completed with the sale of Cushon to NatWest Group. Augmentum received £22.8 million  delivering an IRR of 62% and a multiple on capital invested of 2.1 times  representing a 47% uplift on the previously reported fair value of Augmentum’s position.We have delivered five exits to date  all at or above the previously reported holding value. Combined with dividends from elsewhere in the portfolio these have delivered £84 million of cash.PerformanceAs at 30 September 2023  we are reporting a NAV per share after performance fee of 160.2p (31 March 2023: 158.9p). Since IPO the Company has generated a Gross IRR (before expenses) on Capital Deployed* of 16.6%.Each position is valued objectively using the most appropriate methodology. 92% of the portfolio is valued using public market comparables. Wider governance is a key element of the process with each valuation signed off by the Board and Valuations Committee. Over time we have demonstrated consistency and prudence in our approach  protecting the valuations from some of the outsized market swings that were seen in 2021 and 2022.As mentioned in previous reports  downside protections  such as liquidation preference and anti-dilution provisions  are integral to the way we structure our typical venture investments.. These structures are atypical of ordinary share structures typically seen in the public or private markets as they protect the value of Augmentum’s position in the event of a reduction in the equity value of a company.OutlookMany commentators expect rates to remain elevated for a sustained period. Our base position is that 2024 is likely to be a year of economic challenge  but we expect that confidence is likely to rebound in 2025.Acquisitions have traditionally been the primary exit strategy for fintechs  a trend we see persisting into 2024 and beyond. This trajectory is bolstered by growing bank balance sheets in the current fiscal landscape and an increasing synergy between fintechs and incumbent firms. The urgency for digital transformation – to manage operational pressures and stay competitive against fintech challengers – remains paramount. In the banking sector  global leaders like JPMorgan Chase  which faced scrutiny for its projected US$15.3 billion technology spend across acquisitions and partnerships in 2023  are now reaping rewards for their strategic investments through outperformance. This has not gone unnoticed by their smaller counterparts or shareholders.Our focus aligns with the growing trend towards business-to-business investments  but we also see untapped potential in business-to-consumer fintech ventures. Harnessing cutting-edge technologies like AI  these ventures are poised to offer consumer products far surpassing those of incumbent firms.For venture capital funds that have weathered the challenges of the past two years  a new cycle of opportunity is unfolding. In Europe  the recalibration of early-stage valuations coincides with a maturing technology infrastructure  evolving start-up ecosystems  and new regulatory frameworks. These elements  coupled with substantial room for digital disruption in financial services  lay the groundwork for the next generation of impactful businesses.The announcement of The Mansion House Compact in July 2023 marked a potential paradigm shift for UK pension fund capital  with ten of the UK’s largest funds committing to allocate up to 5% of assets to private markets by 2030. This signals a welcome change in allocator mindset; with progression beyond the singular focus on cost-minimisation that has seen UK pensions underperform against international benchmarks. Talk  however  is cheap and the industry needs to move swiftly and decisively to ensure the Compact delivers on its significant potential to address the UK’s pension performance gap  and to support the wider investment environment.European venture capital has demonstrated that private market strategies can offer both value and outstanding returns. We believe that by building diversified private market strategies  capitalising on the UK’s venture capital expertise in various sectors and stages  pension fund managers can access some of the highest quality private market opportunities.During our Capital Markets Day in July  we underscored the importance of sector specialisation. This focus enhances deal sourcing and execution and elevates the support we provide to portfolio companies. Our thesis-led approach  grounded in a deep understanding of technological advancements and regulatory shifts  guides our identification of emerging fintech opportunities.Looking ahead  our team is cultivating a pipeline centred on expanding retail access to private markets  regulatory and compliance technologies  financial operations including treasury management  and financial market infrastructure for the carbon and energy sectors.We maintain an uncompromising standard for new investments. Our meticulous approach has been instrumental in building our resilient  diverse  and rapidly growing portfolio  which continues to scale even in uncertain economic times. We believe that the coming years will offer exceptional opportunities for top-tier venture investors to deliver a standout vintage.Tim LeveneCEOAugmentum Fintech Management Limited27 November 2023.InvestmentsTideTide’s (www.tide.co) mission is to help small and mid-sized businesses (“SMEs”) save time and money in the running of their businesses.

It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements  mitigated by stock diversification.The Group is exposed to the risk of the change in value of its unlisted equity and non-equity investments. For unlisted equity and non-equity investments the market risk is principally deemed to be represented by the assumptions used in the valuation methodology as set out in the accounting policy.Liquidity RiskThe Group’s assets comprise unlisted equity and non-equity investments. Whilst unlisted equity is illiquid  short-term flexibility is achieved through cash and cash equivalents.Credit RiskThe Group’s exposure to credit risk principally arises from cash and cash equivalents. Only highly rated banks (with credit ratings above A3  based on Moodys ratings or the equivalent from another ratings agency) are used for cash deposits and the level of cash is reviewed on a regular basis.Further details of the Company’s management of these risks can be found in note 13 of the Company’s 2023 Annual Report.There have been no changes to the management of or the exposure to credit risk since the date of the Annual Report.Fair Value HierarchyFair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged  or a liability settled between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.The Group complies with IFRS 13 in respect of disclosures about the degree of reliability of fair value measurements. This requires the Group to classify  for disclosure purposes  fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.The levels of fair value measurement bases are defined as follows:Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for which any significant input to the valuation is not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).The determination of what constitutes ‘observable’ requires significant judgement by the Directors.The Group considers observable data to be market data that is readily available  regularly distributed or updated  reliable and verifiable  not proprietary and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.All investments were classified as Level 3 investments as at  and throughout the period to  30 September 2023. Details of movements in  and changes in value of  the Level 3 investments are included on the next page.All investments were valued in accordance with accounting policy as set out in note 19.4 of the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2023.When using the price of a recent transaction in the valuations the Company looks to ‘re-calibrate’ this price at each valuation point by reviewing progress within the investment  comparing against the initial investment thesis  assessing if there are any significant events or milestones that would indicate the value of the investment has changed and considering whether a market-based methodology (ie. using multiples from comparable public companies) or a discounted cashflow forecast would be more appropriate.The main inputs into the calibration exercise  and for the valuation models using multiples  are revenue  EBITDA and P/E multiples (based on the most recent revenue  EBITDA or earnings achieved and equivalent corresponding revenue  EBITDA or earnings multiples of comparable public companies)  quality of earnings assessments and comparability difference adjustments. Revenue multiples are often used  rather than EBITDA or earnings  due to the nature of the Group’s investments  being in fast-growing  small financial services companies which are not normally expected to achieve profitability or scale for a number of years. Where an investment has achieved scale and profitability the Group would normally then expect to switch to using an EBITDA or earnings multiple methodology.In the calibration exercise and in determining the valuation for the Group’s equity instruments  comparable trading multiples are used. In accordance with the Group’s policy  appropriate comparable public companies based on industry  size  developmental stage  revenue generation and strategy are determined and a trading multiple for each comparable company identified is then calculated. Due to the nature of the Group's investments there are frequently no directly comparable public companies; in these instances baskets of public companies will be used that share similar characteristics to the investee company.The multiple is calculated by dividing the enterprise value of the comparable company by its revenue  EBITDA or earnings. The trading multiple is then adjusted for considerations such as illiquidity  premium to public companies implied in an investee's previous financing round  marketability and other differences  advantages and disadvantages between the Group’s portfolio company and the comparable public companies based on company specific facts and circumstances.The main input into the PWERM (‘Probability Weighed Expected Return Methodology’) was the probability of conversion. This method was used for the convertible loan notes held by the Company.Total gains and losses on assets measured at Level 3 are recognised as part of Gains on Investments in the Consolidated Income Statement  and no other comprehensive income has been recognised on these assets. The total unrealised return for the period was £2 952 000 (period ended 30 September 2022: £1 497 000).The following table presents those investments in portfolio companies whose fair values are recognised in whole or in part using valuation techniques based on assumptions that are not supported by prices or other inputs from observable current market transactions in the same instrument and the effect of changing one or more of those assumptions behind the valuation techniques adopted based on reasonably possible alternative assumptions.Valuation Technique Fair Value30 September2023£’000 Fair Value31 March2023£’000Unobservable Inputs Reasonably possible shiftin input +/- Change invaluation+/(-) £’000 Multiple methodology 221 422 197 876 Multiple 10% 18 437/(19 050) Illiquidity adjustment increase / Premium decrease 30% (26 347) Illiquidity adjustment decrease / Premium increase 30% 23 880 CPORT* 7 343 21 568 Transaction price 10% 3 069/(3 069) PWERM** 6 183 4 766 Probability of conversion 25% 252/(252) NAV 6 388 7 295 Discount to NAV 30% 489/(489) Sales Price - 22 790 N/a* Calibrated price of recent transaction.** Probability weighted expected return methodology.The following table presents the movement of investments measured at fair value  based on fair value measurement levels.Level 3 Six months to30 September2023£’000 Year to31 March2023£’000 Opening balance 254 295 268 807 Purchases at cost 6 879 19 854 Realisation proceeds (22 790) (44 224) Gains on investments held at fair value 2 952 9 858 Closing balance as at 30 September 241 336 254 295.Independent Review Report to Augmentum Fintech plcConclusionBased on our review  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 September 2023 is not prepared  in all material respects  in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34 and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority.We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 September 2023 which comprises the Condensed Consolidated Income Statement  Consolidated Statement of changes in Equity  Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position  Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes.Basis for conclusionWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK) 2410  “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” (“ISRE (UK) 2410”).

The Board of the Company retains responsibility for strategy  operations and compliance and the Directors retain a fiduciary duty to shareholders.Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”)The measures the Board of Directors uses to assess the Company’s performance that are not defined under the International Financial Reporting Standards but which are viewed as particularly relevant for investment trusts. Definitions of the terms used and the basis of calculation are set out in this Glossary and the APMs are indicated with an asterisk (*).Convertible Loan NoteA convertible loan note is a loan which bears interest and is repayable but may convert into shares under certain circumstances.Discount or PremiumA description of the difference between the share price and the net asset value per share. The size of the discount or premium is calculated by subtracting the share price from the net asset value per share and is usually expressed as a percentage (%) of the net asset value per share. If the share price is higher than the net asset value per share the result is a premium. If the share price is lower than the net asset value per share  the shares are trading at a discount.Gross IRR on Capital DeployedIs the annualised return arising on investment related cash flows taking account of the timing of each cash flow  and assuming all investments are realised at their carrying value at the period end. It does not take account of the Group's expenses or transactions with shareholders. It is derived by computing the discount rate at which the present value of all investment related cash flows are equal to the original amounts invested.Initial Public Offering (“IPO”)An IPO is a type of public offering in which shares of a company are sold to institutional investors and usually also retail (individual) investors. Through this process  colloquially known as floating  or going public  a privately held company is transformed into a public company.Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”)Is the annualised return on an investment calculated from the cash flows arising from that investment taking account of the timing of each cash flow. It is derived by computing the discount rate at which the present value of all subsequent cash flows arising from an investment are equal to the original amount invested.Performance fee – CompanyAFML is entitled to a performance fee (previously referred to as carried interest) in respect of the performance of the Company's investments. Each performance fee operates in respect of investments made during a 24 month period and related follow-on investments made for a further 36 month period  save that the first performance fee shall be in respect of investments acquired using 80% of the net proceeds of the Company’s IPO in March 2018 (including the Initial Portfolio)  and related follow-on investments.Subject to certain exceptions  AFML will receive  in aggregate  15% of the net realised cash profits from the sale of investments made over the relevant period once the Company has received an aggregate annualised 10% realised return on investments (the ‘hurdle’) made during the relevant period. AFML's return is subject to a ‘’catch-up’’ provision in its favour.The performance fee is paid in cash as soon as practicable after the end of each relevant period  save that at the discretion of the Board payments of the performance fee may be made in circumstances where the relevant basket of investments has been realised in part  subject to claw-back arrangements in the event that payments have been made in excess of AFML’s entitlement to any performance fees as calculated following the relevant period.The performance fee payable by the Company to AFML is accrued in the Company's financial statements and eliminated on consolidation in the Group financial statements.Performance Fee – AFMLThe performance fee arrangements within AFML were set up with the aim of incentivising employees of AFML and aligning them with shareholders through participation in the realised investment profits of the Group.Any performance fee received by AFML will be allocated to its employees on a discretionary basis by the Management Engagement & Remuneration Committee of the Company.NAV per share Total Return*The theoretical total return on the NAV per share  reflecting the change in NAV during the period assuming that any dividends paid to shareholders were reinvested at NAV at the time the shares were quoted ex-dividend. This is a way of measuring investment management performance of investment trusts which is not affected by movements in the share price discount/premium.Net Asset Value (“NAV”)The value of the Group’s assets  principally investments made in other companies and cash being held  minus any liabilities. The NAV per share is also described as ‘shareholders’ funds’ per share. The NAV is often expressed in pence per share after being divided by the number of shares in issue. The NAV per share is unlikely to be the same as the share price  which is the price at which the Company’s shares can be bought or sold by an investor. The share price is determined by the relationship between the demand and supply of the shares.Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per share after performance fee*The NAV of the Group as calculated above less the performance fee accrual made by the Company divided by the number of issued shares.Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per share after performance fee total return*The Directors regard the Group’s NAV per share after performance fee total return as being the critical measure of value delivered to shareholders over the long term. The Board considers that the NAV per share after performance fee better reflects the current value of each share than the consolidated NAV per share figure  the calculation of which eliminates the performance fee.PartnershipAugmentum I LP  a limited partnership registered in Jersey and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.Total Shareholder Return*The theoretical total return per share reflecting the change in share price during the period and assuming that any dividends paid were reinvested at the share price at the time the shares were quoted ex-dividend.Unquoted inv,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,neutral,0.08,0.89,0.03,True,English,"['Augmentum Fintech Plc', 'Half-year Report', 'US-headquartered shareable digital identity technology company', 'recent ongoing challenging market conditions', 'pro rata shareholder rights', 'consumer tech subscription platform', 'W2 Global Data Solutions', '$60 million Series B round', 'capital markets trading platform', 'average daily matched volume', 'coreless’ banking platform provider', 'ongoing notional volume', 'automated identity verification', 'digital mortgage broker', 'majority shareholding acquisition', 'digital-first consumer bank', 'risk solution provider', 'fintech market leaders', 'SME business bank', 'eleven reporting periods', 'Augmentum Fintech plc', 'unaudited interim results', 'five successful realisations', '29 months cash runway', 'net free cash', 'last six months', 'account payment provider', 'last reporting date', 'top three holdings', 'The Augmentum model', 'Total Return Swaps', '1 million customers', 'global leader', 'top 10 holdings', 'fintech fund', 'market capitalisation', 'savings provider', 'BaaS) provider', 'RegTech provider', 'three follow', 'Available cash', 'current cash', 'Zopa Bank', 'Financial highlights', 'performance fee1', 'workplace pensions', 'NatWest Group', '10 UK small', 'mid-sized businesses', '550,000 UK businesses', 'continuous growth', 'rapid expansion', 'equity funding', 'first time', 'current accounts', 'Wematch.live', 'frontline teams', 'selective investor', 'valuation environment', 'appropriate measure', 'Neil England', 'track record', 'expected reduction', 'top 10 positions', 'average price', 'Tier 2 capital', 'company intelligence', 'The Company', 'investment highlights', 'sum value', 'investment discipline', 'full-year profitability', 'direct lender', '3 Revenue growth', 'wide discount', '2 Annualised IRR', 'back shares', 'unbroken NAV', 'share price', 'portfolio value', 'period end', '62% IRR', '3,918,878 shares', 'November', 'LSE', 'Europe', '31 March', 'inception', 'debt', '74%3 YoY', 'Tide', 'Grover', 'credentials', 'revenues', 'June', '2.1x', 'proceeds', 'India', 'December', '150,000 members', 'country', 'September', 'financing', 'mobile', 'service', 'launch', 'XYB', 'May', 'equities', 'August', 'ADMV', 'EMEA', 'July', 'number', 'acquisitions', 'Onfido', 'Airside', 'FullCircl', 'start', 'deployment', 'investments', 'Volt', 'part', 'Habito', 'Notes', 'Board', 'shareholders', 'valuations', 'LTM', 'outliers', 'comparability', 'Chairman', 'gain', 'IPO', 'order', 'confidence', 'advantage', 'accretion', 'review', 'treasury', 'premium', 'Manager', 'intere', '0.']",2023-11-28,2023-11-29,marketscreener.com

It all came down to the analysis ...,CEO Marco Dezi talks IR  the intricacies of navigating a complex IPO process and why a foreign exchange was the best bet for the firmWhy was Euronext Growth Milan the best exchange for Riba Mundo Tecnologia’s listing? It all came down to the analysis and feedback carried out by the company’s consultants across both the Spanish and Italian capital markets  says Marco Dezi  CEO and main shareholder of the tech enterprise firm.The company  which is also a B2B electronic distributor  was publicly listed on Euronext Growth Milan in July 2023  marking it as the first Spanish company to list on the Italian stock exchange.As part of his role at the firm  Dezi represents Riba Mundo Tecnologia to institutions  stakeholders and customers  even though the firm has an internal IR team of one and also outsources some IR functions to a third-party consultancy.Explaining the reasons behind the company’s choice to list in Italy  Dezi says that beyond the competent market feedback the firm received  another reason to pick Milan was that the company boasts ‘a fully Italian management team [in] Italy and [the country was] the first [one] in terms of billing in 2022  [representing] 20 percent of our total revenue.Marco Dezi  Riba Mundo Tecnologia‘I knew of other companies that had a positive experience and a positive outcome on their evaluation following an IPO on the Euronext Growth Milan. Their experiences were an inspiration for Riba Mundo Tecnologia and we believe it’s the right market to enhance the company and the sector we operate in.’Breaking barriersFor Riba Mundo  stepping into the IPO realm meant charting unfamiliar waters  particularly due to its unique position as the first Spanish company listed on Euronext Growth Milan. The journey spanned more than a year and presented multifaceted challenges  including differences in regulations across the two jurisdictions  language discrepancies and having to co-ordinate the work of numerous teams involved in the process.‘Ours was perhaps a more complicated and longer IPO journey than normal ’ Dezi recalls  adding that it was also his first experience of working on an IPO.He adds  however  that the process was a rewarding one: ‘It is an experience I recommend to any entrepreneur who has the opportunity to undertake this path as it is professionally educational  helps you enter into symbiosis with the company you represent and leads you to get to know every aspect of the business thoroughly.’Dezi outlines three pivotal phases in the IPO process. The initial  perhaps most effortless  phase focused on comprehending the road ahead  he explains.‘It was about understanding the path that was to be undertaken  the due diligence that was needed and which teams would be part of the project ’ he says. ‘In this phase  enthusiasm for what we wanted to achieve prevailed and it didn’t require a lot of management effort.’Stage two is when the real work began. ‘It was a very intense phase because  in the meantime  the normal operations of the company had to be ensured ’ Dezi explains.‘Especially in a company in full growth like ours  it was perhaps an even more amplified difficulty.’At this point and before entering the final phase  the company had to remodel some of its processes because members of the management team had to prioritize the IPO due diligence at the expense of other tasks.‘It was a phase that required a lot of commitment from several key stakeholders in the company and careful management of all company forces was needed to prevent the work from [hurting] the company’s numbers and – above all – its growth ’ Dezi recalls.The time to shineThe last phase was when the company embarked on roadshows  a time Dezi remembers as ‘the most challenging moment’ for him and CFO Jose Piñera Lopez. On reflection  Dezi says the meeting with investors was a crucial moment to convey the company story  detail long-term objectives and explain where the company was headed.‘The commitment in this last phase is directly proportional to the gratification you will get once those investors understand the potential and the prospects of your company and choose to believe in you and invest in your business ’ he says.But why was July 2023 the right moment for the IPO? Dezi says it was necessary as a testament to the company’s growth and the starting point to have its value recognized by partners and investors. Riba Mundo Tecnologia had recorded a 50 percent sales uplift in the first two quarters of 2023 compared with the previous year  and the company’s headcount was also growing at a fast pace. The biggest hurdle  however  was to ensure the company’s story was perceived correctly by its potential investors.‘The biggest challenge was to tell the story of how a trading B2B company was gaining ground and changing the market with its approach based on technology and a vision of internationalization free from commercial constraints ’ Dezi states. ‘It was also a great challenge to present ourselves as a non-Italian company and the first ever Spanish one [on Euronext Growth Milan].’Backing up your numbersSo what advice does Dezi have for those embarking on their first IPO journey?‘Follow the due diligence with maximum commitment during the IPO because it helps you to know the company in-depth ’ he says. He also urges IR professionals or leaders like him who need to manage the relationship with potential investors to always talk about the company with the right enthusiasm while always remaining balanced.‘Anything you say needs to be backed up by numbers and objectives that have been achieved ’ he advises.,neutral,0.09,0.9,0.01,mixed,0.4,0.33,0.27,True,English,"['Riba Mundo Tecnologia', 'first Spanish firm', 'Euronext Growth Milan', 'Opening Bell', 'landmark IPO', 'CFO Jose Piñera Lopez', 'B2B electronic distributor', 'three pivotal phases', 'Italian capital markets', 'Riba Mundo Tecnologia', 'first two quarters', 'Italian stock exchange', 'Euronext Growth Milan', 'several key stakeholders', '50 percent sales uplift', 'internal IR team', 'Italian management team', 'tech enterprise firm', 'trading B2B company', 'competent market feedback', 'longer IPO journey', 'IPO due diligence', 'complex IPO process', 'first Spanish company', 'CEO Marco Dezi', 'first [one', 'two jurisdictions', 'full growth', 'foreign exchange', 'best exchange', 'first experience', 'management effort', 'careful management', 'Italian company', 'best bet', 'main shareholder', 'IR functions', 'third-party consultancy', 'total revenue', 'other companies', 'positive outcome', 'right market', 'Breaking barriers', 'IPO realm', 'unfamiliar waters', 'unique position', 'a year', 'multifaceted challenges', 'language discrepancies', 'rewarding one', 'normal operations', 'other tasks', 'challenging moment', 'crucial moment', 'long-term objectives', 'right moment', 'previous year', 'fast pace', 'biggest hurdle', 'biggest challenge', 'commercial constraints', 'great challenge', 'effortless, phase', 'intense phase', 'final phase', 'last phase', 'positive experience', 'numerous teams', 'starting point', 'company forces', 'real work', 'potential investors', 'company story', '20 percent', 'intricacies', 'listing', 'analysis', 'consultants', 'July', 'role', 'institutions', 'customers', 'reasons', 'choice', 'Italy', 'country', 'terms', 'billing', 'evaluation', 'experiences', 'inspiration', 'sector', 'differences', 'regulations', 'Ours', 'complicated', 'entrepreneur', 'opportunity', 'path', 'symbiosis', 'aspect', 'business', 'road', 'project', 'enthusiasm', 'lot', 'Stage', 'meantime', 'difficulty', 'processes', 'members', 'expense', 'commitment', 'numbers', 'reflection', 'meeting', 'gratification', 'prospects', 'testament', 'value', 'partners', 'headcount', 'ground', 'approach', 'technology', 'vision', 'internationalization', 'Backin']",2023-11-29,2023-11-29,irmagazine.com

The price of Philips stock fell by nearly 7 percent on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange moments after trading opened.The FDA has received 270 reports of problems with the temperature of the DreamStation 2 between August and mid-November.
