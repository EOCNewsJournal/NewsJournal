Its 2022 annual report  filed on January 19  said the deal desk should review any deals greater than US$500 000. Lawyers for SUSE's former CEO Melissa Di Donato  who stood down on Mar 21  told Reuters the deal desk was created after a joint decision by the executive team and the company's board.According to four documents reviewed by Reuters and two of the people with knowledge of the situation  Di Donato greenlighted the commercial terms of a roughly US$1.4 million sale to South African utility Eskom in late January  bypassing the deal desk's scrutiny in order to speed the process  less than two weeks after SUSE told investors the desk would help to improve controls.On January 30  after commercial terms of the Eskom deal had been agreed  a senior SUSE executive said in an email to other company officials that the terms had not been submitted to the deal desk.In late February  an executive told colleagues in an email that the sale had not been scrutinized by the deal desk before being agreed but the team would review the terms to familiarize itself with the transaction  according to the documents and two people with knowledge of the transaction.The deal would still be logged into SUSE's systems as approved by Di Donato without sign-off from the deal desk  the executive said. Reuters could not determine if this was done. There was no suggestion in the documents reviewed by the news agency of any problematic issues that arose from the terms of the deal.A lawyer for Di Donato said in the letter to Reuters that it was ""highly misleading"" to suggest she had reached the Eskom agreement without submitting it for the deal desk's approval: ""the deal desk was aware of the deal. Nothing was skipped."" SUSE lawyers didn't address directly whether approval from the deal desk had been skipped on the Eskom transaction.A spokesperson for Eskom did not comment on SUSE's due diligence but said that ""Eskom's established processes and governance structures were adhered to during this procurement.""DISCOUNTED DEALAs part of the new risks identified in the annual report  SUSE warned in January that: ""quarter-end pressure may exacerbate the risk as sales staff try to get deals over the line.""The documents reviewed by Reuters show the efforts SUSE made to clinch one deal: in December 2022 SUSE discounted a sale to Bank of New York Mellon by more than 90 per cent from the listed price.SUSE sales growth was slowing at the time.

There was no suggestion in the documents reviewed by the news agency of any problematic issues that arose from the terms of the deal.A lawyer for Di Donato said in the letter to Reuters that it was ""highly misleading"" to suggest she had reached the Eskom agreement without submitting it for the deal desk's approval: ""the deal desk was aware of the deal. Nothing was skipped."" SUSE lawyers didn't address directly whether approval from the deal desk had been skipped on the Eskom transaction.A spokesperson for Eskom did not comment on SUSE's due diligence but said that ""Eskom's established processes and governance structures were adhered to during this procurement.""DISCOUNTED DEALAs part of the new risks identified in the annual report  SUSE warned in January that: ""quarter-end pressure may exacerbate the risk as sales staff try to get deals over the line.""The documents reviewed by Reuters show the efforts SUSE made to clinch one deal: in December 2022 SUSE discounted a sale to Bank of New York Mellon by more than 90 per cent from the listed price.SUSE sales growth was slowing at the time. Di Donato agreed to offer BNY Mellon the discount on a package of services originally listed at several million dollars  according to emails and a person familiar with the transaction. Reuters could not determine what SUSE's original offer was.Under the discounted deal  BNY Mellon was offered a one-year package that included SUSE's Platinum service and 10 000 'nodes'  according to the documents and one of the people.Lawyers for Di Donato said ""the scope  the services and the size of the BNY Mellon deal changed from what was originally on offer and  therefore  the final price changed accordingly."" Di Donato's lawyer added ""it was not part of her responsibilities as the CEO of SUSE to track discounts on deals "" and ""the discount was approved in collaboration with others"".A spokesperson for BNY Mellon declined to comment on the deal.Lawyers for SUSE did not comment on the terms of the deal  saying it was confidential. Reuters could not determine if the deal was vetted by the deal desk nor how many deals have been going through the unit.Without referring to SUSE specifically  Christian Strenger  director of the Corporate Governance Institute (CGI) at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management  said that software-related services companies  in particular  have pressure to meet quarterly and year-end performance targets as they often rely on large individual sales.Di Donato's lawyers said that quarter-end pressures affected all companies: ""Our client has never forced a sales team to close a deal that was not good for the business.""SUSE and Reuters parent company  Thomson Reuters  are involved in litigation over the use of SUSE software products. SUSE claims that Thomson Reuters breached the terms that allegedly governed its use of SUSE software products.",negative,0.0,0.04,0.96,mixed,0.06,0.29,0.65,True,English,"['internal controls', 'sales risk', 'SUSE', 'natural governance maturity exercise', 'South African utility Eskom', 'past twelve months', 'other listed companies', 'several million dollars', 'young listed business', 'New York Mellon', 'other company officials', 'US$1.4 million sale', 'Melissa Di Donato', 'public stock market', 'Nine company documents', 'SUSE sales growth', 'senior SUSE executive', 'governance structures', 'large companies', 'Commercial governance', 'several changes', 'market valuation', 'BNY Mellon', 'new management', 'new risks', 'effective control', 'Sales organization', 'recent sales', 'majority shareholder', 'sales targets', 'extraordinary meeting', 'Execution challenges', 'operating performance', 'public offer', 'short-term demands', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'financial year', 'joint decision', 'late February', 'news agency', 'problematic issues', 'Eskom agreement', 'due diligence', 'sales staff', '90 per cent', 'Eskom deal', 'DISCOUNTED DEAL', 'one deal', 'Software firm', 'software businesses', 'deal desk', 'three people', 'two people', 'annual report', 'four documents', 'software company', 'contractual terms', 'former CEO', 'quarter-end pressure', 'commercial controls', 'commercial terms', 'executive team', 'Eskom transaction', 'late January', 'commercial deals', 'IPO price', 'SUSE shares', 'SUSE lawyers', '2021 IPO', 'LONDON', 'clients', 'Microsoft', 'BMW', 'investors', 'scrutiny', 'servers', 'department', 'sector', 'high-risk', 'heatmap', 'impact', 'Reuters', 'warning', 'interviews', 'knowledge', 'transactions', 'light', 'examples', 'decision-making', 'letter', 'Sep', 'creation', 'scaling', 'EQT', 'August', 'CFO', 'Nov', 'shareholders', 'exchange', 'statement', 'article', 'Frankfurt', 'level', 'delisting', 'revenue', 'Oct', 'board', 'situation', 'order', 'process', 'email', 'colleagues', 'systems', 'sign-off', 'suggestion', 'approval', 'Nothing', 'spokesperson', 'procurement', 'line', 'efforts', 'December', 'Bank', 'time', 'package', 'services']",2023-11-30,2023-12-01,channelnewsasia.com

As of that date  the pan-European clearing house Euronext Clearing now clears equities  ETFs  structured products  warrants  and bonds across six Euronext markets1. On average  Euronext Clearing clears circa 2 million transactions on a daily basis for its 52 European and local clearing members  of which 37 were onboarded as part of the expansion  including all major clearing members of the industry. This successful migration establishes Euronext Clearing as the Central Counterparty (CCP) of choice for Euronext’s cash markets  which process around 25% of European cash trading. This transformation contributes significantly to building the backbone of the Capital Markets Union in Europe  reducing the fragmentation of European capital markets.This major step paves the way for the expansion of Euronext Clearing activities to Euronext’s listed and commodity derivatives in Q3 2024. The addition of material post-trade capabilities puts Euronext at the forefront of the financial landscape  with a unique and meaningful presence across the entire value chain  ideally positioned to capture future growth opportunities.Through its expanded pan-European multi-asset-class CCP  Euronext will directly operate clearing activities for cash  listed derivatives and commodities markets by the end of 2024  providing one single platform for clients to manage their collateral  and access information on collateral  risk  and clearing. Euronext Clearing has innovated with the adoption of a new VaR-based margin methodology  in line with evolving market standards. The new methodology enhances the efficiency and reliability of risk capture and allocation within the financial system. The introduction of a unified equity and derivatives default fund facilitates cross-margining empowering clients to optimise their trading activities across seven Euronext markets. The implementation of harmonised clearing allows market participants to streamline their entire trade lifecycle within Euronext and to leverage on Euronext Securities to access T2S.Since the acquisition of Borsa Italiana in April 2021  Euronext has demonstrated a unique expertise in delivering significant technological projects with the migration of the Core Data Centre from Basildon in the UK to Bergamo in Italy  as well as the successful migration of Italian cash equity  ETF  fixed income  warrants and certificates markets to the Euronext state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq®. The expansion of Euronext Clearing to Euronext cash markets significantly contributes to reaching the €70 million run-rate annual EBITDA synergies targeted by the end of 2023. Euronext continues to work toward the migration of Italian derivatives trading to Optiq in Q1 2024. The confirmed expansion of Euronext Clearing to Euronext listed derivatives by Q3 2024 will significantly contribute to reaching the “Growth for Impact 2024” strategic plan €115 million run-rate annual EBITDA synergies by end of 2024.Stéphane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:“The successful expansion of the Euronext Clearing offering to Euronext cash markets is a significant milestone in the delivery of our Euronext “Growth for Impact 2024” strategic plan and demonstrates our capacity to timely and seamlessly integrate and expand European market infrastructures. This move will enable us to further cater to our clients along the entire trading value chain  unlocking new opportunities to develop innovative solutions in a more agile way.

The efficiency and market security of a clearing house relies on its ability to manage various asset classes and markets  and Euronext is leveraging the diversity of its different markets to enhance Euronext Clearing  as a truly European clearing provider.

This ambition is reflected in our efforts to support our Heartists® flourish professionally  regardless of their background  prior work experience or education  through dedicated programs and access to professional development.Detecting and fostering the full potential of every team member contributes to a diverse workforce helping drive the Group’s growth and expansion. We have always welcomed Talent from diverse educational backgrounds and offered them learning opportunities to grow and to achieve fulfilling career paths. By fostering inclusive recruitment and providing ongoing development through tailored programs  mentoring and training  we enhance the Social Elevator  enabling Heartists® to climb the ladder. This commitment has resulted in a diverse cadre of leaders  illustrated by the fact that 28% of our hotel General Managers have a high school diploma or no higher education.A Socially Impactful Talent Development ProgramDetermined to make our social elevator vision a reality across the Group  we launched this summer Reveal Talent. This ambitious career development program creates opportunities for participants with identified potential to reach a first-time hotel management position or take on additional responsibilities. Drawing on new and existing tools – from mentoring to job exposure and business and management modules – the program prepares participants for future promotion. As well as reinforcing knowledge and understanding of the hospitality industry and the Group  Reveal Talent aims to remove self-barriers that may prevent promising team members from considering a management position.Deployed across both our divisions  Luxury & Lifestyle and Premium  Midscale & Economy  the program is one of a kind in the hospitality industry  laying the foundations for a more accessible  tailored approach to career development. The first cohort began the Reveal Talent in Greater China in July 2023  and since then  all of Accor’s regions and brands across more than 200 hotels in 42 countries have contributed to making Reveal Talent a truly global program. The engagement and local facilitation provided by the Accor Academy and Reveal Talent Ambassadors have enabled us to surpass already the initial target of 300 participants in 2023.Tailored to Cater for Local SpecificitiesWith the aim of adapting to the needs and expectations of each local market  Reveal Talent is overseen locally by our brands and regions. In Greater China  English Club sessions are offered to help participants improve their language skills. While in Europe and North Africa  a specific “coach” role has been created to support the development of participants as they grow through the program. In the Luxury segment  the brands themselves are the driving force behind the program’s implementation and have co-constructed a specific blended learning path and bespoke virtually facilitated curriculum.Moving forward  Accor will continue to grow and adapt the Reveal Talent program to meet the needs and aspirations of team members around the world – and foster an environment that make social elevation a daily reality.We are extremely proud of the initial results since the program’s inception. This would not have been possible without the high level of engagement from all our stakeholders and the tremendous drive and support from our local Accor Academies. Their commitment ensures that Reveal Talent will help make a difference around the globe. Meanwhile  the high demand for participation demonstrates that this type of initiative is both much sought after and appreciated. The program will contribute to more diversity  more opportunities and more upskilled Talent at Accor.

Part of Lhyfe's backbone development strategy  this plant will feed into the German core hydrogen pipeline network  for the development of which the German government recently unveiled a €20 billion financing plan.As part of its plan to utilise more green hydrogen as a means of reducing greenhouse emissions while simultaneously decreasing reliance on imported fossil fuels  the German government announced two weeks ago an estimated investment of 20 billion euros in the hydrogen network by 2032. This investment will support the construction of a 9 700-kilometer-long pipeline network to transport hydrogen across the country and to Germany's neighbours.Alongside its bulk and onsite strategy  Lhyfe's backbone strategy consists in positioning some of its green hydrogen production units at locations specifically chosen for their proximity to the future European hydrogen backbone  thus enabling it to address a wide array of customers  delivered through these infrastructures once deployed.As such  over the last two years  Lhyfe has developed a backbone project portfolio representing 3.8 GW of electrolysis installed capacity (as of June 2023) or 37% of its total project pipeline  including large projects such as in Perl (Saarland) and Delfzijl (the Netherlands) located near future hydrogen transport infrastructures. These strategic locations ensure that future hydrogen production can be reliably transported and used in the decarbonisation of industrial sites throughout these regions.In this context  Lhyfe's project in Lubmin fits very well in with both its backbone strategy and Germany's strategy to support green hydrogen development  as it is located very close to the German hydrogen backbone. The new project site will offer access to extensive existing and future electricity production capacities from offshore wind farms. It also benefits from an extra-high voltage grid connection operated by 50Hertz  the transmission system operator  which already operates a transformer station in Lubmin and will feed all the required electricity power to produce hydrogen.The plant will be built on the site of a decommissioned nuclear power plant  which makes it even more environmentally friendly. The project is currently in the development phase and is scheduled to go into operation by 2029 with an electrolysis capacity of 800 MW and a production capacity of up to 330 tons of green hydrogen per day.“This location is of strategic importance to us ” emphasizes Luc Graré  Head of Central & Eastern Europe at Lhyfe. “We are building these plants not only for our short-term needs  but also for future generations. The introduction of green hydrogen in Europe is a long-term project and Lubmin meets all the requirements to establish itself as a sustainable centre for green hydrogen in the long term. We look forward to the long-term development of this location  to the development of the region's core hydrogen infrastructure  and to supporting the longstanding decarbonisation of Europe's industry and transport.”The project's implementation is subject notably to the granting of operating authorizations  construction permits  as well as to financial investment decisions.About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

This breakthrough solution should enable future industrial customers to boost the performance of their systems using this new technology  while reinforcing their energy independence.I FURTHER PROGRESS ON THE ROADMAPAs announced early 2023  BOOSTHEAT has embarked on an operational turnaround strategy focusing on its two core businesses: ""Thermal Compression Solutions (TCS)""  based on the company's know-how and its 7 patent families  and ""BOOSTHEAT Software Solutions & Services (S3)""  based on its energy performance management software.Last September  BOOSTHEAT S3 department unveiled the result of its work: ImpliciX  the brand-new software suite dedicated to facilitating industrial digital transition. Today  BOOSTHEAT unveils the progress made by its TCS division. Since beginning of the year  the teams have been working intensively on thermal compression technology  with three major objectives in mind:Optimizing compressor efficiency and simplifying design to be ready for industrialization with future partners.compressor efficiency and simplifying design to be ready for industrialization with future partners. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the technology in new applications  such as cold production (successfully carried out during the summer of 2023).the effectiveness of the technology in new applications  such as cold production (successfully carried out during the summer of 2023). Exploring the potential of thermal compression  making the most out of existing patents.I HYBRID COMPRESSION: THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDSThis exploration has given rise to a latest-generation solution: the hybrid compressor. This innovative compressor uses a combination of thermal (by gas combustion  for example) and/or electrical energy to provide heating  cooling or electricity capacity in an efficient way and a high level of modulation.This technology combines BOOSTHEAT's thermal compressor with a positive displacement compressor  creating a new compression system for primary energy hybridization.This combination enables multiple operating modes  by mixing the two energy sources  depending on energy availability  requirements  and prices. This innovation opens a huge field of possibilities in terms of targeted applications (micro-cogeneration  production of thermal energy at very high temperatures  for example).I ALIGNMENT WITH THE GEOPOLITICAL CONTEXT AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUESHybridization is more than just a technological progress  but also an economic benefit (enhanced performance)  a boost to the ecological transition (energy mix) and an imperative necessity in today's geopolitical landscape.In fact  world events mean that the availability and price of the 2 primary energy sources (gas and electricity) are highly volatile  while government aid measures are limited in scope (mainly households) and time. For manufacturers  this means in most cases  the inability to make short  medium  or long-term forecasts  especially if we take the impossibility of passing price fluctuation onto the finished product.This is why hybridization  which gives the option of favoring one of the 2 primary energies at a given moment in time  while maintaining the system's output in line with needs  has become an essential solution for avoiding cost overruns and maintaining the performance of the proposed solution over time.I RICH CALENDAR FOR 2024With this major new potential for its compression technology  BOOSTHEAT sees many opportunities for 2024:In terms of development   the Company's objective is to present its hybrid compressor prototype in early 2024 to enter a demonstration phase to prove its performance and qualify its uses.  the Company's objective is to present its hybrid compressor prototype in early 2024 to enter a demonstration phase to prove its performance and qualify its uses. In terms of research  BOOSTHEAT is determined to stay one step ahead of the 2050 carbon neutrality objective  by working on new primary energies such as biogas  biomethane and hydrogen.BOOSTHEAT is determined to stay one step ahead of the 2050 carbon neutrality objective  by working on new primary energies such as biogas  biomethane and hydrogen. Finally  on the commercial front  BOOSTHEAT will be working on adding value to its solution  whether through co-development  licensing  or technology transfer  by targeting market segments in the heating  ventilation  air-conditioning  and refrigeration (HVAC-R) sector  as well as in industrial applications.* * *Find out more about BOOSTHEAT atwww.boostheat-group.comABOUT BOOSTHEATFounded in 2011  BOOSTHEAT is a player in the energy efficiency sector.

This breakthrough solution should enable future industrial customers to boost the performance of their systems using this new technology  while reinforcing their energy independence.I FURTHER PROGRESS ON THE ROADMAPAs announced early 2023  BOOSTHEAT has embarked on an operational turnaround strategy focusing on its two core businesses: ""Thermal Compression Solutions (TCS)""  based on the company's know-how and its 7 patent families  and ""BOOSTHEAT Software Solutions & Services (S3)""  based on its energy performance management software.Last September  BOOSTHEAT S3 department unveiled the result of its work: ImpliciX  the brand-new software suite dedicated to facilitating industrial digital transition. Today  BOOSTHEAT unveils the progress made by its TCS division. Since beginning of the year  the teams have been working intensively on thermal compression technology  with three major objectives in mind:Optimizing compressor efficiency and simplifying design to be ready for industrialization with future partners.compressor efficiency and simplifying design to be ready for industrialization with future partners. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the technology in new applications  such as cold production (successfully carried out during the summer of 2023).the effectiveness of the technology in new applications  such as cold production (successfully carried out during the summer of 2023). Exploring the potential of thermal compression  making the most out of existing patents.I HYBRID COMPRESSION: THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDSThis exploration has given rise to a latest-generation solution: the hybrid compressor. This innovative compressor uses a combination of thermal (by gas combustion  for example) and/or electrical energy to provide heating  cooling or electricity capacity in an efficient way and a high level of modulation.This technology combines BOOSTHEAT's thermal compressor with a positive displacement compressor  creating a new compression system for primary energy hybridization.This combination enables multiple operating modes  by mixing the two energy sources  depending on energy availability  requirements  and prices. This innovation opens a huge field of possibilities in terms of targeted applications (micro-cogeneration  production of thermal energy at very high temperatures  for example).I ALIGNMENT WITH THE GEOPOLITICAL CONTEXT AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUESHybridization is more than just a technological progress  but also an economic benefit (enhanced performance)  a boost to the ecological transition (energy mix) and an imperative necessity in today's geopolitical landscape.In fact  world events mean that the availability and price of the 2 primary energy sources (gas and electricity) are highly volatile  while government aid measures are limited in scope (mainly households) and time. For manufacturers  this means in most cases  the inability to make short  medium  or long-term forecasts  especially if we take the impossibility of passing price fluctuation onto the finished product.This is why hybridization  which gives the option of favoring one of the 2 primary energies at a given moment in time  while maintaining the system's output in line with needs  has become an essential solution for avoiding cost overruns and maintaining the performance of the proposed solution over time.I RICH CALENDAR FOR 2024With this major new potential for its compression technology  BOOSTHEAT sees many opportunities for 2024:In terms of development   the Company's objective is to present its hybrid compressor prototype in early 2024 to enter a demonstration phase to prove its performance and qualify its uses.  the Company's objective is to present its hybrid compressor prototype in early 2024 to enter a demonstration phase to prove its performance and qualify its uses.

Finally  on the commercial front  BOOSTHEAT will be working on adding value to its solution  whether through co-development  licensing  or technology transfer  by targeting market segments in the heating  ventilation  air-conditioning  and refrigeration (HVAC-R) sector  as well as in industrial applications.* * *Find out more about BOOSTHEAT atwww.boostheat-group.comABOUT BOOSTHEATFounded in 2011  BOOSTHEAT is a player in the energy efficiency sector.
