The insurance transaction secures the benefits for all members of the Scheme  which includes defined benefit liabilities for 10 512 pensioners and dependents  and a further 5 915 deferred members.This transaction is in line with the capital allocation strategy of Thales. Thanks to this operation  the Group is de-risking its balance sheet from the potential volatility of pension schemes' valuation arising from market risks such as inflation  interest rates as well as longevity risks.In connection with this agreement  Thales expects to recognize a one-offP&L settlement charge of approximately £400 million in the fourth quarter of 2023  and a total one-off cash-outof approximately £850 million during the same period. These P&L and cash impacts will not affect the FY23 EBIT1 nor the FY23 free operating cash flow1 of the company.Following the completion of this transaction  Thales will no longer have to contribute annually for £75 million to reduce the pension funding shortfall. Lastly  the Group expects a neutral impact on its adjusted net income.The full ""buy-out"" will be effective by mid-2025 at the latest  after a first technical full ""buy-in"" step implemented from 1st December 2023. Terms and conditions related to the full ""buy-out"" have already been contractually accepted by Rothesay.

The company also committed earlier in 2023 to set long-term emission reduction targets with the SBTi in line with reaching net-zero by 2050.“SBTi validation of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets provides clear goals  as we commit to minimizing our environmental footprint ” said Nancy McKinstry  CEO and Chair of the Executive Board  Wolters Kluwer. “As a company with market leading ESG solutions  within our Corporate Performance and ESG division  we are committed to reducing the environmental impact of our own operations and value chain  while delivering sustainable growth for our stakeholders.”SBTi is a collaboration between CDP  the United Nations Global Compact  World Resources Initiative (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The SBTi defines and promotes best practices in science-based target setting  offers resources and guidance to reduce barriers to adoption  and independently assesses and approves companies’ targets. It is the global Net-Zero Standard for corporate climate action.Based on the company’s GHG assessment  Wolters Kluwer has developed abatement plans to reduce GHG emissions in line with a pathway to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The validated emissions reduction targets are:Reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base yearReduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.The company’s scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction target is mainly related to energy consumption from its offices  and the scope 3 GHG emissions reduction target covers value chain emissions from purchased goods and services  capital goods  upstream transportation and distribution  business travel and employee commuting.Efforts to reduce scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions include reducing the company’s organic office footprint and moving to renewable electricity. Decarbonization of Wolters Kluwer’s supply chain will be key to reduce scope 3 emissions  implying a greater focus on engaging with suppliers. Over the coming years  the company will implement additional initiatives to reduce its scope 1  2 and 3 GHG emissions in line with these targets  while continuing to inform stakeholders of progress in its Annual Reports.A breakdown of scope 1  2 and 3 GHG emissions for base year 2019 is available in Wolters Kluwer’s 2022 Annual Report (pages 51-56).

The Suzhou site  located to the west of Shanghai  will thus benefit from the standards of operational excellence already implemented by Lectra at its two other plants in Bordeaux-Cestas  France  and Tolland  USA.Lectra's teams have over 35 years’ experience in the Asia-Pacific region  which in 2022 generated 25% of the Group's revenues.Since the acquisition of its competitor  Gerber Technology  in 2021  Lectra had been relying on a plant belonging to Dutch group VDL Groep (VDL)  to manufacture Gerber-brand multi-ply cutters and spreaders.For its industrial activities  Lectra aimed to adopt the same standards of operational excellence in China as those currently in effect at its Bordeaux-Cestas and Tolland sites.

Ltd.  to take over from subcontractor VDL as of December 1  2023.“Our objective is to offer our customers unrivalled quality  wherever they are located. This means applying the same standards of operational excellence to all our equipment manufacturing sites. We must also ensure that we optimize our production lead times  while contributing to the dynamism of our local supplier ecosystems. That's why we favor local production sites in each of the major regions where we operate. Today  we are the only company in our sector to have three manufacturing sites  in China  the United States and France”  explains Jérôme Viala  Executive Vice President of Lectra.Following the takeover of in-house production at the Tolland site in October 2022  the creation of the Suzhou Lectra Equipment Manufacturing Co. Ltd. subsidiary marks a new milestone in the deployment of Lectra's industrial excellence strategy on a global scale.

The next largest group  38%  indicated they were not at all prepared.“While the CTA beneficial ownership rule represents one of the most significant regulatory developments to impact millions of businesses  there remains much preparatory work for those organizations subject to the new rule  according to our latest survey of businesses  law firms and CPA firms ” said George May  Vice President and Segment Leader  Small Business  for CT Corporation  a Wolters Kluwer business. “Although regulations often draw a significant level of attention from those parties that are impacted  the beneficial ownership reporting requirement has seemed to remain under the radar  in spite of an effective date now only one month away.”“Wolters Kluwer is doing our utmost in helping address the growing sense of awareness and urgency for all market participants that will be impacted by the new requirements ” he added. “Now is the time for those entities to take action in beginning to prepare to meet these reporting requirements.”Only three percent of respondents indicated they were 100% prepared to comply with the CTA beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting rule. Another 33% of respondents were unsure whether their organizations were subject to CTA beneficial ownership filing requirements.While companies that exist before January 1  2024 have until January 1  2025 to file their BOI details  entities formed after January 1  2024 have 90 days to file as a result of a recent amendment submitted by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to extend that period from 30 days. Regardless  the regulatory requirements are complex and will require advanced preparation and time to support  impacting nearly 33 million businesses in 2024.“FinCEN estimates that approximately three hours are needed to complete a filing ” May noted. “For those organizations—or advisory service firms with multiple entities under their purview—that translates into a significant commitment of time and the potential need for expert solutions to ensure compliance with the new regulation requirements.”In polling attendees on the anticipated number of entities for which they would be required to file BOI details  41% were unsure of the number of filings they would be required to submit.Wolters Kluwer has been fully engaged in following developments around the new beneficial ownership rule taking effect January 1  2024. It has created a range of helpful resources such as an easy-to-use self-guided eligibility quiz  webinar presentations  and content to ensure impacted entities are able to effectively prepare for and navigate the new requirements within the target timeframe to meet their compliance obligations.

The next largest group  38%  indicated they were not at all prepared.“While the CTA beneficial ownership rule represents one of the most significant regulatory developments to impact millions of businesses  there remains much preparatory work for those organizations subject to the new rule  according to our latest survey of businesses  law firms and CPA firms ” said George May   Vice President and Segment Leader  Small Business  for CT Corporation  a Wolters Kluwer business. “Although regulations often draw a significant level of attention from those parties that are impacted  the beneficial ownership reporting requirement has seemed to remain under the radar  in spite of an effective date now only one month away.”“Wolters Kluwer is doing our utmost in helping address the growing sense of awareness and urgency for all market participants that will be impacted by the new requirements ” he added. “Now is the time for those entities to take action in beginning to prepare to meet these reporting requirements.”Only three percent of respondents indicated they were 100% prepared to comply with the CTA beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting rule. Another 33% of respondents were unsure whether their organizations were subject to CTA beneficial ownership filing requirements.While companies that exist before January 1  2024 have until January 1  2025 to file their BOI details  entities formed after January 1  2024 have 90 days to file as a result of a recent amendment submitted by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to extend that period from 30 days. Regardless  the regulatory requirements are complex and will require advanced preparation and time to support  impacting nearly 33 million businesses in 2024.“FinCEN estimates that approximately three hours are needed to complete a filing ” May noted. “For those organizations—or advisory service firms with multiple entities under their purview—that translates into a significant commitment of time and the potential need for expert solutions to ensure compliance with the new regulation requirements.”In polling attendees on the anticipated number of entities for which they would be required to file BOI details  41% were unsure of the number of filings they would be required to submit.Wolters Kluwer has been fully engaged in following developments around the new beneficial ownership rule taking effect January 1  2024. It has created a range of helpful resources such as an easy-to-use self-guided eligibility quiz  webinar presentations  and content to ensure impacted entities are able to effectively prepare for and navigate the new requirements within the target timeframe to meet their compliance obligations.

Should be initiated and supervised by physicians with experience in the treatment of epilepsy. Fintepla is prescribed and dispensed according to the Fintepla controlled access programme. Dravet syndrome: Patients who are not taking stiripentol: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  if tolerated  can increase dose to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day). After an additional 7 days  if tolerated and further seizure reduction required  can increase dose to a maximum of 0.35 mg/kg twice daily (0.7 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Patients requiring more rapid titration may increase the dose every 4 days. Do not exceed maximum daily dose of 26 mg (13 mg twice daily). Patients who are taking stiripentol: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  if tolerated  can increase dose to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Patients requiring more rapid titration may increase the dose every 4 days. Do not exceed a total dose of 17 mg (8.6 mg twice daily). Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  the dose should be increased to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day)  if tolerated. After an additional 7 days  if tolerated  dose should be increased to 0.35 mg/kg twice daily (0.7 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Do not exceed maximum daily dose of 26 mg (13 mg twice daily). Discontinuation: When discontinuing treatment  decrease the dose gradually. As with all anti-epileptic medicines  avoid abrupt discontinuation when possible to minimize the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. A final echocardiogram should be conducted 3-6 months after the last dose of treatment with fenfluramine. Renal impairment: Generally  no dose adjustment is recommended when administered to patients with mild to severe renal impairment  however  a slower titration may be considered. If adverse reactions are reported  a dose reduction may be needed. Has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease. Not known if fenfluramine or its active metabolite  norfenfluramine  is dialyzable. Hepatic impairment: Hepatic impairment: Generally  no dose adjustment is recommended when Fintepla is administered without concomitant stiripentol to patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B). In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) not receiving concomitant stiripentol  the maximum dosage is 0.2mg/kg twice daily  and the maximal total daily dose is 17 mg. There are limited clinical data on the use of Fintepla with stiripentol in patients with mild impaired hepatic function. A slower titration may be considered in patients with hepatic impairment and a dose reduction may be needed if adverse reactions are reported. No clinical data is available on the use of Fintepla with stiripentol in moderate and severe hepatic impairment  therefore not recommended for use. Elderly: No data available. Paediatric population: Safety and efficacy in children below 2 years of age not yet established. No data available. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to active substance or any excipients. Aortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Warnings and Precautions: Aortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to establish a baseline and exclude any pre-existing valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension. Conduct echocardiogram monitoring every 6 months for the first 2 years and annually thereafter. If an echocardiogram indicates pathological valvular changes  consider follow-up earlier to evaluate whether the abnormality is persistent. If pathological abnormalities seen on echocardiogram  evaluate the benefit versus risk of continuing fenfluramine treatment with the prescriber  caregiver and cardiologist. Once treatment is discontinued for any reasons  a final echocardiogram should be conducted 3-6 months after the last dose of treatment with fenfluramine. If echocardiogram findings suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension  perform a repeat echocardiogram as soon as possible and within 3 months to confirm these findings. If echocardiogram finding is confirmed suggestive of an increased probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension defined as intermediate probability  conduct a benefit-risk evaluation of continuation of Fintepla by the prescriber  carer and cardiologist. If echocardiogram suggests a high probability  it is recommended fenfluramine treatment should be stopped. Decreased appetite and weight loss: Fenfluramine can cause decreased appetite and weight loss - an additive effect can occur in combination with other anti-epileptic medicines such as stiripentol. Monitor the patient's weight. Undertake risk-benefit evaluation before starting treatment if history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Fintepla controlled access programme: A controlled access programme has been created to 1) prevent off-label use in weight management in obese patients and 2) confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla. Somnolence: Fenfluramine can cause somnolence which could be potentiated by other central nervous system depressants. Suicidal behaviour and ideation: Suicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicines in several indications. Advise patients and caregivers to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation emerge. Serotonin syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with fenfluramine treatment  particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents; with agents that impair metabolism of serotonin such as MAOIs; or with antipsychotics that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. Carefully observe the patient  particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Increased seizure frequency: A clinically relevant increase in seizure frequency may occur during treatment  which may require adjustment in the dose of fenfluramine and/or concomitant anti-epileptic medicines  or discontinuation of fenfluramine  should the benefit-risk be negative. Cyproheptadine: Cyproheptadine is a potent serotonin receptor antagonist and may therefore decrease the efficacy of fenfluramine. If cyproheptadine is added to treatment with fenfluramine  monitor patient for worsening of seizures. If fenfluramine treatment is initiated in a patient taking cyproheptadine  fenfluramine's efficacy may be reduced. Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Discontinue therapy in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity. Consider discontinuation if ocular pain of unknown origin. Effect of CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducers: Co-administration with strong CYP1A2 inducers or CYP2B6 inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations  which may lower the efficacy of fenfluramine. If co-administration is considered necessary  the patient should be monitored for reduced efficacy and a dose increase of fenfluramine could be considered provided that it does not exceed twice the maximum daily dose (52 mg/day). If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with fenfluramine  consider gradual reduction of the fenfluramine dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer. Effect of CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors: Initiation of concomitant treatment with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in higher exposure and  therefore  adverse events should be monitored  and a dose reduction may be needed in some patients. Excipients: Contains sodium ethyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 215) and sodium methyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 219) - may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). It also contains sulfur dioxide (E 220) which may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm. Patients with rare glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. The product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per the maximum daily dose of 12 mL; essentially 'sodium-free'. Contains glucose - may be harmful to teeth. Interactions: Pharmacodynamic interactions with other CNS depressants increase the risk of aggravated central nervous system depression. An increase in dose may be necessary when coadministered with rifampicin or a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer. In in vitro studies co-administration with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in higher exposure (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). Co-administration with CYP2D6 substrates or MATE1 substrates may increase their plasma concentrations. Co-administration with CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 substrates may decrease their plasma concentrations. Pregnancy and lactation: Limited data in pregnant women. As a precaution  avoid use of Fintepla in pregnancy. It is unknown whether fenfluramine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Animal data have shown excretion of fenfluramine/metabolites in milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Fintepla taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. Drive and use machines.: Fintepla has moderate influence on the ability to drive/ use machines as it may cause somnolence and fatigue. Advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have sufficient experience to gauge whether it adversely affects their abilities. Adverse effects: Dravet syndrome: Very common (≥1/10): Upper respiratory tract infection  decreased appetite  somnolence  diarrhoea  pyrexia  fatigue  blood glucose decreased  echocardiogram abnormal (Consisted of trace and mild mitral regurgitation  and trace aortic regurgitation  which are considered physiologic). Common (≥1/100 to <1/10): Bronchitis  abnormal behaviour  aggression  agitation  insomnia  mood swings  ataxia  hypotonia  lethargy  seizure  status epilepticus  tremor  constipation  salivary hypersecretion  weight decreased and blood prolactin increased. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Very common (≥1/10): Upper respiratory tract infection  decreased appetite  somnolence  diarrhoea  vomiting  fatigue. Common (≥1/100 to <1/10): Bronchitis  influenza  pneumonia  seizure  status epilepticus  lethargy  tremor  constipation  salivary hypersecretion  blood prolactin increased  weight decreased  fall. Refer to SmPC for other adverse reactions.▼ This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information.https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/fintepla-epar-product-information_en.pdfImportant Safety Information about BRIVIACT® (brivaracetam) in the EU2Therapeutic indications: BRIVIACT is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy.Posology and method of administration: The physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and dose. It is recommended to parent and care giver to administer BRIVIACT oral solution with the measuring device (10 ml or 5 ml oral dosing syringe) provided in the carton box. BRIVIACT solution for injection/infusion is an alternative route of administration for patients when oral administration is temporarily not feasible. There is no experience with twice daily intravenous administration of brivaracetam for a period longer than 4 days. Adults: The recommended starting dose is 50 or 100 mg/day based on physician's assessment of required for seizure reduction versus potential side effects. Brivaracetam can be taken with or without food. Based on individual patient response and tolerability  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. Children and adolescents weighing 50 kg or more: The recommended starting dose is 50 mg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at 100 mg/day based on physician's assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 100 mg/day. Based on individual patient response  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. Children and adolescents weighing from 20 kg to less than 50 kg: The recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at doses up to 2 mg/kg/day based on physician's assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 2 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 1 mg/kg/day to 4 mg/kg/day. Children weighing from 10 kg to less than 20 kg: The recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day based on physician's assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 2.5 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 1 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day. For adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age  the dose should be administered in two equally divided doses  approximately 12 hours apart.If patients miss one dose or more  it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they remember and take the following dose at the usual morning or evening time. Brivaracetam oral solution can be diluted in water or juice shortly before swallowing; a nasogastric tube or a gastrostomy tube may also be used. Brivaracetam may be initiated with either intravenous or oral administration. When converting from oral to intravenous administration or vice versa  the total daily dose and frequency of administration should be maintained. Brivaracetam may be administered as an intravenous bolus without dilution or diluted in a compatible diluent and administered as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products. Brivaracetam bolus injection or intravenous infusion has not been studied in acute conditions  e.g. status epilepticus  and is therefore not recommended for such conditions For patients from 16 years of age  if brivaracetam has to be discontinued  it is recommended that the dose is reduced gradually by 50 mg/day on a weekly basis. For patients below the age of 16 years  if brivaracetam has to be discontinued  it is recommended that the dose is reduced by a maximum of half the dose every week until a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (for patients with a body weight less than 50 kg) or 50 mg/day (for patients with body weight of 50 kg or more) is reached. After 1 week of treatment at 50 mg/day  a final week of treatment at 20 mg/day is recommended. No dose adjustment is needed for elderly patients (≥65 years of age) or for those with renal impairment. Based on data in adults  no dose adjustment is necessary in paediatric patients with impaired renal function. No clinical data are available on paediatric patients with renal impairment. Brivaracetam is not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis due to lack of data. Exposure to brivaracetam was increased in patients with chronic liver disease. In patients with hepatic impairment  the following adjusted doses  administered in 2 divided doses  approximately 12 hours apart  are recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment: In adults  adolescents and children weighing ≥50 kg  a 50 mg/day starting dose is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 150 mg/day. For adolescents and children weighing from 20 kg to <50 kg  a 1 mg/kg/day is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 3 mg/kg/day. For children weighing from 10 kg to <20 kg  a 1 mg/kg/day is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 4 mg/kg/day. No clinical data are available in paediatric patients with hepatic impairment. The efficacy of brivaracetam in paediatric patients aged less than 2 years has not yet been established.Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance  other pyrrolidone derivatives or any of the excipients. Special warnings and precautions for use: Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in several indications  including brivaracetam. Patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers) should be advised to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. Clinical data on the use of brivaracetam in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment are limited. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. Brivaracetam film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance  total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take brivaracetam. Brivaracetam film-coated tablets  solution for injection/infusion and oral solution contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per tablet/vial/ml respectively  that is to say essentially 'sodium free'. Brivaracetam oral solution contains 168 mg sorbitol (E420) in each ml. Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not take this medicinal product. The oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218)  which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). Brivaracetam oral solution contains propylene glycol (E1520). Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction: In clinical studies  although patient numbers were limited  brivaracetam had no observed benefit over placebo among patients taking concomitant levetiracetam. No additional safety or tolerability concern was observed. In an interaction study between brivaracetam 200 mg single dose and ethanol 0.6 g/L continuous infusion in healthy volunteers  there was no pharmacokinetic interaction  but the effect of alcohol on psychomotor function  attention and memory was approximately doubled with the intake of brivaracetam. Intake of brivaracetam with alcohol is not recommended. In vitro data suggest that brivaracetam has a low interaction potential. The main disposition pathway of brivaracetam® is by CYP-independent hydrolysis; a second pathway involves hydroxylation mediated by CYP2C19. Brivaracetam plasma concentrations may increase when co-administered with CYP2C19 strong inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole  fluvoxamine)  but the risk of a clinically relevant CYP2C19 mediated interaction is considered to be low. Limited clinical data are available implying that coadministration of cannabidiol may increase the plasma exposure of brivaracetam  possibly through CYP2C19 inhibition  but the clinical relevance is uncertain. In healthy subjects  co-administration with the strong enzyme inducer rifampicin (600 mg/day for 5 days)  decreased brivaracetam area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) by 45%. Prescribers should consider adjusting the dose of brivaracetam in patients starting or ending treatment with rifampicin. Brivaracetam plasma concentrations are decreased when co-administered with strong enzyme-inducing AEDs (carbamazepine  phenobarbital  phenytoin) but no dose adjustment is required. Other strong enzyme inducers such as St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may decrease the systemic exposure of brivaracetam. Starting or ending treatment with St John's wort should be done with caution. Brivaracetam at 50 or 150 mg/day did not affect the AUC of midazolam (metabolised by CYP3A4). The risk of clinically relevant CYP3A4 interactions is considered low. In vitro studies have shown that brivaracetam exhibits little or no inhibition of CYP450 isoforms except for CYP2C19 and may therefore increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. lansoprazole  omeprazole  diazepam). Brivaracetam did not induce CYP1A1/2 but induced CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in vitro. No CYP3A4 induction was found in vivo. CYP2B6 induction has not been investigated in vivo and brivaracetam may decrease plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 (e.g. efavirenz). In vitro interaction studies to determine the potential inhibitory effects on transporters concluded that there were no clinically relevant effects  except for OAT3. In vitro  brivaracetam inhibits OAT3 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration 42-fold higher than the Cmax at the highest clinical dose. Brivaracetam 200 mg/day may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products transported by OAT3. Brivaracetam is a moderate reversible inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase  resulting in an increased concentration of carbamazepine epoxide  an active metabolite of carbamazepine. In controlled clinical studies  carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration increased by a mean of 37%  62% and 98% with little variability at Brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day  100 mg/day and 200 mg/day  respectively. No safety risks were observed. There was no additive effect of brivaracetam and valproate on the AUC of carbamazepine epoxide. No dose adjustment is needed when brivaracetam is co-administered with carbamazepine  phenobarbital or phenytoin. Brivaracetam had no clinically relevant effect on the plasma concentrations of clobazam  clonazepam  lacosamide  lamotrigine  levetiracetam  oxcarbazepine  phenobarbital  phenytoin  pregabalin  topiramate  valproic acid or zonisamide. There are no data available on the effects of clobazam  clonazepam  lacosamide  pregabalin or zonisamide on brivaracetam plasma concentrations. Co-administration of brivaracetam (100 mg/day) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of either substance. However  when brivaracetam was co-administered at a dose of 400 mg/day (twice the recommended maximum daily dose)  a reduction in estrogen and progestin AUCs of 27% and 23%  respectively  was observed without impact on suppression of ovulation. Pregnancy: Data on the use of brivaracetam in pregnant women are limited. There are no data on placental transfer in humans  but brivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta in rats. The potential risk for humans is unknown. Animal studies did not detect any teratogenic potential of brivaracetam. In clinical studies  adjunctive brivaracetam used concomitantly with carbamazepine induced a dose-related increase in the concentration of the active metabolite  carbamazepine-epoxide. There are insufficient data to determine the clinical significance of this effect in pregnancy. Brivaracetam should not be used during pregnancy unless clinically necessary. Breast-feeding: Brivaracetam is excreted in human breast milk. The decision to discontinue either breastfeeding or brivaracetam should be made based on the benefit of the medicinal product to the mother. In case of co-administration of brivaracetam and carbamazepine  the amount of carbamazepine-epoxide excreted in breast milk could increase. The clinical significance remains unknown. Fertility: No human data on the effect of brivaracetam on fertility are available. There was no effect on fertility in rats. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Brivaracetam has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machines until they are familiar with the effects of brivaracetam on their ability to perform such activities. Undesirable effects: The most frequently reported adverse reactions with brivaracetam were somnolence (14.3%) and dizziness (11.0%); they were usually mild-to-moderate in intensity. Somnolence and fatigue were reported at a higher incidence with increasing dose. Very common adverse reactions (≥1%-<10%) were influenza  decreased appetite  depression  anxiety  insomnia  irritability  convulsion  vertigo  upper respiratory tract infections  cough  nausea  vomiting  constipation and fatigue. Neutropenia was reported in 6/1099 (0.5%) of brivaracetam and none (0/459) of the placebo-treated patients. Four of these subjects had decreased neutrophil counts at baseline. None of the neutropenia cases were severe  required any specific treatment or led to discontinuation of brivaracetam and none had associated infections. Suicidal ideation was reported in 0.3% (3/1099) of brivaracetam and 0.7% (3/459) of placebo-treated patients. In short-term clinical studies of brivaracetam in patients with epilepsy  there were no cases of completed suicide and suicide attempt; however  both were reported in open-label extension studies. The safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children from 1 month of age was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults. In the open label  uncontrolled  long-term studies suicidal ideation was reported in 4.7 % of paediatric patients (assessed from 6 years onwards  more common in adolescents) compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioural disorders were reported in 24.8 % of paediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority of events were mild or moderate in intensity  were non-serious  and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug. An additional adverse reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity (4.7 %). No specific pattern of adverse event (AE) was identified in children from 1 month to < 4 years of age when compared to older paediatric age groups. No significant safety information was identified indicating the increasing incidence of a particular AE in this age group. As data available in children younger than 2 years of age are limited  brivaracetam is not indicated in this age range. Limited clinical data are available in neonates. Reactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of brivaracetam patients (9/3022) during clinical development. Overdose: There is limited clinical experience with brivaracetam overdose in humans. Somnolence and dizziness have been reported in a healthy subject taking a single dose of 1 400 mg of brivaracetam. The following adverse reactions were reported with brivaracetam overdose: nausea  vertigo  balance disorder  anxiety  fatigue  irritability  aggression  insomnia  depression  and suicidal ideation in the post-marketing experience. In general  the adverse reactions associated with brivaracetam overdose were consistent with the known adverse reactions. There is no specific antidote for overdose with brivaracetam. Treatment of an overdose should include general supportive measures. Since <10% of brivaracetam is excreted in urine  haemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance brivaracetam clearance.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information.https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/briviact-epar-product-information_en.pdfImportant Safety Information about VIMPAT® (lacosamide) in the EU3Therapeutic indications: VIMPAT® is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy. VIMPAT® is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy and in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults  adolescents and children from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy.Posology and method of administration: Lacosamide therapy can be initiated with either oral administration (either tablets or syrup) or IV administration (solution for infusion). The physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and dose. A loading dose may be initiated in patients in situations when the physician determines that rapid attainment of lacosamide steady state plasma concentration and therapeutic effect is warranted. It should be administered under medical supervision with consideration of the potential for increased incidence of serious cardiac arrhythmia and Central Nervous System (CNS) adverse reactions. Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in acute conditions such as status epilepticus. Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in children. Use of a loading dose is not recommended in adolescents and children weighing less than 50 kg. No dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired adult and paediatric patients (CLCR > 30 ml/min). In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with mild or moderate renal impairment  a loading dose of 200 mg may be considered  but further dose titration (>200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/min) or with end-stage renal disease  a maximum dose of 250 mg/day is recommended and the dose titration should be performed with caution. In paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/min) and in those with end-stage renal disease  a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose is recommended. A maximum dose of 300 mg/day is recommended for paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and for adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Based on data in adults  in paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with mild to moderate hepatic impairment  a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose should be applied. Lacosamide should be administered to adult and paediatric patients with severe hepatic impairment only when the expected therapeutic benefits are anticipated to outweigh the possible risks. The dose may need to be adjusted while carefully observing disease activity and potential side effects in the patient. In adolescents and adults weighing 50 kg or more with mild to moderate hepatic impairment a loading dose of 200mg may be considered  but further dose titration (>200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. Lacosamide is not recommended for use in children below the age of 4 years in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures and below the age of 2 years in the treatment of partial-onset seizures as there are limited data on safety and efficacy in these age groups. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients; known second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Special warnings and precautions for use: Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic medicinal products in several indications. Therefore  patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviour and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. Dose-related prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies. Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems or severe cardiac diseases (e.g. myocardial ischaemia/infarction  heart failure  structural heart disease or cardiac sodium channelopathies) or patients treated with medicinal products affecting cardiac conduction  including antiarrhythmics and sodium channel blocking antiepileptic medicinal products  as well as in elderly patients. In these patients it should be considered to perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) before a lacosamide dose increase above 400mg/day and after lacosamide is titrated to steady-state. In the placebo-controlled clinical studies of lacosamide in epilepsy patients  atrial fibrillation or flutter were not reported; however both have been reported in open-label epilepsy studies and in post-marketing experience. In post-marketing experience  AV block (including second degree or higher AV block) has been reported. In patients with proarrhythmic conditions  ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been reported. In rare cases  these events have led to asystole  cardiac arrest and death in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions. Patients should be made aware of the symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. slow  rapid or irregular pulse  palpitations  shortness of breath  feeling lightheaded  fainting). Patients should be counselled to seek immediate medical advice if these symptoms occur. Treatment with lacosamide has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury or falls. Therefore  patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicine. New onset or worsening of myoclonic seizures has been reported in both adult and paediatric patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS)  in particular during titration. In patients with more than one seizure type  the observed benefit of control for one seizure type should be weighed against any observed worsening in another seizure type. The safety and efficacy of lacosamide in paediatric patients with epilepsy syndromes in which focal and generalised seizures may coexist have not been determined. VIMPAT® syrup contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). Vimpat Syrup contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicine. Sorbitol may cause gastrointestinal discomfort and mild laxative effect. The syrup contains aspartame (E951)  a source of phenylalanine  which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria. Neither non-clinical nor clinical data are available to assess aspartame use in infants below 12 weeks of age. Vimpat syrup contains propylene glycol (E1520). VIMPAT® syrup contains 1.42 mg sodium per ml  equivalent to 0.07 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. VIMPAT® solution for infusion contains 59.8 mg sodium per vial  equivalent to 3% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Lacosamide may have minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Lacosamide treatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision. Accordingly  patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machinery until they are familiar with the effects of lacosamide on their ability to perform such activities. Undesirable effects: The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥10%) are dizziness  headache  nausea and diplopia. They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Some were dose-related and could be alleviated by reducing the dose. Incidence and severity of CNS and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time. Incidence of CNS adverse reactions such as dizziness may be higher after a loading dose. Other common adverse reactions (≥1% - <10%) are depression  confusional state  insomnia  balance disorder  myoclonic seizures  ataxia  memory impairment  cognitive disorder  somnolence  tremor  nystagmus  hypoesthesia  dysarthria  disturbance in attention  paraesthesia  vision blurred  vertigo  tinnitus  vomiting  constipation  flatulence  dyspepsia  dry mouth  diarrhoea  pruritus  rash  muscle spasms  gait disturbance  asthenia  fatigue  irritability  feeling drunk  injection site pain or discomfort (local adverse events associated with intravenous administration)  irritation (local adverse events associated with intravenous administration)  fall  and skin laceration and contusion. The use of lacosamide is associated with dose-related increase in the PR interval. Adverse reactions associated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. atrioventricular block  syncope  bradycardia) may occur. Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions: Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms  DRESS) have been reported in patients treated with some antiepileptic medicinal products. These reactions are variable in expression but typically present with fever and rash and can be associated with involvement of different organ systems. If multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction is suspected  lacosamide should be discontinued. The safety profile of lacosamide in adjunctive therapy in paediatric patients with partial-onset seizures was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults. The additional adverse reactions observed in the paediatric population were pyrexia  nasopharyngitis  pharyngitis  decreased appetite  abnormal behaviour and lethargy. Somnolence was reported more frequently in the paediatric population (≥ 1/10) compared to the adult population (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10).Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information.https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/vimpat-epar-product-information_en.pdfImportant Safety Information about FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) in the US4FINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA REMS. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at +1 877 964 3649.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration  of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring : Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35 mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of VHD and PAH  how to recognize signs and symptoms of VHD and PAH  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSIn patients with severe impairment of kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m2  dosage adjustments are recommended. FINTEPLA has not been studied in patients with kidney failure (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m2).Combined molar exposures of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were increased in subjects with various degrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A  B  and C)  necessitating a dosage adjustment in these patients.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact UCB  Inc. at 1 844-599-2273 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning and Medication Guide  for additional Important Safety Information on FINTEPLA.Important Safety Information about BRIVIACT® (brivaracetam) in the US5BRIVIACT® (brivaracetam) CV is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSSuicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs  including BRIVIACT  increase the risk of suicidal behavior and ideation. Monitor patients taking BRIVIACT for the emergence or worsening of depression; unusual changes in mood or behavior; or suicidal thoughts  behavior  or self-harm. Advise patients  their caregivers  and/or families to be alert for these behavioral changes and report them immediately to a healthcare provider.Neurological Adverse Reactions: BRIVIACT causes somnolence  fatigue  dizziness  and disturbance in coordination. Monitor patients for these signs and symptoms and advise them not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on BRIVIACT.Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: BRIVIACT causes psychiatric adverse reactions  including non-psychotic and psychotic symptoms in adult and pediatric patients. Advise patients to report these symptoms immediately to a healthcare provider.Hypersensitivity: BRIVIACT can cause hypersensitivity reactions. Bronchospasm and angioedema have been reported. Discontinue BRIVIACT if a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction after treatment. BRIVIACT is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to brivaracetam or any of the inactive ingredients.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with all antiepileptic drugs  BRIVIACT should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus.DOSING CONSIDERATIONSDose adjustments are recommended for patients with all stages of hepatic impairment.When BRIVIACT is co-administered with rifampin  an increase in the BRIVIACT dose is recommended.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn adult adjunctive therapy placebo-controlled clinical trials  the most common adverse reactions (at least 5% for BRIVIACT and at least 2% more frequently than placebo) were somnolence and sedation  dizziness  fatigue  and nausea and vomiting symptoms. Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies of pediatric patients were generally similar to those in adult patients. Adverse reactions with BRIVIACT injection in adult and pediatric patients were generally similar to those observed with BRIVIACT tablets. Other adverse events that occurred in adult patients who received BRIVIACT injection included dysgeusia  euphoric mood  feeling drunk  and infusion site pain.BRIVIACT is a Schedule V controlled substance.Please refer to the full Prescribing Information and visit www.BRIVIACThcp.com.Important Safety Information about VIMPAT® (lacosamide) in the US6VIMPAT® is indicated for treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older  and as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 4 years of age and older.VIMPAT IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONVIMPAT® is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older. VIMPAT is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 4 years of age and older.VIMPAT is associated with important warnings and precautions including suicidal behavior and ideation  dizziness and ataxia  cardiac rhythm and conduction abnormalities  syncope  and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)  also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity.Partial-Onset SeizuresIn the adult adjunctive placebo-controlled trials for partial-onset seizures  the most common adverse reactions (≥10% and greater than placebo) were dizziness  headache  nausea  and diplopia. In the adult monotherapy clinical trial  adverse reactions were generally similar to those observed and attributed to drug in adjunctive placebo-controlled trials  with the exception of insomnia (observed at a higher rate of ≥2%).Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic SeizuresIn the adjunctive therapy placebo-controlled trial for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures  the adverse reactions were generally similar to those that occurred in the partial-onset seizures trials. The adverse reactions most commonly reported were dizziness  somnolence  headache  and nausea.Pediatric PatientsAdverse reactions reported in clinical studies for partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month to less than 17 years of age and for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures for patients 4 to less than 17 years of age were similar to those seen in adult patients.InjectionIn adult adjunctive therapy clinical trials for partial-onset seizures  adverse reactions with intravenous administration generally were similar to those that occurred with the oral formulation  although intravenous administration was associated with local adverse reactions such as injection site pain or discomfort (2.5%)  irritation (1%)  and erythema (0.5%). When administering a loading dose  the incidence of CNS adverse reactions  such as dizziness  somnolence  and paresthesia  may be higher with 15-minute administration than over a 30- to 60-minute period. The adverse reactions associated with VIMPAT injection in adult patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures are expected to be similar to those seen in adults with partial- onset seizures. The adverse reactions associated with VIMPAT injection in pediatric patients are expected to be similar to those noted in adults. Infusion times less than 30 minutes were not adequately studied in pediatric patients.VIMPAT (lacosamide) is a Schedule V controlled substance.Please refer to the full Prescribing Information.BRIVIACT®  FINTEPLA®  NAYZILAM®  and ucbCARES® are registered trademarks of the UCB Group of Companies.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise.
