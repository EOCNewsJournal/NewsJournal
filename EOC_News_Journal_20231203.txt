The issue has divided the 27-nation bloc  with Belgium  Germany  France  Italy and Luxembourg among those urging a more gradual approach.The European Central Bank (ECB) vice president  Luis de Guindos  also warned this week that using the funds could have serious reputational implications for Europe’s single currency.Over €200 billion of Russia’s sanctioned sovereign assets are estimated to have been frozen by the EU  with most of it at the Belgium-based Euroclear clearinghouse. Those funds have reportedly generated nearly €3 billion in profits from the time they were frozen in March 2022 through the third quarter of this year  with the figure projected to rise further.Russia has repeatedly criticized the freezing of its assets as illegal under international law  describing it as theft.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.06,0.82,0.12,negative,0.02,0.21,0.77,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU', 'plan', 'Bloomberg', 'The European Central Bank', 'Russian central bank assets', 'The European Union', 'Western financial system', 'Luis de Guindos', 'serious reputational implications', 'Belgium-based Euroclear clearinghouse', 'ECB) vice president', 'sovereign assets', 'member states', 'several issues', 'national taxes', 'other sources', 'national experts', 'numerous warnings', '27-nation bloc', 'gradual approach', 'single currency', 'third quarter', 'international law', 'business section', 'other measures', 'EU proposal', 'concerns', 'funds', 'profits', 'order', 'Ukraine', 'Bloomberg', 'person', 'discussions', 'outlet', 'plan', 'December', 'meeting', 'commission', 'differences', 'months', 'ways', 'credibility', 'currencies', 'Germany', 'France', 'Italy', 'Luxembourg', 'time', 'March', 'year', 'figure', 'freezing', 'theft', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-12-02,2023-12-03,rt.com

""The robust data being presented at AES reflect UCB's commitment to research and resources that support the rare epilepsy community. By continuing to deepen our understanding of the real-world experiences faced by people living with rare epilepsy syndromes (acute repetitive seizures and focal epilepsy)  we will be able to better support their journey to finding appropriate treatment options faster and provide resources and education over the long term.""The real-world evidence being presented at AES supports the need to integrate the lived experiences of the rare epilepsy community into the development of treatment options and resources  to bring more holistic care to people living with rare epilepsies and their caregivers.""Providing proactive education and counseling for people living with rare epilepsy syndromes and their caregivers is critical for improving seizure control  appropriate treatment adherence and management of risks like SUDEP "" said Tom Stanton   President of the Danny Did Foundation and study investigator. ""To achieve effective communication  neurologists need support to help them initiate difficult discussions about potentially negative impacts on quality of life. With the proper tools  providers can play a big role to empower and inform patients and caregivers.""The real-world data on fenfluramine  long-term care planning for rare epilepsy syndrome patients  and SUDEP counselling being presented at AES include:A 12-Month Persistence Analysis of Fenfluramine  Valproate  and Levetiracetam in Individuals with Dravet Syndrome: A Comparison Using U.S. Claims Data 1 A new analysis utilizing U.S. real-world data of fenfluramine in people living with DS. 1 Data from this late-breaking poster presentation featured U.S. healthcare claims data from Komodo Healthcare showing the persistency of fenfluramine – defined as the duration of continuous treatment without a gap of more than 90 days. 1A Survey of Rare Epilepsy Parents and Adult Siblings: To Assess Resources Needed to Prepare Families Living in the U.S. for Long-term Adult Care Planning for Their Loved One 2 Survey assessed resources and needs required for caregivers' long-term care planning for a family member diagnosed with a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). 2 Data from a survey of 135 caregivers of people with rare epilepsy syndromes  including parents and adult siblings  found that only 22% believed they had adequate access to long-term care planning information  while 53% did not have information available to them  and 24% were unsure. Those surveyed cited frustration in finding support and resources for patients with rare epilepsy syndromes and concern about how patients and their caregivers will be supported as they transition into adulthood. 2 No family support programs or resources currently exist for long-term adult care planning or for the transfer of primary care for those living with rare epilepsy syndromes  uncovering a significant unmet need for additional support to facilitate future medical  legal and financial planning and ensure caregivers have access to resources and support at every step of their care journey. 2Bridging The Gap Between Neurologists and People with Epilepsy/Caregivers: Systematic Literature R eview about SUDEP Conversations 3 Research looks to understand and learn more about caregivers' needs and experiences and neurologists' attitudes and behaviors toward SUDEP conversations. 3 A critical element of care for people living with epilepsy and rare epilepsy syndromes is the continuous management of risk related to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)  a leading disease-related cause of mortality among people living with epilepsy  affecting approximately one in 1 000 adults with epilepsy yearly 6 and one in 150 for those with inadequate seizure control. 7 A systematic literature review of studies found a gap between what people living with epilepsy and their caregivers want regarding information about SUDEP and the information shared with them by their neurologists. 3 While many neurologists reported not actively discussing SUDEP to avoid causing fear or negative emotions  data show that patients and caregivers want to have more proactive discussions about SUDEP to provide them with the opportunity to take preventive measures. Increasing education for people with epilepsy and their caregivers about SUDEP  as well as providing neurologists with support and training to become adept at initiating these difficult discussions  are critical to help build a trusting partnership to enhance epilepsy management and  in turn  reduce the risks of SUDEP. 3In addition to the other accepted posters at AES  UCB will present additional clinical data on FINTEPLA.

We will continue to reimagine how we care for patients  leveraging today's expertise for a better tomorrow. With so much experience behind us and so much potential ahead  we are more invested than ever in profoundly improving the lives of those living with or caring for those with epilepsy or a rare epilepsy syndrome – through our relentless pursuit of a seizure-free life.About FINTEPLA ® (fenfluramine) Oral Solution 11FINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA REMS. Further information is available at www.FINTEPLAREMS.com or by telephone at +1 877 964 3649.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration  of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35 mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of VHD and PAH  how to recognize signs and symptoms of VHD and PAH  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FINTEPLAREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSIn patients with severe impairment of kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) 15 to 29 mL/min/ 1.73m 2   dosage adjustments are recommended. FINTEPLA has not been studied in patients with kidney failure (eGFR <15 mL/min/ 1.73m 2 ).Combined molar exposures of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were increased in subjects with various degrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A  B  and C)  necessitating a dosage adjustment in these patients.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact UCB  Inc. at 1‑844-599-2273 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch .Please see full Prescribing Information   including Boxed Warning and Medication Guide   for additional Important Safety Information on FINTEPLA.For further information  contact UCB:Corporate CommunicationsBecky Malone   U.S. Media RelationsT +919.605.9600Becky.Malone@ucb.comInvestor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.9414antje.witte@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium ( www.ucb.com ) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.
