(“JJDC”) for 901 256 additional ordinary shares of the Company  in the form of restricted American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”)  for an aggregate amount of $4.8 million  equivalent to €4.6 million1 (the “Remaining Placement Amount”  and the subscription transaction being the “Remaining Placement”)  following the approval by the French Ministry of Economy of JJDC Remaining Placement on November 22  2023  in accordance with the French foreign investment control rules2.As previously announced  pursuant to an existing securities purchase agreement  JJDC was obligated to subscribe  subject to any required regulatory approvals  for $25.0 million of the Company’s restricted ADSs (the “Placement Amount”)  exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933  as amended. Pursuant to French foreign investment control rules  the Placement Amount as initially agreed was reduced  such that JJDC had initially subscribed for 3 762 923 restricted ADSs (representing  together with JJDC’s existing stake  9.99% of the then outstanding voting rights of the Company’s capital stock  as of the issuance date thereof) for gross proceeds to the Company of $20.2 million (the “Initial Placement”). The subscription by JJDC of the Remaining Placement Amount was conditioned upon the approval of the French Ministry of Economy.Story continuesForm of the Remaining PlacementThe Remaining Placement was carried out by way of a share capital increase for an aggregate amount of $4.8 million (issue premium included) decided on November 22  2023 by the Company’s Executive Board pursuant to the delegation granted to it by the Company’s combined shareholders’ meeting held on June 27  2023 in its 25th resolution in accordance with Article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) through the issuance of 901 256 additional ordinary shares  €0.03 nominal value per share of the Company (each an “Ordinary Share”)  in the form of restricted ADSs reserved to a specific investor meeting the criteria defined by the shareholders’ meeting in the 25th resolution – i.e.  an industrial company  institution or entity operating in the healthcare or biotechnology sector  either directly or through a controlled company or a company by which they are controlled  where applicable when entering into a commercial agreement  financing contract or partnership with the Company.The subscription price per Ordinary Share and per ADS of the Remaining Placement is equivalent to the subscription price per Ordinary Share and per ADS of the Initial Placement. The subscription price per Ordinary Share is equal to the volume weighted average price of the Ordinary Shares on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris (“Euronext”) over the last three trading sessions preceding the pricing of the Remaining Placement (i.e. November 22  21 and 20  2023)  less a discount of 8 88%  in accordance with the 25th resolutions of the Company’s combined shareholders’ meeting held on June 27  2023.The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Remaining Placement as described in the Company’s press release dated November 6  2023.As of November 30th  2023  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €77.2 million (unaudited).

This compares favourably with UK figures  where just 37% of FTSE 150 companies have such a committee.When it comes to the participation of senior board members  83% of these committees have at least one such member represented  and 42% have two or more  the index noted.The 2023 Ireland Board Index research was carried out at a time of significant change in the Irish board landscape  with a number of former ISEQ 20 companies delisting from Euronext Dublin  in favour of US listings.Since the research was carried out  Flutter Entertainment has also delisted  following in the footsteps of CRH  whose high-profile exit took place earlier this year.""It's certainly been a turbulent period for the Dublin Euronext exchange - we've seen a number of high-profile exits  with several more companies openly considering their own future on the Euronext "" Ruth Curran said.She said the preference for the US Stock Exchange over Ireland is clearly one of scale  with greater trading volumes and increased earning potential.""But we must also admit that there are some other push factors at play  such as higher stamp duty costs on shares in Ireland  and the regulatory complexities associated with dual listings. Some big decisions lie ahead for Euronext Dublin and Irish policymakers to ensure that Ireland remains a viable and attractive option for companies examining their listing options""  she added.",neutral,0.05,0.57,0.38,positive,0.53,0.44,0.04,True,English,"['ISEQ 20 firms', 'top roles', 'women', 'index', 'higher stamp duty costs', '2023 Ireland Spencer Stuart Board Index', 'The 2023 Ireland Board Index research', 'Irish Residential Properties REIT', 'first Ireland Board Index', 'executive board positions', 'shifting board landscape', 'senior board members', 'Siobhán Talbot', 'other push factors', 'Irish board members', 'Irish board landscape', 'Spencer Stuart Ireland', 'senior leadership positions', 'greater trading volumes', 'one Chair position', 'US Stock Exchange', 'female non-executive directors', 'two female CEOs', 'Dublin Euronext exchange', 'largest 20 ISEQ companies', 'former ISEQ 20 companies', 'board leadership', 'two CEOs', 'The UK', '33% female representation', 'greater diversity', 'female membership', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Irish nationals', 'Irish boardrooms', 'Irish businesses', 'Irish policymakers', 'Ireland boards', 'ISEQ 20 boardrooms', 'new report', 'past year', 'comprehensive review', 'market value', 'fourth year', 'new appointees', 'new director', 'three CFOs', 'Margaret Sweeney', 'common source', 'continued internationalisation', 'Ruth Curran', 'Managing Partner', 'government target', 'diversity initiatives', 'Ms Curran', 'significant way', 'continued investment', 'ESG) policies', 'FTSE 150 companies', 'significant change', 'US listings', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'high-profile exit', 'turbulent period', 'earning potential', 'regulatory complexities', 'dual listings', 'big decisions', 'attractive option', 'listing options', 'Irish boards', 'ISEQ 20 boards', 'top boards', 'individual boards', 'governance practices', 'ESG committee', 'UK figures', 'steady increase', '2022 figures', '12% increase', 'country', 'number', 'women', 'end', 'April', 'Glanbia', 'roles', 'survey', 'Austria', 'Australia', 'Netherlands', 'Sweden', 'reflection', 'recognition', 'outlook', 'quality', 'decision-making', 'impact', 'need', 'Social', 'participation', 'committees', 'time', 'favour', 'footsteps', 'CRH', 'place', 'several', 'future', 'preference', 'scale', 'play', 'shares', 'viable', '42']",2023-12-04,2023-12-04,rte.ie

Conducted in partnership with Proxymity ...,Euronext SRD II survey sees dramatic rise in shareholder identification engagementEuronext Corporate Services has released the results of its European survey on shareholder identification for European issuers in a report titled ‘How issuers across Europe use this untapped benefit of SRD II’.Conducted in partnership with Proxymity  the survey follows the 2020 implementation of the Shareholders Rights Directive II (SRD II). Main trends in shareholder disclosure request practices are analysed by company profile and by country.More than 5000 European listed companies participated in the research  with companies analysed across Belgium  France  Germany  the Netherlands and Portugal.The survey found a 38 per cent increase in the number of listed companies using share registers between 2021 and 2022.A 73 per cent YoY increase was seen in the number of small and mid-sized companies classed as ‘active’ in the identification of their shareholders  rising to 474 in 2022. Among issuers  863 were reported to be proactively identifying their shareholders.Euronext states that the findings mark a “positive change and a new norm” in how European listed companies are structuring their corporate governance.Mathieu Caron  head of primary markets at Euronext  comments: “This survey on shareholder identification practices highlights primarily that the SRD II directive has liberalised the use of shareholder consultation  which is critical for companies of all sizes with ambitious growth and ESG strategies.“We welcome the successful adoption of the SRD II framework by listed companies  which improves transparency in their dialogue with final shareholders. We are now  as a consequence of the directive  able to provide more efficient data collection and management  and are seeing an increasing number of issuers choosing to use this service and are moving further with bond-holders engagement service.”,neutral,0.07,0.92,0.01,positive,0.78,0.21,0.01,True,English,"['Euronext SRD II survey', 'shareholder identification engagement', 'dramatic rise', '73 per cent YoY increase', 'shareholder disclosure request practices', 'Shareholders Rights Directive II', '38 per cent increase', 'Euronext SRD II survey', 'efficient data collection', 'SRD II framework', 'shareholder identification practices', 'SRD II directive', 'shareholder identification engagement', 'bond-holders engagement service', 'Euronext Corporate Services', '5000 European listed companies', 'shareholder consultation', 'corporate governance', 'European survey', 'dramatic rise', 'untapped benefit', 'Main trends', 'company profile', 'share registers', 'positive change', 'new norm', 'Mathieu Caron', 'primary markets', 'ambitious growth', 'ESG strategies', 'successful adoption', 'final shareholders', 'mid-sized companies', 'European issuers', 'increasing number', 'results', 'report', 'partnership', 'Proxymity', '2020 implementation', 'country', 'More', 'research', 'Belgium', 'France', 'Germany', 'Netherlands', 'Portugal', 'small', 'findings', 'head', 'use', 'sizes', 'transparency', 'dialogue', 'consequence', 'management']",2023-12-04,2023-12-04,assetservicingtimes.com
