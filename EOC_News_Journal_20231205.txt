Or follow us on Google NewsHere at CleanTechnica  we’re interested in all things  well  clean tech. Because our readers tend to be individuals who want to learn more about the newest and most impressive companies and startups out there  we’ve decided to ramp up our coverage of clean tech investing. Are you someone who’s searching for new ideas as we enter 2024 and hoping to find investments leveraging key mega-trends? Then let’s start by checking out the US Climate Investor Conference 2023  seeing which companies are taking center stage  and learning a little more about innovative and leading edge companies in sustainability.The US Climate Investor Conference 2023 is presented by Water Tower Research  and it will take place virtually on Thursday  December 7. The conference is appealing to the climate investor who feels that the climate sector has numerous companies that are not fully understood by the investment community. This likely is because information flow has slowed or in many instances completely disappeared due to rapidly changing sell-side dynamics. Their climate tech and sustainable investing research focus is guided by two key principles: sustainability and resiliency.Sustainability is the ability of a product or service to lower the overall carbon footprint and/or reduce resource consumption. This can be driven by a variety of factors including renewable power generation  renewable fuels and chemicals  energy efficiency  resource management  emissions control  and the broader bioeconomy.Resiliency is the ability of a company’s business model and product to sustain long-term growth. Is it flexible enough to adjust and navigate through a variety of external events? Will drive demand for the company’s product or service likely to perform above average through economic cycles  regulatory shifts  geopolitical volatility  and pandemics?With that backdrop  their US Climate Investor Conference 2023 will showcase a full day of presentations by a select group of companies in the climate tech and sustainable investing industry. Here are the confirmed companies for the event.Alternus Energy is a transatlantic clean energy independent power producer (IPP)  currently listed on the Euronext Growth Oslo. Headquartered in Ireland  they develop  install  own  and operate utility scale solar parks in Europe and the US. Their goal is to reach 3GW’s of operational projects within 5 years through continued organic development activities and targeted strategic opportunities.Base Carbon Inc. channels experience in natural resources across environmental markets  portfolio construction  and technology infrastructure to provide innovative solutions to the carbon economy. They say that the demand for carbon credits could increase by a factor of 15 or more by 2030 and by a factor of up to 100 by 2050. Overall  they envision that the market for carbon credits could be worth upward of $50 billion in 2030.Gevo Inc.’s product line focuses on decarbonization of the process to give high-protein animal feed the lowest carbon levels in its life-cycle inventory (LCI) as possible. Additionally  each of the energy-dense liquids they derive from the leftover starch  as well as chemicals and other products have the lowest carbon life-cycle inventory they can engineer. The LCI  based on the Argonne GREET model  is widely considered to be the best yardstick of true carbon intensity in sustainably produced animal feed as well as renewable fuels and chemicals produced to replace fossil fuels  because this metric takes into account the full range of carbon emissions and sequestration from all steps of the process.Greenland Technologies Holding Corp. is a transmission and drivetrain systems provider for material handling equipment such as forklift trucks for industrial and logistic applications. It is a leading developer of innovative and quality solutions in the material handling industry. They have gained the trust and reputation to become the leading transmission and drivetrain systems provider for material handling equipment in China.Loop Industries supports the global shift to a circular plastics economy. Loop’s innovative depolymerization technology upcycles highest purity plastic from waste feedstocks  such as polyester fibers from carpets and clothing  colored plastic  and opaque plastic. Its patented low-energy process breaks down this would-be waste into its base monomers (individual molecules)  monoethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate. Using low heat and no pressure  the monomers are purified  removing all solid waste and contaminants such as coloring  additives  and organic or inorganic impurities. The purified DMT and MEG are then polymerized (or re-combined) into Loop branded virgin-quality PET resin that is suitable for use in food-grade packaging.Ocean Power Technologies provides intelligent maritime solutions and services that enable safer  cleaner  and more productive ocean operations for the defense and security  science and research  and offshore wind markets. Their PowerBuoy platforms provide clean and reliable electric power and real-time data communications for remote maritime and subsea applications.

They strive to provide their shareholders with strong capital returns  growth  and a stable distribution  all while helping reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. They believe in creating a lasting positive environmental impact and providing shareholders with enhanced returns.Revolve Renewable Power Corp. develops utility scale renewable energy generation projects in North America with a particular focus on wind  solar  and battery storage technologies. It currently has a portfolio of 2838 megawatts (or “MW”) of projects under active development and a further 2000MW of ‘greenfield’ opportunities  which it is in the process of converting to its pipeline in the near term. This pipeline is split between 1820MW of wind projects  2400MW of solar & battery storage projects  and a 50MW dedicated battery storage project.SES AI Corporation is a US hardware and software company that takes a systems approach to develop and commercialize Li-Metal batteries.

The DMC  composed of a group of independent experts  arrived at this recommendation after review of the safety data of patients enrolled in the NATiV3 trial.The DMC review supports the continuation of the NATiV3 clinical trial  in the absence of a safety signal that would require any modification to the trial protocol. This safety assessment was based on the review of safety data from more than 500 patients  including patients that have been treated with lanifibranor for more than 72 weeks. This positive recommendation confirms the good safety and tolerability profile of lanifibranor.Dr Michael Cooreman  Chief Medical Officer  commented: “We are pleased to see the continued good safety profile of lanifibranor in patients with NASH at this stage of our study as more patients are enrolled in the NATiV3 clinical trial and have been receiving treatment with lanifibranor for longer periods of time. As an orally-available small molecule and the only pan-PPAR agonist currently in clinical development for the treatment of NASH  lanifibranor has a unique mechanism of action  targeting the broad disease biology of NASH with fibrosis. We are very excited about the potential therapeutic benefits that it could bring to patients  if approved.”About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce antifibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms  which are well-characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well-balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.About the NATiV3 Phase III trialNATiV3 is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of lanifibranor (800mg/daily and 1200mg/daily) in adult patients with biopsy-proven non-cirrhotic NASH and F2/F3 stage of liver fibrosis. The trial is designed to take place in approximately 24 countries and more than 350 clinical sites and to recruit approximately 900 patients to be treated over a 72-week period. The effect of lanifibranor will be assessed on several histological endpoints  including NASH resolution and improvement of fibrosis of at least one stage.An exploratory cohort is included in parallel to the NATiV3 trial and is anticipated to include approximately 200 patients with NASH and fibrosis who are not eligible for the main NATiV3 trial. Inventiva anticipates that this exploratory cohort may allow the generation of additional data using non-invasive tests and contribute to the regulatory safety database requirement to support the planned submission for potential accelerated approval to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and potential conditional approval to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) of lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.For more information about NATiV3  visit clinicaltrials.gov.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  mucopolysaccharidoses (“MPS”) and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation.

Our guests and Chinese travelers appreciate these efforts as their expectations for sustainable tourism continue to grow. The eco-certification process with China Hospitality Association helps us measure and manage our sustainability actions more effectively  moving us toward our long-term goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Gary Rosen  CEO  Accor Greater ChinaThe Green Hotel Certification process will include a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of each hotel’s performance in terms of green operations  environment  and health and safety  checked against national standards and an independent evaluation process. China Hospitality Association will also support Accor’s hotels with professional training  consultation and guidance to continuously improve the capabilities and efficiencies of their operations. Accor hotels in China will thus deepen their commitment to conservation practices  environmental protection  and creating safe and healthy atmospheres.We are proud to work with Accor Greater China as its preferred certification partner and we look forward to supporting the group with its continued efforts to make positive and influential contributions to the environment and society. With the implementation of our professional Green Hotel Certification standards  Accor is proving its leadership of the tourism industry and setting an excellent example of environmental and corporate responsibility. Chen Xinhua  President  China Hospitality AssociationThe eco-certification of its hotels is an important step along Accor’s path toward sustainable transformation in Greater China and across the industry in which it operates. Earlier this year  Accor collaborated with Trip.com and McKinsey & Company to publish an educational white paper  “The Path Toward Eco-friendly Travel in China”  which sets out a series of actions for supporting the sector’s journey towards a net positive model. Accor also formed an unprecedented alliance with Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels to create and define an ESG measurement framework tailored specifically to the hotel sector  with benchmarks for sustainable guest rooms  reducing food waste  exploring sustainable finance  and employee training.Meanwhile at its hotels  Accor Greater China is currently engaged in numerous operational efforts designed to reduce carbon emissions. Currently  hotels are implementing an industry-first biodegradable and environmentally friendly solution that replaces disposable plastic bottles of toiletries in hotels  while continuing to identify more opportunities for plastic elimination throughout the guest experience. The reduction of food waste is also a key area of priority for the region’s hotels  along with initiatives to shift thinking and encourage greater environmental sensitivity in the mindsets of guests and employees.We are thankful for the support of our partners  such as China Hospitality Association  who share our commitment to making a difference  said Mr Rosen. As we head into 2024  we will continue to find new and innovative ways of pushing forward toward our ultimate goal of achieving carbon neutrality.Accor is fully supporting its 5 500 hotels in obtaining external sustainable certifications.

Dec. 04  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO – NASDAQ: NBTX – “Nanobiotix” or the “Company”)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  announces today the closing of the previously announced subscription by Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JJDC  Inc. (“JJDC”) for 901 256 additional ordinary shares of the Company  in the form of restricted American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”)  for an aggregate amount of $4.8 million  equivalent to €4.6 million1 (the “Remaining Placement Amount”  and the subscription transaction being the “Remaining Placement”)  following the approval by the French Ministry of Economy of JJDC Remaining Placement on November 22  2023  in accordance with the French foreign investment control rules2.As previously announced  pursuant to an existing securities purchase agreement  JJDC was obligated to subscribe  subject to any required regulatory approvals  for $25.0 million of the Company’s restricted ADSs (the “Placement Amount”)  exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933  as amended. Pursuant to French foreign investment control rules  the Placement Amount as initially agreed was reduced  such that JJDC had initially subscribed for 3 762 923 restricted ADSs (representing  together with JJDC’s existing stake  9.99% of the then outstanding voting rights of the Company’s capital stock  as of the issuance date thereof) for gross proceeds to the Company of $20.2 million (the “Initial Placement”). The subscription by JJDC of the Remaining Placement Amount was conditioned upon the approval of the French Ministry of Economy.Form of the Remaining PlacementThe Remaining Placement was carried out by way of a share capital increase for an aggregate amount of $4.8 million (issue premium included) decided on November 22  2023 by the Company’s Executive Board pursuant to the delegation granted to it by the Company’s combined shareholders’ meeting held on June 27  2023 in its 25th resolution in accordance with Article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) through the issuance of 901 256 additional ordinary shares  €0.03 nominal value per share of the Company (each an “Ordinary Share”)  in the form of restricted ADSs reserved to a specific investor meeting the criteria defined by the shareholders’ meeting in the 25th resolution – i.e.  an industrial company  institution or entity operating in the healthcare or biotechnology sector  either directly or through a controlled company or a company by which they are controlled  where applicable when entering into a commercial agreement  financing contract or partnership with the Company.The subscription price per Ordinary Share and per ADS of the Remaining Placement is equivalent to the subscription price per Ordinary Share and per ADS of the Initial Placement.

Inclusion is a choice”: discussion with Accor’s Anne-Sophie Beraud and the International Paralympic Committee’s Andrew Parsons,On yesterday's International Day of Persons with Disabilities  Accor’s SVP Diversity  Equity  Inclusion & Social Care Anne-Sophie Beraud sat down with Andrew Parsons  President of the International Paralympic Committee  to discuss the opportunities ahead in p…,On yesterday's International Day of Persons with Disabilities  Accor’s SVP Diversity  Equity  Inclusion & Social Care Anne-Sophie Beraud sat down with Andrew Parsons  President of the International Paralympic Committee  to discuss the opportunities ahead in promoting the inclusion of persons with disabilities and the importance of Paris 2024 as a catalyst for change.Discover the Video of their Letter to the Future “Shifting Mindsets on Disability”Around 16% of the world’s population live with a significant form of disability  with 80% of those being invisible. As the United Nations appeals for intensified efforts to get back on track toward the targets set in 2019’s Disability Inclusion Strategy  the upcoming Paris 2024 Paralympic Games present a golden opportunity to shift mindsets.As a Premium Partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games  Accor is proud to play a role in this journey of awareness-raising. It goes to the very heart of our DNA. Making people with disabilities feel fully  generously welcomed – both through an inclusive workplace for our teams and in our hotels for our clients – goes to the core of Accor’s culture of inclusion and caring.Accor is very engaged in the inclusion of persons with disabilities. We all love sports and we are in the hospitality industry and welcoming people is part of our DNA. So  the connection between Paris 2024 and the disability cause is obvious for us. Anne-Sophie BeraudMany people with disabilities say that the problem is not in their bodies  but in a society that is not designed for all. Tristan du PlessisClosing the Understanding Gap: Paris 2024 Paralympic Games as a Catalyst for ChangeThe Paris 2024 Paralympic Games have the potential to bring lasting gains by shining a positive spotlight on disability  one that will reach four billion people in over 180 countries. As the main global event that puts persons with disabilities at center stage  the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games are about much more than just physical prowess. It’s a four-yearly opportunity to celebrate achievement  to foster understanding  and to accelerate social change.Athletes also play an important role beyond Paris 2024. Michaël Jeremiasz  a former Paralympic athlete  collaborates closely with Accor to contribute to reinforcing our approach towards persons with disabilities.Everyone must have a chance. Everyone must have an opportunity. I think one of the most effective ways to bring this change is to bring together activism and pop culture… We need athletes with disability to become icons and global icons… I believe the Paralympic Games is a catalyst. It is a very good start  and then it is up to societies to keep the ball rolling. Andrew ParsonsWhen we discuss with persons with disabilities  you understand that what they want is equal opportunity  equal rights. This event is a great opportunity to celebrate inclusion. We are very proud to be a premium partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. I think this is very important because we need to celebrate difference. Anne-Sophie BeraudInclusive Hospitality: Innovating a Better Experience for AllAccessible technology has a role to play to offer a more inclusive welcome. In hotels  in-room features such as voice-controlled amenities and motion-sensing lighting – as used in Accor’s Smart Room concept – are inclusive innovations that have potential to enhance the experience for all guests.But technology doesn’t have a monopoly on innovation. It’s also about the new ways of thinking and doing needed to create a truly inclusive workplace culture and client experiences. By redesigning recruitment processes and staff training initiatives  for example  businesses  including hospitality  can raise awareness  promote opportunity  and embed inclusion values deeply within their organizations.When you speak with [persons with disabilities] you understand that what they need is quite simple: they just want some small adjustments. I would say that we need to train staff  of course  but also work on a more accessible world in hospitality to welcome all guests. Technology and design can help us to be more inclusive…At the beginning [the Smart Room] was really designed for persons with disabilities. But today it doesn't answer only the needs of persons with a disability  it answers the needs of all people. Anne-Sophie BeraudTechnology is there to help us build a more inclusive society. It’s about making people with disabilities feel welcome  not only guests in hotels  but also its employees  and all the hospitality chain. If we have more companies like Accor changing their behavior  understanding that they need to go a step further when it comes to inclusion  we really start changing society. Andrew ParsonsBuilding a More Inclusive World TogetherFor two weeks in 2024  the world will be captivated by the breathtaking physical feats of elite athletes with disabilities. The challenge will be to hold on to that energy and understanding beyond the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games closing ceremony  using it to power greater understanding and concrete improvements 365 days of every year  for all persons with disabilities  all over the world.As a global community  we have made some progress on creating a more inclusive world for persons with disabilities. The Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games will be a golden opportunity to increase the momentum. Let’s use these Games to accelerate the pace of change towards the equitable  inclusive  and welcoming world that we all want to live in.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries in 5 500 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

Dec. 04  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO – NASDAQ: NBTX – “Nanobiotix” or the “Company”)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  announces today the closing of the previously announced subscription by Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JJDC  Inc. (“JJDC”) for 901 256 additional ordinary shares of the Company  in the form of restricted American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”)  for an aggregate amount of $4.8 million  equivalent to €4.6 million1 (the “Remaining Placement Amount”  and the subscription transaction being the “Remaining Placement”)  following the approval by the French Ministry of Economy of JJDC Remaining Placement on November 22  2023  in accordance with the French foreign investment control rules2.As previously announced  pursuant to an existing securities purchase agreement  JJDC was obligated to subscribe  subject to any required regulatory approvals  for $25.0 million of the Company’s restricted ADSs (the “Placement Amount”)  exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933  as amended. Pursuant to French foreign investment control rules  the Placement Amount as initially agreed was reduced  such that JJDC had initially subscribed for 3 762 923 restricted ADSs (representing  together with JJDC’s existing stake  9.99% of the then outstanding voting rights of the Company’s capital stock  as of the issuance date thereof) for gross proceeds to the Company of $20.2 million (the “Initial Placement”). The subscription by JJDC of the Remaining Placement Amount was conditioned upon the approval of the French Ministry of Economy.Form of the Remaining PlacementThe Remaining Placement was carried out by way of a share capital increase for an aggregate amount of $4.8 million (issue premium included) decided on November 22  2023 by the Company’s Executive Board pursuant to the delegation granted to it by the Company’s combined shareholders’ meeting held on June 27  2023 in its 25th resolution in accordance with Article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) through the issuance of 901 256 additional ordinary shares  €0.03 nominal value per share of the Company (each an “Ordinary Share”)  in the form of restricted ADSs reserved to a specific investor meeting the criteria defined by the shareholders’ meeting in the 25th resolution – i.e.  an industrial company  institution or entity operating in the healthcare or biotechnology sector  either directly or through a controlled company or a company by which they are controlled  where applicable when entering into a commercial agreement  financing contract or partnership with the Company.The subscription price per Ordinary Share and per ADS of the Remaining Placement is equivalent to the subscription price per Ordinary Share and per ADS of the Initial Placement.

The DMC  composed of a group of independent experts  arrived at this recommendation after review of the safety data of patients enrolled in the NATiV3 trial.The DMC review supports the continuation of the NATiV3 clinical trial  in the absence of a safety signal that would require any modification to the trial protocol. This safety assessment was based on the review of safety data from more than 500 patients  including patients that have been treated with lanifibranor for more than 72 weeks. This positive recommendation confirms the good safety and tolerability profile of lanifibranor.Dr Michael Cooreman  Chief Medical Officer  commented: “We are pleased to see the continued good safety profile of lanifibranor in patients with NASH at this stage of our study as more patients are enrolled in the NATiV3 clinical trial and have been receiving treatment with lanifibranor for longer periods of time. As an orally-available small molecule and the only pan-PPAR agonist currently in clinical development for the treatment of NASH  lanifibranor has a unique mechanism of action  targeting the broad disease biology of NASH with fibrosis. We are very excited about the potential therapeutic benefits that it could bring to patients  if approved.”About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce antifibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms  which are well-characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well-balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.About the NATiV3 Phase III trialNATiV3 is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of lanifibranor (800mg/daily and 1200mg/daily) in adult patients with biopsy-proven non-cirrhotic NASH and F2/F3 stage of liver fibrosis. The trial is designed to take place in approximately 24 countries and more than 350 clinical sites and to recruit approximately 900 patients to be treated over a 72-week period. The effect of lanifibranor will be assessed on several histological endpoints  including NASH resolution and improvement of fibrosis of at least one stage.An exploratory cohort is included in parallel to the NATiV3 trial and is anticipated to include approximately 200 patients with NASH and fibrosis who are not eligible for the main NATiV3 trial. Inventiva anticipates that this exploratory cohort may allow the generation of additional data using non-invasive tests and contribute to the regulatory safety database requirement to support the planned submission for potential accelerated approval to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and potential conditional approval to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) of lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.For more information about NATiV3  visit clinicaltrials.gov.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  mucopolysaccharidoses (“MPS”) and other diseases with significant unmet medical need.

These accounts have been subject to a limited review by the statutory auditors  who are in the process of issuing their report.Consolidated data (in €m)Limited review for data at 09/30Audited data for the data at 03/31 H12023/24(6 months) H12022/23(6 months) Change 2022/23fiscal year(12 months) Revenue 276.7 237.1 +17% 532.3 EBITEBIT margin 36.813.3% 29.712.5% +24% 77.014.5% Amortization of client relationshipsOther operating income and expensesOperating income (0.7)(2.8)33.2 (0.7)(3.3)25.7+29% (1.5)(2.9)72.7 Cost of net financial debtOther financial income and expensesTax charges (0.7)(0.3)(9.2) (0.4)(0.4)(6.9) (1.8)(2.3)(18.5) Group share of net incomeNet margin 23.08.3% 17.97.6% +28% 50.19.4%Half-year revenue up +17%; equivalent to +12% organic growthAt the end of H1 2023/24  Wavestone recorded a consolidated revenue of €276.7m – a solid increase of +17% over one year.As a reminder  H1 2023/24 benefited from the contributions of PEN Partnership and Coeus Consulting  consolidated  respectively  since August 1  2022  and October 1  2022. At constant scope and exchange rates  half-yearly growth amounted to +12%  despite an unfavorable working day impact of -2.2%[1].This solid progression in the half-yearly results at constant scope is the result of the intensification of business development activity over several quarters and of the headcount growth at the end of the 2022/23 fiscal year.Stabilization of the staff turnover rate at 14%; recruitment pace still moderateThe staff turnover rate has continued to decline  stabilizing at 14% at September 30  2023 (on a rolling-12-month basis); this compares with 16% for the whole of the previous fiscal year.Given the uncertain economic environment and reduced staff turnover  Wavestone is maintaining a moderate rate of recruitment compared with the previous fiscal year. At September 30  2023  Wavestone had 4 305 employees  compared with 4 406 at March 31.Despite more moderate recruitment activity  the firm is targeting an increase in the workforce over the whole of the 2023/24 fiscal year.Consultant utilization rate of 73% at the end of H1 and an increase in sales price of +1.1%After the significant drop in its consultant utilization rate at the end of the 2022/23 fiscal year (71% in Q4 2022/23)  the utilization rate had recovered to 73% at the end of H1 2023/24.The average daily rate for the six months reached €900 – an increase of +1.1% compared with the average sales price for the whole of the 2022/23 fiscal year (€890). At constant exchange rates  the average daily rate stood at €902  up +1.3%.+24% increase in EBIT – profitability of 13.3%At the end of H1 2023/24  EBIT reached €36.8m  a solid growth of +24% compared with the same period a year before.The EBIT margin stood at 13.3% at the end of H1  up compared with the first half of the previous fiscal year (12.5%)  despite an unfavorable working day impact. With an economic environment in a period of slowdown  the firm was able to take advantage of its solid growth  a good sales-price-to-salary ratio and good control of its costs.After taking into account the amortization of client relations  and other operating income and expenses  which comprise largely expenses related to the proposed combination with Q_PERIOR  operating income was €33.2m – showing robust growth of +29%.Half-year net margin rises to 8.3%Due to the rise in interest rates  the cost of net financial debt rose in H1 2023/24 to reach €0.7m  compared with €0.4m a year earlier.The tax charge amounted to €9.2m  up +33% compared with H1 of the 2022/23 fiscal year.The half-yearly group share of the net result amounted to €23.0m  a solid increase of +28%  compared with H1 2022/23. Net margin was 8.3% at the end of H1  compared with 7.6% a year earlier.Increase of 31% in self-financing capacity to €39.4mAt September 30  2023  Wavestone's self-financing capacity amounted to €39.4m  an increase of +31%  compared with the same period last year.Changes in working capital requirements (WCR) consumed €20.3m in cash over the period. This change is mainly due to the usual decrease in social debts in the first half of the year (leave-taking  bonus payments and profit-sharing in France).After taking into account the payment of taxes (€9.8m)  the firm generated an operating cash flow of €9.3m  compared with -€7.5m in H1 2022/23.Investment operations consumed €6.5m in H1 2023/24  including €5.3m dedicated to the payment of the first PEN Partnership earnout  and €1.1m in current investments.Financing flows consumed €19.7m  including €7.6m in dividends paid to shareholders for the 2022/23 fiscal year  €6.0m in share buybacks to cover all free share allocation plans to employees  €2.8m in net repayments of financial loans  and €2.6m in lease liability repayments.Available cash and cash equivalents of €13.3m at September 30  2023At September 30  2023  Wavestone's equity had reached €311.9m.The net cash position  excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities  stood at €13.3m at the end of September 2023  compared with €27.1m six months earlier.At the end of the 2023/24 fiscal year  as a result of typically higher cash generation in H2  the firm is targeting a positive net cash flow of between €55m and €60m  excluding the impact of the proposed combination with Q_PERIOR or any other new acquisition.Consolidated data (in €m)Limited review at 09/30Audited data at 03/31 (09/30/2023) (03/31/2023) Consolidated data (in €m)Limited review at 09/30Audited data at 03/31 (09/30/2023) (03/31/2023) Non-current assets 269.8 272.8 Shareholders' equity 311.9 299.1 of which goodwill 237.8 235.4 including rights to use leased assets 11.4 13.2 Financial liabilitiesof which less than one year 40.95.6 43.75.7 Current assets 193.5 193.1 Lease liabilities 13.5 15.9 of which trade receivables 175.2 176.6 Cash and cash equivalents 54.1 70.8 Non-financial liabilities 151.2 178.2 Total 517.4 536.8 Total 517.4 536.8Strong first half in 2023/24; caution maintained for the second half of the fiscal yearWavestone saw a strong first half in 2023/24  both in terms of growth in its business activity and profitability  despite the hardening economic environment during the period.Although this deterioration in the economic climate has significantly impacted demand in some business sectors (banking  retail  and the public sector)  others  such as insurance  energy  the luxury sector  and transport remain better positioned to generate opportunities. In addition  in terms of aeras of expertise  the firm is seeing strong resilience in technological areas (cybersecurity  IT strategy  Data & AI)  and a growing demand for projects around Generative AI.At September 30  2023  the order book stood at 3.6 months of work  compared with 4.0 months at March 31  2023  which reflects the slowdown in order intake typical of the summer as well as the degradation of the business environment.Wavestone is approaching the second half of the fiscal year cautiously and  in particular  the start to the 2024 calendar year  which will be marked by increased economic uncertainty.Confirmation of the 2023/24 annual objectivesWavestone confirms its financial objectives for 2023/24: to achieve organic growth at least equal to that of the 2022/23 fiscal year (+7%)  despite an unfavorable working day impact (-1.6% over the whole of the fiscal year). This objective takes into account a less robust growth dynamic in H2 2023/24  due to the moderation in the pace of recruitment since the start of the fiscal year.At full scope  integrating the effect of the full-year consolidation of PEN Partnership and Coeus Consulting  Wavestone is targeting revenue of over €580m  which represents total growth of +9% for an EBIT margin of about 15%.These objectives are at constant exchange rates  and exclude the impact of the proposed combination with Q_PERIOR or any other new acquisition.Combined General Meeting on December 5  2023  with the aim of approving the proposed combination between Wavestone and Q_PERIORThe Combined General Meeting required to decide on the combination and  in particular  on the contribution of Q_PERIOR shares remunerated in newly issued Wavestone shares  will be held tomorrow  Tuesday  December 5  2023  at 10:00am  at Pavillon Gabriel  5 avenue Gabriel  75008 Paris.The meeting will also be broadcast live for shareholders who are unable to attend in person  from a link accessible on Wavestone's website.Next events: Combined General Meeting: Tuesday  December 5  2023  at 10am; and the publication of Q3 2023/24 revenue: Tuesday  January 30  2024  after Euronext market closing.About WavestoneIn a world where knowing how to drive transformation is the key to success  Wavestone's mission is to inform and guide large organizations in their most critical transformations  with the ambition of a positive outcome for all stakeholders.

(NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announced that they have completed recruitment for the Phase 3 trial Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524) for Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15. The trial builds on previous positive Phase 1 and 2 trial results and includes both adult and pediatric participants  with the aim to confirm the efficacy  safety  lot consistency  and immunogenicity of VLA15.“We are pleased that the Phase 3 trial recruitment is complete. Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne infectious disease in the United States and Europe  can sometimes even lead to long lasting consequences ” said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head Vaccine Research and Development  Pfizer. “If approved  a vaccine could prevent the disease and ease the burden of acute  severe and sometimes persistent consequences in both adults and children. We look forward to progressing the trial with the goal of submitting a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2026  subject to positive data.”Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said: “The completion of enrollment is indeed an important milestone in the development of a potential vaccine for Lyme disease. VLA15 has the potential to address a high need in North America and Europe  as it has been designed to offer coverage for the most common circulating types of Borrelia bacteria that cause Lyme disease in these regions. We’re excited about the ongoing trials and the progress towards potentially offering a vaccine against this disease which can result in debilitating sequelae and excessive healthcare usage.”The VALOR trial  which was initiated in August 2022  has enrolled 9 437* participants five years of age and older  at sites in areas where Lyme disease is highly endemic across the U.S.  Europe and Canada. As part of the primary series  participants receive three doses of VLA15 or a saline placebo (1:1 ratio) within the first year  and one booster dose approximately one year after completion of the primary immunization.The VLA15 candidate has demonstrated a strong immune response and had a favorable safety profile across all dose and age groups in pre-clinical and clinical trials so far.1 2 No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no safety concerns were observed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).1 2 A second Phase 3 trial (C4601012)  aiming to provide further evidence on the safety profile of VLA15 in the pediatric population  is also fully recruited.The VALOR trial is expected to be concluded by the end of 2025. Pfizer and Valneva entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.3 4About VLA15There are currently no approved human vaccines for Lyme disease  and VLA15 is the most advanced Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development  with two Phase 3 trials in progress. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine candidate covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 is an alum-adjuvanted formulation  administered intramuscularly and has demonstrated a strong immune response as well as satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical trials so far.About the VALOR trialVALOR is an ongoing randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial which has enrolled 9 437* participants 5 years of age and older to receive VLA15 or a saline placebo (1:1 ratio). As part of the primary series  participants receive three doses of VLA15 within the first year at months 0  2 and 5-9  and one booster dose 9-12 months after completion of the primary immunization.5 The final primary series vaccination for participants occurs just before the peak Lyme disease season for the region. Participants will be followed for the occurrence of Lyme disease. The trial is conducted at sites located in areas where Lyme disease is highly endemic across the U.S.  Canada and Europe and has enrolled volunteers with a cleared past infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi naïve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected Ixodes ticks.6 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.7 8 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the U.S. and 129 000 people in Europe.8 9 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious chronic complications affecting the skin  joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.9 10 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.11* Number of evaluable participantsAbout Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

These persistence data are intended to supplement the existing approval by U.S. FDA and ongoing regulatory approval processes.97% of the 316 healthy adults still enrolled in the trial retained neutralizing antibody titers above the seroresponse threshold2 twenty-four months after the single-dose vaccination. The persistence of antibodies in older adults aged 65 and above was as robust as in younger adults  and even slightly higher in terms of geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates (SRRs). This outcome underscores the vaccine's potential to offer strong and lasting protection against chikungunya across different age groups. These results follow completion of the pivotal Phase 3 study published in the Lancet3 in which a seroresponse rate of 96% six months after a single vaccination1 was reported.Study VLA1553-303 collected long-term safety by following any Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) from the preceding study and collecting new-onset SAEs. No safety concerns were identified for the duration of the 24-month follow-up and  as reported in the 12-months data analysis  no AESI was ongoing when participants were enrolled in the trial.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are very pleased about these twenty-four-month data which confirm IXCHIQ®'s ability to induce a robust  long-lasting antibody response in both younger and older adults with a single vaccination. Being the world's first approved vaccine against chikungunya  each positive outcome further strengthens the defense against this significant and expanding public health threat.”Valneva was granted U.S. FDA approval4 for its chikungunya vaccine IXCHIQ® in November 20235. Two marketing applications are currently under review by EMA and Health Canada with potential approvals in mid-2024. A clinical study in adolescents is also ongoing in Brazil for which the Company reported positive pivotal Phase 3 data in November 20236. This study is intended to support label extension in this age group and licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite7. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20328. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries9. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas10 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Before IXCHIQ®  there were no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About IXCHIQ®In the U.S.  IXCHIQ® is a live-attenuated vaccine indicated for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. As for all products approved under FDA’s accelerated approval pathway  continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.IXCHIQ® (chikungunya virus  live) Solution for Intramuscular InjectionIndicationIXCHIQ® is a vaccine indicated for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on anti-CHIKV neutralizing antibody titers. Continued approval for this vaccine is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ABOUT IXCHIQ® – Please consult the full prescribing information for all the labeled safety information.ContraindicationsIXCHIQ® should not be given to individuals who have a weakened immune system due to medications used for hematologic and solid tumors  on chemotherapy  history of congenital immunodeficiency  long-term immunosuppressive therapy  or patients with HIV infection who are severely immunocompromised.Individuals with a history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine.WarningsAppropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction following administration of IXCHIQ® or any vaccine.Vaccination with IXCHIQ® may cause severe or prolonged chikungunya-like adverse reactions. Severe chikungunya-like adverse reactions that prevented daily activity and/or required medical intervention occurred in 1.6% of 3 082 IXCHIQ® recipients and no placebo recipients. Fourteen IXCHIQ® recipients had prolonged (duration at least 30 days) chikungunya-like adverse reactions.Infection of pregnant individuals with wild-type chikungunya virus can result in intra-partum transmission and potentially fatal neonatal complications. IXCHIQ® should be administered during pregnancy only after an individual risk-benefit assessment  considering maternal risk of chikungunya infection and gestational age.Fainting can occur with administration of IXCHIQ®. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting.IXCHIQ® may not protect all individuals who receive the vaccine.Adverse ReactionsThe most common injection site reaction (>10%) was tenderness (11%) and the most common systemic adverse reactions (>10%) were headache (31%)  fatigue (29%)  myalgia (24%)  arthralgia (17%)  fever (13%) and nausea (11%).Use in Specific PopulationsPregnancyThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies of IXCHIQ® in pregnant individuals  and human data available from clinical trials with IXCHIQ® are insufficient to establish the presence or absence of vaccine-associated risk during pregnancy.Please click here for full Prescribing Information for IXCHIQ®.About Phase 3 trial VLA1553-303VLA1553-303 is a single-arm  open label Phase 3 trial evaluating antibody persistence in 363 participants aged 18 years or above who were immunized with VLA1553 during the pivotal trial VLA1553-301. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the persistence of antibodies annually from one to five years after the single immunization with VLA1553. Study VLA1553-303 collected long-term safety by following-up any Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) from the preceding clinical study and collecting new-onset SAE up to two years. When participants joined the follow-up study  no AESI was ongoing.Additional information  including a detailed description of the trial design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04546724).About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

(NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announced that they have completed recruitment for the Phase 3 trial Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524) for Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15. The trial builds on previous positive Phase 1 and 2 trial results and includes both adult and pediatric participants  with the aim to confirm the efficacy  safety  lot consistency  and immunogenicity of VLA15.“We are pleased that the Phase 3 trial recruitment is complete. Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne infectious disease in the United States and Europe  can sometimes even lead to long lasting consequences ” said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head Vaccine Research and Development  Pfizer. “If approved  a vaccine could prevent the disease and ease the burden of acute  severe and sometimes persistent consequences in both adults and children. We look forward to progressing the trial with the goal of submitting a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2026  subject to positive data.”Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said: “The completion of enrollment is indeed an important milestone in the development of a potential vaccine for Lyme disease. VLA15 has the potential to address a high need in North America and Europe  as it has been designed to offer coverage for the most common circulating types of Borrelia bacteria that cause Lyme disease in these regions. We’re excited about the ongoing trials and the progress towards potentially offering a vaccine against this disease which can result in debilitating sequelae and excessive healthcare usage.”The VALOR trial  which was initiated in August 2022  has enrolled 9 437* participants five years of age and older  at sites in areas where Lyme disease is highly endemic across the U.S.  Europe and Canada. As part of the primary series  participants receive three doses of VLA15 or a saline placebo (1:1 ratio) within the first year  and one booster dose approximately one year after completion of the primary immunization.The VLA15 candidate has demonstrated a strong immune response and had a favorable safety profile across all dose and age groups in pre-clinical and clinical trials so far.1 2 No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no safety concerns were observed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).1 2 A second Phase 3 trial (C4601012)  aiming to provide further evidence on the safety profile of VLA15 in the pediatric population  is also fully recruited.The VALOR trial is expected to be concluded by the end of 2025. Pfizer and Valneva entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.3 4About VLA15There are currently no approved human vaccines for Lyme disease  and VLA15 is the most advanced Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development  with two Phase 3 trials in progress. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine candidate covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 is an alum-adjuvanted formulation  administered intramuscularly and has demonstrated a strong immune response as well as satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical trials so far.About the VALOR trialVALOR is an ongoing randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial which has enrolled 9 437* participants 5 years of age and older to receive VLA15 or a saline placebo (1:1 ratio). As part of the primary series  participants receive three doses of VLA15 within the first year at months 0  2 and 5-9  and one booster dose 9-12 months after completion of the primary immunization.5 The final primary series vaccination for participants occurs just before the peak Lyme disease season for the region. Participants will be followed for the occurrence of Lyme disease. The trial is conducted at sites located in areas where Lyme disease is highly endemic across the U.S.  Canada and Europe and has enrolled volunteers with a cleared past infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi naïve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected Ixodes ticks.6 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.7 8 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the U.S. and 129 000 people in Europe.8 9 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious chronic complications affecting the skin  joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.9 10 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.11* Number of evaluable participantsAbout Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Women now make up 37pc of Iseq 20 boards.This was driven by a number of new appointments throughout the year. Around 65pc of boards added a new director in the period  of whom 67pc were women.As a result  the number of boards with at least 33pc female representation has risen to 80pc. the report found.Spencer Stuart pointed to a “steady increase” in the number of female non-executive directors  while the number of women in top executive positions remained low.Just two chief executives  three chief financial officers and one chair position were held by women in the period under review.However  both of these chief executives – Ires Reit boss Margaret Sweeney and Glanbia group managing director Siobhán Talbot – have announced their intentions to retire next year.Almost half of new appointments to boards over the year to April 2023 were non-Irish  with a third of all directors coming from outside Ireland.“It’s positive to see that ISEQ 20 boards as a whole are already surpassing the government target of 33pc of women on boards  with 37pc of female membership across Iseq 20 boards ” Spencer Stuart managing partner Ruth Curran said.She added that the number of women on boards has jumped 42pc since 2020.“However  there are individual boards that still have a significant way to go  and there is still a need for more women in senior leadership positions in Irish boardrooms ” Ms Curran said.The Board Index was completed at a time of “significant change” as a number of former Iseq 20 companies announced plans to delist from Euronext Dublin.Flutter plans to add a listing on the New York Stock Exchange early next year  while CRH also moved its primary stock market listing to New York earlier this year.“The preference for the US Stock Exchange over Ireland is clearly one of scale  with greater trading volumes and increased earning potential  but we must also admit that there are some other push factors at play  such as higher stamp duty costs on shares in Ireland  and the regulatory complexities associated with dual listings ” Ms Curran said.,neutral,0.03,0.94,0.04,neutral,0.06,0.84,0.09,True,English,"['executive board positions', 'Women', '13pc', 'Iseq', 'report', 'Stuart managing partner Ruth Curran', 'executive search giant Spencer Stuart', 'higher stamp duty costs', 'three chief financial officers', 'Glanbia group managing director', 'primary stock market listing', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'US Stock Exchange', 'executive board positions', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'top executive positions', 'The Board Index', 'one chair position', 'Ires Reit boss', 'Siobhán Talbot', 'senior leadership positions', 'greater trading volumes', 'two chief executives', '33pc female representation', 'female non-executive directors', 'former Iseq 20 companies', 'new director', 'Ms Curran', 'top companies', 'female membership', 'Irish boardrooms', 'new appointments', 'steady increase', 'Margaret Sweeney', 'government target', 'significant way', 'significant change', 'Euronext Dublin', 'earning potential', 'regulatory complexities', 'dual listings', 'Iseq 20 boards', 'individual boards', 'outside Ireland', 'Women', '13pc', 'report', 'April', 'number', '12pc', 'year', '37pc', '65pc', 'period', '67pc', 'result', '80pc', 'review', 'intentions', 'half', 'third', 'need', 'time', 'plans', 'Flutter', 'CRH', 'preference', 'scale', 'other', 'factors', 'play', 'shares']",2023-12-04,2023-12-05,independent.ie

Recen..,"Published: Tue 5 Dec 2023  6:02 PMIn a global financial environment characterised by relentless change  iSwiss Bank has distinguished itself by setting a new standard in the industry. Recently  the bank issued the first tranche of Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)  backed by tax credits related to the Italian superbonus 110  worth almost 300 million euros. This innovative move  confirmed by iSwiss CEO Aleo Christopher  marks a step change in the financial market.The CEO of iSwiss Bank  Aleo Christopher  explained how  for the first time  the tax credits of the Superbonus 110 were transformed into securitised financial instruments  introducing new opportunities for SMEs seeking liquidity. The market reaction was highly positive  indicating a growing interest in this type of financial product  perceived as more stable than traditional bank loans.The details of the ABS tranche are remarkable: it offers an annual interest rate of 3.5 per cent and has a maturity date of October 2033. As Christopher pointed out  A distinctive feature is a single note  a strategic choice to emphasise the uniformity and quality of the underlying assets.In addition  iSwiss plans to list this tranche in the professional segment of the London Stock Exchange  assuming the role of price maker. The bank has also expanded its global presence by opening a new office in the UK.The role of iSwiss Bank in the deal is crucial  as Aleo pointed out  to minimise dependence on external entities and reduce costs  especially for its clients. ""Quotations and securities issues are costly in the initial phase "" said Aleo  ""especially for the consulting part  which is carried out by a few entities internationally and operates as an oligopoly. The other costs of quotations prevent the recourse to the financial market  as a financing channel  by SMEs that cannot afford millionaire fees from these players. As iSwiss Bank  we have created an autonomous ecosystem; we can offer access to the financial market at low costs. We foresee that in the near future  SMEs will easily be able to finance themselves on the market and not only with banks as is the case today "" concludes Aleo.In the newly launched securitisation transaction  iSwiss PAY in Canada will act as a paid agent. iSwiss Bank will play a dual role as arranger and exclusive lead manager of the transaction.Also significant is the involvement of iSwiss Securities  the group's Swedish company  which will participate by offering the new 110 superbonus securities to its customers. iSwiss Securities  a Swedish-supervised company  is a securities manager with over ten years of experience and a portfolio of private and business customers. The company was recently acquired by iSwiss Bank  which integrated its securities account management.Recently  iSwiss has also expanded its presence in the Gulf countries and Africa  managing a client and investment portfolio close to that of Europe.Managing securities issues of 16.3 billion euros  iSwiss Bank aims to become a leader in investment banking and the securities market. Operating a payments network  being a member of SWIFT  and having direct access to the Euroclear and Clearstream securities trading systems  the iSwiss group offers comprehensive and global financial solutions.The group also aims to make the stock market accessible to small and medium-sized companies  with an ongoing commitment to liquidating Italian SMEs' tax credits. Up to 2025  there will be around 30 billion euros in earthquake-related bonuses. iSwiss is already expanding its securitisation services to real estate projects  including in emerging markets and renewable energy.The superbonus 110 ABS were given an ISIN code IE0003FNUZ18  with a FISN of LUXST SEC/3.5 ASST BKD 20331030 EUR and the CFI Code DAFSFN  marking a historical moment in structured finance and positioning iSwiss Bank as an innovative pioneer in the field of ABS.— Samantha Thacker is an economist.
