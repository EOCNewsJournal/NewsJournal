See Note 11.2.The issuance of Group's condensed consolidated financial statements of the nine-month period ended September 30  2023 was approved by the Company's Board of Directors on November 10  2023.1.1. Overview of Argentine Electricity MarketTransactions among different participants in the electricity industry take place through the wholesale electricity market (""WEM"") which is a market in which generators  distributors and certain large users of electricity buy and sell electricity at prices determined by supply and demand (""Term market"") and also  where prices are established on an hourly basis based on the economic production cost  represented by the short term marginal cost measured at the system's load center (""Spot market""). CAMMESA (Compañía Administradora del Mercado Mayorista Eléctrico Sociedad Anónima) is a quasi-government organization that was established to administer the WEM and functions as a clearing house for the different market participants operating in the WEM. Its main functions include the operation of the WEM and dispatch of generation and price calculation in the Spot market  the real-time operation of the electricity system and the administration of the commercial transactions in the electricity market. Currently  the Term market has CAMMESA as sole seller  in accordance with Section 9 of SE Resolution No. 95/2013.After the Argentine economic crisis in 2001 and 2002 and the Convertibility Law  the costs of generators increased as a result of the Argentine peso devaluation. In addition  the price of fuel for their generation increased as well. The increasing generation costs combined with the freezing of rates for the final user decided by the Secretariat of Energy lead to a permanent deficit in CAMMESA accounts  which faced difficulties to pay the energy purchases to generators. Due to this structural deficit  the Secretariat of Energy issued a series of regulations to keep the electricity market working despite the deficit.Secretariat of Energy Resolution No. 59/2023On February 7  2023  Resolution No. 59/2023 (""Resolution 59"") was published in the Official Gazette whereby generators with combined cycle units are authorized to adhere to the Power Availability and Efficiency Improvement Agreement (the ""Agreement"") so as to foster the necessary investments for major and minor maintenance of the equipments.Through this agreement  adhering generators commit to reach  at least  85% of monthly average power availability in exchange of a new power and energy price formed  in part  by amounts denominated in US dollars. In the case of power  a 2 000 USD/MW-month  plus the amount in ARS corresponding to the 85% and 65% of the power value established by Resolution 826 is set for the spring/autumn and summer/winter periods  respectively. Additionally  the price for generated energy is set at 3.5 USD/MWh in case of using gas  and at 6.1 USD/MWh in case of alternative fuel (gasoil) use.On April 25  2023  CAMMESA accepted the subscription to the Agreement of all the Group's combined cycle units  except for the unit so-called Buenos Aires that belongs to Central Costanera S.A. Hence  an increase in the remuneration of these units for their sales to the spot market occurred from the transactions since March 2023.- 9 -English translation of the consolidated financial statements originally filed in Spanish with the Argentine Securities Commission (""CNV"").In case of discrepancy  the consolidated financial statements filed with the CNV prevail over this translation.CENTRAL PUERTO S.A.Regarding Buenos Aires combined cycle  on July 28  2023 CAMMESA agreed to the Agreement subscription by Central Costanera S.A. (valid as from July transactions)  once the Secretariat of Energy successfully ordered CAMMESA the following regarding the mentioned thermal unit: a) conversion to mono-fuel  i.e. operation just with natural gas  eliminating the possibility of operation with gas oil; and b) the adequation of the installed capacity to the real technical possibility of energy generation by the combined cycle. During the month of October 2023  the corrective maintenance tasks of this unit were concluded  therefore  the increases in the remuneration of this unit were applied as from the transactions of October 2023.Secretariat of Energy Resolution No. 574/2023On July 11  2023  Resolution N. 574/2023 was published  which extended for 60 days (with the possibility of being extended for 60 days more) the termination date for the Concession Agreement of the Hydroelectric Power Station Piedra del Águila  among other Argentine Hydroelectric Power Stations  whose concession term ends during 2023. This way  the Company extended the useful life of generators and auxiliary equipment of Piedra del Águila hydroelectric power station so that they depreciate up to the new termination date of the concession agreement of Piedra del Águila hydroelectric power station.Energy Secretariat Resolution No. 750/2023On September 6  2023  the Energy Secretariat Resolution No. 750/2023 (""Resolution 750"") was published in the Official Gazette. Resolution 750 updated the amounts of remuneration for power and energy for the generation which is not committed in contracts. Thus  Annexes I to IV of Resolution 826 were replaced and a 23% increase as from September 1  2023 was established.Energy Secretariat Resolution No. 869/2023On October 30  2023  the Energy Secretariat Resolution No. 869/2023 (""Resolution 869"") was published in the Official Gazette. Resolution 869 updated the amounts of remuneration for power and energy of the generation which is not committed in contracts. Thus  Annexes I to IV of Resolution 750 were replaced and a 28% increase as from November 1  2023 was established.2. Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements2.1. Applied professional accounting standardsThe Company prepares its condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the regulations in force of the Argentine Securities Commission (CNV) on Chapter III  Title IV of the CNV Regulations (N.T. 2013 as amended). Under section 1 of such section of the Regulations  companies issuing negotiable instruments must present their condensed consolidated financial statements applying Technical Resolution 26 of the Argentine Federation of Professional Councils in Economic Sciences (""FACPCE"")  which resolution establishes the application of the International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (""IASB"")  its amendments and adoption circulars of IFRS that FACPCE may establish in accordance with such Technical Resolution. Interim condensed financial statements must apply the International Accounting Standard 34 (""IAS"") ""Interim Financial Reporting"".2.2. Basis of presentation and consolidationThese condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30  2023 were prepared applying the financial information framework prescribed by CNV as mentioned in Note 2.1.In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements  the Group applied the significant accounting policies  estimates and assumptions described in Notes 2.3 and 2.4 of the issued financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022.These condensed consolidated financial statements include all the necessary information for a proper understanding by their users of the relevant facts and transactions subsequent to the issuance of the last annual financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022 and up to the date of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements. However  these condensed consolidated financial statements include neither all the information nor the disclosures required for the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IAS 1 (Presentation of financial statements). Therefore  these condensed consolidated financial statements must be read together with the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022.- 10 -English translation of the consolidated financial statements originally filed in Spanish with the Argentine Securities Commission (""CNV"").In case of discrepancy  the consolidated financial statements filed with the CNV prevail over this translation.CENTRAL PUERTO S.A.The Group's condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in Argentine pesos  which is the Group's functional currency  and all values have been rounded to the nearest thousand (ARS 000)  except when otherwise indicated.2.2.1. Measuring unitThe condensed consolidated financial statements as at September 30  2023  including the figures for the previous period were restated to consider the changes in the general purchasing power of the functional currency of the Group (Argentine peso) pursuant to IAS 29 and General Resolution no. 777/2018 of the Argentine Securities Commission. Consequently  the financial statements are stated in the current measurement unit at the end of the reported period.The effects caused by the application of IAS 29 are detailed in Note 2.2.2 to the issued consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022.The inflation was 103.15% and 66.07% in the nine-month periods ended September 30  2023 and 2022  respectively.2.3. Business combinationsBusiness combinations are accounted using the acquisition method when the Group takes effective control of the acquired company.The Group will recognize in its financial statements the acquired identifiable assets  the assumed liabilities  any non-controlling interest and  if any  goodwill according to IFRS 3.The acquisition cost is measured as the aggregate of the transferred consideration  measured at fair value on that date  and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The Group will measure the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportional interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquiree.If the business combination is made in stages  the Group will measure again its previous holding at fair value at the acquisition date and will recognize income or loss in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.Goodwill is measured at cost  as excess of the transferred consideration regarding the acquired identifiable assets and the net assumed liabilities of the Group. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the identifiable assets and of the assumed liabilities  the difference is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is higher than the consideration paid  the Group reassesses whether it has properly identified all the assets acquired and all the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in comparison to the consideration paid  then the gain is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.As described in Notes 11.1 and 11.2  dated February 17  2023 and May 3  2023  the Group acquired 75.68% of the Company Central Costanera S.A.  as well as an additional 0.0093% of such Company in a subsequent public acquisition offering  and 100% of the companies Empresas Verdes Argentina S.A.  Las Misiones S.A. and Estancia Celina S.A.  respectively.Regarding the described acquisitions  the Company is finishing to gather the necessary information to complete the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities identification and valuation process under the time- window set forth by IFRS 3. The Company will base such process on independent assessments to be made by specialists.- 11 -English translation of the consolidated financial statements originally filed in Spanish with the Argentine Securities Commission (""CNV"").In case of discrepancy  the consolidated financial statements filed with the CNV prevail over this translation.CENTRAL PUERTO S.A.2.4. Changes in accounting policiesNew standards and interpretations adoptedAs from the fiscal year beginning January 1  2022  the Group has applied for the first time certain new and/or amended standards and interpretations as issued by the IASB.Below is a brief description of the new and/or amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group and their impact on these consolidated financial statements.Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-currentIn January 2020  the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments clarify:- What is meant by a right to defer settlement. - That a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period. - That classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right. - That only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability is itself an equity instrument would the terms of a liability not impact its classification.The amendments did not have a significant impact on the Group´s consolidated financial statements.Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to IAS 8In February 2021  the IASB issued amendments to IAS 8  in which it introduces a definition of ""accounting estimates"". The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. Also  they clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates.The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and apply to changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates that occur on or after the start of that period. Earlier application is permitted as long as this fact is disclosed.The amendments did not have a significant impact on the Group´s consolidated financial statements.Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2In February 2021  the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements  in which it provides guidance and examples to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their 'significant' accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their 'material' accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.The amendments to IAS 1 are applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 with earlier application permitted. Since the amendments to the Practice Statement 2 provide non-mandatory guidance on the application of the definition of material to accounting policy information  an effective date for these amendments is not necessary. The Group has revisited their accounting policy information disclosures to ensure consistency with the amended requirements. These amendments did not have a significant impact on the Group´s consolidated financial statements.- 12 -English translation of the consolidated financial statements originally filed in Spanish with the Argentine Securities Commission (""CNV"").In case of discrepancy  the consolidated financial statements filed with the CNV prevail over this translation.CENTRAL PUERTO S.A.3.

Pursuant to the CNV applicable regulations  on March 17  2023  a mandatory public acquisition offering (""OPA"") at an equitable price with respect to the remaining outstanding shares was announced. Such was approved by CNV on May 23  2023.

Measures in the Argentine economyForeign exchange marketAs from December 2019  the BCRA issued a series of communications whereby it extended indefinitely the regulations on Foreign Market and Foreign Exchange Market issued by BCRA that included regulations on exports  imports and previous authorization from BCRA to access the foreign exchange market to transfer profits and dividends abroad  as well as other restrictions on the operation in the foreign exchange market.Particularly  as from September 16  2020  Communication ""A"" 7106 established  among other measures referred to human persons  the need for refinancing the international financial indebtedness for those loans from the non-financial private sector with a creditor not being a related counterparty of the debtor expiring between October 15  2020 and March 31  2021. The affected legal entities were to submit before the Central Bank a refinancing plan under certain criteria: that the net amount for which the foreign exchange market was to be accessed in the original terms did not exceed 40% of the capital amount due for that period and that the remaining capital had been  as a minimum  refinanced with a new external indebtedness with an average life of 2 years. This point shall not be applicable when indebtedness is taken from international entities and official credit agencies  among others. On February 25  2021  through Communication ""A"" 7230  BCRA broadened the regulation scope to all those debt installments higher than USD 2 million becoming due between April 1 and December 31  2021. The effects of these regulations for the Company are described in Note 7.3.3. and 7.3.11. Moreover  on March 3  2022 and October 13  2022  through Communications ""A"" 7466 and ""A"" 7621  BCRA broadened the regulation scope to all those debt installments higher than USD 2 million becoming due until December 31  2022 and December 31  2023  respectively. These updates had no effect on the Company  except for the loan described in Note 7.3.11.- 27 -English translation of the consolidated financial statements originally filed in Spanish with the Argentine Securities Commission (""CNV"").In case of discrepancy  the consolidated financial statements filed with the CNV prevail over this translation.CENTRAL PUERTO S.A.As of the date of issuance of these financial statements  restrictions imposed by BCRA have been increased  due to additional restrictions established both for imports payment and foreign exchange market operation.Income TaxOn June 16  2021  the Argentine Executive Power passed Law No. 27630  which established changes in the corporate income tax rate for the fiscal periods commencing as from January 1  2021. Such law establishes payment of the tax based on a structure of staggered rates regarding the level of accumulated taxable net income. The estimated amounts in this scale will be annually adjusted as from January 1  2022  considering the annual variation of the consumer price index provided by the INDEC corresponding to October of the year prior to the adjustment compared with the same month of the previous year. For fiscal year 2022 the applicable scale was the following: 25% up to an accumulated taxable net income of 7.6 million Ps.; 30% for the excess of such amount up to 76 million Ps.; and 35% for the excess of such amount. For fiscal year 2023 the applicable scale is the following: 25% up to an accumulated taxable net income of 14.3 million Ps.; 30% for the excess of such amount up to 143 million Ps.; and 35% for the excess of such amount.13. Restrictions on income distributionPursuant to the General Legal Entities Law and the Bylaws  5% of the profits made during the fiscal year must be assigned to the statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 20% of the Company's Capital Stock.Within the framework of the amendments to the loan agreement with Citibank N.A.  JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding INC described in Note 7.3.3  there was a restriction for the payment of dividends until 80% of the loan's principal and interest are paid. Thus  during 2021 no dividends could be paid while during 2022 and 2023 dividends can be paid up to USD 25 million and USD 20 million  respectively. Due to the advanced partial payment of the balance of such loan on October 19  2023 as described in Note 7.3.3  through which more than 80% of the loan was paid  this limitation is no longer applicable as from that date.The profits that are distributed to human persons of Argentina and abroad and foreign legal entities are subject to a withholding of 7% as dividend tax  to the extent that such profits correspond to fiscal years closed after December 31  2017.14.

33504,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.politico.eu/article/plan-use-frozen-russian-assets-fund-ukraine-in-disarray/,EU in disarray over plan to fund Ukraine from frozen Russian assets,Most EU governments reject the idea put forward by Spain  arguing Kyiv would not get the money quickly enough.,EU officials have been exploring ways to skim off the earnings from assets worth some $300 billion that were immobilized after the war began | Sergey Bobok/AFP via Getty ImagesBRUSSELS ― EU countries have poured cold water on a plan to use revenue generated from Russian assets frozen since the start of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine to support the war-torn country's reconstruction.Several ambassadors from the bloc’s 27 governments argued that an idea drawn up by Spain  in its role at the helm of the EU’s rotating six-month presidency  would not give Ukraine’s economy the urgent boost it needs  and instead risks undermining the EU’s commitment to provide support to Kyiv.For months  EU officials have been exploring ways to skim off the earnings from assets worth some $300 billion that were immobilized after the war began. But the plan has drawn skepticism from some governments  including France and Germany  as well as from the European Central Bank  which fears it could cause instability in the euro currency.The criticism came to a head at a meeting of EU envoys on Tuesday evening. Under Spain's proposal  obtained by POLITICO and discussed at the meeting  Madrid estimated that profits from the Russian central bank reserves frozen in EU countries could generate €15 billion to €17 billion for Kyiv by 2027.According to officials who spoke to POLITICO on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions  several countries claimed the Spanish proposal didn't satisfy the EU’s priority of supporting Ukraine because it would take months ― possibly even years ― for Kyiv to see the money. There was also confusion over how Madrid had arrived at its numbers.Multiple crisesThe idea to use the cash generated by the frozen assets emerged from a review of how the EU spends its money  which Spain is conducting.The Commission has said it wants to give Kyiv €17 billion in grants plus €33 billion in low-interest loans up to 2027 to prevent the country from going bankrupt. If that money doesn't come from the earnings generated by the frozen assets  it would have to be funded from elsewhere.Any decision will require unanimity among all 27 member countries.Given that Spain’s proposal was so contrary to the views of most other governments  several diplomats speculated it had been drafted by Spanish government officials in Madrid with little knowledge of the mood across the rest of the EU.“This is not an acceptable base for discussion at EUCO [the December 14-15 summit of EU leaders] for many countries ” said one diplomat.Russian foreign reserves were frozen by countries participating in sanctions at the onset of Moscow's war on Ukraine; the majority sit in the EU. For example  some €180 billion are with Belgium’s Euroclear  a clearing house acting as a custodian for Russian reserves.As Russian securities reach maturity and are reinvested by financial intermediaries  they generate a profit.The talks on generating revenues from those assets are part of a Commission plan to spend €66 billion in additional funds to cover unexpected spending. The EU executive argues the bloc’s coffers have been depleted by multiple crises from the pandemic to the war in Ukraine.Several diplomats from other countries even questioned whether Madrid's aim in making the proposal was to divert extra contributions away from the Ukraine crisis toward other budget areas such as migration and EU competitiveness.“It seems like a back door to try to use the extra funds for Ukraine for other spending ― that coincidentally is on Spain’s own wishlist ” said another diplomat.Other officials noted that Spain's idea of using the money generated by the frozen assets was superfluous  given that all EU countries except Hungary agree on increasing funding to Kyiv. Any Russian proceeds should come on top on what is approved for aid to Ukraine  not instead of it  they said.Spain was expected to table a new budget proposal on Tuesday evening ahead of another discussion among EU envoys on Wednesday. They will continue to debate the matter until the summit of leaders.,negative,0.02,0.12,0.86,negative,0.02,0.18,0.8,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'disarray', 'plan', 'Ukraine', 'Russian central bank reserves', 'European Central Bank', 'rotating six-month presidency', 'Russian foreign reserves', 'other budget areas', 'December 14-15 summit', 'The EU executive', 'new budget proposal', 'Spanish government officials', 'most other governments', 'Russian reserves', 'Russian securities', 'Russian proceeds', 'other spending', 'Other officials', 'other countries', 'Spanish proposal', 'Sergey Bobok/AFP', 'Getty Images', 'cold water', 'Several ambassadors', 'urgent boost', 'euro currency', 'Tuesday evening', 'Multiple crises', 'low-interest loans', 'several diplomats', 'little knowledge', 'acceptable base', 'clearing house', 'financial intermediaries', 'additional funds', 'unexpected spending', 'extra contributions', 'back door', 'extra funds', 'several countries', '27 member countries', 'many countries', 'Russian assets', 'EU officials', 'EU envoys', 'EU competitiveness', 'EU countries', 'war-torn country', 'one diplomat', 'frozen assets', 'EU leaders', 'Ukraine crisis', 'Commission plan', '27 governments', 'ways', 'earnings', 'BRUSSELS', 'revenue', 'start', 'Moscow', 'invasion', 'reconstruction', 'bloc', 'idea', 'Spain', 'role', 'helm', 'economy', 'commitment', 'support', 'Kyiv', 'months', 'skepticism', 'France', 'Germany', 'instability', 'criticism', 'head', 'meeting', 'POLITICO', 'Madrid', 'profits', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'sensitivity', 'discussions', 'priority', 'years', 'money', 'confusion', 'numbers', 'cash', 'review', 'grants', 'decision', 'unanimity', 'views', 'mood', 'EUCO', 'sanctions', 'onset', 'majority', 'example', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'custodian', 'maturity', 'talks', 'part', 'coffers', 'pandemic', 'aim', 'migration', 'wishlist', 'Hungary', 'funding', 'top', 'aid', 'Wednesday', 'matter']",2023-12-05,2023-12-06,politico.eu

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology and...,Louvain-La-Neuve  Belgium  December 5  2023 - IBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.  EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology and the world’s leading provider of proton therapy solutions for the treatment of cancer  announced today a research collaboration agreement with the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) to advance preclinical research into the use of ConformalFLASH®1 technology using an IBA Proteus®ONE2 machine. The preclinical evaluation will be focused on skin and muscular normal tissue sparing after proton FLASH irradiation.The two organizations published a joint abstract  “Experimental demonstration of 360nA FLASH proton beam current via synchrocyclotron using IBA Proteus®ONE ” during the Proton Therapy Co-Operative Group (PTCOG) Congress 2023  which took place in Madrid  Spain  in June. The collaboration announced today will facilitate a deepening of the research partnership between IBA and KUMC  as they look to develop ConformalFLASH® in a clinical Proteus®ONE treatment room.Olivier Legrain  Chief Executive Officer of IBA  commented: “We are excited to partner with the University of Kansas Medical Center  comprising some of the brightest minds in the field of radiation oncology who have consistently pushed the boundaries of what is possible. This collaboration brings together a synergy of expertise and a shared passion for exploring the potential of FLASH radiotherapy and its translation to the clinic. We are eager to continue pushing the boundaries of knowledge on FLASH and sharing this expertise with our large community of IBA centers.”Ronald Chen  MD  Chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology at The University of Kansas Medical Center  added: “As an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center  The University of Kansas Cancer Center at KUMC is committed to being a leader in cancer-related research. FLASH therapy has the potential to transform cancer care. Our team of physician scientists  physicists and radiobiologists is excited to collaborate with IBA to lead preclinical and clinical research in this area  so FLASH can be a clinical reality to help cancer patients in the not-so-distant future.”ConformalFLASH® is a ultra-high dose rate proton delivery using the Bragg peak  combining the biological tissue-sparing effects of FLASH with the physics properties of the proton Bragg peak. This technology distinguishes itself from electron FLASH machines  that are currently limited to deliver FLASH dose rates to superficial tumors  and protons transmission FLASH delivery  which has reduced conformality and higher integral doses compared to ConformalFLASH®.FLASH irradiation has the potential to dramatically change the landscape of radiotherapy and patient cancer care by enhancing the therapeutic window with less toxicity and possibility to escalate the dose with shorter treatment. FLASH  defined as radiation delivery at ultra-high dose rates (40-60Gy/s)  has been shown in preclinical research to spare normal tissue toxicity while maintaining an equivalent anti-tumor efficacy3.***ENDS***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology and the world’s leading provider of proton therapy solutions for the treatment of cancer  announced today a research collaboration agreement with the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) to advance preclinical research into the use of ConformalFLASH®1 technology using an IBA Proteus®ONE2 machine. The preclinical evaluation will be focused on skin and muscular normal tissue sparing after proton FLASH irradiation.The two organizations published a joint abstract  “Experimental demonstration of 360nA FLASH proton beam current via synchrocyclotron using IBA Proteus®ONE ” during the Proton Therapy Co-Operative Group (PTCOG) Congress 2023  which took place in Madrid  Spain  in June. The collaboration announced today will facilitate a deepening of the research partnership between IBA and KUMC  as they look to develop ConformalFLASH® in a clinical Proteus®ONE treatment room.Olivier Legrain  Chief Executive Officer of IBA  commented: “We are excited to partner with the University of Kansas Medical Center  comprising some of the brightest minds in the field of radiation oncology who have consistently pushed the boundaries of what is possible. This collaboration brings together a synergy of expertise and a shared passion for exploring the potential of FLASH radiotherapy and its translation to the clinic. We are eager to continue pushing the boundaries of knowledge on FLASH and sharing this expertise with our large community of IBA centers.”Ronald Chen  MD  Chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology at The University of Kansas Medical Center  added: “As an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center  The University of Kansas Cancer Center at KUMC is committed to being a leader in cancer-related research. FLASH therapy has the potential to transform cancer care. Our team of physician scientists  physicists and radiobiologists is excited to collaborate with IBA to lead preclinical and clinical research in this area  so FLASH can be a clinical reality to help cancer patients in the not-so-distant future.”ConformalFLASH® is a ultra-high dose rate proton delivery using the Bragg peak  combining the biological tissue-sparing effects of FLASH with the physics properties of the proton Bragg peak. This technology distinguishes itself from electron FLASH machines  that are currently limited to deliver FLASH dose rates to superficial tumors  and protons transmission FLASH delivery  which has reduced conformality and higher integral doses compared to ConformalFLASH®.FLASH irradiation has the potential to dramatically change the landscape of radiotherapy and patient cancer care by enhancing the therapeutic window with less toxicity and possibility to escalate the dose with shorter treatment. FLASH  defined as radiation delivery at ultra-high dose rates (40-60Gy/s)  has been shown in preclinical research to spare normal tissue toxicity while maintaining an equivalent anti-tumor efficacy3.***ENDS***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.

An open-plan area of 700 m² located at number 111 Álaba Street designed for teamwork and to encourage the exchange of ideasbetween PS21 Barna  Lúcid  True and Redbility  the four agencies of the group with a presence in the city of Barcelona.The project is the work of the architecture studio Lagranja Design  led by Gerard Sanmartí and Gabriel Schiavon. In line with the axiom 'form follows function'  by Louis Sullivan  founder of modernist architecture  the architects of Lagranja Design have created a space in which functionality weighs on aesthetics. 'When Agustín Vivancos contacted us  he conveyed to us the idea that it should be a space that encouraged unexpected interactions. This is how you energise an office'  explains Gerard Sanmartí  co-founder of Lagranja Design and architect of the project.Removing the false ceiling was key to achieving the objective. This decision allowed architects to design two heights  an open-plan office with common spaces that fostered connection between people and  in addition  incorporate modular structures that function as rooms for teamwork sessions to promote privacy. On the ground floor  there are sound insulated and air-conditioned spruce wood boxes  interspersed between open work areas  a rest space  a stand for presentations  a dining room  a workshop  a warehouse and services. A spiral staircase provides access to floor 1  where the rest area and a meeting space for 10 people are located.​In parallel to the office project  the design agency Mucho developed the graphic and corporate identity of Jungle with the aim of creating a brand that represented the creativity of the ecosystem and that incorporated versatility and plasticityso that it could adapt to different projects without losing identity. The typography is inspired by the Swiss style of the Basel and Zurich school of the 1950s that sought to present information objectively. It is characterised by the use of sans serif and grid-based designs. Jungle's typography was incorporated into the leather and surfaces of the office boxes.'From the first meeting it was clear that Jungle should not be inspired by nature. The energy and cosmopolitan vibe prevailed more than other discourses ' explains Gerard. The inspiration is urban. In the 700 m²  unpainted plasterboard  plaster  galvanised steel  tile and metal flooring predominate and the range of colours are greys combined with fluorescent mimosa yellow details. Restored old street lights of the city of Barcelona and galvanised steel staffs with fluorescent pink paint are the final touch to a project that suggests the speed and rhythm of a cosmopolitan city like Barcelona but also the calm and tranquillity of the Mediterranean.The offices are located on the ground floor of the Álaba 111 building  a project designed by the architects Battle i Roig that stands out for its eco-efficiency and sustainability in the Poblenou neighbourhood  the sixth largest startup hub in Europe. Sustainability is also key in the architectural project to meet the standards required by the BCorp certificate  a recognition obtained by Jungle in February 2023. Lagranja Design has used minimal resources  recycled  sustainable materials and local suppliers.Jungle is listed on Euronext Paris since March 2022 and is made up of the companies PS21 and PS21 Barna  creative agencies; True  communication consulting; Redbility  consulting in the design of digital products and services; ES3  digital agency; PINK  creative boutique; Invisible  the cultural laboratory and the design of the future; Líbero  the publishing project; Líbero Creative Club  the football creative agency; Lúcid  the industrial design company and MeMe  a social agency.,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,neutral,0.08,0.89,0.03,True,English,"['JUNGLE 21 S A', 'new offices', 'Barcelona', 'December', '04:34', 'sixth largest startup hub', 'fluorescent mimosa yellow details', 'air-conditioned spruce wood boxes', 'Líbero Creative Club', 'Agustín Vivancos', 'Battle i Roig', 'old street lights', 'fluorescent pink paint', 'open work areas', 'industrial design company', 'football creative agency', 'office boxes', 'creative agencies', 'creative boutique', '111 Álaba Street', 'Lúcid', 'digital agency', 'social agency', 'design agency', 'creative ecosystem', 'open-plan area', 'four agencies', 'architecture studio', 'Gabriel Schiavon', 'Louis Sullivan', 'modernist architecture', 'unexpected interactions', 'false ceiling', 'two heights', 'common spaces', 'modular structures', 'sound insulated', 'dining room', 'spiral staircase', 'rest area', 'different projects', 'Swiss style', 'Zurich school', 'sans serif', 'grid-based designs', 'first meeting', 'cosmopolitan vibe', 'other discourses', 'unpainted plasterboard', 'galvanised steel', 'metal flooring', 'steel staffs', 'final touch', 'Álaba 111 building', 'BCorp certificate', 'minimal resources', 'sustainable materials', 'local suppliers', 'Euronext Paris', 'communication consulting', 'digital products', 'cultural laboratory', 'Lagranja Design', 'open-plan office', 'PS21 Barna', 'Gerard Sanmartí', 'ground floor', 'teamwork sessions', 'rest space', 'meeting space', 'corporate identity', 'Poblenou neighbourhood', 'architectural project', 'publishing project', 'cosmopolitan city', 'office project', 'News', 'presence', 'Barcelona', 'opening', 'offices', '22@ district', '700 m²', 'number', 'exchange', 'ideasbetween', 'True', 'Redbility', 'group', 'line', 'axiom', 'form', 'function', 'founder', 'architects', 'aesthetics', 'objective', 'decision', 'connection', 'people', 'addition', 'rooms', 'privacy', 'stand', 'presentations', 'workshop', 'warehouse', 'services', 'access', 'parallel', 'Mucho', 'graphic', 'Jungle', 'aim', 'brand', 'creativity', 'versatility', 'plasticityso', 'typography', 'Basel', '1950s', 'leather', 'surfaces', 'nature', 'energy', 'inspiration', 'tile', 'range', 'colours', 'greys', 'speed', 'rhythm', 'calm', 'tranquillity', 'Mediterranean', 'eco-efficiency', 'sustainability', 'Europe', 'recognition', 'February', 'March', 'companies', 'Invisible', 'future', 'MeMe']",2023-12-05,2023-12-06,marketscreener.com

The Group offers a broad portfolio of solutions that meet all power  durability and autonomy requirements for an efficient zero-emission mobility  from on-road light and mid-range commercial vehicles  trucks  pickups  buses and coaches  to off-road lifting and mechanical handling equipment.With SymphonHy  Symbio is able to support its customers  pioneers of hydrogen-powered transport  in their deployment plans  which are already showing promise now  in real life.Stellantis  one of the world’s leading automakers and also a Symbio co-shareholder  was the first company to market a zero-emission hydrogen solution for light commercial vehicles for the Peugeot e-Expert  Citroën e-Jumpy and Opel Vivaro-e models. The Company is expanding its range to include large vans with a mid-power architecture  a range of up to 500 km and a recharge time of less than 10 minutes. Stellantis confirmed today its plans to develop a hydrogen technology for its Ram brand pickups  in line with its aim of electrifying its portfolio of vehicles with a range of 320 miles ALVW or 200 miles GCWR and fast tank refilling  without compromising on payload capacity. All these vehicles will be equipped with fuel cells produced by Symbio.Philippe ROSIER  CEO of SYMBIO: “SymphonHy is proof of Europe’s industrial and technological leadership. Together with the entire ecosystem and our private and public partners  we are ready to scale up and make hydrogen electric mobility  a sustainable  high-performance  and affordable reality. Delivered in less than two years  SymphonHy is testimonial of Symbio’s ability to meet its industrial commitments  underpinning the acceleration of zero-emission hydrogen mobility deployment. The first 100% fuel cell system assembled at SymphonHy was produced in October 2023  just one month after the gigafactory became operational.”Patrick KOLLER  CEO of FORVIA: “A few weeks after inaugurating two major FORVIA sites in France to accelerate the decarbonization of mobility  I’m delighted to be part of this new step for Symbio  which is now sized to meet the challenges of the global market. This plant is further proof of our commitment to zero emission mobility. FORVIA believes in hydrogen technology as the only complementary credible alternative to battery electrification. With Symbio  we cover 75% of the hydrogen mobility value chain  from fuel cells to storage systems. We are working to develop innovative solutions to improve the range of our customers’ fuel cell electric vehicles. In 2022  FORVIA delivered 10 000 hydrogen tanks worldwide  a record and an important milestone in our quest to become number 1.”Florent MENEGAUX  CEO of MICHELIN: “Michelin was a very early believer in hydrogen and in Symbio  which we acquired before turning it into a joint venture with Forvia in 2019. The entry of Stellantis into the capital this year confirms that hydrogen meets a constant concern to support the future of mobility. This technology is now proving to be an essential addition to satisfy the need for longer range  particularly for commercial vehicles  which are starting to be fitted out. It’s no coincidence that the Group recently announced a range of hydrogen-powered vehicles through its subsidiary Watèa by Michelin  a mobility operator specializing in the energy transition of business fleets  with an offer of hydrogen vehicle.”Carlos TAVARES  CEO of STELLANTIS: “Symbio is the proof that three French-rooted and leading companies in their respective fields can join forces and expertise to be at the forefront. Today’s inauguration marks an important step as hydrogen is part of the mix of technologies we are bringing forward for commercial vehicle customers. This technology is a building block of the powerful electrification ecosystem we are developing to support our bold goal to reach  by 2030  100% electric sales in Europe and 50% in the U.S. As Stellantis’ purpose is to ‘lead the way the world moves ’ hydrogen will contribute to reaching our ambitious carbon net zero by 2038 target  ahead of the competition in our fight against climate change.”Moreover  in partnership with the German group Schaeffler  Symbio has set up a 50/50 joint-venture  Innoplate  to produce bipolar plates (BPPs)  a strategic component in fuel cells. Based in Alsace  France  Innoplate will be operational in the first quarter of next year with an initial capacity of 4 million BPPs  rising to c. 50 million BPPs annually and employing over 120 people by 2030.

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM)  one of the fastest growing semiconductor equipment companies and global market leader in Atomic Layer Deposition  announced plans for a new North American expansion to accommodate growing demand for research and development in the semiconductor industry.ASM is investing €300 million over a period of up to five years to design and construct the new state-of-the-art site on more than 20 acres (8.5 hectares) in Scottsdale  Arizona. This total investment is a combination of capital expenditures related to infrastructure and lab equipment  and includes operational expenses such as the additional research and engineering jobs created with the expansion.“ASM’s facility in Arizona has always been a key center for development of leading technologies that enabled many breakthroughs in the global semiconductor industry ” said Benjamin Loh  CEO of ASM. “The investment in our new facility in Scottsdale will substantially expand our research and development activities  further strengthening Arizona as a hub for top-notch semiconductor innovation.”The new North American headquarters will cover 250 000 square feet (20 000 m²)  more than double the size of the current facility. The global technology and innovation center will house a variety of functions under one roof  allowing ASM departments to collaborate more efficiently. This includes investing in leading-edge lab equipment and state-of-the-art infrastructure not just for research and development  but also for renewable energy  a water recycling facility  and other sustainability features. Some of ASM’s global operations and corporate support functions will also be on site  including supply chain  manufacturing engineering  a Global Training Center  and the Global Software Team.“Arizona is proud to celebrate ASM’s high-tech expansion  a project that further cements Arizona’s semiconductor leadership and bolsters U.S. resilience and competitiveness ” said Governor Katie Hobbs. “We’re grateful to celebrate this new milestone in the Arizona-Netherlands partnership and thank ASM for their continued commitment to Arizona.”ASM first established its North American headquarters in Phoenix  Arizona  in 1976 and was one of the first semiconductor equipment companies in Arizona. ASM has seven R&D centers and several manufacturing facilities around the world  with its global headquarters located in the Netherlands. Political and economic leaders from the Netherlands were recently in Arizona to celebrate ASM’s expansion announcement.“Arizona and the U.S. are valuable partners in the Netherlands’ mission to co-create solutions that promote innovation and partnerships in the global semiconductor value chain ” said Mark Rutte  Prime Minister of the Netherlands. “It is through these types of cross-border collaborations that we are shaping the future of advancements in this growing industry.”“ASM’s expansion in Arizona is one example of how we are looking to establish opportunities for Dutch and U.S. companies to exchange knowledge and establish meaningful partnerships ” said Micky Adriaansens  Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy of the Netherlands. “With its new North American headquarters  ASM will support its key customers’ expansion of leading-edge device manufacturing in Arizona  in the rest of the U.S.  and globally  contributing to a more resilient  innovative and competitive semiconductor supply chain.”ASM’s equipment is a key technology for the semiconductor integrated-circuit chips needed to make the electronics products that consumers and businesses use everywhere. Specializing in the wafer equipment market  ASM’s focus is on the deposition of thin films  designing  making  selling  and servicing deposition tools to supply customers with advanced technologies used in wafer fabrication plants. ASM’s customers include the companies that make the world’s top semiconductor devices.“ASM’s expansion further positions Arizona as the nation’s leading center for semiconductor innovation and manufacturing ” said Sandra Watson  President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. “ASM has been a longtime industry partner in Arizona  and we look forward to supporting their continued success.”ASM currently employs over 800 people in Arizona and plans to hire an estimated additional 500 people over the next six years  creating new job opportunities in engineering as well as research and development. The site will be designed as a destination to work  with various amenities that will provide support to employees in accomplishing their work and their general wellbeing.“ASM is anchored in Arizona  and we are pleased to welcome their new North American headquarters to Scottsdale for the next chapter of their continued growth ” said David D. Ortega  Mayor of Scottsdale. “ASM will be locating over 1 000 high-paying technology jobs in our city and their focus on sustainability ensures they will be a fantastic community partner in the shared goal to preserve our most valuable resources.”“The burgeoning relationship between Greater Phoenix and the Netherlands is strengthened by partners like ASM that drive the advanced manufacturing ecosystem  create important jobs  and commit to sustainable efforts around the region ” said Greater Phoenix Economic Council President and CEO Chris Camacho. “This massive investment goes beyond the dollars  with plans to improve irrigation and river systems in Arizona as ASM continues to show good stewardship of its U.S. home.”Sustainability has been a cornerstone of ASM’s global business processes and will continue to be a main theme with the new North American headquarters. ASM will pursue LEED rating for the new facility while also driving programs for energy and water reuse. ASM is also committed to reclaimed water system improvements to further reduce use and recycling of water  and targets more than 80% reclaimed water in the new facility. ASM’s current facility in Arizona has reduced its absolute water use by 60% from 2017 to 2022  even with substantial growth in its business activities during this period. Construction of the new North American facility is expected to take about three years.In connection with ASM’s sustainability efforts  the company also announced new multi-year partnerships with local organizations. One of these partnerships is with The Nature Conservancy (TNC)  where ASM will support TNC with three-year investments to its Restoring Flows program  starting with a $130 000 investment in year one  which completes Phase 1 funding of the project.This project will improve the irrigation systems in the Verde Valley and strengthen the long-term resilience of the Verde River  one of the last free-flowing river systems in the state and a critical water supply for the Phoenix metro area. Over the next three years  ASM will help fund this innovative water restoration program to save millions of gallons of water for the Verde River annually  which will in turn address environmental concerns and enhance the well-being of the community and wildlife in the region.ASM also announced a new partnership with the Arizona Sustainability Alliance (AZSA)  where ASM will support AZSA with a $240 000 investment over three years to its Urban Forestry Tree Planting & Associated Education Initiatives and its annual events like the Sustainability Celebration and Conservation Invasion. Over the next three years  ASM will fund the planting of more than 250 trees and ASM employees will take part in tree planting volunteer days.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

For the record  the controlling shareholders had undertaken to neutralize their voting rights for these two resolutions.Wavestone  a French leading consultancy  and Q_PERIOR  a consulting leader in the Germany-Switzerland-Austria (GSA) region  are thus pleased to announce today that they have joined forces to create a new champion in the consulting market.""This combination brings our two firms to a new scale and a new international dimension. It creates new development opportunities  positioning us as the preferred partner for our clients' major transformations  and enabling us to accelerate our expansion into new geographies""  says Karsten Höppner  CEO of Q_PERIOR and future Chief Operating Officer of Wavestone.""Together  we aim to create a new European consulting champion with a global reach  while embracing our European roots  the human values that we cherish  and our commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen "" adds Pascal Imbert  Chairman and CEO of Wavestone.Wavestone and Q_PERIOR: a new European consulting firm with a global reachThis combination is transformative and strategic for both firms. It creates a new player in the category of top international consulting firms.The change in size  international scope and value proposition of the new entity will enable it to access new opportunities  aimed at supporting major international accounts in their most global transformations.With over 5 500 employees based in 17 countries throughout Continental Europe  the UK  North America and Asia  the new firm is now operating in almost all business sectors and is becoming a major player in many of these areas: Banking  Insurance  Energy  Automotive & Manufacturing  Transportation  Travel & Logistics.Among its major clients  the new firm serves BMW  BSH  Crédit Agricole  Deutsche Bahn  EDF  EnBW  L'Oréal  LVMH  SNCF  Société Générale  Swiss RE and TotalEnergies[2].As of March 31  2023[3]  the new entity generates a consolidated annual revenue of €835.2m with an EBIT margin of 12.1%.A new consulting player with a development model driven by growthThe project co-built by the two firms aims at continuing the development of the new group at a sustained rate of growth over the next few years  through a mix of organic growth and acquisitions.By 2025  the new firm aims to reach  without new acquisitions  around €1 billion revenue  with an EBIT of at least €130 million in FY 2024/25. These objectives are calculated on a constant forex basis.In the longer term  the new entity aims to sustain a 15% revenue growth rate  considering both organic and inorganic  and targets a normative EBIT margin of around 15%.In terms of external growth  the union of Wavestone and Q_PERIOR is thus positioning itself as an attractive platform for future acquisitions. Priority will be given to two geographical areas  the United Kingdom and the United States  as well as on consolidating the positions already established in Asia.As a benchmark employer  the new firm accompanies its financial ambitions with a particular focus on human capital across all geographies  in order to enhance its appeal in attracting and retaining the best talent. Deeply committed to developing its human capital  the new entity aims to rank in the top of the Great Place to Work® rankings in each of the major countries in which it operates.The new firm also strives to be at the forefront of social  societal and environmental responsibility issues. On this extra-financial level  the new firm's objective is to rank in the top 5% of companies in terms of CSR performance.Reminder of the terms of the combinationWavestone today acquired 100% of the share capital of Q_PERIOR  based on an enterprise value of €330m  excluding any potential earn-out  including €321.9m in shareholders' equity (the base price) and €8.1m of adjusted net financial debt[4]. In addition to this base price  an earn-out of up to €35.0m could be paid  conditioned by the EBIT of Q_PERIOR at March 31  2024.This operation was financed for 79.0% of the base price by the issuance today of 4 709 840 new Wavestone shares on the basis of a reference price of €54 per new share  i.e.  a total of €254.3m. These new Wavestone shares are now issued and held by Q_PERIOR shareholders  who thus become Wavestone shareholders as of today.The remaining balance of the base price  i.e. €67.6m  and if applicable the earn-out up to a maximum of €35.0m  are financed in cash from Wavestone's available funds.Following the operation  Wavestone's share capital is now composed of 24 906 332 shares.On the basis of these terms and the capital structure of Wavestone at September 30  2023  the breakdown of shareholders is now as follows:Shareholders Number of shares % of total share capital Number of exercisable voting rights % of total exercisable voting rights Imbert Family (Wavestone's founder) 5 789 136 23.24% 11 578 272 31.32% Dancoisne – Chavelas Family (Wavestone's founder) 5 211 088 20.92% 10 422 176 28.19% Majority shareholders of Q_PERIOR 3 989 956 16.02% 3 989 956 10.80% Controlling shareholders acting in concert 14 990 180 60.19% 25 990 404 70.31% Other Wavestone executives  Directors and employees 1 646 409 6.61% 2 721 845 7.36% Q_PERIOR employees 719 884 2.89% 719 884 1.95% Free float 7 222 517 29.00% 7 534 408 20.38% Treasury stock 327 342 1.31% - - Total 24 906 332 100.00% 36 966 541 100.00%The main shareholders of the new entity  comprising Pascal Imbert  Chairman and CEO of Wavestone  the Dancoisne - Chavelas family and the majority shareholders of Q_PERIOR  are now acting in concert and have become the new controlling shareholders of Wavestone.

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM)  one of the fastest growing semiconductor equipment companies and global market leader in Atomic Layer Deposition  announced plans for a new North American expansion to accommodate growing demand for research and development in the semiconductor industry.ASM is investing €300 million over a period of up to five years to design and construct the new state-of-the-art site on more than 20 acres (8.5 hectares) in Scottsdale  Arizona. This total investment is a combination of capital expenditures related to infrastructure and lab equipment  and includes operational expenses such as the additional research and engineering jobs created with the expansion.“ASM’s facility in Arizona has always been a key center for development of leading technologies that enabled many breakthroughs in the global semiconductor industry ” said Benjamin Loh  CEO of ASM. “The investment in our new facility in Scottsdale will substantially expand our research and development activities  further strengthening Arizona as a hub for top-notch semiconductor innovation.”The new North American headquarters will cover 250 000 square feet (20 000 m²)  more than double the size of the current facility. The global technology and innovation center will house a variety of functions under one roof  allowing ASM departments to collaborate more efficiently. This includes investing in leading-edge lab equipment and state-of-the-art infrastructure not just for research and development  but also for renewable energy  a water recycling facility  and other sustainability features. Some of ASM’s global operations and corporate support functions will also be on site  including supply chain  manufacturing engineering  a Global Training Center  and the Global Software Team.“Arizona is proud to celebrate ASM’s high-tech expansion  a project that further cements Arizona’s semiconductor leadership and bolsters U.S. resilience and competitiveness ” said Governor Katie Hobbs. “We’re grateful to celebrate this new milestone in the Arizona-Netherlands partnership and thank ASM for their continued commitment to Arizona.”ASM first established its North American headquarters in Phoenix  Arizona  in 1976 and was one of the first semiconductor equipment companies in Arizona. ASM has seven R&D centers and several manufacturing facilities around the world  with its global headquarters located in the Netherlands. Political and economic leaders from the Netherlands were recently in Arizona to celebrate ASM’s expansion announcement.“Arizona and the U.S. are valuable partners in the Netherlands’ mission to co-create solutions that promote innovation and partnerships in the global semiconductor value chain ” said Mark Rutte  Prime Minister of the Netherlands. “It is through these types of cross-border collaborations that we are shaping the future of advancements in this growing industry.”“ASM’s expansion in Arizona is one example of how we are looking to establish opportunities for Dutch and U.S. companies to exchange knowledge and establish meaningful partnerships ” said Micky Adriaansens  Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy of the Netherlands. “With its new North American headquarters  ASM will support its key customers’ expansion of leading-edge device manufacturing in Arizona  in the rest of the U.S.  and globally  contributing to a more resilient  innovative and competitive semiconductor supply chain.”ASM’s equipment is a key technology for the semiconductor integrated-circuit chips needed to make the electronics products that consumers and businesses use everywhere. Specializing in the wafer equipment market  ASM’s focus is on the deposition of thin films  designing  making  selling  and servicing deposition tools to supply customers with advanced technologies used in wafer fabrication plants. ASM’s customers include the companies that make the world’s top semiconductor devices.“ASM’s expansion further positions Arizona as the nation’s leading center for semiconductor innovation and manufacturing ” said Sandra Watson  President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. “ASM has been a longtime industry partner in Arizona  and we look forward to supporting their continued success.”ASM currently employs over 800 people in Arizona and plans to hire an estimated additional 500 people over the next six years  creating new job opportunities in engineering as well as research and development. The site will be designed as a destination to work  with various amenities that will provide support to employees in accomplishing their work and their general wellbeing.“ASM is anchored in Arizona  and we are pleased to welcome their new North American headquarters to Scottsdale for the next chapter of their continued growth ” said David D. Ortega  Mayor of Scottsdale. “ASM will be locating over 1 000 high-paying technology jobs in our city and their focus on sustainability ensures they will be a fantastic community partner in the shared goal to preserve our most valuable resources.”“The burgeoning relationship between Greater Phoenix and the Netherlands is strengthened by partners like ASM that drive the advanced manufacturing ecosystem  create important jobs  and commit to sustainable efforts around the region ” said Greater Phoenix Economic Council President and CEO Chris Camacho. “This massive investment goes beyond the dollars  with plans to improve irrigation and river systems in Arizona as ASM continues to show good stewardship of its U.S. home.”Sustainability has been a cornerstone of ASM’s global business processes and will continue to be a main theme with the new North American headquarters. ASM will pursue LEED rating for the new facility while also driving programs for energy and water reuse. ASM is also committed to reclaimed water system improvements to further reduce use and recycling of water  and targets more than 80% reclaimed water in the new facility. ASM’s current facility in Arizona has reduced its absolute water use by 60% from 2017 to 2022  even with substantial growth in its business activities during this period. Construction of the new North American facility is expected to take about three years.In connection with ASM’s sustainability efforts  the company also announced new multi-year partnerships with local organizations. One of these partnerships is with The Nature Conservancy (TNC)  where ASM will support TNC with three-year investments to its Restoring Flows program  starting with a $130 000 investment in year one  which completes Phase 1 funding of the project.This project will improve the irrigation systems in the Verde Valley and strengthen the long-term resilience of the Verde River  one of the last free-flowing river systems in the state and a critical water supply for the Phoenix metro area. Over the next three years  ASM will help fund this innovative water restoration program to save millions of gallons of water for the Verde River annually  which will in turn address environmental concerns and enhance the well-being of the community and wildlife in the region.ASM also announced a new partnership with the Arizona Sustainability Alliance (AZSA)  where ASM will support AZSA with a $240 000 investment over three years to its Urban Forestry Tree Planting & Associated Education Initiatives and its annual events like the Sustainability Celebration and Conservation Invasion. Over the next three years  ASM will fund the planting of more than 250 trees and ASM employees will take part in tree planting volunteer days.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

The half-year financial report will be made available to the public and filed with the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) in the next few days. The report will also be published on the Company website.€ million 30.09.20226 months 30.09.20236 months Change Revenue 117.8 123.5 €+5.7m Current EBITDA1 13.8 13.7 - % revenue 11.7% 11.1% -0.6 pt Recurring operating income 8.1 7.8 €-0.3m Operating income 7.9 6.5 €-1.4m Net income 5.2 2.3 €-2.9m Net income – Group share 5.4 2.5 €-2.9mABEO Group CEO Olivier Estèves made the following comments: “Despite the persisting uncertainties affecting the global economy - tense geopolitical situation  inflation  tightening monetary and financing conditions and tensions on the employment market - we reported solid results for the first half. We are once again demonstrating our ability to combine steady growth with control of financial balances through a consistent and rigorous management. Backed by our positioning in structurally buoyant markets and a dynamic order intake  we are confident in our ability to achieve another year of growth after the expected acceleration in sales during the second half.”First half growth in line with Group expectationsABEO first half 2023/24 consolidated revenue totalled €123.5m  up 5.3% like-for-like (up 4.8% as reported) and fully in line with expectations. After 3.0% organic growth at the beginning of the financial year  business momentum accelerated in the second quarter with revenue up 7.4% at constant consolidation perimeter and exchange rates. This performance was driven by the Gymnastics business in Europe and North America and favourable demand in the Changing Rooms division.Double-digit recurring EBITDA margin of 11.1%Recurring EBITDA was stable at €13.7m[2]  representing a solid margin of 11.1% of revenue  slightly down by 0.6 percentage points year-on-year. Compared to the first half of 2019/20  before the Covid crisis  the recurring EBITDA margin improved by 1.5 percentage points  confirming ABEO's focus on performance.The EBITDA margin reflects:a 2.1 percentage point increase in the gross margin due to the pass-through of inflation into sale prices and a tight control of its purchasing policy;increasing staff costs in a challenging recruitment market (28.8% of revenue compared to 27.6% year-on-year);a limited increase in other operating expenses to support business growth.The Sports division recurring EBITDA totalled €7.7m representing 12.0% of revenue  down 0.7 percentage points from the same period last year. This decline was limited thanks to a 1.2 percentage point improvement in the gross margin to 59.2% and a controlled increase in overheads against a backdrop of growth (division revenue up 11% year-on-year).The Sportainment & Climbing division reported a recurring EBITDA of €0.7m representing 2.7% of division revenue  down 3.7 percentage points versus the first half of 2022/23  when the division benefited from Covid support measures totalling €0.9m. Excluding this support  the EBITDA margin was down only 0.2 percentage points.The Changing Rooms division delivered a recurring EBITDA of €5.3m resulting in an EBITDA margin rate at 15.6%  up 1.2 percentage points versus the same period of the previous year. The 2.5 percentage point gross margin improvement and tight control of overheads enabled the division to reap the full benefit of business volumes.After depreciation of fixed assets (€5.9m  including €2.8m related to IFRS 16)  recurring operating income amounted to €7.8m in the first half of 2023/24 (versus €8.1m the previous year)  representing a 6.3% of revenue (down 0.6 percentage points year-on-year).Non-recurring operating income and expenses amounted to €-1.2m (compared to a €-0.2m in the first half of 2022/23)  mainly in restructuring costs for the Sportainment & Climbing division. Accordingly  first half operating income reached a €6.5m amount.As a result  after the deduction of a cost of debt of €2.0m  a €0.4m foreign exchange gain and a €2.4m tax charge  net income Group share for the period amounted to €2.5m.Financial structure under controlFirst half cash flow from operations (after tax) improved to an €8.1m outflow (compared to an €11.8m outflow for the same period in 2022/23)  resulting from a €13.3m positive cash flow from operations before change in working capital and tax and a €19.3m outflow from change in working capital (compared to a €22.2m outflow in the first half of 2022/23). This change in working capital is mainly due to recurring adverse seasonal effect during the first half.Cash flow related to investing activities amounted to a €10.1m outflow  €5.9m of which was allocated to the acquisition of a stake in VOGO and the completion of the BigAirBag acquisition.Improving free cash flow is a priority for the second half of 2023/24  with an expected return to a more standard level of working capital.Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €13.0m at 30 September 2023.

With the resources and industry expertise that the SPAC brings  we will be in a much stronger position to capture the rapid growth in the expanding satellite technology communications market serving customers in both the public and private sector.”AERKOMM (www.aerkomm.com)Founded in 2013 in Silicon Valley  California  AERKOMM innovative satellite communication technology company leveraging its proprietary antennae  modems and integrated routers and media servers to deliver solutions the public and private sectors.AERKOMM's solutions are qualified to provide secure and resilient communications services in aviation  mobility and terrestrial network markets  such as providing satellite backhaul solutions for mobile network operators and enhanced inflight entertainment and connectivity to commercial aviation partners.AERKOMM currently possesses the following technologies:Full-Dominance Glass Semiconductor Antenna (“FGSA” or “Glass Antenna”)AERKOMM has pioneered a glass antenna which is poised to be a key enabling technology for more reliable  higher performance and more resilient satellite communications.Its glass antenna can enable both single-orbit and multi-orbit communication with satellites  as well as multi-beam and multi-channel connectivity that uses difference frequency bands in both licensed and unlicensed spectrum.Current and prospective clients and partners are particularly interested in AERKOMM's smaller form factor  which enables our glass antennae to be installed or otherwise deployed in more locations and at lower costs than alternative and legacy antenna technologies. This enables AERKOMM to pioneer new business models for more a resilient and interoperable global communications system  which is a high priority for both public and private sector enterprises.Software-Defined ModemAERKOMM has been developing the first-generation software-defined modem using FPGA (“Field Programmable Gate Array”). The second-generation architecture will be implemented by SoC (“System on Chip”) with central processing unit/graphics processing unit (“CPU/CGPU”) -embedded which can leverage high parallel-processing capability.Software-defined modems enable flexibility  adaptability and efficiency by providing programmable signal processing functions that can be reconfigured to support different modulation and coding schemes  as well as the latest protocols and standards.By applying a single hardware platform for multiple standards  and when combined with its glass antenna  AERKOMM is creating a unique ecosystem which is more flexible and compatible to different satellite constellation waveforms  and more easily upgraded for new communication schemes via software updates.Integrated Routers and Media Servers (AirCinema Cube or “Cube” and EdgeKomm Box or “Box”)The Cube is a key technology for AERKOMM's commercial airline customers. It enables clients' passengers to stream video and access video on demand while in flight.In addition  AERKOMM has developed a Box  which simplifies content delivery and improves satellite data transmission network performance with local caching capabilities  storing frequently accessed content for faster delivery to users.The Box is seamlessly integrated with AERKOMM's Content Delivery Network (“CDN”)  which enables content to be efficiently distributed across the network. The early demonstration of this capability is being deployed by AERKOMM's commercial aviation partners for their passengers with the Cube.AERKOMM's ecosystem supports targeted advertising  delivering personalized and relevant ads to users  or passengers  which introduces new revenue generation opportunities for clients  with revenue sharing agreements with AERKOMM for delivering these solutions.AERKOMM's integrated routers and media servers enable seamless content delivery  enhance network performance  enable personalized advertising  and ensure secure and efficient network device management for its clients and their customers.Potential TransactionThe terms of the LOI between AERKOMM and the SPAC listed on a major US stock market exchange  contemplate a business combination in which the SPAC or its successor public entity acquiring 100% of the outstanding equity and equity equivalents of AERKOMM for stock (including options  warrants and other securities that have the right to acquire or convert into equity securities of the Company).
