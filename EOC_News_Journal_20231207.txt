Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt and the Madrid Exchange look set to benefit.""The active account requirement is a new requirement "" EU states said in a statement.

The study demonstrates that  for 1 000 inclusions in a trial  NIS2+™ could significantly reduce the number of unnecessary liver biopsies being performed (632 vs 1 522; -58%). The data taken from this study indicate that NIS2+™ may reduce liver biopsy failure rate to <30% and that NIS2+™ alone performs better than FIB-4 alone (a non-invasive test for fibrosis detection) or combined with FIB-4.In MASH clinical trials  patients are referred to liver biopsy for potential enrollment based on clinical and biological features that are neither sensitive nor specific  leading to unacceptably high (>60%) liver biopsy failure rates. Reducing liver biopsy failure rates using non-invasive tests represents a high unmet need and an important step towards accelerating recruitment at optimized cost in future MASH clinical trials.Dr. Vlad Ratziu  Professor at Sorbonne University and Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris  France  stated: “Most late-stage MASH trials do not have a well-defined  non-invasive strategy for referring patients to liver biopsy. There is a real need to maximize the accuracy of the patient selection process by using better non-invasive predictors of at-risk MASH. NIS2+™ has the potential to become an accessible and rapid screening tool that could have a major impact on the feasibility of MASH clinical trials  including the speed of enrollment.”Dr. Stephen Harrison  Chairman and Founder for Pinnacle Clinical Research  Chairman and Co-Founder of Summit Clinical Research  USA and Visiting Professor of Hepatology at the Radcliffe Department of Medicine  University of Oxford  UK  commented: “Screening patients with NIS2+ would potentially prevent unnecessary liver biopsies  reducing the likelihood of study related complications and improve patient satisfaction. It would also lead to a liver biopsy failure rate decrease  maintaining timely and cost-efficient completion of MASH clinical trials – a prerequisite for the testing of the numerous molecules currently in development.”A total of three papers on NIS2+™ technology have been published in leading medical journals this year. Six posters and two oral presentations featuring complementary data on the performance of NIS2+™ were also presented this year at key scientific conferences: NASH-TAG  EASL3  Paris-NASH and AASLD4 TLM.ABOUT MASHMASH is a liver disease characterized by an accumulation of fat (lipid droplets)  along with inflammation and degeneration of hepatocytes. The disease is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease along with long-term risk for progression to cirrhosis  leading to liver insufficiency and potential progression to liver cancer. MASH is a serious disease that often carries no symptoms in its early stages  but if left untreated can result in cirrhosis  cancer  and the need for liver transplant. The prevalence of MASH is rapidly increasing as a result of the growing obesity and diabetes epidemics and is believed to affect as much as 12 percent of people in the U.S. and six percent worldwide.ABOUT NIS2+™NIS2+™ is a blood-based diagnostic technology specifically designed to detect at-risk MASH among patients with metabolic risk factors based on an independent 2-biomarker panel. It is an optimization of the NIS4® technology and was developed and validated by GENFIT as a robust technology across characteristics of interest such as type-2 diabetes  age and sex  allowing large-scale implementation in clinical practice. GENFIT continues to explore the possibility of obtaining regulatory approval and CE Certificates of Conformity  for the widespread use an IVD test powered by NIS2+™ technology in both the United States and Europe.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs.

The Group has also greatly strengthened its positioning as an industrial player  as demonstrated by its external growth transactions . Thanks to these acquisitions  the Group has stepped up its regional coverage across France and developed synergies in new markets.In line with HERIGE's stated ambition of profitable growth with a positive impact  the transaction would give the company the means to step up its industrial investments to boost productivity and operational performance  while consolidating its position in energy and the circular economy.The scope of this sale represents a turnover of €383.5 million and 79 points of sale in Western France. All 1 155 employees would join SAMSE Group  which is recognized for its strong human values. Their presence would help further strengthen the company's geographical coverage and business development  without compromising its close ties with customers.The enterprise value of the scope to be sold is estimated using an EBITDA multiple . The value of the shares is calculated by deducting adjusted net debt from this enterprise value. The transaction would reduce HERIGE's debt by around €120 million (improving gearing by 83 points) and generate a capital gain of around €24 million  i.e.  +16% in equity. This would provide the Group with additional resources to develop its two industrial divisions: Concrete with EDYCEM and Joinery with ATLANTEM.Benoît Hennaut  Chairman of the Executive Board of HERIGE Group  said: “The planned transaction will enable HERIGE to concentrate on its industrial development strategy  with a fast-paced rollout of CSR and innovation initiatives. It is perfectly in line with our growth strategy focused on high value added activities  based on an offering tailored to the challenges of energy renovation and the circular economy. For SAMSE Group  the acquisition will support its drive to bring commercial and human synergies to its trading businesses. As two-family groups with shared values  our common culture has brought us together. Our Group has a bright future ahead  and this planned sale is just one of the chapters in the long-term  profitable and sustainable industrial ambition driving us forward.”This announcement follows a competitive tender process.The proposed sale remains subject to informing and consulting with employee representative bodies  obtaining approval by the relevant competition authorities  and conducting environmental audits.

The move  announced today  is part of a broader strategic refoundation plan intended to restore the company's financial stability by around the end of 2026.The capital increase comes after a series of financial maneuvers designed to address Orpea's restructuring needs. In the past week  updates were released concerning the company's voting rights and share composition following a successful EUR 3.9 billion capital raise. This raise was guaranteed by unsecured creditors and notably preserved existing shareholders' subscription rights.Earlier in November  documents related to the upcoming December General Meeting were distributed  signaling an equity boost and proposed governance revisions subsequent to an investment by ""Groupement."" This followed the Commercial Court of Nanterre's approval in July for a fast-tracked safeguard plan.The court-sanctioned Accelerated Safeguard Plan included provisions for three capital increases  one of which—the Groupement Capital Increase—did not offer preferential subscription rights but did grant priority right to Existing Shareholders registered by November 15. These shareholders had an opportunity during a five-day trading period to claim New Shares before they were opened to the public in France.The Equitization Capital Increase completed on November 30 resulted in unsecured creditors acquiring approximately 98% ownership post-increase through claim set-off.

Here Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting (TAA) North America provides expert insights into key areas of focus and strategic year-end tax planning as it relates to individuals  corporations and the tax and accounting profession.What: Year-end tax planning is often the last chance many have to take critical actions that will directly impact 2023 tax returns. There are several common tax strategies that are evergreen and should be considered annually  while others are unique to the current 2023 tax season due to specific changes in tax legislation. Both annual and seasonal tax strategies present opportunities to maximize one's return.Annual year-end tax planning strategies that should always be considered include: postponing income and accelerating deductions; maximizing qualified retirement plan and charitable contributions; bunching itemized deductions; tax loss harvesting; and annual gifting.Tax planning issues that are specific to the 2023 filing season should be approached strategically and include: leveraging the expanded clean energy-related credits for the home; new and expanded clean vehicle credits; new and expanded clean energy credits and deductions for businesses  including small business expensing and clean commercial vehicles; new third-party reporting on Form 1099-B and postponement of expanded Form 1099-K reporting; change in required minimum distributions (RMDs) for retirement plans; possible legislative changes to Child Tax Credit  the state and local tax deduction limit  and business depreciation and expensing; and  IRS challenge to Employee Retention Credit claims.To learn more about how to strategically prepare for year-end tax planning  please visit our resources page or reach out to schedule an interview with one of our experts.Resources: Wolters Kluwer has published a Tax Briefing for 2023 Year End Tax Planning  which can be downloaded at the following link: engagetax.wolterskluwer.com/2023-Year-End-Tax-Planning.Interview Opportunities:Mark Luscombe   JD  LLM  CPA  Principal Federal Tax Analyst  Wolters Kluwer TAA  North AmericaInterviews can be arranged by contacting Shannon Wherry  Associate Director  External Communications TAA  at shannon.wherry@wolterskluwer.com.Wolters Kluwer TAA federal tax experts are also available to discuss the year-end planning strategies for 2023  or any other current tax topics impacting business and individual taxpayers.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG.

With 57% of enterprise IT’s carbon footprint attributable to workplace devices*  this service offering represents a major step forward in providing clients with access to new sustainable IT solutions.Since the 2021 announcement of Atos’ partnership with the BSI Kitemark™ certified startup Circular Computing at COP26  Atos has expanded its portfolio and set up a comprehensive suite of more than 20 “Tech for Good” services and solutions  encompassing social value and accessibility criteria as well as data analytics and user interfaces.The first segment in the new offering reshapes device lifecycle management. Most companies replace employee laptops every three to four years  with each new device accountable for emissions of more than 300 kg of CO 2 e (carbon dioxide equivalent)**. Atos is now working with a global network of industrial partners to offer clients lower-carbon laptop replacement options  including performance-based refresh and extended use  refurbishing  or remanufacturing.However  to optimize IT assets it is critical to accurately measure their usage and the carbon footprint of digital behaviors. Atos’ new offering includes a set of dashboards that enable end users and executives to better monitor and improve their workplace carbon footprint.The “Atos Tech 4 Good Assistant” application offers employees real-time feedback about their personal performance against environmental and social parameters. The assistant can recommend actions such as removing unnecessary programs  turning off the laptop or changing settings on the device. The assistant is available via Microsoft Teams or pop-up notifications  and provides a monthly performance report for each end user.The final part of the sustainable workplace offering provides consolidated data and recommended actions to IT and CSR leaders. These recommendations allow leaders to not only closely monitor and manage their workplace carbon footprint  but also to improve the impact of the service in terms of social value and accessibility. They are designed to support CSR reporting  which is becoming an increasingly challenging task for organizations across the world.The Atos Tech 4 Good Assistant solution already monitors more than 100 device models  applications and services  and offers 10+ dashboards to track metrics like device redeployment and improved electricity use. The offering has been co-designed with several Atos clients to ensure it meets the needs of different industries and geographies before expanding to more devices and services as it ramps up in 2024.Alexa Van Den Bempt  Senior Vice President  Digital Business Platforms  Tech Foundations  Atos said: “I am very excited about this new offering. Not only will it help meet our clients’ monitoring and reporting needs  but we are also taking major strides towards making decarbonization more compelling  empowering employees to make the right choices for our planet.”The Atos Group has been committed to reducing the environmental impact of activities across its worldwide value chain for more than 12 years. It has been a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes for the World and Europe for eight years  and was among the first three European IT companies to make the list. Atos has earned an “A” score for more than 10 years by the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project)  which rewards actions to fight global warming.Digital Workplace is one of the strategic core activities of Atos’ Tech Foundations business line. It provides end-to-end employee experience through digital collaboration and productivity tools  as well as intelligent customer care services.

The assistant can recommend actions such as removing unnecessary programs  turning off the laptop or changing settings on the device. The assistant is available via Microsoft Teams or pop-up notifications  and provides a monthly performance report for each end user.The final part of the sustainable workplace offering provides consolidated data and recommended actions to IT and CSR leaders. These recommendations allow leaders to not only closely monitor and manage their workplace carbon footprint  but also to improve the impact of the service in terms of social value and accessibility. They are designed to support CSR reporting  which is becoming an increasingly challenging task for organizations across the world.The Atos Tech 4 Good Assistant solution already monitors more than 100 device models  applications and services  and offers 10+ dashboards to track metrics like device redeployment and improved electricity use. The offering has been co-designed with several Atos clients to ensure it meets the needs of different industries and geographies before expanding to more devices and services as it ramps up in 2024.Alexa Van Den Bempt  Senior Vice President  Digital Business Platforms  Tech Foundations  Atos said: “I am very excited about this new offering.

It is not possible to identify the factors of the market or related to the fundamentals of EURO which could explain the rise in EURO Ressources' share price prior to the announcement of the Offer (the highest price  €3.35  was reached on November 10  2023).- We have not been informed of nor have we identified any Related-Party Agreements within the meaning of Article 261-1 I of the AMF General Regulations  paragraph 4.In conclusion  we consider that the Offer Price of €3.50 is fair for the holders of the Company's securities in the context of the Buy-out Offer and the Squeeze Out.""The Independent Expert answers questions raised by the directors.The Chairman presents the report of the Committee and the recommendation to the board of directors:(a) after taking into account:the draft offer document prepared by the Offeror; andthe report of the Independent Expert;(b) the Committee has acknowledged that:according to the information in draft offer document prepared by the Offeror  the Offeror holds 90.00000016002% of the share capital and 94.37% of the voting rights of the Company; on this basis  the Offeror complies therefore with the provisions of the AMF Regulations to implement the buyout offer and a squeeze-out;as part of the Squeeze Out  the shares that are not held by the Offeror will be transferred to it  in exchange for consideration equal to the Offer price  i.e. 3.50 euros per share  net of all costs  independently of any decision of the shareholders to sell their shares;the rationale of the Offer as described by the Offeror is the following:""In the current gold price environment IAMGOLD  through IAMGOLD France  intends to focus on rationalizing its asset portfolio  financing the Côté Gold project in Canada and addressing the cost structure of all its operating mines.The sale of the Rosebel Gold Mine has been carried out to help finance IAMGOLD's Côté Gold project. As a result  due to the royalty arrangement already in place  IAMGOLD pays a royalty to the Company  the holder of the Rosebel Royalty  on the basis of external information received from the present owner of the Rosebel Gold Mine  and in its capacity as 90% shareholder receives back 90% of such a royalty as dividend. The Rosebel Royalty is the main asset of EURO Ressources and will come to an end in 6 years. EURO Ressources would need to further invest into its own business and make strategic acquisitions to pursue its activities and continue to grow its business  in particular after the Rosebel Royalty comes to an end.There is a strategic misalignment between IAMGOLD and the Company with investing in further royalties and expanding the Company business. The strategic focus of IAMGOLD  through IAMGOLD France  is not to further develop EURO Ressources by acquiring new royalties  but rather to rationalize its asset portfolio  simplify its group structures  help finance its present mining projects and addressing the cost structure of all its operating mines.Obtaining full ownership of the Company  the holder of the Rosebel Royalty  will improve the cost structure of IAMGOLD on a consolidated basis. IAMGOLD  through IAMGOLD France  also wishes to simplify and reduce the ongoing costs and holding structure of the IAMGOLD group  and to eliminate the regulatory and administrative constraints which result from the listed and public reporting status of its subsidiary EURO Ressources.The market of EURO Ressources shares is not liquid and the Offer will also provide immediate liquidity to shareholders.""the conclusion of the Independent Expert indicates that:""[…] our conclusion is based on the following considerations:- The Offer Price of €3.50 represents a premium of 34.2% over the central value of €2.61  and of 24.8% over the upper limit of the range (€2.80) resulting from the application of the Net Asset Value per Sum of the Parties method used as the principal valuation method.- The Offer Price is higher than the maximum share price recorded over the last 12 months prior to the announcement of the Offer. The premium in relation to volume-weighted average share prices is between 6.7% (spot price at November 13  2023) and 17.9% (volume-weighted average share price over the last 12 months). It is not possible to identify the factors of the market or related to the fundamentals of EURO which could explain the rise in EURO Ressources' share price prior to the announcement of the Offer (the highest price  €3.35  was reached on November 10  2023).- We have not been informed of nor have we identified any Related-Party Agreements within the meaning of Article 261-1 I of the AMF General Regulations  paragraph 4.In conclusion  we consider that the Offer Price of €3.50 is fair for the holders of the Company's securities in the context of the Buy-out Offer and the Squeeze Out.""given the statement of the Offeror regarding its intention not to further develop the Company by acquiring new royalties:- the Offer represents an opportunity for the shareholders of the Company to benefit from an immediate liquidity on their full participation by tendering their shares to the Offer  such liquidity being offered at an attractive price with respect to the premium offered compared to the value of the Company resulting from the multi-criteria methods of valuation such as specified in the report of the Independent Expert; especially the price offered results in a premium of 34.2% over the central value of €2.61  and of 24.8% over the upper limit of the range (€2.80) resulting from the application of the principal valuation method used by the Independent Expert (Net Asset Value per Sum of the Parties method);- the trading of the shares of the Company on the Segment B of Euronext PARIS will no longer be relevant as there will be no use of the financial market for financing the development of the Company;the delisting of the shares of the Company on the Segment B of Euronext PARIS will reduce the operating costs of the Company  by cancelling the related regulatory and administrative constrains and the requirements in terms of permanent and ongoing disclosures imposed by the financial regulations;(c) the Committee:has determined that the Offer is made within the interest of the Company and its shareholders and that it entails a satisfying opportunity of sale for the shareholders which intend to benefit from an immediate liquidity  andhas determined therefore to recommend to the board of directors to issue a favorable opinion regarding the Offer.Discussion amongst the Directors ensued. In response to a question  Ms. Karsenti advised that the Autorité des marchés financiers (the “AMF”) did not prefer one method of valuation over another but rather considered what the most appropriate valuation method would be given a particular company’s circumstances. Following brief further discussion  upon motion duly made and seconded  and carried unanimously  the following resolution was approved by the Board of Directors:WHEREAS  after taking into account:A. the draft offer document prepared by the Offeror filed with the AMF on November 14  2023;B. the report from the Independent Expert  prepared pursuant to article 262-1 of the AMF General Regulations;C. the recommendation of the Committee; andD. the draft information document in response by the Company to the Offer which shall have to be filed with the AMF in accordance with article 231-26 of the AMF General Regulations of the AMF;RESOLVED THAT the board of directors is of the opinion that  for the same motives exposed by the Committee as part of its recommendation  the Offer is made within the interest of the Company and its shareholders and that it entails a satisfying opportunity of sale for the shareholders which intend to benefit from an immediate liquidity  and that therefore it recommends to the shareholders to tender their shares to the Offer initiated by the Offeror.This resolution and the related motivated opinion were delivered unanimously by the members present  being recalled that among them:▪ the independent directors  all members of the Committee  were each invited to cast their vote first  and all agreed with the recommendations of the Committee and voted in favor of the proposed Offer;▪ the directors in a potential conflict of interest situation  namely Mr. Bursanescu and Mr. Bradburn  then were invited to cast their votes  and all declared that they agreed with the recommendations of the above members  and thus voted favorably on the proposed Offer.""4.

The involvement of Singapore SPRIM Global Investment Company  through its dedicated TrialCap Fund  is greatly appreciated by the all BioSenic team  for the benefit of the patients.”About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in immune and autoimmune diseases. Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning and key strengths to develop  separately and in combination  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com .About BioSenic technology platformsThe ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). BioSenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol. ALLOB  an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. After phase 2 clinical results with contradictory conclusions  BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (between early or late treatment).The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.About SPRIM Global Investments:SPRIM Global Investments (SGI) invests principally in companies that provide R&D capabilities to bring life science  biotech and medtech innovations to patients around the world.

Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning and key strengths to develop  separately and in combination  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com .About BioSenic technology platformsThe ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). BioSenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol. ALLOB  an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. After phase 2 clinical results with contradictory conclusions  BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (between early or late treatment).The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.About SPRIM Global Investments:SPRIM Global Investments (SGI) invests principally in companies that provide R&D capabilities to bring life science  biotech and medtech innovations to patients around the world.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2023  ended September 30  2023  and provided an update on its corporate progress.“In the third quarter of 2023  we continued to make significant progress with the clinical development of our core asset  varoglutamstat. From learnings across currently approved monoclonal antibodies  we see a clear unmet need among early Alzheimer’s disease patients for a safe and effective oral therapy and we believe that varoglutamstat can address this gap ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon. “We are preparing for the upcoming European Phase 2b VIVIAD study readout during the end of the first quarter of 2024 and potential discussions with the FDA thereafter. Separately  we have initiated the identification of novel oral QPTC/L inhibitors as second generation compounds in early AD from our oral small molecule platform. We are also integrating additional biomarkers of kidney function into the VIVIAD study to assess the potential of QPCT/L inhibitors in chronic kidney disease. We are committed to growing Vivoryon into a leading biotech company with our highly attractive programs that have prospects in multiple disease areas with high unmet need including AD  chronic kidney disease  NASH  oncology and orphan CNS.”Dr. Weber continued  “I would also like to express my gratitude to Florian Schmid  our CFO  who has decided not to renew his contract as a member of the Vivoryon executive leadership team and pursue other opportunities. Florian has played a significant role in increasing the quality of our financial position and processes over the last several years. In light of this transition  I am excited to announce the promotion of Anne Doering as CFO whose extensive capital markets experience will be instrumental to Vivoryon’s next phase of growth. To ensure a smooth transition we are pleased that Florian plans to continue with us as a strategic advisor after Anne assumes the CFO role.”Q3 2023 and Post-Period Portfolio HighlightsVaroglutamstat Clinical Program:Varoglutamstat is a differentiated investigational small-molecule medicine in development to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It is currently being investigated in two large Phase 2 studies  VIVIAD (NCT04498650) in Europe and VIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) in the U.S.  where it continues to show evidence of a favorable safety profile at the therapeutic dose of 600mg twice daily (BID)  a dose demonstrated to result in a target occupancy of nearly 90%. In addition  VIVALONG  an open-label extension study  will allow for the potential confirmation of the long-term safety and health outcome benefits of varoglutamstat after patients have completed the double blinded studies VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND. The study will also generate relevant pharmacoeconomic data.Varoglutamstat is designed to prevent N3pE-Abeta formation  rather than aiming to clear existing plaques  making it an intervention upstream of other approaches such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Through a second mode of action  varoglutamstat also modulates neuroinflammation via the CCL2 pathway  which  in turn  has an impact on tau pathology.VIVIADVIVIAD (NCT04498650) is a state-of-the-art Phase 2b study being conducted in Europe and is designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of varoglutamstat in 259 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD.In July 2023  Vivoryon announced a safety update based on data from all 259 randomized patients which showed no clinical signs of varoglutamstat associated ARIAs at the cutoff date of June 14  2023. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) decided the study should continue as planned and that no additional DSMB meeting will be required until study completion.In October 2023  Vivoryon hosted a virtual R&D Event with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) focused on the clinical utility of primary and secondary endpoints of the VIVIAD study. The primary endpoint  which is a combination of three elements of the Cogstate neuropsychological test battery (NTB)  called “Cogstate 3-item scale ” includes Identification  Detection and One Back tests and evaluates attention and working memory domains over 48-96 weeks. Key secondary efficacy endpoints include in hierarchical order: Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB  4-item scale)  the full Cogstate NTB (8-item scale)  the Amsterdam Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q)  and electroencephalogram (EEG).In the VIVIAD study  discontinuation rates to date remain favorable (cut-off date of November 20  2023). The total number of discontinuations remains low in VIVIAD throughout the study at less than 13% based on blinded data. In addition  the number of discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) has remained at less than 4%.The statistical power of VIVIAD to detect a potential treatment difference of Cohen’s d of 0.35 between active and placebo is confirmed to be above 80% as assumed in the study protocol.Vivoryon remains on track to share final topline data during the end of the first quarter of 2024 and the full dataset at a subsequent medical meeting. Following the VIVIAD data readout  the Company expects to conduct an end of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second half of 2024. The end of the active treatment phase in VIVIAD is estimated to occur by year end 2023  which is then followed by a minimum period of four weeks of safety follow-up visits with rigorous data and statistical analysis thereafter. Vivoryon expects the final VIVIAD dataset to include an evaluation of patients following the 12-week titration period  which is the same for every patient randomized to the active arm. The 600mg BID is applied in approximately 75% of the treatment weeks of all patients and the 300mg BID is applied in approximately 25% of the treatment weeks.VIVA-MINDVIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) is a complementary Phase 2 study for varoglutamstat being conducted in the U.S. which seeks to enroll 180 patients with early AD into the Phase 2a adaptive dose finding portion and to enroll a further 234 patients in the Phase 2b portion of the study. VIVA-MIND is running in parallel to VIVIAD to provide robust evidence on slowing AD progression and to support Vivoryon’s regulatory strategy.In October 2023  Vivoryon announced that the study’s independent DSMB unanimously recommend that VIVA-MIND should proceed with a dose of 600mg BID through the remainder of Phase 2a and 2b. This decision follows the September 2023 DSMB quarterly safety review of adverse events and labs  and the October 2023 analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest (AESI) pertaining to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and hepatobiliary disorders  as well as target occupancy and plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) data.With VIVA-MIND  the Company has confirmed the feasibility of an up-titration protocol to the final dose of 600mg BID which is accelerated compared to the ongoing VIVIAD Phase 2b study. VIVA-MIND is continuing to recruit participants into the second cohort  with 21 sites open across the U.S.Vivoryon’s regulatory strategy for VIVA-MIND follows an adaptive trial design which includes the option to expand the study to a confirmatory Phase 3 study contingent on VIVIAD results and regulatory feedback.VIVALONGIn July 2023  Vivoryon announced that it commenced preparations for an open-label extension (OLE) study  VIVALONG  to provide a long-term treatment option to patients after completion of treatment under the VIVIAD or VIVA-MIND protocol.The launch of VIVALONG is contingent on the outcome of VIVIAD.Pending VIVIAD results  Vivoryon plans to assess the long-term treatment of varoglutamstat including positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and other key safety and efficacy endpoints.Early-Stage Pipeline and Kidney Disease Exploration:Vivoryon is unveiling additional opportunities in R&D activities stemming from its proprietary oral small molecule QPCT/L inhibitor platform. Following the VIVIAD readout  Vivoryon plans to leverage findings to further bolster its platform capabilities and potentially nominate new development projects in 2024.The Company has initiated the identification of novel oral QPCT/L inhibitors as second generation compounds in early AD.The VIVIAD study will now include additional biomarkers to investigate the effect of QPCT/L inhibition on kidney function.Activities to identify suitable new chemical entity (NCE) oral QPCT/L inhibitors as potential development projects in 2024 are underway in multiple disease areas including AD  chronic kidney disease  NASH  oncology and orphan CNS  such as Huntington’s disease and Down syndrome.Corporate Development Updates:In September 2023  Vivoryon held an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) related to the appointment of Frank Weber  MD  as CEO and Anne Doering  CFA  as Chief Strategy & Investor Relations Officer (CS&IRO). The shareholders approved all items on the agenda of the meeting  including the appointment of Dr. Weber and Anne Doering to the Company’s Board as executive directors.The Company announced the appointment of Anne Doering as Chief Financial Officer (CFO)  leveraging Ms. Doering’s deep capital markets experience and enabling a smooth management transition as she succeeds Florian Schmid on March 1  2024.Financial Results for the Third Quarter of 2023No revenues were generated in the nine months ended September 30  2023  or the nine months ended September 30  2022.Research and development expenses of EUR 10.4 million in the nine months ended September 30  2023  decreased by EUR 5.6 million compared to the nine months ended September 30  2022. This decrease is primarily attributable to EUR 3.0 million lower expenses related to our clinical trial VIVIAD and EUR 2.6 million lower manufacturing cost for study drug production.General and administrative expenses of EUR 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30  2023  increased by EUR 2.6 million from EUR 4.2 million in the nine months ended September 30  2022. The main reasons for the increase were EUR 0.9 million higher personnel costs  EUR 0.9 million higher costs for the non-executive Board and EUR 0.8 million higher consulting costs. The reasons for the cost increases in personnel and the non-executive Board were predominantly caused by accelerated share-option expenses and severance payments as a result of the 2023 Board changes.Net loss of EUR 17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30  2023  compares to EUR 18.9 million for the nine months ended September 30  2022.The Company held EUR 17.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30  2023  compared to EUR 26.6 million as of December 31  2022. In the nine months ended September 30  2023  the Company entered into Euro term deposits of EUR 16.0 million resulting in a disclosure of these funds in the balance sheet as financial assets. Combining the cash and cash equivalents with the term deposits  Vivoryon has EUR 33.0 million in liquid funds at its disposal.Cash flows used in operating activities were EUR (33.3) million for the nine months ended September 30  2023  compared to EUR (14.7) million in the nine months ended September 30  2022. The change in operating cash flow by EUR (18.5) million mainly results from newly disclosed term deposits with a term of more than three months of EUR (16.0) million that are disclosed in the Company`s financial assets and not in cash equivalents as well as other changes in working capital. Excluding this shift in cash to term deposits  cash flows used in operating activities would have been EUR (17.3) million.Cash flows used in investing activities were EUR (0.5) million for the nine months ended September 30  2023  compared to EUR 2.0 thousand in the nine months ended September 30  2022.Cash flows provided from financing activities were EUR 24.2 million for the nine months ended September 30  2023  including EUR 1.3 million from the exercise of share options  compared to EUR 19.1 million in the nine months ended September 30  2022.Financial GuidanceIncluding the proceeds from the capital raise completed in May 2023  according to current planning and estimates  Vivoryon expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its research and development expenses  as well as the general and administrative expenses and cash flows from investing and financing activities into the second half of 2024. This guidance does not include potential milestone payments from development partnerships  potential payments from licensing agreements and/or additional financing measures  as exercise of the options granted in connection with the private placement announced September 30  2022 (see note 8.11 of the Company’s annual financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022).Conference Call and WebcastVivoryon will host a conference call and webcast today  December 6  2023  at 3:00 pm CET (9:00 am EST).

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2023  ended September 30  2023  and provided an update on its corporate progress.“In the third quarter of 2023  we continued to make significant progress with the clinical development of our core asset  varoglutamstat. From learnings across currently approved monoclonal antibodies  we see a clear unmet need among early Alzheimer’s disease patients for a safe and effective oral therapy and we believe that varoglutamstat can address this gap ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon. “We are preparing for the upcoming European Phase 2b VIVIAD study readout during the end of the first quarter of 2024 and potential discussions with the FDA thereafter. Separately  we have initiated the identification of novel oral QPTC/L inhibitors as second generation compounds in early AD from our oral small molecule platform. We are also integrating additional biomarkers of kidney function into the VIVIAD study to assess the potential of QPCT/L inhibitors in chronic kidney disease. We are committed to growing Vivoryon into a leading biotech company with our highly attractive programs that have prospects in multiple disease areas with high unmet need including AD  chronic kidney disease  NASH  oncology and orphan CNS.”Dr. Weber continued  “I would also like to express my gratitude to Florian Schmid  our CFO  who has decided not to renew his contract as a member of the Vivoryon executive leadership team and pursue other opportunities. Florian has played a significant role in increasing the quality of our financial position and processes over the last several years. In light of this transition  I am excited to announce the promotion of Anne Doering as CFO whose extensive capital markets experience will be instrumental to Vivoryon’s next phase of growth. To ensure a smooth transition we are pleased that Florian plans to continue with us as a strategic advisor after Anne assumes the CFO role.”Q3 2023 and Post-Period Portfolio HighlightsVaroglutamstat Clinical Program:Varoglutamstat is a differentiated investigational small-molecule medicine in development to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It is currently being investigated in two large Phase 2 studies  VIVIAD (NCT04498650) in Europe and VIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) in the U.S.  where it continues to show evidence of a favorable safety profile at the therapeutic dose of 600mg twice daily (BID)  a dose demonstrated to result in a target occupancy of nearly 90%. In addition  VIVALONG  an open-label extension study  will allow for the potential confirmation of the long-term safety and health outcome benefits of varoglutamstat after patients have completed the double blinded studies VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND. The study will also generate relevant pharmacoeconomic data.Varoglutamstat is designed to prevent N3pE-Abeta formation  rather than aiming to clear existing plaques  making it an intervention upstream of other approaches such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Through a second mode of action  varoglutamstat also modulates neuroinflammation via the CCL2 pathway  which  in turn  has an impact on tau pathology.VIVIADVIVIAD (NCT04498650) is a state-of-the-art Phase 2b study being conducted in Europe and is designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of varoglutamstat in 259 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD.In July 2023  Vivoryon announced a safety update based on data from all 259 randomized patients which showed no clinical signs of varoglutamstat associated ARIAs at the cutoff date of June 14  2023. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) decided the study should continue as planned and that no additional DSMB meeting will be required until study completion.In October 2023  Vivoryon hosted a virtual R&D Event with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) focused on the clinical utility of primary and secondary endpoints of the VIVIAD study. The primary endpoint  which is a combination of three elements of the Cogstate neuropsychological test battery (NTB)  called “Cogstate 3-item scale ” includes Identification  Detection and One Back tests and evaluates attention and working memory domains over 48-96 weeks. Key secondary efficacy endpoints include in hierarchical order: Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB  4-item scale)  the full Cogstate NTB (8-item scale)  the Amsterdam Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q)  and electroencephalogram (EEG).In the VIVIAD study  discontinuation rates to date remain favorable (cut-off date of November 20  2023). The total number of discontinuations remains low in VIVIAD throughout the study at less than 13% based on blinded data. In addition  the number of discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) has remained at less than 4%.The statistical power of VIVIAD to detect a potential treatment difference of Cohen’s d of 0.35 between active and placebo is confirmed to be above 80% as assumed in the study protocol.Vivoryon remains on track to share final topline data during the end of the first quarter of 2024 and the full dataset at a subsequent medical meeting. Following the VIVIAD data readout  the Company expects to conduct an end of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second half of 2024. The end of the active treatment phase in VIVIAD is estimated to occur by year end 2023  which is then followed by a minimum period of four weeks of safety follow-up visits with rigorous data and statistical analysis thereafter. Vivoryon expects the final VIVIAD dataset to include an evaluation of patients following the 12-week titration period  which is the same for every patient randomized to the active arm. The 600mg BID is applied in approximately 75% of the treatment weeks of all patients and the 300mg BID is applied in approximately 25% of the treatment weeks.VIVA-MINDVIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) is a complementary Phase 2 study for varoglutamstat being conducted in the U.S. which seeks to enroll 180 patients with early AD into the Phase 2a adaptive dose finding portion and to enroll a further 234 patients in the Phase 2b portion of the study. VIVA-MIND is running in parallel to VIVIAD to provide robust evidence on slowing AD progression and to support Vivoryon’s regulatory strategy.In October 2023  Vivoryon announced that the study’s independent DSMB unanimously recommend that VIVA-MIND should proceed with a dose of 600mg BID through the remainder of Phase 2a and 2b. This decision follows the September 2023 DSMB quarterly safety review of adverse events and labs  and the October 2023 analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest (AESI) pertaining to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and hepatobiliary disorders  as well as target occupancy and plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) data.With VIVA-MIND  the Company has confirmed the feasibility of an up-titration protocol to the final dose of 600mg BID which is accelerated compared to the ongoing VIVIAD Phase 2b study. VIVA-MIND is continuing to recruit participants into the second cohort  with 21 sites open across the U.S.Vivoryon’s regulatory strategy for VIVA-MIND follows an adaptive trial design which includes the option to expand the study to a confirmatory Phase 3 study contingent on VIVIAD results and regulatory feedback.VIVALONGIn July 2023  Vivoryon announced that it commenced preparations for an open-label extension (OLE) study  VIVALONG  to provide a long-term treatment option to patients after completion of treatment under the VIVIAD or VIVA-MIND protocol.The launch of VIVALONG is contingent on the outcome of VIVIAD.Pending VIVIAD results  Vivoryon plans to assess the long-term treatment of varoglutamstat including positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and other key safety and efficacy endpoints.Early-Stage Pipeline and Kidney Disease Exploration:Vivoryon is unveiling additional opportunities in R&D activities stemming from its proprietary oral small molecule QPCT/L inhibitor platform. Following the VIVIAD readout  Vivoryon plans to leverage findings to further bolster its platform capabilities and potentially nominate new development projects in 2024.The Company has initiated the identification of novel oral QPCT/L inhibitors as second generation compounds in early AD.The VIVIAD study will now include additional biomarkers to investigate the effect of QPCT/L inhibition on kidney function.Activities to identify suitable new chemical entity (NCE) oral QPCT/L inhibitors as potential development projects in 2024 are underway in multiple disease areas including AD  chronic kidney disease  NASH  oncology and orphan CNS  such as Huntington’s disease and Down syndrome.Corporate Development Updates:In September 2023  Vivoryon held an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) related to the appointment of Frank Weber  MD  as CEO and Anne Doering  CFA  as Chief Strategy & Investor Relations Officer (CS&IRO). The shareholders approved all items on the agenda of the meeting  including the appointment of Dr. Weber and Anne Doering to the Company’s Board as executive directors.The Company announced the appointment of Anne Doering as Chief Financial Officer (CFO)  leveraging Ms. Doering’s deep capital markets experience and enabling a smooth management transition as she succeeds Florian Schmid on March 1  2024.Financial Results for the Third Quarter of 2023No revenues were generated in the nine months ended September 30  2023  or the nine months ended September 30  2022.Research and development expenses of EUR 10.4 million in the nine months ended September 30  2023  decreased by EUR 5.6 million compared to the nine months ended September 30  2022. This decrease is primarily attributable to EUR 3.0 million lower expenses related to our clinical trial VIVIAD and EUR 2.6 million lower manufacturing cost for study drug production.General and administrative expenses of EUR 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30  2023  increased by EUR 2.6 million from EUR 4.2 million in the nine months ended September 30  2022. The main reasons for the increase were EUR 0.9 million higher personnel costs  EUR 0.9 million higher costs for the non-executive Board and EUR 0.8 million higher consulting costs. The reasons for the cost increases in personnel and the non-executive Board were predominantly caused by accelerated share-option expenses and severance payments as a result of the 2023 Board changes.Net loss of EUR 17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30  2023  compares to EUR 18.9 million for the nine months ended September 30  2022.The Company held EUR 17.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30  2023  compared to EUR 26.6 million as of December 31  2022. In the nine months ended September 30  2023  the Company entered into Euro term deposits of EUR 16.0 million resulting in a disclosure of these funds in the balance sheet as financial assets. Combining the cash and cash equivalents with the term deposits  Vivoryon has EUR 33.0 million in liquid funds at its disposal.Cash flows used in operating activities were EUR (33.3) million for the nine months ended September 30  2023  compared to EUR (14.7) million in the nine months ended September 30  2022. The change in operating cash flow by EUR (18.5) million mainly results from newly disclosed term deposits with a term of more than three months of EUR (16.0) million that are disclosed in the Company`s financial assets and not in cash equivalents as well as other changes in working capital. Excluding this shift in cash to term deposits  cash flows used in operating activities would have been EUR (17.3) million.Cash flows used in investing activities were EUR (0.5) million for the nine months ended September 30  2023  compared to EUR 2.0 thousand in the nine months ended September 30  2022.Cash flows provided from financing activities were EUR 24.2 million for the nine months ended September 30  2023  including EUR 1.3 million from the exercise of share options  compared to EUR 19.1 million in the nine months ended September 30  2022.Financial GuidanceIncluding the proceeds from the capital raise completed in May 2023  according to current planning and estimates  Vivoryon expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its research and development expenses  as well as the general and administrative expenses and cash flows from investing and financing activities into the second half of 2024. This guidance does not include potential milestone payments from development partnerships  potential payments from licensing agreements and/or additional financing measures  as exercise of the options granted in connection with the private placement announced September 30  2022 (see note 8.11 of the Company’s annual financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022).Conference Call and WebcastVivoryon will host a conference call and webcast today  December 6  2023  at 3:00 pm CET (9:00 am EST).

Passive explosion-protection equipment (€9.4m in revenue)  composed of products specifically designed for protection against dust explosions  as well as a recent move into explosions related to battery energy storage systems (BESS)  under the VIGILEX Energy® brand. This activity accounted for 30% of the Group's revenue in 2022  for a substantial 49% increase compared with 2021.BESS: a new market posting exponential growthHarnessing the expertise acquired since 2010 in dust-explosion protection equipment  in 2022 the Group decided to extend its range of systems to the BESS protection segment. Demand for energy storage is expected to rise significantly  with an annual growth forecast of +23% by 2030  driven by the increase in global renewable energy production. The Group began marketing its range of explosion protection products to global BESS operators several months ago and has obtained its first major listings  representing significant business potential for the Group.Production facilities distributed in 3 geographical regions for a local offeringSTIF operates two production units in France and one in China with a total surface area of 16 000 m2. This presence on two continents ensures proximity with customers  perfectly adapting to their specific needs while optimizing logistics and transport costs. These state-of-the-art production sites incorporate highly automated and robotic lines. The Group plans to increase its production facilities in the near future with the opening of a plant in Texas (United States) to step up its expansion in the North American market.Long-standing commercial presence in Europe  North America and AsiaThe Group relies on a multi-channel sales strategy  combining direct and indirect sales of products through a network of more than 30 distributors worldwide. Thanks to this extended geographical network  established over the last 40 years  and production facilities close to customers  the Group is able to cover the main regions of the world and address a wide range of international customers. This strong geographical foothold is reflected in substantial international revenue  with sales in more than 80 countries accounting for 75% of consolidated revenue in FY 2022.A powerful ambition: step up growth to change dimension by 2027Drawing on a proven and profitable business model  STIF now intends to accelerate its international development in four strategic areas:Quickly become the leading player in explosion-protection equipment in the BESS segment through listings with numerous international manufacturers;in explosion-protection equipment in the BESS segment through listings with numerous international manufacturers; Strengthen the Group's commercial footprint with new hires and the opening of new sales offices in the United States  the Middle East  and South Korea;with new hires and the opening of new sales offices in the United States  the Middle East  and South Korea; Expand the production base   in particular by opening a new plant in Texas (United States)  increasing capacity in China and carrying out refurbishments in France;  in particular by opening a new plant in Texas (United States)  increasing capacity in China and carrying out refurbishments in France; Reinforce the Group's technological advance  by developing innovative products and optimizing the design and efficiency of existing products through an active Research & Development policy.Through the momentum of its markets and the quality of its product range  STIF expects to sharply accelerate revenue in the coming years.

By 2027  the Group is aiming for annual revenue of around €80m  with EBITDA exceeding 15% of revenue.Non-financial performance recognized by EthiFinanceSTIF is committed to a policy of social and environmental responsibility.
