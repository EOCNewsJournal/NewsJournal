Background  rationale and summary The board of directors considers it to be in the interest of the company and the shareholders that the executive management and the employees of the company are made part of the company's development by being offered participation in an incentive program. The reasons for the proposal are to contribute to the possibilities to retain and attract qualified personnel and to increase motivation of the employees of the company by being involved in and working for a positive revenue growth during the period covered by the Share Savings Program 2024/2027. In light of the terms and conditions  size of allotment and other circumstances  the board of directors considers the Share Savings Program 2024/2027  in accordance with the below  to be reasonable and advantageous for the company and its shareholders. The program is suggested to have a three-year performance period. Participation in the program is suggested to be offered to all employees within the company  conditional upon that the employee makes an initial investment in the company's shares (""investment shares""). For each investment MAG Interactive AB (publ) Drottninggatan 95A | SE-113 60 STOCKHOLM | +46 (0) 8-644 35 40 | maginteractive.com | Reg.no 556804-3524share  the participant may receive three additional shares free of charge in MAG Interactive after the performance period  whereof one is conditional upon retained employment (""retention shares"")  one is conditional upon retained employment and the fulfilment of a performance criteria concerning the company's average annual revenue growth during the program (""performance share A"") and one is conditional upon retained employment and the fulfilment of a performance criteria concerning the company's total revenue (""performance share B"") (performance share A and performance share B  together ""performance shares"") (retention shares and performance shares  together ""share rights""). The board of directors' intention is to propose a similar incentive program to the AGM 2025. A. The board of directors' proposal for resolution on implementation of the Share Savings Program 2024/2027 The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement the Share Savings Program 2024/2027 mainly in accordance with the following terms: In total  the Share Savings Program 2024/2027 shall consist of no more than 135 000 share rights  whereof 45 000 retention shares  45 000 performance shares A and 45 000 performance shares B. Participation in the Share Savings Program 2024/2027 requires that participants make a personal investment in the company's shares or allocate already held shares to the program. Each participant shall be offered to participate with a maximum number of investment shares which shall be allocated to the Share Savings Program 2024/2027. The Share Savings Program 2024/2027 shall  in accordance with the below  be offered to: all employees of the company (including employees in MAG Games Ltd) as of 31 January 2024 (approximately 103 persons)  including members of the company's executive management team that are not founders or large shareholders of the company. Participants within each category shall be offered to participate with a maximum number of investment shares as is outlined in the table below: Categories of participants Maximum number of investment shares Group 1 - Executive management (3 persons) 22 500 Group 2 - Other employees (100 persons) 22 500 Total number of investment shares 45 000 For each investment share that is bought and allocated to the program  participants may be granted one retention share  one performance share A and one performance share B free of charge. Allotment of share rights is conditional upon that the participants employment with the company has not been terminated  with certain exceptions for common ""good leaver"" conditions. In case a participant's employment with the company is terminated on good leaver grounds during the performance period  the participant shall be granted share rights pro-rated in relation to the time remaining of the performance period. Allotment of performance shares is  in addition to what is outlined above  subject to the fulfilment of the performance conditions set out below concerning the company's average annual revenue MAG Interactive AB (publ) Drottninggatan 95A | SE-113 60 STOCKHOLM | +46 (0) 8-644 35 40 | maginteractive.com | Reg.no 556804-3524growth and total revenue  respectively  during the performance period  where the participant is allotted one performance share A if a performance condition regarding the average annual revenue growth is fulfilled and one performance share B if a performance condition regarding the total revenue is fulfilled. Fulfilment of the performance condition for performance share A shall be calculated based on a comparison between the average revenue in the company's quarterly reports during the period from and including 1 March 2026  up to and including 28 February 2027 and the average revenue in the company's quarterly reports during the period from and including 1 March 2023  up to and including 29 February 2024. Performance shares will only be allotted if the revenue has grown during the performance period. Performance fulfilment for performance share A is calculated to a maximum of one (1) share at 15% average annual revenue growth with pro-rated allotment in case of performance fulfilment between 5% and 15% average annual revenue growth. Performance fulfilment for performance share B is calculated to a maximum of one (1) share at a total revenue of SEK 500 million at the end of the performance period  with pro-rated allotment from performance fulfilment of performance share A up to a total revenue of SEK 500 million. The number of performance shares to be allotted will be rounded upwards to the nearest whole number of shares. Notice of participation in the Share Savings Program 2024/2027 shall have been received by the company on 30 April 2024 at the latest  and the board of directors shall be entitled to extend this time period. The allotment of share rights to participants shall be made promptly after the expiration of the performance period. The share rights will vest three years after the program start (1 March 2027). Vesting of share rights is accelerated  under certain conditions  in case of a merger in which the company is absorbed by another company or in case of a public offer for all shares in the company whereby the offeror acquires more than 2/3 of the shares in the company  including shares that the offeror or a closely related party to the offeror acquire outside  but in connection with  the offer. The holders can exercise allotted and vested share rights during the period from and including 1 April 2027 up to and including 1 June 2027. The board of directors may  in individual cases  extend the exercise period to no later than 5 July 2027 if the holder  due to applicable rules  cannot exercise the share rights during the initial exercise period. For employees resident outside of Sweden  participation requires that such participation is in accordance with applicable laws  and that the board of directors  in its sole discretion  consider it to be possible with reasonable administrative and economic efforts. The share rights shall be governed by separate agreements with each participant. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Share Savings Program 2024/2027 within the above-mentioned substantial terms. B. The board of directors' proposal for an issue of warrants In order to enable the company's delivery of shares under the Share Savings Program 2024/2027  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 135 000 warrants of series 2024/2027  free of charge  to a wholly owned subsidiary of MAG Interactive AB (publ) (the ""Subsidiary"") in accordance with the following: MAG Interactive AB (publ) Drottninggatan 95A | SE-113 60 STOCKHOLM | +46 (0) 8-644 35 40 | maginteractive.com | Reg.no 556804-3524Each warrant of series 2024/2027 entitles the holder to subscription for one (1) share in MAG Interactive AB (publ) during the period from 1 February 2024  or the later date on which the warrants are registered  up to and including 25 July 2027. Subscription for new shares by way of exercising warrants of series 2024/2027 shall be made at a price per share of SEK 0.025975  which corresponds to the quota value of the shares. The exercise price and the number of shares that each warrant of series 2024/2027 entitles to may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  share split  rights issue  or similar actions  wherein the recalculation terms in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants shall be applied. The subscription of warrants of series 2024/2027 shall be made no later than on 8 April 2024. However  the board of directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period. There can be no over-subscription. For complete terms  see Appendix 1and Appendix A1. If the warrants of series 2024/2027 are exercised in full  the share capital will increase by SEK 3 506.493507. C. The board of directors' proposal for approval of transfer of shares and/or warrants The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary may transfer shares and/or warrants of series 2024/2027 to the participants in the Share Savings Program 2024/2027 in connection with the allotment of the share rights in accordance with the terms set out in section A. Dilution effect  market value  costs  etc. The board of directors' proposal to resolve on issuance of warrants entails a dilution effect corresponding to a maximum of approximately 0.51 per cent of the shares and votes in the company if the proposed warrants are exercised in full. The dilution effect is calculated as the relation between the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for and the sum of the current number of shares and the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for. Residual warrants will be cancelled and as such will not result in any dilution effect for the shareholders. The Share Savings Program 2024/2027 is expected to have only marginal effects on the company's key ratios. The board of directors' assessment is that the Share Savings Program 2024/2027 will trigger costs mainly related to administration  accounting salary costs and social security contributions. The total costs for administration are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 200 000. The share rights will be accounted as an employee expense over the performance period  without affecting the company's cash flow. If share rights are allotted  the Share Savings Program 2024/2027 will also entail social security contributions. The total costs for social security contributions during the performance period will depend on the participants employee status  the number of share rights that will be vested  and the value of the benefit that the participant will receive  i.e. the value of the retention shares and performance shares at exercise in 2027. Social security contributions will be expensed in the income statement during the performance period based on the value of the share rights. Based on the assumption that 100 per cent of the share rights included in the Share Savings Program 2024/2027 are vested  a share price of SEK 30 upon exercise of the retention shares and MAG Interactive AB (publ) Drottninggatan 95A | SE-113 60 STOCKHOLM | +46 (0) 8-644 35 40 | maginteractive.com | Reg.no 556804-3524performance shares and an average social security cost of 31.42 per cent  the total costs for the program are calculated to amount to approximately SEK 5.1 million during the period 2024-2027  which corresponds to 4.7 percent of the company's annual employee cost (including social security contribution) based on the budgeted employee costs for the financial year 2023/2024. All of the calculations above are preliminary and aim only to present an example of the potential costs that the Share Savings Program 2024/2027 may incur. Actual costs may therefore deviate from what is stated above. Previous incentive programs in MAG Interactive AB (publ) The company currently has one ongoing share savings program  two ongoing warrant programs and two ongoing employee stock option programs for key employees and other employees. These previously approved incentive programs are  together with the Share Savings Program 2024/2027  expected to entail a dilution of approximately 4.76 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares provided that all outstanding and proposed warrants are exercised in full. The dilution effect is calculated as the relation between the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for and the sum of the current number of shares and the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for. For a more detailed description of the company's other share related incentive programs  reference is made to the annual report for the financial year 2022/2023. Preparation of the proposal The proposal has been prepared by the board of directors together with external advisors. Resolutions proposed by the Nomination Committee MAG Interactive AB (publ)'s nomination committee consists of Kaj Nygren (NMO Invest AB and Playful Days AB)  Johan Persson (Johan Persson  Fredrik Stenh and Anders Larsson)  Joachim Spetz (Swedbank Robur Fonder) and Henrik Sandell (Didner & Gerge Fonder)  who together represent approximately 55 per cent of the voting rights in respect of all shares in the company.

Item 12B - Fees to the auditor It is proposed that fees are paid to the company's auditors upon approval of their invoices.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

An oral …,New Drug Application granted priority review with PDUFA date set for June 10  2024European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also validated the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for elafibranorInvestigational elafibranor is the first novel second-line treatment for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) to be filed in E.U. and U.S. in nearly a decadeParis (France)  December 07  2023 – Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) and GENFIT (Nasdaq and Euronext: GNFT) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for investigational elafibranor. An oral  once-daily dual peroxisome activated receptor alpha/delta (PPAR α δ) agonist  investigational elafibranor could potentially be the first novel second-line treatment for the rare  cholestatic liver disease  PBC  in nearly a decade. The target FDA PDUFA date under priority review is June 10  2024.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also validated Ipsen’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for elafibranor and the review of the submission to the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) began on 26 October 2023. Furthermore  a third simultaneous regulatory filing of elafibranor has been validated for review by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).“We are delighted to have achieved simultaneous filings for elafibranor  which is in line with our ambition to be able to bring a new and much needed medicine to as many people living with PBC as rapidly as possible ” said Christelle Huguet  EVP and Head of Research & Development  Ipsen. “This is a condition where many patients are living with worsening disease and debilitating symptoms despite being on treatment. Elafibranor  if approved  has the potential to change the management of this challenging condition for people living with PBC  offering a new second line treatment choice  where the number of effective options are currently limited.”PBC is a rare  progressive  autoimmune cholestatic liver disease1 in which bile ducts in the liver are gradually destroyed.2 The damage to bile ducts can inhibit the liver’s ability to rid the body of toxins  and can lead to scarring of liver tissue  known as cirrhosis.1 2 3 Common symptoms of PBC include fatigue and pruritus (itch)  which can be severely debilitating.4 Untreated  PBC can lead to liver failure  or in some cases death.1 It primarily affects women  with nine women diagnosed for every man.3 A significant proportion of people living with PBC do not benefit from existingtherapies.5  6 7“These simultaneous regulatory submission acceptances are another important step in the elafibranor journey. We are pleased to be partnering with Ipsen  who we know has a good understanding of the rare-disease regulatory process ” said Pascal Prigent  Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT. “We know they share the same goal as GENFIT  to bring a new  much needed treatment option to people living with PBC as fast as possible; we look forward to elafibranor’s progress through the regulatory review processes.”ABOUT ELAFIBRANORElafibranor is an oral  once-daily  dual peroxisome activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/delta (α δ) agonist  currently under investigation as a treatment for patients with PBC  a rare cholestatic liver disease. Elafibranor  through activation of PPAR α δ targets multiple cell types and biological processes involved in the pathophysiology of PBC  including cholestasis (impairment of bile flow in the liver)  bile toxicity  inflammation and fibrosis and bile acid output. In 2019  elafibranor was granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) the existing first-line therapy for PBC. Elafibranor has not received approval by regulatory authorities anywhere in the world.ABOUT ELATIVE®ELATIVE is a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial  with an open-label long-term extension (NCT04526665). ELATIVE evaluated the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 80mg once daily versus placebo for the treatment of patients with PBC with an inadequate response or intolerance to UDCA. The trial enrolled 161 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive either elafibranor 80mg once daily or placebo. Patients with an inadequate response to UDCA would continue to receive UDCA in combination with elafibranor or placebo  while patients unable to tolerate UDCA would receive only elafibranor or placebo. Data confirmed the potential for elafibranor to be an effective new treatment option for PBC  with 13 times more patients achieving a biochemical response  suggesting an improvement in disease progression  when treated with elafibranor compared with patients on placebo: 47% placebo-adjusted difference  elafibranor 80mg (51%) compared with placebo (4%) (P<0.001).8Reductions in levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were rapid  seen as early as Week 4 in the elafibranor group  and were sustained through Week 52  with a decrease in ALP of 41% on elafibranor compared with placebo.8 ALP and bilirubin are important predictors of PBC disease progression. ELATIVE also investigated the effect of treatment with elafibranor on pruritus (severe itch)  a significant symptom burden amongst people living with PBC. Findings from the secondary endpoint using the PBC Worst Itch NRS score  showed a reduction in pruritis for elafibranor  which was not statistically significant. Data reported from two separate patient-reported outcome measures demonstrated reductions in moderate to severe pruritus  which favored elafibranor versus placebo.8 Elafibranor was well-tolerated in the trial and has a well-documented safety profile. Adverse events occurring in >10% of patients and more frequently on elafibranor versus placebo included abdominal pain  diarrhea  nausea  and vomiting.8ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs.

Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

An oral  o…,New Drug Application granted priority review with PDUFA date set for June 10  2024European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also validated the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for elafibranorInvestigational elafibranor is the first novel second-line treatment for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) to be filed in E.U. and U.S. in nearly a decadePARIS  FRANCE  07 December 2023 - Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) and GENFIT (Nasdaq and Euronext: GNFT) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for investigational elafibranor. An oral  once-daily dual peroxisome activated receptor alpha/delta (PPAR α δ) agonist  investigational elafibranor could potentially be the first novel second-line treatment for the rare  cholestatic liver disease  PBC  in nearly a decade. The target FDA PDUFA date under priority review is June 10  2024.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also validated Ipsen’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for elafibranor and the review of the submission to the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) began on 26 October 2023. Furthermore  a third simultaneous regulatory filing of elafibranor has been validated for review by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).“We are delighted to have achieved simultaneous filings for elafibranor  which is in line with our ambition to be able to bring a new and much needed medicine to as many people living with PBC as rapidly as possible ” said Christelle Huguet  EVP and Head of Research & Development  Ipsen. “This is a condition where many patients are living with worsening disease and debilitating symptoms despite being on treatment. Elafibranor  if approved  has the potential to change the management of this challenging condition for people living with PBC  offering a new second line treatment choice  where the number of effective options are currently limited.”PBC is a rare  progressive  autoimmune cholestatic liver disease1 in which bile ducts in the liver are gradually destroyed.2 The damage to bile ducts can inhibit the liver’s ability to rid the body of toxins  and can lead to scarring of liver tissue  known as cirrhosis.1 2 3 Common symptoms of PBC include fatigue and pruritus (itch)  which can be severely debilitating.4 Untreated  PBC can lead to liver failure  or in some cases death.1 It primarily affects women  with nine women diagnosed for every man.3 A significant proportion of people living with PBC do not benefit from existing therapies.5 6 7“These simultaneous regulatory submission acceptances are another important step in the elafibranor journey. We are pleased to be partnering with Ipsen  who we know has a good understanding of the rare-disease regulatory process ” said Pascal Prigent  Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT. “We know they share the same goal as GENFIT  to bring a new  much needed treatment option to people living with PBC as fast as possible; we look forward to elafibranor’s progress through the regulatory review processes.”ENDSElafibranorElafibranor is an oral  once-daily  dual peroxisome activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/delta (α δ) agonist  currently under investigation as a treatment for patients with PBC  a rare cholestatic liver disease. Elafibranor  through activation of PPAR α δ targets multiple cell types and biological processes involved in the pathophysiology of PBC  including cholestasis (impairment of bile flow in the liver)  bile toxicity  inflammation and fibrosis and bile acid output. In 2019  elafibranor was granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) the existing first-line therapy for PBC. Elafibranor has not received approval by regulatory authorities anywhere in the world.ELATIVEELATIVE is a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial  with an open-label long-term extension (NCT04526665). ELATIVE evaluated the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 80mg once daily versus placebo for the treatment of patients with PBC with an inadequate response or intolerance to UDCA. The trial enrolled 161 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive either elafibranor 80mg once daily or placebo. Patients with an inadequate response to UDCA would continue to receive UDCA in combination with elafibranor or placebo  while patients unable to tolerate UDCA would receive only elafibranor or placebo. Data confirmed the potential for elafibranor to be an effective new treatment option for PBC  with 13 times more patients achieving a biochemical response  suggesting an improvement in disease progression  when treated with elafibranor compared with patients on placebo: 47% placebo-adjusted difference  elafibranor 80mg (51%) compared with placebo (4%) (P<0.001).8Reductions in levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were rapid  seen as early as Week 4 in the elafibranor group  and were sustained through Week 52  with a decrease in ALP of 41% on elafibranor compared with placebo.8 ALP and bilirubin are important predictors of PBC disease progression. ELATIVE also investigated the effect of treatment with elafibranor on pruritus (severe itch)  a significant symptom burden amongst people living with PBC. Findings from the secondary endpoint using the PBC Worst Itch NRS score  showed a reduction in pruritis for elafibranor  which was not statistically significant. Data reported from two separate patient-reported outcome measures demonstrated reductions in moderate to severe pruritus  which favored elafibranor versus placebo.8 Elafibranor was well-tolerated in the trial and has a well-documented safety profile. Adverse events occurring in >10% of patients and more frequently on elafibranor versus placebo included abdominal pain  diarrhea  nausea  and vomiting.8IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 100 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share.

An oral  once-daily dual peroxisome activated receptor alpha/delta (PPAR α δ) agonist  investigational elafibranor could potentially be the first novel second-line treatment for the rare  cholestatic liver disease  PBC  in nearly a decade. The target FDA PDUFA date under priority review is June 10  2024.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also validated Ipsen’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for elafibranor and the review of the submission to the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) began on 26 October 2023. Furthermore  a third simultaneous regulatory filing of elafibranor has been validated for review by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).“We are delighted to have achieved simultaneous filings for elafibranor  which is in line with our ambition to be able to bring a new and much needed medicine to as many people living with PBC as rapidly as possible ” said Christelle Huguet  EVP and Head of Research & Development  Ipsen. “This is a condition where many patients are living with worsening disease and debilitating symptoms despite being on treatment. Elafibranor  if approved  has the potential to change the management of this challenging condition for people living with PBC  offering a new second line treatment choice  where the number of effective options are currently limited.”PBC is a rare  progressive  autoimmune cholestatic liver disease1 in which bile ducts in the liver are gradually destroyed.2 The damage to bile ducts can inhibit the liver’s ability to rid the body of toxins  and can lead to scarring of liver tissue  known as cirrhosis.1 2 3 Common symptoms of PBC include fatigue and pruritus (itch)  which can be severely debilitating.4 Untreated  PBC can lead to liver failure  or in some cases death.1 It primarily affects women  with nine women diagnosed for every man.3 A significant proportion of people living with PBC do not benefit from existing therapies.5 6 7“These simultaneous regulatory submission acceptances are another important step in the elafibranor journey. We are pleased to be partnering with Ipsen  who we know has a good understanding of the rare-disease regulatory process ” said Pascal Prigent  Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT. “We know they share the same goal as GENFIT  to bring a new  much needed treatment option to people living with PBC as fast as possible; we look forward to elafibranor’s progress through the regulatory review processes.”ENDSElafibranorElafibranor is an oral  once-daily  dual peroxisome activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/delta (α δ) agonist  currently under investigation as a treatment for patients with PBC  a rare cholestatic liver disease. Elafibranor  through activation of PPAR α δ targets multiple cell types and biological processes involved in the pathophysiology of PBC  including cholestasis (impairment of bile flow in the liver)  bile toxicity  inflammation and fibrosis and bile acid output. In 2019  elafibranor was granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) the existing first-line therapy for PBC. Elafibranor has not received approval by regulatory authorities anywhere in the world.ELATIVEELATIVE is a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial  with an open-label long-term extension (NCT04526665). ELATIVE evaluated the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 80mg once daily versus placebo for the treatment of patients with PBC with an inadequate response or intolerance to UDCA. The trial enrolled 161 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive either elafibranor 80mg once daily or placebo. Patients with an inadequate response to UDCA would continue to receive UDCA in combination with elafibranor or placebo  while patients unable to tolerate UDCA would receive only elafibranor or placebo. Data confirmed the potential for elafibranor to be an effective new treatment option for PBC  with 13 times more patients achieving a biochemical response  suggesting an improvement in disease progression  when treated with elafibranor compared with patients on placebo: 47% placebo-adjusted difference  elafibranor 80mg (51%) compared with placebo (4%) (P<0.001).8Reductions in levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were rapid  seen as early as Week 4 in the elafibranor group  and were sustained through Week 52  with a decrease in ALP of 41% on elafibranor compared with placebo.8 ALP and bilirubin are important predictors of PBC disease progression. ELATIVE also investigated the effect of treatment with elafibranor on pruritus (severe itch)  a significant symptom burden amongst people living with PBC. Findings from the secondary endpoint using the PBC Worst Itch NRS score  showed a reduction in pruritis for elafibranor  which was not statistically significant. Data reported from two separate patient-reported outcome measures demonstrated reductions in moderate to severe pruritus  which favored elafibranor versus placebo.8 Elafibranor was well-tolerated in the trial and has a well-documented safety profile. Adverse events occurring in >10% of patients and more frequently on elafibranor versus placebo included abdominal pain  diarrhea  nausea  and vomiting.8IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 100 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s latest Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com.GENFIT Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements  including those within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to GENFIT  including  but not limited to statements about the potential of elafibranor as a safe and effective second-line treatment for PBC  the opportunity to manage the disease progression and the potential of elafibranor to improve pruritus  reduce cholestatic injury and improve liver function. The use of certain words  including “believe”  “potential ” “expect”  “target”  “may” and “will” and similar expressions  is intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes its expectations are based on the current expectations and reasonable assumptions of the Company’s management  these forward-looking statements are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied or projected by  the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include  among other things  the uncertainties inherent in research and development  including in relation to safety of drug candidates  cost of  progression of  and results from  our ongoing and planned clinical trials  review and approvals by regulatory authorities in the United States  Europe and worldwide  of our drug and diagnostic candidates  potential commercial success of elafibranor if approved  exchange rate fluctuations  our continued ability to raise capital to fund our development  as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed or identified in the Company’s public filings with the AMF  including those listed in Chapter 2 “Main Risks and Uncertainties” of the Company’s 2022 Universal Registration Document filed with the AMF on April 18  2023  which is available on the Company’s website (www.genfit.com) and on the website of the AMF (www.amf-france.org) and public filings and reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) including the Company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on April 18  2023 and subsequent filings and reports filed with the AMF or SEC  including the Half-Year Business and Financial Report at June 30  2023 or otherwise made public  by the Company.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

An oral  once-daily dual peroxisome activated receptor alpha/delta (PPAR α δ) agonist  investigational elafibranor could potentially be the first novel second-line treatment for the rare  cholestatic liver disease  PBC  in nearly a decade. The target FDA PDUFA date under priority review is June 10  2024.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also validated Ipsen’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for elafibranor and the review of the submission to the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) began on 26 October 2023. Furthermore  a third simultaneous regulatory filing of elafibranor has been validated for review by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).“We are delighted to have achieved simultaneous filings for elafibranor  which is in line with our ambition to be able to bring a new and much needed medicine to as many people living with PBC as rapidly as possible ” said Christelle Huguet  EVP and Head of Research & Development  Ipsen. “This is a condition where many patients are living with worsening disease and debilitating symptoms despite being on treatment. Elafibranor  if approved  has the potential to change the management of this challenging condition for people living with PBC  offering a new second line treatment choice  where the number of effective options are currently limited.”PBC is a rare  progressive  autoimmune cholestatic liver disease1 in which bile ducts in the liver are gradually destroyed.2 The damage to bile ducts can inhibit the liver’s ability to rid the body of toxins  and can lead to scarring of liver tissue  known as cirrhosis.1 2 3 Common symptoms of PBC include fatigue and pruritus (itch)  which can be severely debilitating.4 Untreated  PBC can lead to liver failure  or in some cases death.1 It primarily affects women  with nine women diagnosed for every man.3 A significant proportion of people living with PBC do not benefit from existingtherapies.5  6 7“These simultaneous regulatory submission acceptances are another important step in the elafibranor journey. We are pleased to be partnering with Ipsen  who we know has a good understanding of the rare-disease regulatory process ” said Pascal Prigent  Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT. “We know they share the same goal as GENFIT  to bring a new  much needed treatment option to people living with PBC as fast as possible; we look forward to elafibranor’s progress through the regulatory review processes.”ABOUT ELAFIBRANORElafibranor is an oral  once-daily  dual peroxisome activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/delta (α δ) agonist  currently under investigation as a treatment for patients with PBC  a rare cholestatic liver disease. Elafibranor  through activation of PPAR α δ targets multiple cell types and biological processes involved in the pathophysiology of PBC  including cholestasis (impairment of bile flow in the liver)  bile toxicity  inflammation and fibrosis and bile acid output. In 2019  elafibranor was granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) the existing first-line therapy for PBC. Elafibranor has not received approval by regulatory authorities anywhere in the world.ABOUT ELATIVE®ELATIVE is a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial  with an open-label long-term extension (NCT04526665). ELATIVE evaluated the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 80mg once daily versus placebo for the treatment of patients with PBC with an inadequate response or intolerance to UDCA. The trial enrolled 161 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive either elafibranor 80mg once daily or placebo. Patients with an inadequate response to UDCA would continue to receive UDCA in combination with elafibranor or placebo  while patients unable to tolerate UDCA would receive only elafibranor or placebo. Data confirmed the potential for elafibranor to be an effective new treatment option for PBC  with 13 times more patients achieving a biochemical response  suggesting an improvement in disease progression  when treated with elafibranor compared with patients on placebo: 47% placebo-adjusted difference  elafibranor 80mg (51%) compared with placebo (4%) (P<0.001).8Reductions in levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were rapid  seen as early as Week 4 in the elafibranor group  and were sustained through Week 52  with a decrease in ALP of 41% on elafibranor compared with placebo.8 ALP and bilirubin are important predictors of PBC disease progression. ELATIVE also investigated the effect of treatment with elafibranor on pruritus (severe itch)  a significant symptom burden amongst people living with PBC. Findings from the secondary endpoint using the PBC Worst Itch NRS score  showed a reduction in pruritis for elafibranor  which was not statistically significant. Data reported from two separate patient-reported outcome measures demonstrated reductions in moderate to severe pruritus  which favored elafibranor versus placebo.8 Elafibranor was well-tolerated in the trial and has a well-documented safety profile. Adverse events occurring in >10% of patients and more frequently on elafibranor versus placebo included abdominal pain  diarrhea  nausea  and vomiting.8ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs.

In addition  even if the Company’s results  performance  financial condition and liquidity  and the development of the industry in which it operates are consistent with such forward-looking statements  they may not be predictive of results or developments in future periods. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of publication of this document. Other than as required by applicable law  the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information or statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise.IPSEN – FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s latest Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com .GENFIT CONTACTSINVESTORSJean-Christophe Marcoux – Chief Corporate Affairs Officer | Tel: +33 3 2016 4000 | jean-christophe.marcoux@genfit.comMEDIAStephanie Boyer – Press relations | Tel: +333 2016 4000 | stephanie.boyer@genfit.comIPSEN CONTACTSINVESTORSCraig Marks | Tel: +44 (0)7584 349 193 | craig.marks@ipsen.comNicolas Bogler | Tel: +33 6 52 19 98 92 | nicolas.bogler@ipsen.comMEDIAAmy Wolf | Tel: +41 79 576 07 23 | amy.wolf@ipsen.comIoana Piscociu | Tel: +33 6 69 09 12 96 | Ioana.piscociu@ipsen.comAnna Gibbins | Tel: +44 (0)7717 801 900 | anna.gibbins@ipsen.comGENFIT | 885 Avenue Eugène Avinée  59120 Loos - FRANCE | +333 2016 4000 | www.genfit.com1 Younossi ZM  et al. 2019.

KF-SRT aims to enhance control of spatial attention and body-environment awareness through an immersive training process  which is a safe  interactive  and game-like VR environment. The flexibility of the portable VR equipment allows KF-SRT to be implemented in various clinical and home settings.“Since 2018  this partnership has been marked by continuous innovation and has revealed a significant advance in the development of immersive VR technology for the treatment of spatial neglect  a hidden disability among individuals who have sustained stroke and other types of brain injury ” said Dr. Chen. Spatial neglect disrupts basic self-care and daily activities  hindering rehabilitation outcomes and functional recovery.“KF-SRT is grounded in established theories of neurorehabilitation for spatial neglect. By making the treatment game-like  we improve patient engagement and motivation to complete the treatment regimen while receiving rehabilitative benefits ” noted Dr. Chen. “As VR hardware and software become more affordable and accessible  innovative therapy paradigms like KF-SRT will continue leading the way in rehabilitation  facilitating treatment delivery  improving outcomes  and reducing the burdens on individuals  families  and society.”KF-SRT engages the user's visual system through stimuli presented in a head-mounted display while simultaneously engaging their motor system through head and positional tracking and a marker-less hand-tracking device. The Annals of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation published ""Immersive virtual reality treatment for spatial neglect: An agile user-centered development process"" (DOI: 10.1016/j.rehab.2021.101592)  authored by Dr. Chen and Denise Krch  PhD   senior research scientist in the Center for Traumatic Brain Injury Research in which they reported that therapists expressed unanimous satisfaction with the KF-SRT user interface  and patients have reported a preference for the VR experience over conventional therapy.Julio Alvarez  Global Healthcare Strategy Director at Virtualware remarks “For many years  we have been working at the intersection of digital technology and health  developing innovative solutions derived from the latest scientific research and the collective experience of our team. The current project continues to pose an attractive technological challenge for Virtualware  and we are excited to deliver a series of digital interventions that may aid individuals with neuropsychological impairment on their road to recovery”.“In this landmark collaboration with the Kessler Foundation  we at Virtualware are excited to push the boundaries of virtual reality in rehabilitation. Our commitment  through this important deal  is to innovate and expand our VR technologies for the betterment of those suffering from spatial neglect” Unai Extremo  CEO of Virtualware  concluded.Virtualware is a global pioneer in developing Virtual Reality solutions for major industrial  educational  and healthcare conglomerates. Since its founding in 2004  the company has garnered widespread recognition for its accomplishments. In 2021  Virtualware was acknowledged as the world’s most Innovative VR Company. It is based in Bilbao  Spain  and has offices in Hamilton  Ontario  Canada.The company went public on Euronext Access Paris in April 2023  where its stock currently trades at 7.50 euros a share.Kessler Foundation  a major nonprofit organization in the field of disability  is a global leader in rehabilitation research.

The London Stock Exchange  of course  has historically been the most important public market in Europe  if not the world. Now it is facing a crisis of confidence. Company after company is either dropping its London listing or deciding not to list there in the first place. On Wednesday Tui Travel  Europe’s biggest tour operator  said it was considering whether to delist from the London market.It won’t be the last. FTSE 100 mainstay CRH shifted its main listing to New York and left only a secondary listing in the UK this year  while other index members Smurfit Kappa and Flutter Entertainment are both seen as likely to leave sooner rather than later. Smurfit has already made its intentions clear if a merger with US firm WestRock goes through  while Paddy Power-owner Flutter is shifting more and more towards the US too.But it’s not just that the London Stock Exchange is losing members  it is also the ones it’s failing to attract. Arm Holdings  a British chipmaker and national champion  decided earlier this year to go public in New York rather than London despite reportedly fierce lobbying by the British government.READ MOREThe mood music around the London Stock Exchange is now grim. While there are a number of possible reforms mooted to help arrest the decline – combining smaller pension funds so they would be less conservative and invest heavily in equities  for example  or relaxing rules about how much control a company founder can retain in a listing – the London market is facing a deeper problem.A generation ago it would nearly have been unthinkable to drop a London listing. Since Brexit numerous European firms have left and prospered  thus removing a critical barrier to firms departing. The London Stock Exchange is now fighting a trend as much as day-to-day issues for its members.

The Phase 3 IMROZ trial evaluating the investigational use of Sarclisa® (isatuximab) in combination with standard-of-care bortezomib  lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) met its primary endpoint at a planned interim analysis for efficacy  demonstrating statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared with VRd alone in transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). This is also the second Phase 3 trial investigating Sarclisa in newly diagnosed patients to show superiority versus standard of care.Thierry Facon  MDProfessor of Haematology in the Department of Haematology  Lille University Hospital  Lille  France  member of French Academy of Medecine and IMROZ Principal Investigator“The IMROZ trial outcome is promising for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are transplant-ineligible  as there remains a significant unmet need for potential new therapies. First line therapeutic options are critical for all patients  but especially for those who are transplant-ineligible  given attrition rates in subsequent lines of therapy.”The safety and tolerability of Sarclisa observed in this trial was consistent with the established safety profile of Sarclisa and VRd.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDGlobal Head of Development  Sanofi""This is the second Phase 3 trial investigating Sarclisa in newly diagnosed patients to show superiority versus standard of care  reinforcing our belief in Sarclisa as a best-in-class medicine. These data underscore our commitment to advancing scientific innovation for people living with multiple myeloma  and we look forward to sharing more detail on Sarclisa’s potential to improve outcomes for patients receiving earlier lines of therapy.”Study results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting and form the basis of a future regulatory submission.About the IMROZ trialThe randomized  multi-center  open label Phase 3 IMROZ clinical trial enrolled 484 patients with newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible MM across 104 centers spanning 21 countries. During the trial  Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg once weekly for five weeks during first 42-day cycle and once every two weeks in cycles 2 to 4 in combination with subcutaneous bortezomib  oral lenalidomide and intravenous or oral dexamethasone. Then Sarclisa was administered every 2 weeks from cycle 5 to 17 and every 4 weeks in cycles 18+ during 28-day cycles in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone at the standard dose  until disease progression  unacceptable safety profile or patient’s decision to stop the study treatment. The primary endpoint of IMROZ is progression-free survival. Key secondary endpoints include complete response rate  minimal residual disease negativity rate for patients with a complete response  very good partial response or better rate  overall survival. Other secondary endpoints are: overall response rate  time to progression  duration of response  time to first response  time to best response  progression-free survival on next line of therapy  progression-free survival by MRD status  sustained MRD negativity greater than or equal to 12 months rate  safety  pharmacokinetic profile  immunogenicity  disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life  disease and treatment-related symptoms  health state utility  and health status.1The use of Sarclisa in combination with VRd in transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed MM is investigational and has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About SarclisaSarclisa is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on multiple myeloma (MM) cells  inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells  making it a potential target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa.Based on the Phase 3 ICARIA-MM study  Sarclisa is approved in >50 countries  including the U.S. and EU  in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory MM (RRMM) who have received ≥2 prior therapies  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and who progressed on last therapy. Based on the Phase 3 IKEMA study  Sarclisa is also approved in 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone  including in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with RRMM who have received 1–3 prior lines of therapy and in the European Union for patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. In the U.S.  the generic name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc  with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Sarclisa continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with current standard treatments across the MM treatment continuum. It is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indication.For more information on Sarclisa clinical trials  please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.About multiple myelomaMM is the second most common hematologic malignancy.2 Since MM does not have a cure  most patients will relapse. Relapsed MM is the term for when the cancer returns after treatment or a period of remission. Refractory MM refers to when the cancer does not respond or no longer responds to therapy.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

After his graduation  Prof. Anguille joined the research group of Prof. Zwi Berneman at the same institution as a PhD student (supported by a 4-year FWO “aspirant” mandate and a 1-year “Emmanuel Van der Schueren” fellowship of the Flemish League against Cancer to finish his PhD). His PhD thesis  which revolved around cellular immunotherapy and more specifically around the development of an optimized dendritic cell vaccine for acute myeloid leukemia  resulted in several high-visibility publications in renowned journals  including Blood  Leukemia  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  and Lancet Oncology. In 2012-2013  Prof. Anguille spent a 6-month research visit to the Dendritic Cell Biology & Therapeutics group of the ANZAC Research Institute in Sydney  Australia  headed by the late Prof. Derek Hart. This research stay abroad was supported by a FWO travel grant (V444212N) and by a highly prestigious Endeavour Research Award granted by the Australian Government.In 2013  Prof. Anguille started his training as a medical specialist in Internal Medicine  which he completed in 2016. He qualified as Clinical Hematologist in 2017. Prof. Anguille works as full-time staff member in the Division of Hematology of the Antwerp University Hospital since 2016. Since January 1st  he succeeded Prof. Zwi Berneman as Head of the Division of Hematology of the Antwerp University Hospital and as Head of the Laboratory of Experimental Hematology (LEH) of the Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences of the University of Antwerp.In addition to his clinical activities  Prof. Anguille’s main research focus continues to be on cellular immunotherapies for hematological diseases  including cell-based cancer vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies (T-cell receptor [TCR]- and chimeric antigen receptor [CAR]-engineered T cells). His research activities involve both basic research (he is currently promotor or co-promotor of 8 PhD students at LEH) as well as translational/clinical research. Within this context  Prof. Anguille serves as principal investigator (mainly in the field of cellular immunotherapy) of several clinical trials running at the Division of Hematology of the Antwerp University Hospital  including two large  multicentric academic cell therapy trials in hematological diseases for which he obtained funding from the Belgian National Cancer Plan Action 29 (€1 500 000 €) and from Kom op Tegen Kanker (€761 780). Prof. Anguille is co-chairing an FWO-TBM project (awarded in 2020 for a total amount of 1 305 429 €) together with Prof. Stroobants from the Molecular Imaging Center Antwerp (MICA) of the University of Antwerp. Since 2021  he is also promotor of an FWO Research Project entitled “BCMA immunoPET to predict and monitor treatment response to CAR-based cellular therapies in multiple myeloma” (€462 504).

But it has said it will look at the potential of later moving its primary listing from London to the United States. However  its shares will continue to be traded in London following the debut on the US market.Paddy Power made its stock exchange debut in Dublin in 2000. Since then  the wider group has grown to become the world’s biggest online gambling group.It has operations in countries including the UK  Australia  India  Serbia and Georgia. It also owns Betfair as well as FanDuel in the United States and in 2019 agreed to buy the Stars Group  catapulting Flutter into the gambling stratosphere.It's long way from the humble beginnings of Paddy Power  which started life in 1988 with the merger of 40 outlets that were owned by David Power  Stewart Kenny and John Corcoran.Flutter  whose chief executive is Peter Jackson  has been working towards a New York listing in order to gain exposure to US investors.Mr Jackson previously pointed out that potential investors in the US like to see companies reporting under US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Practices).“They also like to see companies listed on their domestic exchanges ” he said in August. “It gives people a lot more comfort in their ability to invest.”Mr Jackson said that a lack of stamp duty on share trades in the US  and high levels of equity liquidity are also helpful for investors.“There are lots of technical reasons like that (why) a US listing is exciting to us ” he added.“We also think it helps grow our profile in the US and enables us to attract and retain talent and have a local equity that we can use for doing deals  whether that’s with media companies  influencers.”Flutter believes that it is appropriate to maintain just two listings to minimise regulatory complexities and has notified Euronext Dublin of its intention to cancel its secondary listing on Euronext Dublin with effect from 8.00am on Monday  29 January 2024 ” the company said on Friday.“The last day of trading of Flutter's ordinary shares on Euronext Dublin will be Tuesday 23 January 2024  with trading suspended from close of business on that day to allow for the settlement of pending trades and repositioning instructions  in advance of effectiveness of the US listing ” it added.Flutter will release a trading update for the three months to the end of December and for the whole of 2023 on January 18.,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.5,0.36,0.14,True,English,"['Paddy Power owner Flutter', 'New York debut', 'Dublin delisting', 'dates', 'biggest online gambling group', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Michael M Santiago', 'stock exchange debut', 'Dublin stock exchange', 'New York listing', 'primary share listing', 'primary listing', 'gambling firm', 'wider group', 'Stars Group', 'gambling stratosphere', 'secondary listing', 'Getty Images', 'Paddy Power', 'United States', 'humble beginnings', 'David Power', 'Stewart Kenny', 'John Corcoran', 'chief executive', 'Peter Jackson', 'Mr Jackson', 'Accounting Practices', 'domestic exchanges', 'stamp duty', 'share trades', 'high levels', 'equity liquidity', 'technical reasons', 'local equity', 'two listings', 'regulatory complexities', 'pending trades', 'three months', 'US listing', 'last day', 'US market', 'US GAAP', 'Euronext Dublin', 'media companies', 'US investors', 'trading update', 'potential investors', 'ordinary shares', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'January', 'Photo', 'era', 'parent', 'delists', 'Friday', 'flagged', 'move', 'completion', 'application', 'London', 'world', 'countries', 'UK', 'Australia', 'India', 'Serbia', 'Georgia', 'Betfair', 'FanDuel', 'life', 'merger', '40 outlets', 'order', 'exposure', 'August', 'people', 'comfort', 'ability', 'lack', 'lots', 'profile', 'talent', 'deals', 'influencers', 'intention', 'effect', '8.00am', 'Monday', 'company', 'Tuesday', 'close', 'business', 'settlement', 'repositioning', 'instructions', 'advance', 'December']",2023-12-08,2023-12-08,independent.ie
