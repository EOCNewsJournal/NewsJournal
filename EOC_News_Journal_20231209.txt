Further milestones are expected upon US and European launches which could now happen in 2Q24 in the US (FDA PDUFA 1 action date: June 10  2024) and 2H24 in Europe. These milestones total approximately 89M€. Launches in the US and Europe will also make GENFIT eligible for royalty payments. Revenues will fund the development of GENFIT’s pipeline  now mainly focused on Acute On-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) with 5 differentiated assets.Lille (France)  Cambridge (Massachusetts  United States)  Zurich (Switzerland)  December 8  2023 – GENFIT (Nasdaq and Euronext: GNFT)  a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases  today announces its revised outlook for 2024 and reflects on recent progress.Elafibranor in PBCIpsen has made significant progress since the announcement of positive interim data of ELATIVE® pivotal Phase 3 trial in June 2023:Strong leadership presence at AASLD The Liver Meeting® and additional results from ELATIVE® presented as late breaker  including data showing statistically significant improvement (nominal p-value < 0.05) on multidimensional measures of pruritus (PBC-40 and 5D-itch scores)Publication of ELATIVE® Phase 3 data in the New England Journal of MedicineRegulatory filing acceptance obtained in the US  Europe and United Kingdom2 in less than 6 months after topline Phase 3 data  and Priority Review granted for NDA by the US FDA with PDUFA target action date on June 10  2024During its Capital Market Day on December 7  Ipsen reiterated its confidence in elafibranor as its profile could be very beneficial for patients suffering from PBC. In the ELATIVE® Phase 3 trial  significant treatment benefit in the primary composite endpoint was achieved with elafibranor  with a high responder rate  and a low placebo effect3. The key secondary endpoint on ALP normalization was achieved – despite a high baseline ALP level – with high statistical significance  the pruritus improvements on PBC-40 and 5D-itch scores were also statistically significant4 and elafibranor was generally well-tolerated with a well-documented safety profile consistent with previous trials.Acceptance of filings in the US and Europe have triggered the first milestone payment for GENFIT. We also expect additional milestones after US and European launches and as a result should receive a total of approximately 89M€ by the end of next year. Ipsen also indicated that they were expecting global peak sales to exceed 500M€ for elafibranor in PBC. With eligibility for tiered double-digit royalties under the agreement with Ipsen  this could mean a very significant revenue stream for GENFIT based on these royalties and additional milestone payments.Ipsen also indicated that it is developing elafibranor in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) which could lead to further revenues for GENFIT under the licensing agreement.Pascal Prigent  CEO of GENFIT  commented: “We continue to be pleased by Ipsen’s commitment and results already obtained. We believe that their excellent and proven launch capabilities will allow them  once approved  to quickly bring elafibranor to the many patients that need it. I have no doubt that they will maximize the potential of elafibranor  and this will obviously be very beneficial for GENFIT as it will help us accelerate the development of our deep and promising pipeline.”Pipeline outlook for 2024GENFIT’s R&D efforts have pivoted from chronic to acute liver diseases  with a strong focus on ACLF where the unmet medical need is very important  with currently no approved therapies. Our therapeutic candidates have been strategically selected based on the pathophysiology of ACLF to address the most relevant pathways via differentiated and complementary modes of action.In 2024  progress is expected to be made on all programs of the ACLF franchise:VS-01 (liposomal-based technology designed to remove ammonia and other ACLF toxins from the blood): Phase 2 initiated with interim data readout targeted for mid-2024NTZ (anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial agent aiming to reduce systemic inflammation  and impede release of PAMPs 5 and bacterial translocation): reformulation and Phase 2 under preparation in 2024 with a proof-of-concept study initiation targeted for 1H25and bacterial translocation): reformulation and Phase 2 under preparation in 2024 with a proof-of-concept study initiation targeted for 1H25 SRT-015 (ASK1 inhibitor  liver-centric  aimed at inhibiting cell death  inflammation and fibrosis): first-in-Human study initiation targeted 2H24CLM-022 (NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor aimed at inhibiting systemic inflammation and cell death): preclinical Proof of Concept expected to initiate in 2024VS-02-HE (small molecule aiming at reducing hyperammonemia  stabilizing blood ammonia and preventing hepatic encephalopathy): IND enabling studies starting in 2024 with completion expected in 2025GENFIT also develops assets in other rare and life-threatening liver diseases with high unmet medical needs:GNS561 for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA): Phase 1b interim biomarker data targeted as early as 1H24VS-01 for Urea Cycle Disorders (UCDs) and Organic Acidemias (OA): IND enabling non clinical studies completion expected in 2024ABOUT ELAFIBRANORElafibranor is an oral  once-daily  dual peroxisome activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/delta (α δ) agonist  currently under investigation as a treatment for patients with PBC  a rare cholestatic liver disease. Elafibranor  through activation of PPAR α δ targets multiple cell types and biological processes involved in the pathophysiology of PBC  including cholestasis (impairment of bile flow in the liver)  bile toxicity  inflammation and fibrosis and bile acid output. In 2019  elafibranor was granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) the existing first-line therapy for PBC. Elafibranor has not received approval by regulatory authorities anywhere in the world.ABOUT ELATIVE®ELATIVE is a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial  with an open-label long-term extension (NCT04526665). ELATIVE evaluated the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 80mg once daily versus placebo for the treatment of patients with PBC with an inadequate response or intolerance to UDCA. The trial enrolled 161 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive either elafibranor 80mg once daily or placebo. Patients with an inadequate response to UDCA would continue to receive UDCA in combination with elafibranor or placebo  while patients unable to tolerate UDCA would receive only elafibranor or placebo. Data confirmed the potential for elafibranor to be an effective new treatment option for PBC  with 13 times more patients achieving a biochemical response  suggesting an improvement in disease progression  when treated with elafibranor compared with patients on placebo: 47% placebo-adjusted difference  elafibranor 80mg (51%) compared with placebo (4%) (P<0.001).ABOUT ACLFACLF presents as a syndrome defined by a combination of hepatic and extrahepatic organ dysfunctions and failures and a uniformly poor prognosis. In patients with liver cirrhosis and acute hepatic decompensation  ACLF can be triggered by a precipitating event (e.g.  an infection) that leads to a progressive functional deterioration of multiple organs with high short-term mortality (23% to 74% mortality at 28 days)6.ACLF represents a significant cost of care for healthcare systems  as it is characterized by an abrupt life-threatening worsening of a preexisting advanced chronic liver disease resulting in acute liver decompensation  liver failure and extrahepatic organ failure. With a $52k average cost per hospitalization per patient in the US and a 16-day average length of hospital stay  estimated annual cost burden in the US was $6.4bn in 2021  a nearly 4-fold increase since 20117.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs. GENFIT is a pioneer in liver disease research and development with a rich history and strong scientific heritage spanning more than two decades. Today  GENFIT has a growing and diversified pipeline with programs at various development stages. The Company’s area of focus is Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF). Its ACLF franchise consists of five assets in development: VS-01  NTZ  SRT-015  CLM-022 and VS-02-HE. These are all based on differentiated mechanisms of action leveraging complementary pathways. Other assets target other life-threatening disease indications such as cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and Urea Cycle Disorders (UCD)/Organic Acidemias (OA). GENFIT’s track record in bringing early-stage assets with high potential to late development and pre-commercialization stages is highlighted in the successful 52-week Phase 3 ELATIVE® trial evaluating elafibranor in PBC. Beyond therapeutics  GENFIT’s pipeline also includes a diagnostic franchise focused on Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) previously known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and ammonia. GENFIT has facilities in Lille and Paris (France)  Zurich (Switzerland) and Cambridge  MA (USA).

The company will trade under the ticker symbol 'FLUT' while maintaining its premium listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) with its existing ticker 'FLTR'. As part of the   Flutter's London listing remains unaffected by this expansion.The strategic move to list on the NYSE comes as Flutter anticipates significant revenue contributions from its US operations  including its sports betting platform FanDuel. This decision aligns with the company's focus on expanding its presence in the rapidly growing US betting market.In preparation for this transition  Flutter will be issuing a trading update on January 18. Following this  January 23 will mark the last trading day for Flutter's shares on Euronext Dublin before their suspension and eventual delisting. The delisting from Euronext Dublin precedes the company's removal from the Eurostoxx index by December 18  as part of a regulatory simplification process.Additionally  Flutter Entertainment is set to report its full-year results under US GAAP standards on March 26. This reporting change reflects the company's increasing orientation towards its American investor base and operations.The expansion into the NYSE does not come without its challenges; Flutter had previously attempted to leverage assets from its acquisition of Milan-based Sisal  which it bought for £1.62 billion from CVC Capital Partners. Sisal brought betting shops and regulated lotteries into Flutter's portfolio. Despite these assets  Flutter was unsuccessful in its bid to replace Camelot as the operator of the UK national lottery  losing out to Allwyn  a company owned by Czech billionaire Karel Komárek.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Robertet will create a synergy between …,French firm Robertet S.A.  one of the leading natural fragrance and flavours companies in the world  plans to invest between €2 million and €10 million over the next 10 years  its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jerome Bruhat has said.In an online interaction with businessline soon after announcing the acquisition of Bengaluru-based family-owned firm  Sonarome  a leading flavour company in India  he said: “It (the acquisition) is the starting point of a much bigger operation and we want to invest quite massively in India in the years to come because we believe in this market.”‘All cash deal’Sonarme  which specialises in the manufacture of flavours and fragrances  has been acquired through an “all cash deal”  he said  without divulging details of taking over the Bengaluru firm that employs over 100 in Karnataka’s capital.The turnover of the company  renowned for its research and development strategy  its in-depth knowledge of local trends and long-standing relationships with leaders of the sector  was €15 million in 2022. “It is a very decent turnover… It is a complementary acquisition since we had no presence in the flavours sector in India ” Bruhat said.The acquisition is a family-to-family agreement as both companies are family-owned. “India is a major market for our industry in fragrance and flavours. We have had  in the past  a successful track record on fragrances in India… ” said the CEO of Robertet  founded in Grasse in France in 1850.Consolidating footprintIn a statement issued on the acquisition  the French firm  listed on Euronext Paris  said the strategic acquisition is Robertet’s sixth external growth operation in five years. “With this takeover  we are consolidating our footprint in South-East Asia  while expanding our industrial capabilities to better serve our customers in the region ” it said.Bruhat said: “With our unique positioning in natural products  new local industrial capacity and enhanced expertise in flavours  we have all the assets to become a major player in this specific market.”Robertet  which has been present in India for the past two decades  is trying to make its business presence in India and wants to offer Indian customers “not only fragrances but also flavours”  he said.The Grasse-based firm will try to create a synergy between Robertet and Sonarome  which has the expertise to cater to local customers and a good understanding of domestic consumers  Bruhat said.“They (Sonarome) have been able to build a fantastic factory in Bangalore  which can create and serve any kind of flavours. Robertet’s USP is that it is the global number one for natural  which has been the heart of the company for over 173 years ” he said. The Bengaluru firm exports to a few firms in Africa and South Asia.Huge appetite for naturalsThe French firm sources natural ingredients from farmers  and transforms them into ingredients that are sold or included in fragrance and flavours for customers. “We have the broadest range  and  probably  the best naturals in the world ” the company’s CEO said.Bruhat said Robertet is witnessing a huge appetite for brands with natural flavours. “The world of flavours used to be chemical  but it’s changing rapidly. Ten years ago  even in Europe or the US clients sought 80 per cent synthetics and 20 per cent naturals. Today is the opposite ” he said.The French firm can muster the full value chain from the farmer to the end products sold to customers.

Acceptance triggers a fi…,Official GENFIT press releaseUS Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Priority Review for New Drug Application (NDA) for elafibranor in PBC  and European Medicine Agency (EMA) has also validated the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for elafibranor.Acceptance triggers a first milestone payment. Further milestones are expected upon US and European launches which could now happen in 2Q24 in the US (FDA PDUFA 1 action date: June 10  2024) and 2H24 in Europe. These milestones total approximately 89M€. Launches in the US and Europe will also make GENFIT eligible for royalty payments. Revenues will fund the development of GENFIT’s pipeline  now mainly focused on Acute On-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) with 5 differentiated assets.Lille (France)  Cambridge (Massachusetts  United States)  Zurich (Switzerland)  December 8  2023 – GENFIT (Nasdaq and Euronext: GNFT)  a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases  today announces its revised outlook for 2024 and reflects on recent progress.Elafibranor in PBCIpsen has made significant progress since the announcement of positive interim data of ELATIVE® pivotal Phase 3 trial in June 2023:Strong leadership presence at AASLD The Liver Meeting® and additional results from ELATIVE® presented as late breaker  including data showing statistically significant improvement (nominal p-value < 0.05) on multidimensional measures of pruritus (PBC-40 and 5D-itch scores)Publication of ELATIVE® Phase 3 data in the New England Journal of MedicineRegulatory filing acceptance obtained in the US  Europe and United Kingdom2 in less than 6 months after topline Phase 3 data  and Priority Review granted for NDA by the US FDA with PDUFA target action date on June 10  2024During its Capital Market Day on December 7  Ipsen reiterated its confidence in elafibranor as its profile could be very beneficial for patients suffering from PBC. In the ELATIVE® Phase 3 trial  significant treatment benefit in the primary composite endpoint was achieved with elafibranor  with a high responder rate  and a low placebo effect3. The key secondary endpoint on ALP normalization was achieved – despite a high baseline ALP level – with high statistical significance  the pruritus improvements on PBC-40 and 5D-itch scores were also statistically significant4 and elafibranor was generally well-tolerated with a well-documented safety profile consistent with previous trials.Acceptance of filings in the US and Europe have triggered the first milestone payment for GENFIT. We also expect additional milestones after US and European launches and as a result should receive a total of approximately 89M€ by the end of next year. Ipsen also indicated that they were expecting global peak sales to exceed 500M€ for elafibranor in PBC. With eligibility for tiered double-digit royalties under the agreement with Ipsen  this could mean a very significant revenue stream for GENFIT based on these royalties and additional milestone payments.Ipsen also indicated that it is developing elafibranor in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) which could lead to further revenues for GENFIT under the licensing agreement.Pascal Prigent  CEO of GENFIT  commented: “We continue to be pleased by Ipsen’s commitment and results already obtained. We believe that their excellent and proven launch capabilities will allow them  once approved  to quickly bring elafibranor to the many patients that need it. I have no doubt that they will maximize the potential of elafibranor  and this will obviously be very beneficial for GENFIT as it will help us accelerate the development of our deep and promising pipeline.”Pipeline outlook for 2024GENFIT’s R&D efforts have pivoted from chronic to acute liver diseases  with a strong focus on ACLF where the unmet medical need is very important  with currently no approved therapies. Our therapeutic candidates have been strategically selected based on the pathophysiology of ACLF to address the most relevant pathways via differentiated and complementary modes of action.In 2024  progress is expected to be made on all programs of the ACLF franchise:VS-01 (liposomal-based technology designed to remove ammonia and other ACLF toxins from the blood): Phase 2 initiated with interim data readout targeted for mid-2024NTZ (anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial agent aiming to reduce systemic inflammation  and impede release of PAMPs 5 and bacterial translocation): reformulation and Phase 2 under preparation in 2024 with a proof-of-concept study initiation targeted for 1H25and bacterial translocation): reformulation and Phase 2 under preparation in 2024 with a proof-of-concept study initiation targeted for 1H25 SRT-015 (ASK1 inhibitor  liver-centric  aimed at inhibiting cell death  inflammation and fibrosis): first-in-Human study initiation targeted 2H24CLM-022 (NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor aimed at inhibiting systemic inflammation and cell death): preclinical Proof of Concept expected to initiate in 2024VS-02-HE (small molecule aiming at reducing hyperammonemia  stabilizing blood ammonia and preventing hepatic encephalopathy): IND enabling studies starting in 2024 with completion expected in 2025GENFIT also develops assets in other rare and life-threatening liver diseases with high unmet medical needs:GNS561 for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA): Phase 1b interim biomarker data targeted as early as 1H24VS-01 for Urea Cycle Disorders (UCDs) and Organic Acidemias (OA): IND enabling non clinical studies completion expected in 2024ABOUT ELAFIBRANORElafibranor is an oral  once-daily  dual peroxisome activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/delta (α δ) agonist  currently under investigation as a treatment for patients with PBC  a rare cholestatic liver disease. Elafibranor  through activation of PPAR α δ targets multiple cell types and biological processes involved in the pathophysiology of PBC  including cholestasis (impairment of bile flow in the liver)  bile toxicity  inflammation and fibrosis and bile acid output. In 2019  elafibranor was granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) the existing first-line therapy for PBC. Elafibranor has not received approval by regulatory authorities anywhere in the world.ABOUT ELATIVE®ELATIVE is a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial  with an open-label long-term extension (NCT04526665). ELATIVE evaluated the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 80mg once daily versus placebo for the treatment of patients with PBC with an inadequate response or intolerance to UDCA. The trial enrolled 161 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive either elafibranor 80mg once daily or placebo. Patients with an inadequate response to UDCA would continue to receive UDCA in combination with elafibranor or placebo  while patients unable to tolerate UDCA would receive only elafibranor or placebo. Data confirmed the potential for elafibranor to be an effective new treatment option for PBC  with 13 times more patients achieving a biochemical response  suggesting an improvement in disease progression  when treated with elafibranor compared with patients on placebo: 47% placebo-adjusted difference  elafibranor 80mg (51%) compared with placebo (4%) (P<0.001).ABOUT ACLFACLF presents as a syndrome defined by a combination of hepatic and extrahepatic organ dysfunctions and failures and a uniformly poor prognosis. In patients with liver cirrhosis and acute hepatic decompensation  ACLF can be triggered by a precipitating event (e.g.  an infection) that leads to a progressive functional deterioration of multiple organs with high short-term mortality (23% to 74% mortality at 28 days)6.ACLF represents a significant cost of care for healthcare systems  as it is characterized by an abrupt life-threatening worsening of a preexisting advanced chronic liver disease resulting in acute liver decompensation  liver failure and extrahepatic organ failure. With a $52k average cost per hospitalization per patient in the US and a 16-day average length of hospital stay  estimated annual cost burden in the US was $6.4bn in 2021  a nearly 4-fold increase since 20117.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs.

But it has said it will look at the potential of later moving its primary listing from London to the United States. However  its shares will continue to be traded in London following the debut on the US market.Paddy Power made its stock exchange debut in Dublin in 2000. Since then  the wider group has grown to become the world’s biggest online gambling group.It has operations in countries including the UK  Australia  India  Serbia and Georgia. It also owns Betfair as well as FanDuel in the United States and in 2019 agreed to buy the Stars Group  catapulting Flutter into the gambling stratosphere.It's long way from the humble beginnings of Paddy Power  which started life in 1988 with the merger of 40 outlets that were owned by David Power  Stewart Kenny and John Corcoran.Flutter  whose chief executive is Peter Jackson  has been working towards a New York listing in order to gain exposure to US investors.Mr Jackson previously pointed out that potential investors in the US like to see companies reporting under US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Practices).“They also like to see companies listed on their domestic exchanges ” he said in August. “It gives people a lot more comfort in their ability to invest.”Mr Jackson said that a lack of stamp duty on share trades in the US  and high levels of equity liquidity are also helpful for investors.“There are lots of technical reasons like that (why) a US listing is exciting to us ” he added.“We also think it helps grow our profile in the US and enables us to attract and retain talent and have a local equity that we can use for doing deals  whether that’s with media companies  influencers.”Flutter believes that it is appropriate to maintain just two listings to minimise regulatory complexities and has notified Euronext Dublin of its intention to cancel its secondary listing on Euronext Dublin with effect from 8.00am on Monday  29 January 2024 ” the company said on Friday.“The last day of trading of Flutter's ordinary shares on Euronext Dublin will be Tuesday 23 January 2024  with trading suspended from close of business on that day to allow for the settlement of pending trades and repositioning instructions  in advance of effectiveness of the US listing ” it added.Flutter will release a trading update for the three months to the end of December and for the whole of 2023 on January 18.,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.5,0.36,0.14,True,English,"['Paddy Power owner Flutter', 'New York debut', 'Dublin delisting', 'dates', 'biggest online gambling group', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Michael M Santiago', 'stock exchange debut', 'Dublin stock exchange', 'New York listing', 'primary share listing', 'primary listing', 'gambling firm', 'wider group', 'Stars Group', 'gambling stratosphere', 'secondary listing', 'Getty Images', 'Paddy Power', 'United States', 'humble beginnings', 'David Power', 'Stewart Kenny', 'John Corcoran', 'chief executive', 'Peter Jackson', 'Mr Jackson', 'Accounting Practices', 'domestic exchanges', 'stamp duty', 'share trades', 'high levels', 'equity liquidity', 'technical reasons', 'local equity', 'two listings', 'regulatory complexities', 'pending trades', 'three months', 'US listing', 'last day', 'US market', 'US GAAP', 'Euronext Dublin', 'media companies', 'US investors', 'trading update', 'potential investors', 'ordinary shares', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'January', 'Photo', 'era', 'parent', 'delists', 'Friday', 'flagged', 'move', 'completion', 'application', 'London', 'world', 'countries', 'UK', 'Australia', 'India', 'Serbia', 'Georgia', 'Betfair', 'FanDuel', 'life', 'merger', '40 outlets', 'order', 'exposure', 'August', 'people', 'comfort', 'ability', 'lack', 'lots', 'profile', 'talent', 'deals', 'influencers', 'intention', 'effect', '8.00am', 'Monday', 'company', 'Tuesday', 'close', 'business', 'settlement', 'repositioning', 'instructions', 'advance', 'December']",2023-12-08,2023-12-09,independent.ie

Ltd.  as part of the SPRIM Global Investments group (SGI)  is named as the lender.Biosenic signs term sheet with TrialCap Pte. Ltd. for up to USD 8 million debt financing and USD 800 000 equity investment as a first decisive  financing step towards a Phase 3 clinical trial for its ground-breaking auto-immune medication  a first-in-class drug oral arsenic salt.Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  December 8  2023  7.00 am CEST – BIOSENIC (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BIOS)  the clinical-stage company specializing in serious autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and cell therapy  and its subsidiary Medsenic SAS  today announces that it has signed a term sheet with Singapore based TrialCap Pte. Ltd. (the ""Term Sheet"") and/or other lenders (the ""Lender"") for a proposed debt and equity financing. BioSenic is seeking the funds to continue its clinical development  backed by previous highly promising Phase 2 and pre-clinical results of arsenic trioxide (ATO). Previous results show that ATO is a very valuable medication for correcting dysregulations of the immune system.In accordance with the Term Sheet  the Lender will provide two term loan facilities of each up to USD 4 000 000. The facilities will be structured as a loan note facility agreement  with each loan to be advanced in cash directly to the relevant trial service provided or to BioSenic for relevant expenditures under the Phase 3 clinical study with oral arsenic trioxide (OATO) in first-line treatment of chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (cGvHD). The loan facilities will allow BioSenic to finance between 25% and 37% of the trial expenses eligible for an R&D tax credit in France and Australia  respectively. The loan facilities have a maturity date of 7 years from the first utilization date  an interest rate of SOFR plus 9.5% per annum and an upfront fee of an amount equal to 1.0% of the facility amount  payable on each drawdown.In addition  under the Term Sheet  the Lender intends to make an equity investment of USD 800 000 in new shares of BioSenic. BioSenic will also issue warrants equal to 20% of the total amounts drawn under the loan facilities. These warrants become exercisable when 20% of the two loan facilities have been drawn and the exercise price is equal to the subscription price of the equity investment.Completion of the transactions set out in the Term Sheet is subject to the following conditions: (i) the satisfactory completion of due diligence by the Lender  (ii) the signing of the definitive agreements for the debt and equity financing  (iii) the signing with a Clinical Research Organization (CRO) and (iv) an equity raise by BioSenic of an amount to be further determined. BioSenic expects such conditions to be satisfied in Q1 2024.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic said: ""We are very pleased to announce that we have found ways to set up a decisive financing for our lead project  an international Phase 3 clinical trial in chronic Graft versus Host disease  to confirm the remarkable therapeutic effects of our medication ArsciCor  soon available for clinical trials as an oral medication. This is a major step forward in harnessing the unique therapeutic properties of arsenic trioxide to correct immune dysregulation as seen in various autoimmune diseases. The success of the present project should lead BioSenic to progress other important therapeutic approaches related to abnormalities of the immune system  with chronic detrimental characteristics affecting the innate  trained and/or adaptative system  in chronic  serious diseases  and with unmet medical needs. The involvement of TrialCap Pte. Ltd. is greatly appreciated by the all BioSenic team  for the benefit of the patients.”About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in immune and autoimmune diseases. Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning and key strengths to develop  separately and in combination  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platforms1) The ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). BioSenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol.2) ALLOB  an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. After phase 2 clinical results with contradictory conclusions  BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (between early or late treatment).The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.About TrialCap Pte.

Founded on July 9  1916 in Buenos Aires  it is the first Confederation in the world  established almost 40 years before the next ones to be formed. CONMEBOL originated from a tournament between countries of the South American continent. The first Copa América was held in 1916 in Buenos Aires in celebration of the hundred years of Argentina's independence. This was the beginning of the institution  originally composed of the associations of Argentina  Brazil  Chile and Uruguay. Later on  the other South American associations joined CONMEBOL: Paraguay (1921)  Peru (1925)  Bolivia (1926)  Ecuador (1927)  Colombia (1936) and Venezuela (1953). It is the only soccer confederation in which all its associations are also members of FIFA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Its ten member National Associations are the pride of CONMEBOL.About CONMEBOL Copa América 2024™The CONMEBOL Copa América 2024™ will be played in the United States and includes 10 CONMEBOL teams and 6 guest teams from Concacaf.

Ltd.  as part of the SPRIM Global Investments group (SGI)  is named as the lender.Biosenic signs term sheet with TrialCap Pte. Ltd. for up to USD 8 million debt financing and USD 800 000 equity investment as a first decisive  financing step towards a Phase 3 clinical trial for its ground-breaking auto-immune medication  a first-in-class drug oral arsenic salt.Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  December 8  2023  7.00 am CEST – BIOSENIC (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BIOS)  the clinical-stage company specializing in serious autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and cell therapy  and its subsidiary Medsenic SAS  today announces that it has signed a term sheet with Singapore based TrialCap Pte. Ltd. (the ""Term Sheet"") and/or other lenders (the ""Lender"") for a proposed debt and equity financing. BioSenic is seeking the funds to continue its clinical development  backed by previous highly promising Phase 2 and pre-clinical results of arsenic trioxide (ATO). Previous results show that ATO is a very valuable medication for correcting dysregulations of the immune system.In accordance with the Term Sheet  the Lender will provide two term loan facilities of each up to USD 4 000 000. The facilities will be structured as a loan note facility agreement  with each loan to be advanced in cash directly to the relevant trial service provided or to BioSenic for relevant expenditures under the Phase 3 clinical study with oral arsenic trioxide (OATO) in first-line treatment of chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (cGvHD). The loan facilities will allow BioSenic to finance between 25% and 37% of the trial expenses eligible for an R&D tax credit in France and Australia  respectively. The loan facilities have a maturity date of 7 years from the first utilization date  an interest rate of SOFR plus 9.5% per annum and an upfront fee of an amount equal to 1.0% of the facility amount  payable on each drawdown.In addition  under the Term Sheet  the Lender intends to make an equity investment of USD 800 000 in new shares of BioSenic. BioSenic will also issue warrants equal to 20% of the total amounts drawn under the loan facilities. These warrants become exercisable when 20% of the two loan facilities have been drawn and the exercise price is equal to the subscription price of the equity investment.Completion of the transactions set out in the Term Sheet is subject to the following conditions: (i) the satisfactory completion of due diligence by the Lender  (ii) the signing of the definitive agreements for the debt and equity financing  (iii) the signing with a Clinical Research Organization (CRO) and (iv) an equity raise by BioSenic of an amount to be further determined. BioSenic expects such conditions to be satisfied in Q1 2024.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic said: ""We are very pleased to announce that we have found ways to set up a decisive financing for our lead project  an international Phase 3 clinical trial in chronic Graft versus Host disease  to confirm the remarkable therapeutic effects of our medication ArsciCor  soon available for clinical trials as an oral medication. This is a major step forward in harnessing the unique therapeutic properties of arsenic trioxide to correct immune dysregulation as seen in various autoimmune diseases. The success of the present project should lead BioSenic to progress other important therapeutic approaches related to abnormalities of the immune system  with chronic detrimental characteristics affecting the innate  trained and/or adaptative system  in chronic  serious diseases  and with unmet medical needs. The involvement of TrialCap Pte. Ltd. is greatly appreciated by the all BioSenic team  for the benefit of the patients.”About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in immune and autoimmune diseases. Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning and key strengths to develop  separately and in combination  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platforms1) The ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). BioSenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The Company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol.2) ALLOB  an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. After phase 2 clinical results with contradictory conclusions  BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (between early or late treatment).The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.About TrialCapPte.

BG FUND November 2023 HIGHLIGHTS Equity markets in Europe and the US rallied strongly in November with indices almost back to their July highs. The EuroStoxx 50® Total Return and the S&P500® Total Return were up +8.04% and +9.13% respectively with the risk-on sentiment driven by growing expectation of future rate cuts as inflation abates and economic growth numbers remain encouraging. The market implied volatility measure VStoxx® decreased markedly from 19.7% to 13.8% while the iTraxx Crossover® (S39) tightened across the month from 450bps to 374bps reflecting the increased risk appetite from markets. Against this market backdrop  BG Fund was up +399bps (USD A shares) during the month with positive idiosyncratic outcomes from a variety of positions across convertibles and event-driven situations in both equity and credit. November 2023 COMMENTARY Volatility strategies Mandatory convertible bond arbitrage Mandatory convertible bonds contributed +11bps this month  driven by our position in Siemens Energy mandatory. Convertible bond arbitrage Convertible bond strategies contributed a solid +53bps to the performance in November. A significant contribution  as we had expected  came from Clariane who announced specific actions to strengthen their balance sheet with a capital increase and an asset disposal program  while a number of other oversold positions rebounded from their lows of the previous month. This is a strong outcome in a month where European CBs in general continued to soften in a market where both hedge and long-only funds remained risk neutral. Importantly  primary market issuance returned in earnest this month with €2.5bn of new issues including one from a South African company Sibanye-Stillwater  a precious and industrial metals mining and recycling business. Demand from long only managers in general was limited and pricing  while not yet generous  suited our book and we participated in most deals with the exception of Ubisoft which was priced too high. 5The US convertible market was unequivocally positive in November for the first time in several months. This was against a backdrop of 2-year rates dropping by 40bps from 5.08% to 4.68% and HY CDX spreads dropping enormously from 517bps to 402bps. Market conditions have demonstrably changed for the better  with a lot of optimism around the end-of-rate-hikes narrative. Our credit and interest rate hedges detracted as would be expected (the interest rate hedge has been reduced slightly)  but overall the portfolio delivered a nice positive pnl month. The new issue market is also flying in the US and the last week of the month saw two new giant CB issues in Uber and PG&E. We participated in both and made decent pnl. Volatility Trading Volatility trading posted -5bps to the performance of the fund in November.

Our portfolio  which maintains its customary long convexity position  was consequently challenged by this abrupt shift in market dynamics. By reacting swiftly  we were able to mitigate losses through downside puts on the VIX  and we are maintaining a cautious approach  monitoring the evolving environment for any potential discrepancies. Warrant arbitrage Warrant arbitrage was flat in November. Equity strategies In November equity strategies returned a solid +154bps  primarily driven by positive results in risk arbitrage and special situations. The first contributor was our position in VMware  as their takeover by Broadcom finally completed after receiving the long-awaited approval from Chinese authorities. Prior to this approval  the stock had been under pressure on fears of that US-China trade tensions might impact the deal as it approached its long stop date. Another positive result was our investment in Abcam  as Danaher received all the authorizations to complete the takeover on 6 December  earlier than expected. † * Source: Bloomberg 6As flagged last month  the return of corporate activity seems to be gradually gathering pace. One clear example of this is another position which contributed positively in November  a holding in Adevinta. A consortium led by private equity giants Permira and Blackstone confirmed a takeover offer for the company  at €14bn enterprise value. This is the largest M&A deal in Europe year to date. This also demonstrates the availability of financing for such transactions. We remain very constructive on the overall opportunity set. As a final note  both capital markets and our short-term trading actives continue to perform well. Credit strategies Credit long / short The credit books contributed (+11bps) this month. Credit special situations Credit special situations was up strongly this month (+95bps). While November was a strong month for credit markets overall  performance was specifically driven by idiosyncratic positions  with the start of the Orpea restructuring process and a further improvement in the KCA situation. In terms of broader markets  the HY Crossover index tightened by as much as 92 points  reaching its tightest point of the year at 365 bps and back to the levels of the first quarter of 2022. The strength of the European credit market was also generally helped by the rate environment  with 5-year euro rates falling by 36bps in November. Trading Trading contributed +79bps in November  with positive contributions from a range of positions. Macro trading had a good November  with positive attribution from long gold (hedging rising geopolitical uncertainty)  tactical long positions in equity options and a long position in EURUSD. While there may be too much dovishness from the Fed now priced in  we think that there is room for risk appetite to remain supported and for Europe in particular to surprise to the upside. We continue to monitor liquidity and fiscal positions very closely. DIRECT INVESTMENTS OTHER THAN BG FUND On top of its investment in BG Fund  BGHL has other investments.
