For now  there is no free capacity at power plants "" it said.EU aid debateThe European Union will find ways to provide financial aid to Ukraine despite Hungary’s threat to veto EU assistance  a senior official said Friday. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has threatened to block the $53 billion budget proposal to assist Kyiv through 2027.A senior EU official who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said if Hungary does veto the aid package  the EU could allocate a smaller amount of money to Ukraine for a shorter time  or the other 26 EU countries could extend their national contributions bilaterally to Kyiv.""We know how existential it is. European leaders are responsible people — at least 26 "" said the official  who is involved in an EU summit scheduled for next week.Ukraine depends on economic aid from the West to keep its defenses against Russia going.A senior EU diplomat  also speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity  expressed hope that a compromise might be reached  as happened last year when Orban objected to the EU’s $18 billion financial package aid to Ukraine but ultimately approved it after securing concessions from the EU for his country.Hungary is also planning to block EU membership talks for Ukraine at next week’s summit.The EU is due to consider a legal proposal on Tuesday allowing the use of sanctioned Russian frozen assets to help Ukraine. However  EU officials say Ukraine might not see the money anytime soon because EU members are bickering over the amounts pledged for Ukraine.The EU executive said some $30 billion worth of private Russian assets and a further $223 billion of the Russian central bank's funds have been confiscated.Some $135 billion of the latter sum is held by Belgian company Euroclear. Belgium estimated it would collect $2.5 billion in taxes on that in 2023 and 2024. It said it would use those proceeds for Ukraine.Putin presidency 2024Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday announced his candidacy in March's presidential election after a Kremlin award ceremony during which war veterans and others pleaded with him to seek reelection in what Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called “spontaneous” remarks.Putin  who was handed the presidency by Boris Yeltsin on the last day of 1999  has already served as president for longer than any other ruler of Russia since Josef Stalin.For Putin  71  the election is a formality: with the support of the state  the state-run media and almost no mainstream public dissent  he is certain to win. He has no discernable successor.About 80% of Russians approve of Putin's performance  according to the independent pollster Levada Center.

As of 1 September 2023 (cut-off date)  14 heavily pre-treated rrNHL patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma  mantle cell lymphoma and indolent lymphoma were enrolled (7 at DL1 and 7 at DL2). In parallel  enrollment of the Phase 2 expansion study is ongoing  and the first 9 patients have been dosed. The results (cut-off date: 1 September 2023) included in the poster are summarized below:Phase 1 part of the study: GLPG5101 showed an encouraging safety profile. Most TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 and the majority of the few Grade ≥ 3 events hematological. No CRS Grade > 3 and no ICANS Grade ≥ 2 were observed. 12 of 14 evaluable patients responded to treatment (ORR of 86%)  with 11 of 14 patients achieving a Complete Response (CRR of 79%). 6 of 7 patients treated with the higher dose level (DL2) responded to treatment (ORR of 86%) and achieved a Complete Response (CRR of 86%). At the time of the analysis  8 of 12 responding patients (67%) had an ongoing response  with a duration up to 15 months (median follow-up of 8.6 months); 2 of the 4 patients who progressed after an initial response had a CD19 positive relapse and 1 had confirmed CD19-negative disease.Phase 2 part of the study: GLPG5101 showed an encouraging safety profile with most TEAEs of Grade 1 or 2; the majority of Grade ≥ 3 events were hematological. No CRS Grade > 2 and ICANS was seen in one patient (Grade 3). 6 of 7 evaluable patients responded to treatment (ORR of 86%) and a Complete Response was observed in 4 of 7 patients (57%). At the time of the analysis  all 6 responding patients (100%) had an ongoing response with a median follow-up of 3.2 months.The data suggest that Galapagos’ point-of-care platform can deliver fresh product in a median vein-to-vein time of seven days.Strong and consistent in vivo CAR-T expansion levels and a product consisting of early phenotype T cells were observed in all doses tested.Natalia Tovar  MD  PhD  Hospital Clinic de Barcelona  Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi I Sunyer (IDIBAPS)  University of Barcelona (Spain) presented the analysis on the Phase 1 part EUPLAGIA-1 in patients with rrCLL  with or without RT.

The combination of these three core components allows for the administration of a fresh product  a median vein-to-vein time of seven days (i.e. the time between T-cell collection and CAR-T infusion)  and greater physicians oversight throughout the process.About the EUPLAGIA-1 study (EudraCT 2021-003815-25)EUPLAGIA-1 is an ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label  multi-center study evaluating the feasibility  safety  and efficacy of point-of-care manufactured GLPG5201 in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphocytic leukemia (rrCLL) and small cell lymphocytic lymphoma (rrSLL)  with or without Richter transformation (RT). GLPG5201 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as intravenous infusion of a fresh product candidate in a single fixed dose. Patients with CD19+ rrCLL or rrSLL with ≥2 lines of prior therapy are eligible to participate  and patients with RT are eligible regardless of prior therapy. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study was to evaluate safety and determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. The dose levels that were evaluated in the Phase 1 part of the study are 35x106 (DL1)  and 100x106 (DL2) CAR+ viable T cells.About chronic lymphocytic leukemiaChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (lymphoid neoplasms). It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes  which are usually monoclonal in origin. CLL affects B-cells in the blood and bone marrow.1 RT is an uncommon clinicopathological condition observed in patients with CLL. It is characterized by the sudden transformation of the CLL into a significantly more aggressive form of large cell lymphoma and occurs in approximately 2-10% of all CLL patients. CLL usually follows an indolent course and is an incurable disease. Patients who develop relapsed and refractory disease and become resistant to new agents have a dismal prognosis and a high unmet medical need for new therapeutic options such as CAR-T cells. With estimated incidence of 4.7 new cases per 100 000 individuals  CLL is the most prevalent lymphoid malignancy and is the most common adult leukemias in the US and in Europe.2About the ATALANTA-1 study (EudraCT 2021-003272-13)ATALANTA-1 is an ongoing Phase 1/2  open-label  multicenter study to evaluate the feasibility  safety  and efficacy of point-of-care manufactured GLPG5101  a CD19 CAR-T product candidate  in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (rrNHL). GLPG5101 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as an intravenous infusion of a fresh product candidate in a single fixed dose. Each enrolled patient will be followed for 24 months. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study was to evaluate safety and to determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. Secondary objectives include assessment of efficacy and feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing of GLPG5101.

Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma can occur at any age although it is more common in adults over 50 years old. Initial symptoms usually are enlarged lymph nodes  fever  and weight loss. There are many different types of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. These types can be divided into aggressive (fast-growing) and indolent (slow-growing) types  and they can be formed from either B lymphocytes (B cells) or in lesser extent from T lymphocytes (T cells) or Natural Killer cells (NK cells). B-cell lymphoma makes up about 85% of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas diagnosed in the US. Prognosis and treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas depend on the stage and type of disease.About GalapagosWe are a global biotechnology company with operations in Europe and the US dedicated to developing transformational medicines for more years of life and quality of life.

The results were presented at the ASH 2023 Annual Meeting  in San Diego  California.As of May 1  2023  data cutoff  patients in the Sézary Syndrome cohort (cohort 1  n=56) received a median of 5 prior systemic therapies  including mogamulizumab  and had a median follow-up of 14.4 months.The data demonstrated that lacutamab showed robust clinical activity and an overall favorable safety profile. The global confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 37.5% (21/56)  including 2 complete responses (CR) and 19 partial responses (PR). Overall response rate (ORR) in the skin was 46.4% (26/56)  including 5 CR and 21 PR and ORR in the blood was 48.2% (27/56) with 15 CR and 12 PR. Median progression-free survival was 8.0 months (95% CI 4.7-21.2). In patients who achieved a global response  the median duration of response is 12.3 months (95% CI 5.2-NE).Best Global Response N=56 Best Response in Skin N=56 Best Response in Blood N=56 Best Response in LN N=461 Best Response (N  %) CR 2 (3.6) 5 (8.9) 15 (26.8) 3 (6.5) PR 19 (33.9) 21 (37.5) 12 (21.4) 6 (13.0) SD 28 (50.0) 27 (48.2) 24 (42.9) 28 (60.9) PD 7 (12.5) 3 (5.4) 5 (8.9) 5 (10.9) NE 0 0 0 4 (8.7) ORR% [95%CI] 37.5% [26.0-50.6] 46.4% [34.0-59.3] 48.2% [35.7-61.0] 19.6% [10.7-33.2]Table 1: Efficacy results in SS patients (n=56)____________________________________ 1 includes patients not involved at baseline who progressed in the LN“The rapid and durable responses observed in the Phase 2 TELLOMAK trial which enrolled heavily pretreated patients  confirms that treatment with lacutamab achieves clinically meaningful outcomes for patients with Sézary Syndrome after at least two prior systemic therapies ” commented Dr. Sonia Quaratino  Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma. “Enrollment to TELLOMAK study is completed and long-term follow-up will provide more mature data on the key study endpoints in due course.”Prof. Pierluigi Porcu  Director  Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center  Jefferson Health  Philadelphia  and Principal Investigator in the TELLOMAK study  added: “Sézary Syndrome patients treated with more than two prior systemic therapies including mogamulizumab  represent a high unmet medical need population with poor quality of life.

Rare cutaneous lymphomas of T lymphocytes have a poor prognosis with few efficacious and safe therapeutic options at advanced stages.KIR3DL2 is an inhibitory receptor of the KIR family  expressed by approximately 65% of patients across all CTCL subtypes and expressed by up 90% of patients with certain aggressive CTCL subtypes  in particular  Sézary syndrome. It is expressed by up to 50% of patients with mycosis fungoides and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). It has a restricted expression on normal tissues.Lacutamab is granted European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIME designation and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory Sézary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Lacutamab is granted orphan drug status in the European Union and in the United States for the treatment of CTCL.About TELLOMAKTELLOMAK (NCT03902184) is a global  open-label  multi-cohort Phase 2 clinical trial recruiting patients with Sézary syndrome and mycosis fungoides (MF) in the United States and Europe. Specifically:Cohort 1: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in approximately 60 patients with Sézary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies  including mogamulizumab. The Sézary syndrome cohort of the study could enable the registration of lacutamab in this indication.Cohort 2: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline with a Simon 2-stage design.Cohort 3: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that do not express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline  with a Simon-2 stage design.All comers: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with both KIR3DL2 expressing and non-expressing MF to explore the correlation between the level of KIR3DL2 expression and treatment outcomes utilizing a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) assay under development as a companion diagnostic.The trial is now fully enrolled. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective global response rate. Key secondary endpoints are progression-free survival  duration of response  overall survival  quality of life  pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity and adverse events.About Innate PharmaInnate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.
