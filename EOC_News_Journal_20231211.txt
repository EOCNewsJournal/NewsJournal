The bank has already set a milestone by issuing a €20 million digital bond via Deutsche Börse’s proprietary Clearstream platform using a centralized data storage system on its D7 platform.The German regulation on digital securities  known as eWpG  supports both centralized digital repositories and decentralized ones operating on blockchain technology. Under this regulation  the latter are classified as cryptographic securities  a category into which KfW’s next issue will fall.According to a report by International Financing Review  KfW broached the topic of its upcoming tokenized bond at a recent conference. Union Investment  a prominent German asset management firm  will again be a lead investor in this KfW tokenized bond. This firm has played a significant role in investing in tokenized bonds  from the initial European Investment Bank to Siemens and Metzler’s tokenized fund units.

This follows a record high reached on Friday.Because stock markets are leading indicators of the economy  it's an encouraging sign that Germany's stock market has hit a record high. And it's good news for America's stock market given that the two countries traded about $200 billion worth of goods in 2021.Germany is the fourth largest economy in the world and a close ally to the US  so it's no surprise that over the long-term  both countries' stock markets tend to move in tandem.Advertisement""The S&P 500 and DAX are positively correlated  and while the DAX has historically lagged the S&P 500  the recent outperformance should continue "" Stockton told Business Insider on Friday. ""We wouldn't normally look to the DAX for leadership pertaining to the US  but it is providing a good example (of a breakout to new highs) for global equity markets.""The DAX confirmed its breakout to record highs on Friday  when it closed above its final resistance level of about 16 290. The index has surged 3% since it cleared that resistance level in late November to a new high of 16 794.""The breakout is a bullish long-term catalyst for Europe's largest economy "" Stockton said.In a Friday note to clients  she also said to expect the S&P 500 to continue following the DAX higher  rather than leading the DAX higher.AdvertisementThe S&P 500 is still about 4% below its record high reached in January 2022  but it did stage a bullish breakout on Friday above the key resistance level of about 4 600. If the S&P 500 can decisively close above this level at the end of the week  expect more gains to continue  according to Stockton.""We would see this as a bullish long-term indication  with the next and final resistance for the S&P 500 at its January 2022 high "" she said.",positive,0.76,0.22,0.01,mixed,0.56,0.32,0.12,True,English,"['German stocks', 'great news', 'S&P 500', 'The Deutsche Boerse AG German Stock Index', 'app Email address', ""Fairlead Strategies' founder"", 'largest 40 publicly-traded companies', 'The S&P 500', 'global equity markets', 'fourth largest economy', 'bullish long-term catalyst', 'bullish long-term indication', ""countries' stock markets"", 'key resistance level', 'final resistance level', 'US stock market', 'The DAX', 'two countries', 'encouraging sign', 'recent outperformance', 'NEW LOOK', 'inside scoop', 'biggest stories', 'Read preview', 'favorite topics', 'personalized feed', 'Privacy Policy', 'great sign', 'leading indicators', 'good news', 'close ally', 'good example', 'late November', 'new high', 'bullish breakout', 'record close', 'record high', '$200 billion worth', 'Business Insider', 'Katie Stockton', 'Friday note', 'highs', 'Germany', 'Monday', 'world', 'goods', 'today', 'tech', 'Something', 'Terms', 'Service', 'time', 'Advertisement', 'America', 'surprise', 'tandem', 'leadership', 'Europe', 'clients', 'January', 'end', 'week', 'gains', 'next']",2023-12-11,2023-12-11,markets.businessinsider.com

The results were presented at the ASH 2023 Annual Meeting  in San Diego  California.As of May 1  2023  data cutoff  patients in the Sézary Syndrome cohort (cohort 1  n=56) received a median of 5 prior systemic therapies  including mogamulizumab  and had a median follow-up of 14.4 months.The data demonstrated that lacutamab showed robust clinical activity and an overall favorable safety profile. The global confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 37.5% (21/56)  including 2 complete responses (CR) and 19 partial responses (PR). Overall response rate (ORR) in the skin was 46.4% (26/56)  including 5 CR and 21 PR and ORR in the blood was 48.2% (27/56) with 15 CR and 12 PR. Median progression-free survival was 8.0 months (95% CI 4.7-21.2).

Rare cutaneous lymphomas of T lymphocytes have a poor prognosis with few efficacious and safe therapeutic options at advanced stages.KIR3DL2 is an inhibitory receptor of the KIR family  expressed by approximately 65% of patients across all CTCL subtypes and expressed by up 90% of patients with certain aggressive CTCL subtypes  in particular  Sézary syndrome. It is expressed by up to 50% of patients with mycosis fungoides and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). It has a restricted expression on normal tissues.Lacutamab is granted European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIME designation and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory Sézary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Lacutamab is granted orphan drug status in the European Union and in the United States for the treatment of CTCL.About TELLOMAKTELLOMAK ( NCT03902184 ) is a global  open-label  multi-cohort Phase 2 clinical trial recruiting patients with Sézary syndrome and mycosis fungoides (MF) in the United States and Europe. Specifically:Cohort 1: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in approximately 60 patients with Sézary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies  including mogamulizumab. The Sézary syndrome cohort of the study could enable the registration of lacutamab in this indication.Cohort 2: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline with a Simon 2-stage design.Cohort 3: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that do not express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline  with a Simon-2 stage design.All comers: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with both KIR3DL2 expressing and non-expressing MF to explore the correlation between the level of KIR3DL2 expression and treatment outcomes utilizing a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) assay under development as a companion diagnostic.The trial is now fully enrolled. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective global response rate. Key secondary endpoints are progression-free survival  duration of response  overall survival  quality of life  pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity and adverse events.About Innate PharmaInnate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.
