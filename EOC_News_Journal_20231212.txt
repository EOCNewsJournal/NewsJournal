All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2022 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  December 11  2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity”  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

The Commission's proposal would target €180 billion worth of frozen assets that are with Belgium’s Euroclear  a clearinghouse acting as a custodian for Russian reserves.,"EU officials have been exploring ways to skim off the earnings from assets worth some €200 billion that were immobilized in the EU since Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine | iStockBRUSSELS ― The European Commission presented a plan on Tuesday to funnel the proceeds from Russian assets frozen in the EU to help rebuild Ukraine.But the proposal — which has to be unanimously approved by EU countries — is merely a first step in what will probably be a drawn-out process that means the war-torn country is unlikely to see the money anytime soon.The issue is loosely tied to a wider discussion about a dedicated fund for Ukraine that will be held by EU leaders in a summit on Thursday and Friday.For months  EU officials have been exploring ways to skim off the earnings from assets worth some €200 billion that were immobilized in the EU since Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.As Russian securities reach maturity and are reinvested by financial intermediaries  they generate a profit. The EU wants to target those revenues  said an EU official who was granted anonymity as they were not allowed to speak on the record.The Commission's initial proposal would force the proceeds of invested assets to be deposited in a separate account of the clearinghouse ― financial institutions that facilitate transactions ― where they are held.Once that is agreed  the EU executive would have to put forward a second proposal to trigger the transfer of cash to the EU budget and then to Ukraine.Interest ratesThe European Central Bank has expressed concerns about the plan to use the proceeds of frozen assets  warning that it could cause instability in the euro currency. Going after the revenues is seen as a legally safer option than a full-scale handover of assets.“The active discussion is around the interest rates … from a legal standpoint the interest rate does not belong to Russia ” Vladyslav Vlasyuk  an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  told POLITICO. ""So these are not sovereign funds  strictly speaking ” He estimated that this move would generate around €3 billion per year.Russian foreign reserves were frozen by countries participating in sanctions at the onset of Moscow’s war on Ukraine and the majority sit in the EU. The Commission's proposal would target €180 billion worth of frozen assets that are with Belgium’s Euroclear  a clearinghouse acting as a custodian for Russian reserves.Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen stressed that the proceeds from Russian frozen funds should finance the long-term reconstruction of Ukraine  which is estimated at $411 billion by the World Bank.The EU's proposed wider Ukraine fund has been designed to provide €33 billion of loans and €17 billion of grants to Ukraine until 2027  but is currently blocked by Hungary.",neutral,0.03,0.76,0.21,negative,0.02,0.18,0.8,True,English,"['Russian frozen assets', 'first step', 'EU', 'money', 'Ukraine', 'Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'The European Central Bank', 'The European Commission', 'Russian foreign reserves', 'Russian frozen funds', 'wider Ukraine fund', 'The Commission', 'World Bank', 'Russian reserves', 'wider discussion', 'dedicated fund', 'sovereign funds', 'Russian securities', 'Vladimir Putin', 'first step', 'war-torn country', 'financial intermediaries', 'separate account', 'financial institutions', 'Interest rates', 'euro currency', 'safer option', 'full-scale handover', 'active discussion', 'legal standpoint', 'Vladyslav Vlasyuk', '€180 billion worth', 'long-term reconstruction', 'Russian assets', 'frozen assets', 'EU officials', 'EU leaders', 'EU executive', 'EU budget', 'initial proposal', 'second proposal', 'EU countries', 'ways', 'earnings', 'invasion', 'iStock', 'BRUSSELS', 'plan', 'Tuesday', 'proceeds', 'process', 'money', 'issue', 'summit', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'months', 'February', 'maturity', 'profit', 'revenues', 'anonymity', 'record', 'clearinghouse', 'transactions', 'transfer', 'cash', 'concerns', 'instability', 'adviser', 'POLITICO', 'move', 'year', 'sanctions', 'onset', 'Moscow', 'majority', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'custodian', 'loans', 'grants', 'Hungary']",2023-12-12,2023-12-12,politico.eu
33729,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/eu-commission-tables-first-step-on-tapping-into-frozen-russian-funds-for-ukraine/,EU Commission tables first step on tapping into frozen Russian funds for Ukraine,The European Commission proposed on Tuesday (12 December) blocking all profits from the sanctioned Russian sovereign assets in the EU into separate accounts  in the first step towards making use of them to finance Ukraine's reconstruction.,The European Commission proposed on Tuesday (12 December) blocking all profits from the sanctioned Russian sovereign assets in the EU into separate accounts  in the first step towards making use of them to finance Ukraine’s reconstruction.The Commission is putting forward a “proposal on the immobilisation of extraordinary revenues  so-called ‘windfall revenues’  of the Russian Central Bank’s assets”  announced Vera Jourova  the vice-president of the EU executive.The Commission recommends that financial institutions put all profits stemming from the Russian Central Bank’s assets on separate accounts once the decision is adopted.This would mean to “immobilise the net profits and secure them so it can be used in the future”  one EU official said speaking on condition of anonymity.The step comes after EU countries urged the Commission to look into legal ways of using the stream of revenues from the Russian central bank’s money immobilised in the bloc to help rebuild Ukraine following Russia’s attack on the country.The European Commission estimates there is around €200 billion of the Russian Central Bank reserves frozen in the EU.The draft proposal  which is not public and has been sent directly to national capitals  however  falls short of proposing ways to do so. The member states will later take a decision in this regard  based on a future proposal by the executive.“Because it is unprecedented  each step needs to be carefully assessed and discussed. We think it is appropriate to step of separate registration assets  and it paves the way for the next steps ” the EU official said.As this has never been done before  EU experts  lawyers  and economists  including the European Central Bank  have called for caution in doing so.More hawkish Eastern and Central European member states have pushed for the move  while some countries such as Belgium  Estonia  and the Czech Republic have already started looking into how to use freezes within a national context.The EU’s proposal “will focus prudently on the windfall profits from the immobilised assets of the Russian Central Bank ” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had said after the meeting of leaders in July  but expressed caution.EU leaders are expected to review the Commission’s proposal at a summit on Thursday (14 December).They should “reiterate call for decisive progress  […] on how extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from Russia’s immobilised assets could be directed to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction”  according to draft conclusions seen by Euractiv.More than €100 billion of frozen Russian assets are stuck in the Belgium-based Euroclear and have generated around €3 billion according to the clearing house’s data since the beginning of Russia’s war on Ukraine.“There is good reason to consider that these revenues should be used to help the reconstruction and recovery of Ukraine  that is the long-term objective ” the EU official said.“The short-term objective is to make sure this is possible ” the official added  presenting two strands of work.“First  forcing the central security deposits (CSDs) to manage and register separately those revenues so they can be identified in the accounting system  and secondly  these net profits from today would be prohibited to redistribution to shareholders and third parties  so they have to stay in CSDs.”That way  the Russian Central Bank’s money will not be touched by the future steps  only the profits.Those can be used for Ukraine since they are “exceptional” and “only exist because of the immobilisation. It is a direct consequence [of the sanctions] ” the official said.The European Commission did not give any estimation as to how much cash could be generated from the move  which is also supported by the world’s biggest economies.The G7 will explore how “extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from immobilised Russian sovereign assets” could be used to support Ukraine’s reconstruction  the group said in a statement in October.The proposal also comes at a point in time as the EU leaders meet in Brussels later this week to discuss how to fund the next years in the EU’s future budget.Using revenues from Russian frozen assets has been raised as an idea  and is included in the latest framework proposal for the EU summit sent by the European Council President Charles Michel on Tuesday (12 December)  and seen by Euractiv  even though it has now been criticised by a majority of member states.[Edited by Alexandra Brzozowski/Zoran Radosavljevic]Read more with Euractiv,neutral,0.06,0.62,0.32,negative,0.04,0.29,0.68,True,English,"['EU Commission tables', 'frozen Russian funds', 'first step', 'Ukraine', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'European Council President Charles Michel', 'Russian Central Bank reserves', 'Central European member states', 'European Central Bank', 'The European Commission', 'central security deposits', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'Russian frozen assets', 'latest framework proposal', 'separate registration assets', 'one EU official', 'The Commission', 'Russian assets', 'The G7', 'separate accounts', 'Vera Jourova', 'financial institutions', 'national capitals', 'next steps', 'hawkish Eastern', 'Czech Republic', 'national context', 'decisive progress', 'private entities', 'draft conclusions', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'clearing house', 'good reason', 'long-term objective', 'short-term objective', 'two strands', 'accounting system', 'third parties', 'direct consequence', 'biggest economies', 'next years', 'Alexandra Brzozowski', 'Zoran Radosavljevic', 'EU experts', 'future steps', 'future budget', 'draft proposal', 'extraordinary revenues', 'windfall revenues', 'net profits', 'legal ways', 'windfall profits', 'EU leaders', 'first step', 'future proposal', 'EU executive', 'EU countries', 'EU summit', 'Tuesday', 'December', 'Ukraine', 'reconstruction', 'immobilisation', 'vice-president', 'decision', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'stream', 'money', 'bloc', 'attack', 'country', 'regard', 'lawyers', 'economists', 'caution', 'More', 'move', 'Estonia', 'freezes', 'meeting', 'July', 'Thursday', 'call', 'recovery', 'Euractiv', 'data', 'beginning', 'war', 'CSDs', 'today', 'shareholders', 'sanctions', 'estimation', 'cash', 'world', 'group', 'statement', 'October', 'point', 'time', 'Brussels', 'idea', 'majority']",2023-12-12,2023-12-12,euractiv.com

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo has already promised to send the corporate taxes from that windfall – some €1.5 bn – directly to Ukraine.,Frozen Russian central bank assets held within the EU will be segregated  the bloc proposed today (12 December)  rowing back on previous promises to use windfall profits to aid Ukraine.The news comes as western support to the war-torn nation falters  with US President Joe Biden facing Republican scepticism over continuing financial aid  and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán threatening to veto a €50 bn EU package.The plans – formally adopted by the European Commission today  but not published – will require financial depositaries such as Euroclear to register frozen Russian assets separately  with profits withheld from shareholders  said an EU official  speaking under condition of anonymity.Seizing Russian state profits as reparations for Ukraine remains a “long-term” objective but there’s “no deadline and no fixed condition” for doing so  the official added.That falls short of commitments given by the Commission’s president Ursula von der Leyen in October  who told reporters she would present plans to use profits from the immobilised assets to pay for Ukraine’s reconstruction  which the World Bank said in March will cost €383 bn.EU member states  who must unanimously agree the sanctions measures  may be responsible for the U-Turn.

This will make possible their transfer and assignment to the EU budget for the benefit of Ukraine at a later stage ” the document says.The proposals include recommendations to shield the entities holding the assets from legal risks and retaliation  as well as exemptions for central securities depositories holding small amounts.The EU  Group of Seven nations and Australia have frozen about €260 billion ($280 billion) in Russian Central Bank assets in the form of securities and cash  with more than two thirds of that immobilized in the EU. The majority of the EU-based assets are held in Belgium by the clearing house Euroclear  where they have earned about €3 billion so far this year.Despite backing from the G-7 for the windfall measure  the EU is taking a gradual approach  given concerns raised by the European Central Bank  the International Monetary Fund and several member states.The plan’s “Step 2 ” which envisions transferring the net revenue generated by the frozen funds to the EU’s 2024-2027 budget  would require those concerns to be overcome before the commission presents a further proposal.Based on current interest rate assumptions  the EU estimates that the taxable proceeds could reach €15 billion over the next four years  according to the document.The proposal makes clear that the returns generated by the frozen assets are not due to Russia  nor are they Russia’s property  because they are distinct from the principal immobilized assets themselves. At the same time  there can be no “legitimate expectation” that the revenues remain with central securities depositories and their shareholders as the profits are a result of sanctions and extraordinary circumstances  the draft notes.“The faster we act  the more significant the amounts we can mobilize to help Ukraine ” the proposal concludes.--With assistance from Jorge Valero.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2023 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.06,0.66,0.28,negative,0.03,0.35,0.62,True,English,"['Initial Steps', 'Russian Assets', 'EU', 'Sanctioned', 'Ukraine', 'current interest rate assumptions', 'Russian central bank assets', 'European Central Bank', 'risk management requirements', 'International Monetary Fund', 'several member states', 'next four years', 'central securities depositories', 'principal immobilized assets', 'The European Union', 'Bloomberg L.P.', 'EU-based assets', 'frozen assets', 'first steps', 'windfall tax', 'national taxes', 'statutory capital', 'later stage', 'legal risks', 'Seven nations', 'two thirds', 'clearing house', 'gradual approach', 'net revenue', '2024-2027 budget', 'same time', 'legitimate expectation', 'extraordinary circumstances', 'draft notes', 'Jorge Valero', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'small amounts', 'windfall measure', 'taxable proceeds', 'ensuing profits', 'EU budget', 'draft proposal', 'move', 'Ukraine', 'reconstruction', 'funds', 'actions', 'deduction', 'expenses', 'line', 'transfer', 'assignment', 'benefit', 'document', 'proposals', 'recommendations', 'entities', 'retaliation', 'exemptions', 'Group', 'Australia', 'form', 'cash', 'majority', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'G-7', 'concerns', 'plan', 'commission', 'returns', 'property', 'revenues', 'shareholders', 'result', 'sanctions', 'assistance']",2023-12-12,2023-12-12,news.yahoo.com

According to estimates by the European Commission  the proposal would generate about 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) per year  or 15 billion from 2023-2027.The plan would most directly impact Euroclear  a Belgium-based financial services company that holds about 191 billion euros ($205 billion) in Russian assets.Euroclear did not respond to requests for comment  the FT said.The plan's specific targeting of only the profits  and only those from Russia's Central Bank  is thought to assuage some fears of the financial and legal implications of the seizure. Experts said that even such a plan has risks.There are concerns that Russia could take retaliatory measures by seizing Western assets in Russia  which it has threatened to do. On occasion  it has followed through on those threats  such as the seizure of Carlsberg's Russian subsidiary  which the CEO said was unlawful.There is also a lack of a clear legal standard for the seizure  experts said.A year into full-scale invasion  West struggles to seize Russian assets for Ukraine Hundreds of potential international investors met with top Ukrainian and Western officials in London in late June to discuss how to rebuild the country  ravaged by Russia’s war.

This follows a record high reached on Friday.Because stock markets are leading indicators of the economy  it's an encouraging sign that Germany's stock market has hit a record high. And it's good news for America's stock market given that the two countries traded about $200 billion worth of goods in 2021.Germany is the fourth largest economy in the world and a close ally to the US  so it's no surprise that over the long-term  both countries' stock markets tend to move in tandem.Advertisement""The S&P 500 and DAX are positively correlated  and while the DAX has historically lagged the S&P 500  the recent outperformance should continue "" Stockton told Business Insider on Friday.

This includes executives in the c-suite and major hedge funds.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  announces that Mobilink Bank  its financial services operating company in Pakistan  participated in the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai  UAE. Mobilink Bank’s Chief Operating Officer Haaris Mahmood Chaudhary spoke at a panel on gender equality and gender-responsive finance to combat climate change in Pakistan.Mobilink Bank  Pakistan’s leading digital microfinance bank with over 45 million registered users  is among the first adopters of climate finance in Pakistan. Mobilink Bank has invested over PKR1.6 billion ($5.6 million) in green financing  primarily focusing on loans for solar applications in agriculture to promote renewable energy. Mobilink Bank is also one of the strongest advocates of gender diversity and inclusion in Pakistan  having allocated over PKR12 billion ($42.2 million) of subsidized financing to more than 66 thousand women entrepreneurs. It continues to provide digital  financial  and agritech solutions to farmers  enhancing sustainable agricultural practices with a gender-inclusive focus.Speaking at a panel organized by UN Women Regional Office of Asia and the Pacific and Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination of Pakistan during COP28  Chaudhary emphasized the intersection between gender-inclusivity and climate initiatives.“It is often the most disadvantaged parts of the society that bear the brunt of disasters  including climate change. Women- a highly influential  yet underserved segment  are more susceptible to the drastic effects of climate change  and we aim at narrowing the gender gap to provide inclusive opportunities for them for holistic economic development. We believe that there is a unique opportunity to address many challenges at once: Financial community  especially when empowered with the digital tools that we have as a VEON Group company  can move the needle significantly in combatting climate change and building communities’ resilience by gender-inclusive practices.” said Chaudhary in his remarks on the COP28 panel.VEON’s comprehensive approach to disasters was recently recognized at the World Communication Awards  where VEON received the Crisis Response award for the efforts of Jazz  JazzCash and Mobilink Bank in the midst of  and during the aftermath of  the devastating floods in Pakistan in August 2022  as well as for Banglalink’s support for communities facing Cyclone Mocha in Bangladesh  and Kyivstar’s work in keeping Ukraine connected through the war.VEON Group’s sustainability initiatives  including in areas of diversity and inclusion as well as climate action  are outlined in its latest Integrated Report for 2022  available on the company website.About VEONVEON is a digital operator that provides converged connectivity and digital services to nearly 160 million customers.

Carbios (Euronext Growth Paris: ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  was one of eight beneficiaries selected to present the progress of its industrial project in the presence of the President of the French Republic on the occasion of the two-year anniversary of the launch of the France 2030 investment plan. Carbios is receiving €42.5 million in public funding (€30 million from the State as part of France 2030 and €12.5 million from the Grand-Est Region) for the construction of the world's first plant for the enzymatic depolymerization of PET. Carbios is an emblematic example of the France 2030 initiative to support innovative projects that contribute to reindustrialization through innovation in strategic sectors  such as recycling. This plant  located in Longlaville in the Grand-Est Region  will be Carbios' first industrial site. Construction has just begun.Emmanuel Ladent  CEO of Carbios: ""Carbios is honored to have been selected by the State to present the progress of our industrial project  an ambitious undertaking that could not have been launched without France 2030. Carbios is an example of what France can achieve collectively  from research to industry  to create a global leader in the fight against plastic pollution. We are very grateful for the support of the State in this crucial phase for our company.""Dr. Philippe Pouletty  Founder and President of Carbios: ""We thank the President and Carbios shareholders for their strong support of Carbios. Thanks to Carbios’ proprietary biotechnology and Europe’s ambitious recycling objectives  we will be able to reduce plastic pollution  oil use  and potentially toxic microplastics  all while promoting a more targeted use of plastics.""The state-of-the-art facility will play a crucial role in the fight against plastic pollution by offering an industrial-scale solution for enzymatic depolymerization of PET waste. Carbios' technology enables PET circularity and provides an alternative raw material to virgin fossil-based monomers  allowing PET producers  waste management companies  public entities  and brands to have an efficient solution to meet regulatory requirements and fulfill their own sustainability commitments. The plant will have a processing capacity of 50 000 tons of post-consumer PET waste per year (equivalent to 2 billion colored PET bottles  2.5 billion PET trays  or 300 million T-shirts) and will address waste with little or no value such as colored PET bottles  food trays  and textiles. The plant will create 150 direct and indirect jobs in the region. In October 2023  Carbios obtained the building permit in 10 months (the average duration in France is 17 months) and the site operating permit  allowing construction to begin. The plant is currently under construction in Longlaville in the Grand-Est Region.France 2030 is an investment plan on an unprecedented scale. €54 billion will be invested to ensure that companies  universities and research organizations are in a position to respond competitively to the ecological and attractiveness challenges of the world ahead  and to foster the emergence of future leaders in our sectors of excellence  particularly in the field of ecological transition. From fundamental research  to the emergence of an idea  to the production of a new product or service  France 2030 supports the entire life cycle of innovation  right through to industrialization.###About Carbios:Carbios is a biotech company developing and industrializing biological solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles.

(""Azerion"") announces that it has today entered into an agreement with Principion Holding B.V. (""Principion"") to simplify Azerion's loan structure by settling several loans outstanding between Azerion and Principion (the ""Loan Settlement"").The objectives of the Loan Settlement are to simplify Azerion’s capital structure by setting off mutually outstanding unsecured liabilities  whilst at the same time providing Azerion with security against remaining balances. The Loan Settlement also provides Azerion the ability to use any ordinary shares in the capital of Azerion (the ""Shares"") to be acquired through the Loan Settlement mechanism for value creating purposes for all shareholders without the issuance of new Shares. The Loan Settlement has been approved by Azerion's management board and supervisory board.As at the date of this press release  the aggregate amount due and outstanding under the loans provided by (i) Principion to Azerion is approximately EUR 17.5 million  and (ii) Azerion to Principion is approximately EUR 36 million. In that context  the Loan Settlement consists of the following elements:Settlement of outstanding loansThe aggregate amounts outstanding under the various loans between Azerion and Principion will be set off against each other. Following the set-off  an amount of approximately EUR 18.5 million remains outstanding under the terms of one remaining loan provided by Azerion to Principion (the ""Remaining Loan Amount"")  with an interest rate of 4% per annum and a maturity date of 31 March 2025.Granting of securityPrincipion will grant a right of pledge over 10 548 229 Shares held by Principion to Azerion group  as security for payment of the Remaining Loan Amount. The right of pledge shall cease to exist upon repayment of the Remaining Loan Amount in full.Right to acquire SharesIn addition  Principion will grant a right to acquire a maximum of 10 548 229 Shares held by Principion (the ""Call Option"") to Azerion  against a price per Share which will be the lower of (i) EUR 1.85  and (ii) the maximum price per Share allowed under the then applicable share acquisition authorisation granted by Azerion's general meeting to Azerion's management board.1 The exercise price will upon each exercise be set off against the corresponding amount outstanding under the Remaining Loan Amount.The Call Option can be exercised by Azerion in whole or in part  but must in any case be exercised ultimately on 31 March 2025 (i) in full if this results in the aggregated exercise price being less than or equal to the amount still outstanding under the Remaining Loan Amount at that moment in time  or (ii) for such number of Shares as is required to result in the aggregate exercise price for this exercise equalling the amount then still outstanding under the Remaining Loan Amount at that moment in time  provided  for the avoidance of doubt  that the Call Option cannot be exercised for more than 10 548 229 Shares.In the event that  upon repayment of the Remaining Loan Amount in full  the Call Option has not been exercised in full  Azerion may choose at any time up to and including 31 March 2025 to either (i) exercise the remainder of the Call Option against payment of the aggregated exercise price in cash; or (ii) forfeit the remainder of the Call Option.If any amount remains due and outstanding under the Remaining Loan Amount following full exercise of the Call Option  this will be settled by payment by Principion to Azerion in cash.Entering into the Loan Settlement reinforces Azerion's commitment to simplifying its capital structure while laying further foundations for future growth.About AzerionFounded in 2014  Azerion (EURONEXT: AZRN) is one of Europe’s largest digital advertising and entertainment media platforms.

(""Azerion"") announces that it has today entered into an agreement with Principion Holding B.V. (""Principion"") to simplify Azerion's loan structure by settling several loans outstanding between Azerion and Principion (the ""Loan Settlement"").The objectives of the Loan Settlement are to simplify Azerion’s capital structure by setting off mutually outstanding unsecured liabilities  whilst at the same time providing Azerion with security against remaining balances. The Loan Settlement also provides Azerion the ability to use any ordinary shares in the capital of Azerion (the ""Shares"") to be acquired through the Loan Settlement mechanism for value creating purposes for all shareholders without the issuance of new Shares. The Loan Settlement has been approved by Azerion's management board and supervisory board.As at the date of this press release  the aggregate amount due and outstanding under the loans provided by (i) Principion to Azerion is approximately EUR 17.5 million  and (ii) Azerion to Principion is approximately EUR 36 million. In that context  the Loan Settlement consists of the following elements:Settlement of outstanding loansThe aggregate amounts outstanding under the various loans between Azerion and Principion will be set off against each other. Following the set-off  an amount of approximately EUR 18.5 million remains outstanding under the terms of one remaining loan provided by Azerion to Principion (the ""Remaining Loan Amount"")  with an interest rate of 4% per annum and a maturity date of 31 March 2025.Granting of securityPrincipion will grant a right of pledge over 10 548 229 Shares held by Principion to Azerion group  as security for payment of the Remaining Loan Amount. The right of pledge shall cease to exist upon repayment of the Remaining Loan Amount in full.Right to acquire SharesIn addition  Principion will grant a right to acquire a maximum of 10 548 229 Shares held by Principion (the ""Call Option"") to Azerion  against a price per Share which will be the lower of (i) EUR 1.85  and (ii) the maximum price per Share allowed under the then applicable share acquisition authorisation granted by Azerion's general meeting to Azerion's management board.1 The exercise price will upon each exercise be set off against the corresponding amount outstanding under the Remaining Loan Amount.The Call Option can be exercised by Azerion in whole or in part  but must in any case be exercised ultimately on 31 March 2025 (i) in full if this results in the aggregated exercise price being less than or equal to the amount still outstanding under the Remaining Loan Amount at that moment in time  or (ii) for such number of Shares as is required to result in the aggregate exercise price for this exercise equalling the amount then still outstanding under the Remaining Loan Amount at that moment in time  provided  for the avoidance of doubt  that the Call Option cannot be exercised for more than 10 548 229 Shares.In the event that  upon repayment of the Remaining Loan Amount in full  the Call Option has not been exercised in full  Azerion may choose at any time up to and including 31 March 2025 to either (i) exercise the remainder of the Call Option against payment of the aggregated exercise price in cash; or (ii) forfeit the remainder of the Call Option.If any amount remains due and outstanding under the Remaining Loan Amount following full exercise of the Call Option  this will be settled by payment by Principion to Azerion in cash.Entering into the Loan Settlement reinforces Azerion's commitment to simplifying its capital structure while laying further foundations for future growth.About AzerionFounded in 2014  Azerion (EURONEXT: AZRN) is one of Europe’s largest digital advertising and entertainment media platforms.

MaaT013 introduces a novel therapeutic approach by restoring the gut microbiome ecosystem  offering a distinct immuno-restorative option that could complement standard immunosuppressive drugs  and could become a potential breakthrough for patients with limited options.”“ These promising findings pave the way for advancing the treatment landscape for aGvHD  with microbiome-based innovations  especially when they achieve complete responses ” said Hervé Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. “It reinforces our approach based on restoring patients’ immune systems through gut microbiome ecosystem therapies. The efficacy and safety results underscore the strong favourable benefit-risk profile for MaaT013  and we look forward to continuing to investigate MaaT013 with the aim of having it accessible globally for patients in need as soon as possible.”MaaT013 shown to have a safe profile and translates into increased overall survival:GI-ORR of 53% at day 28  with Complete Response observed in more than two thirds of responders (35%); Overall Response Rate (ORR) considering all organs was 50% with 31% Complete Response (CR).OS was 56% at 6 months and 47% at 12 months with a median follow up of 355 days.OS was significantly higher in patients who responded to MaaT013 compared to non-responders (67% versus 24% at 12 months).The Company defined a subgroup of 38 patients with similar treatment sequence to the ongoing Phase 3 ARES clinical trial  which included patients previously treated with steroids and ruxolitinib. GI-ORR was 61% at day 28  mainly driven by GI Complete Response (CR) with 58%. ORR was 54% including 51% with CR. Overall Survival (OS) in this group was 55% at 6 months and 52% at 12 months  confirming the CR as a proxy of survival at one year. OS was significantly higher in responders to MaaT013 treatment compared to non-responders (81% versus 8% at 12 months  respectively).MaaT013  a pooled-donor microbiome ecosystem therapy  displayed a good overall tolerability and safety profile in the EAP population. As of today  MaaT013 has been administered to more than 200 patients. Full details on safety are available here . A Phase 3 trial is currently ongoing in Europe to confirm these results in ruxolitinib-refractory patients ( NCT04769895 ) with ORR expected in mid-2024. The Company has an open-IND granted by the U.S. FDA with active discussions ongoing with potential clinical investigation sites.MaaT Pharma also presented its ongoing Phase 2b trial design for MaaT033  its second candidate  at the 2023 ASH Annual Meeting. Developed as an adjunctive therapy to enhance OS in HSCT (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) and cellular therapy recipients  MaaT033 targets optimal microbiota function for a broader patient population in a chronic setting. This international  multi-centre trial ( NCT05762211 ) is the largest randomized controlled study to date of a microbiome-based therapy in oncology  spanning up to 56 sites and enrolling 387 patients.Company to host key opinion leaders’ discussion on Monday  December 18 at 6:00 pm CET.

Committed to treating cancer and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)  a serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation  MaaT Pharma launched  in March 2022  an open-label  single arm  phase 3 clinical trial in patients with acute GvHD (aGvHD)  following the achievement of its proof of concept in a phase 2 trial. Its powerful discovery and analysis platform  gutPrint®  enables the identification of novel disease targets  evaluation of drug candidates  and identification of biomarkers for microbiome-related conditions. The company’s Microbiome Ecosystem Therapies are produced through a standardized cGMP manufacturing and quality control process to safely deliver the full diversity of the microbiome  in liquid and oral formulations. MaaT Pharma benefits from the commitment of world-leading scientists and established relationships with regulators to support the integration of the use of microbiome therapies in clinical practice. MaaT Pharma is listed on Euronext Paris (ticker: MAAT).About MaaT013MaaT013 is a full-ecosystem  off-the-shelf  standardized  pooled-donor  enema Microbiome Ecosystem TherapyTM for acute  hospital use. It is characterized by a consistently high diversity and richness of microbial species and the presence of Butycore TM (group of bacterial species known to produce anti-inflammatory metabolites). MaaT013 aims to restore the symbiotic relationship between the patient’s functional gut microbiome and their immune system to correct the responsiveness and tolerance of immune functions and thus reduce steroid-resistant  gastrointestinal (GI)-predominant aGvHD. MaaT013 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).About acute graft-vs-host-diseaseaGvHD occurs in patients within 100 days of undergoing a stem cell or bone marrow transplant. The transplanted cells “attack” the recipient  causing inflammation of the skin  liver and/or GI tract. GI-aGvHD results in patients experiencing extensive diarrhea which can be life-threatening. The standard first line therapy for treating aGvHD is the use of systemic steroids. If patients do not respond to steroids  they are considered steroid resistant (SR) and other agents can be administered. Currently  the only agent approved for treating SR aGvHD after failure of steroid treatment is ruxolitinib  which is currently approved for this indication in the USA and has received approval from the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on March 25  2022.About the Early Access ProgramThe Early Access Program (EAP) is coordinated and implemented by European Member States  which set their own rules and procedures to grant patients early access to certain medications or treatments  especially when facing life-threatening conditions and lacking alternative options. It allows for the use of these interventions before formal approval  acknowledging the urgent medical needs of individuals who might benefit from them. Healthcare professionals make the formal request to access this treatment. MaaT013 has been used in the EAP since 2019. It encompassed a diverse cohort of patients diagnosed with SR/steroid-dependent (SD) GI-aGvHD  with various aGvHD classifications – mainly grade III (49%) and grade IV (42%).Forward-looking StatementsAll statements other than statements of historical fact included in this press release about future events are subject to (i) change without notice and (ii) factors beyond the Company’s control.

Reasons for the Offering Buoyed by the excellent results of the REVERSE-IT study published earlier in the year  Valbiotis is embarking on a new phase in its development  focused on generating revenues and based on the following three strategic priorities: Preparing to market TOTUM•63 alongside Nestlé Health Science;Launching direct marketing of other products in France  including TOTUM•070 from the 1 st half of 2024;Finalizing the signature of new global or regional licensing and/or distribution agreements with major players in nutrition and health  in addition to the global strategic partnership already signed for TOTUM•63 in February 2020 with Nestlé Health Science  bearing in mind that discussions are underway with over 60 identified prospects  while continuing its research efforts to prepare tomorrow's pipeline and complete clinical processes enabling proprietary health claims to be obtained for the majority of them  without this “label” constituting a prerequisite for marketing the products concerned. The Company is entering a new deployment phase with the start of commercialization  which  in view of the Company's expectations  requires additional financing. The net proceeds of the issue will be around €13.0M. The Company intends to use the net proceeds to finance: At 45% of net proceeds  working capital requirements   mainly a result of the need to build up inventories of raw materials to be supplied by Valbiotis to Nestlé Health Science under the supply contract  with a 1 st order expected in the 1 st half of 2024  and subsequently under future agreements relating to other products  as well as the financing of trade receivables. At 35% of net proceeds  sales and marketing activities in France (excluding TOTUM•63)  including: Finalizing the Company's structure with a view to starting direct marketing in France. This strategic development involves: The need to finalize the build up of sales and marketing teams to over 40 employees by 2026  with a gradual operational ramp-up;The enhancement of IT tools  with the implementation of a CRM  an e-commerce site  the integration of a sales module into the ERP and  finally  the interfacing of the various tools with those of the Company's logistics partner;Continued securing of the supply chain; Financing working capital requirements linked to the build-up of raw materials and finished goods inventories; and finally At 20% of net proceeds  the completion of a number of clinical trials not financed by partnerships (including the Phase II/III HEART 2 trial for TOTUM•070)  for an amount that is rather insignificant compared with the amounts devoted to this subject by the Company since its creation. Should the Offer be limited to the commitments received  i.e.  net proceeds of €12.0M  the relative share of funds allocated to each objective would remain unchanged and be reduced proportionately. After taking into account 100% of the net proceeds of the Offer  i.e.  €13.0M  and taking into account the anticipated ramp-up in activity  the Company considers that it will be able to finance its own growth in the future within the current scope of its activities  without ruling out recourse to bank financing should the need arise.A dedicated website has been created for the occasion: https://investir.valbiotis.com/and a toll-free number is available to call free of charge: 0 805 651 652Terms of the proposed issue of new shares Nature of the Operation and Legal Framework The fundraising proposed by Valbiotis concerns a share increase through the issue of new shares with cancellation of preferential subscription rights (DPS) but with a priority subscription period decided by the Company's Board (Directoire) acting on a delegation of authority from the General Meeting of May 5  2022 (11th resolution).

In practice  each shareholder will be able to place an irreducible priority subscription order for a maximum number of Initial New Shares corresponding to (i) 3 363 229 multiplied by (ii) the number of shares they hold in the Company  divided by (iii) 12 425 378. By way of example  a shareholder with 100 shares in the Company may place a priority irreducible subscription order for a maximum number of shares equal to: 3 363 229 x 100 / 12 425 378 = 27 New Shares. The number of New Shares allotted will be equal to the amount of each shareholder's priority subscription order within the priority period divided by the Subscription Price  rounded down to the nearest whole number. Any shareholder entitled to subscribe for less than one New Share under this rule will be entitled to subscribe for one New Share. This priority period is neither transferable nor negotiable  and will only benefit shareholders of the Company on record on December 12  2023.

Asset management: ambition to reach 150 million euros in FRE 2 by 2027 in third-party private asset management. Wendel plans to reach this level through double-digit organic growth of its activities  supplemented by external growth in new asset classes. Permanent capital : Objective of generating a double-digit IRR on the existing portfolio Portfolio rotation: redeployment of capital in assets generating a c. 15% IRR 3 .Further increase in return to shareholder targets: redistribution to shareholders  in the form of recurring and predictable dividends  of the bulk of cash flows generated by asset management and of around 20% of expected performance on permanent capital and sponsor money. Increase in dividend target to 2.5% of NAV 4 from 2024  with the aim of reaching 3.5% of NAV in the medium term  with the development of asset management. The objective to maintain at least a constant dividend from one year to another remains unchanged.

Our business model is built around two value-creating levers: on the one hand  permanent capital investment  and on the other  our new private asset management business developed by talented teams. These two activities  coupled with disciplined cost management  give us confidence in our ability to offer our shareholders growing and recurring dividends. We will therefore be redistributing most of the cash flow generated by our asset management business and around 20% of the value creation expected from our investments in permanent capital and sponsor money.This new redistribution policy will take effect as early as 2024  when we will propose to the next Annual General Meeting a dividend increase of c. 20%  i.e. around 2.5% of NAV as of December 31  2023  with the aim of returning around 3.5% of NAV (N-1) to shareholders over the medium term.

Sanofi is disappointed with the Federal...,Statement on FTC challenge to proposed license agreement with Maze TherapeuticsParis  December 11  2023. Sanofi is disappointed with the Federal Trade Commission’s announcement that it is seeking a preliminary injunction against a proposed licensing agreement between Sanofi and Maze Therapeutics. The agreement  announced on May 1  2023  is for MZE001  a glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) inhibitor program that has completed Phase 1 and is in development for Pompe Disease  a rare  inherited and often fatal disorder that disables the heart and skeletal muscles.We respectfully disagree with the action by the FTC which also delays potential advancements that could impact the lives of patients. The Maze partnership was designed to apply Sanofi’s resources  knowledge  and expertise to accelerate the development of MZE001  with the hope of addressing unmet medical needs for this devastating condition. The delay associated with a long litigation has led Sanofi to conclude that it would not be in the best interests of patients to contest this litigation and Sanofi will therefore be terminating the agreement with Maze in accordance with its terms. Sanofi remains committed to address the Pompe patient community’s unmet needs.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The actions deployed by the Group to cushion the inflationary effects and control operating expenses are proving effective resulting in an improvement of all economic indicators.Total sales for the period stand at €26.6 million  close to the level recorded in S2 2022-2023  but down -11.6% (-9.5% at constant exchange rates) on S1 2022-2023  a period that benefitted from a strong upturn in order intake following the pandemic.Printing activity recorded total sales for the period of €18.9 million  down -5.5% (-3.1% at constant exchange rates) on S1 2022-2023. With an economic downturn resulting in a drop in demand on most of its markets  the Communications activity (down only -1.6% at constant exchange rates) is proving more resilient than the Home Decor activity that continues to be penalised by reduced order volumes.Hardware activity stands at €7.8 million  down -23.6% (-21.9% at constant exchange rates) on the record S1 2022-2023 figures. This is  however  the 2nd best performance for a first six-month period in the past five years thanks in part to a buoyant LED activity in France and the delivery of orders to Italy and South America.Gross margin rate is up 5.8% at 48.9%. This represents a more normative level for both divisions. Prismaflex International benefits from the readjustment of its business policy to counter the impact of inflation on material and energy costs.The improved gross margin rate and careful control of operating expenses means current EBITDA are up +64% at €2.3 million  or 8.6% of total sales revenue.After net depreciation expenses and provisions  current operating profit is positive at €1.0 million  three times higher than in S1 2022-2023.Operating profit stands at €1.1 million  including noncurrent income for €0.1 million.Current earnings before tax stands at €0.9 million  including financial interest on debt of€0.2 million  up slightly due to the higher rates.A net result of €0.7 million confirms the resilience of the Group's activity.Financial situation: debt pay-off underway30.09.23 31.03.23 Equity shareholders (including minority shareholders) 9.2 8.5 Net debt 11.3 12.5 Gearing 123% 147% Net debt (before IFRS 16) 9.4 10.4 Gearing (before IFRS 16) 102% 122%Cash flow generated by the activity stands at €2.1 million  and includes a self-financing capacity of €2.2 million (before interest and tax) and a stable working capital.Production-related investments came to €0.7 million for the period  notably for printing equipment for the Printing activity in Canada and the United Kingdom. Free cash-flow for the period stands at +€1.4 million.Net debt  including €1.9 million IFRS 16-related debt release  is at €11.3 million (€9.4 million before hors IFRS 16). Gearing is therefore at 1.23 (1.02 before IFRS 16). Cash available is up €0.6 million on March 31 2023 at €3.1 million.Outlook 2023-2024Order backlog on September 30  2023 stands at €8.2 million  with €4.2 million for Printing and €4.0 million for Hardware and reflects the uncertainty of the current economic situation and resulting wait-and-see attitude adopted by contractors.The Printing division continues to benefit from the resilience of the Communications activity in every country the Group operates in and shall continue to diversify its activity to counter the consequences of the drop in orders for Home Decor.The Hardware division  hit by the economic slowdown and longer decision-making processes  will count on its innovations and industrial capacity to meet the demand of leading advertising specialists and also the retail sector. The Group is well placed for major projects in France and abroad with potential deliveries in 2024.In such a context  Prismaflex International aims to achieve total sales in S2 on a par with those reached in S1 and a fourth quarter that is more dynamic than Q3  notably for Hardware. At the same time  the Group will continue prioritising improving current operating profitability and a positive free cash-flow.Forthcoming datesHalf-year results presentation videoconference  on December 12  2023 at 10amPress releaseQ3 2023-2024 results  January 23  2024 after closure.PRISMAFLEX INTERNATIONALOUTDOOR ADVERTISING SOLUTIONS MANUFACTURER AND WIDE FORMAT DIGITAL PRINTINGISIN : FR0004044600-ALPRI - Reuters : ALPRI.PA – Bloomberg : ALPRI.FPEURONEXT GROWTHTMwww.prismaflex.comContacts :Florence Thérond – CFO - Phone: +33 (0)4 74 70 68 00 – finance@prismaflex.comGuillaume Le Floch – Analysts/investors contacts – Phone: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 70 - glefloch@actus.frMarie-Claude Triquet – Press relations - Phone: +33 (0)6 84 83 21 82 – mctriquet@actus.frThis publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: m5pyYshvaW3ImGubkstoa2eVZpiVl2XKbpTHmmltlcmWm3Bmm5loa8iXZnFkl25o- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Inside Information:- News release on accounts  results Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/83292-pri-111223-rs-23-24-gb.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2023 ActusNews",neutral,0.28,0.71,0.02,mixed,0.38,0.27,0.35,True,English,"['2023-2024 half-year results', 'Prismaflex International', 'Significant improvement', 'net debt', 'Return', 'profitability', 'Reduction', 'Official PRISMAFLEX INTERNATIONAL press release', 'Positive €1.4 million free cash flow', 'other net calculated charges', '2023-2024 six-month consolidated accounts', 'record S1 2022-2023 figures', 'IFRS 16-related debt release', 'Prismaflex International Board', '2nd best performance', 'past five years', 'stable working capital', 'Positive net result', 'constant exchange rates', 'Gross margin rate', 'Net consolidated result', 'The Printing division', 'The Hardware division', 'buoyant LED activity', 'Current EBITDA rate', 'net depreciation expenses', 'S1 2023-2024 results', 'six-month period analysis', 'first six-month period', 'Current operating profit', 'total sales revenue', 'current economic situation', 'Home Decor activity', 'Six-month results', 'Free cash-flow', 'higher rates', 'operating expenses', 'net debt', 'Current EBITDA1', 'Financial situation', 'Financial result', 'economic downturn', 'economic indicators', 'economic slowdown', 'Current earnings', 'debt pay-off', 'high basis', 'inflationary effects', 'Order backlog', 'limited review', 'strong upturn', 'order intake', 'order volumes', 'South America', 'business policy', 'energy costs', 'careful control', 'noncurrent income', 'financial interest', 'minority shareholders', 'before interest', 'Production-related investments', 'printing equipment', 'United Kingdom', 'longer d', 'Printing activity', 'Communications activity', 'Hardware activity', '6 months Var', 'normative level', 'Equity shareholders', 'self-financing capacity', 'comparison', 'levels', 'S2', 'Group', 'possibility', 'September', '30/09', 'auditors', 'December', 'tax', 'affiliates', 'provisions', 'products', 'actions', 'improvement', 'pandemic', 'drop', 'demand', 'markets', 'part', 'France', 'delivery', 'orders', 'Italy', 'divisions', 'readjustment', 'impact', 'material', 'resilience', 'Canada', 'Gearing', 'March', 'Outlook', 'uncertainty', 'attitude', 'contractors', 'country', 'consequences', '3.5', '48']",2023-12-11,2023-12-12,marketscreener.com

This makes it difficult to determine the impact of treatment.In this specific trial  the Overall Neuropathy Limitation Scale (ONLS)  which measures functional motor disability  did not confirm findings from our previous clinical trial. Patients with mild-to-moderate CMT1A experienced improvement on both treatment and placebo  rather than the slow deterioration typical of CMT1A's natural progression. This unexpected improvement in the placebo group complicates the interpretation of the results based on this endpoint. It also confirms what the medical literature as a whole has been saying for many years  namely that ONLS is undoubtedly a relevant endpoint over the long term  but not over such a short period of time as a clinical study.In the meantime  other data from the trial suggest no deterioration in the condition of patients under treatment  which is a positive sign in the context of a degenerative disease such as CMT1A. This suggests that PXT3003 might stabilize the condition of patients  which is an important consideration for a disease where progression is generally inevitable.Moreover  the trial reaffirmed the high safety profile of the treatment  already established in previous studies. This safety profile is crucial for treatments of chronic diseases such as CMT1A.Considering these initial results  Pharnext plans to continue analyzing the data  particularly in collaboration with potential partners for licensing or acquisition of PXT3003. This analysis will help determine the next steps toward potential marketing authorization.Pharnext aims to leverage the clinical data accumulated on PXT3003 over the past decade  as well as the upcoming results from the Phase III trial currently conducted in China by its partner Tasly  who acquired the licensing rights for PXT3003 in China in 2017.These efforts are part of Pharnext's strategic analysis to provide a medical solution for patients with CMT1A  who currently lack approved treatments. This situation illustrates the challenges of drug development for rare and complex diseases  where traditional clinical trial criteria may not fully capture the potential benefits of a treatment. It also highlights the importance accumulating long-term data and the need for innovative approaches in designing clinical trials for such conditions.Hugo Brugière  Manager of Pharnext  said: “Although the results we are sharing today are not exactly what we had hoped for  they are nonetheless very promising. We are now going to make the most of all the data we have accumulated over the last ten years  including our 2 Phase III studies and our 6-year extension study  which tend to demonstrate a beneficial effect on patients.I remind that  today  PXT3003 is the only ray of hope for all CMT1A patients  and that no other drug candidate is currently in an advanced stage. It seems to me  therefore  that efficacy results for a risk-free drug could support an application for regulatory approval and market authorization. This is for us the final stage  which we will move forward with patient community”.For information  Pharnext will hold a live conference this Monday  December 11  2023  at 2:00 pm CET  in French.

In the specific case of the trust  the shares are sold on the market in accordance with the terms set out in the trust agreement.Shareholders may suffer a loss of their invested capital due to a significant fall in the Company's share price  as well as significant dilution due to the large number of securities issued to Global Tech Opportunities 13 and/or the trust.Investors are advised to exercise extreme caution before deciding to invest in the securities of a listed company that carries out such dilutive financing transactions  particularly when they are carried out in succession.

Increase in dividend target to 2.5% of NAV 4 from 2024  with the aim of reaching 3.5% of NAV in the medium term  with the development of asset management. The objective to maintain at least a constant dividend from one year to another remains unchanged.

Our business model is built around two value-creating levers: on the one hand  permanent capital investment  and on the other  our new private asset management business developed by talented teams. These two activities  coupled with disciplined cost management  give us confidence in our ability to offer our shareholders growing and recurring dividends. We will therefore be redistributing most of the cash flow generated by our asset management business and around 20% of the value creation expected from our investments in permanent capital and sponsor money.This new redistribution policy will take effect as early as 2024  when we will propose to the next Annual General Meeting a dividend increase of c. 20%  i.e. around 2.5% of NAV as of December 31  2023  with the aim of returning around 3.5% of NAV (N-1) to shareholders over the medium term.

The Phase 3 trial investigating Sarclisa® (isatuximab) in combination with carfilzomib  lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) showed a statistically significant improvement in the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity  compared with KRd alone  after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) consolidation in transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). These results from the IsKia trial conducted by the European Myeloma Network (EMN) were presented during the oral plenary session (#4) at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting by Francesca Gay  Associate Professor at the University Division of Hematology  AOU Città della Salute e della Scienza di Torino  University of Torino and Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences - member of the Young EMN board of directors.MRD negativity is defined as the absence of myeloma cells in the bone marrow after treatment  as measured by diagnostic techniques that must have a sensitivity of at least 1 in 100 000 cells. In this trial  MRD negativity was detected with a sensitivity of 10-5 (no cancer cells detected within 100 000 bone marrow cells) and 10-6 (no cancer cells detected within 1 000 000 bone marrow cells).In an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis  the primary endpoint of rate of MRD negativity using next generation sequencing with a sensitivity of 10-5 after consolidation for patients receiving Sarclisa combination therapy (n=151) was 77% versus 67% for those who received KRd alone (n=151) (odds ratio [OR] 1.67; p=0.049). The respective rates of MRD negativity at sensitivity of 10-6 were 67% versus 48% (OR 1.93; p=0.006). The MRD negativity benefit  both at 10-5 and 10-6 sensitivities  was retained in all subgroups analyzed with similar benefit in both standard-risk and high-risk patients.There was a statistically significant difference in MRD negativity rates after induction with Sarclisa in combination with KRd versus KRd (10-5: 45% versus 26%  p<0.001; 10-6: 27% versus 14%  p=0.004).The safety and tolerability of Sarclisa observed in this trial were consistent with the observed safety profile of Sarclisa in other clinical trials  with no new safety signals observed. Rates of grade 3 or higher hematologic adverse events (AEs) were 40% versus 30% and rates of non-hematologic AEs were 41% versus 37% for the Sarclisa combination versus KRd  respectively. Discontinuation rates for AEs were similar in both study arms (7% and 5%  respectively). There were three treatment-related deaths in the Sarclisa combination arm and one in the KRd arm.Peter C. AdamsonGlobal Development Head  Oncology  Sanofi“The statistically significant rates of MRD negativity observed with Sarclisa combination therapy further support our belief in Sarclisa as a potential best-in-class therapy. Effective front-line treatment is critical for newly diagnosed patients  because achieving undetectable levels of disease early in the treatment journey may lead to better long-term outcomes. We look forward to our continued collaboration with the EMN to explore the potential of this novel combination regimen for those with transplant-eligible  newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.”The use of Sarclisa in combination with KRd in this patient population is investigational and has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the trialThe randomized  open-label Phase 3 IsKia trial enrolled 302 patients with newly diagnosed  transplant-eligible MM across eight countries and 42 sites in Europe. Patients were randomized into two arms. Patients in both arms received induction with four 28-day cycles of KRd followed by cyclophosphamide and stem cell collections  chemotherapy with Melphalan 200 mg/m2 followed by ASCT (Mel200-ASCT)  four 28-day cycles of KRd post ASCT consolidation and 12 cycles of KRd light consolidation. Sarclisa was added to KRd in one trial arm only. During the trial  Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg once weekly for the first four weeks of cycle one  then every other week for the rest of the induction and full consolidation periods  then every four weeks during light consolidation period.The primary endpoint was the rate of MRD negativity by next-generation sequencing (10-5) after consolidation in the ITT population. MRD was tested in all patients who achieved at least a very good partial response. Key secondary endpoints were the rate of next-generation sequencing MRD negativity (10-5) after induction and progression free survival. MRD rates were evaluated in an ITT analysis.High-risk patient cytogenetics per the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria were defined as the presence of t(4;14)  t(14;16)  or del(17p). High-risk cytogenetic abnormality (HRCA) was defined as the presence of one of the following abnormalities: del(17p13.1)  t(4;14) (p16.3;q32.3)  t(14;16) (q32.3;q23)  gain(1q21)  or amp(1q21). Two or more HRCAs was defined as the presence of at least two high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities.About SarclisaSarclisa is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on multiple myeloma (MM) cells  inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activities. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells  making it a potential target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa.Based on the Phase 3 ICARIA-MM study  Sarclisa is approved in >50 countries  including the U.S. and EU  in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of certain patients with relapsed refractory MM (RRMM) who have received ≥2 prior therapies  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and who progressed on last therapy. Based on the Phase 3 IKEMA study  Sarclisa is also approved in 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone  including in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with RRMM who have received 1–3 prior lines of therapy and in the European Union for patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. In the U.S.  the generic name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc  with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The IsKia trial marks the second positive Phase 3 trial of Sarclisa in transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma  and fifth positive Phase 3 readout for Sarclisa overall  demonstrating its best-in-class potential.Sarclisa continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with current standard treatments across the MM treatment continuum. It is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indication.For more information on Sarclisa clinical trials  please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.About multiple myelomaMM is the second most common hematologic malignancy.1 Since MM does not have a cure  most patients will relapse. Relapsed MM is the term for when the cancer returns after treatment or a period of remission. Refractory MM refers to when the cancer does not respond or no longer responds to therapy.About the European Myeloma Network (EMN) foundationThe European Myeloma Network (EMN) is a non-profit organization  created in 2005. This network is the reference organization for multiple myeloma studies in Europe: physicians can participate in cooperative projects to increase and share their experiences  and to standardize and harmonize clinical practices; pharmaceutical companies can refer to the EMN as a general interlocutor in Europe to plan and manage clinical trials with new molecules; and  most importantly  patients can be enrolled in clinical studies evaluating last-generation and promising drugs  with the ultimate goal of improving their survival and quality of life. Various national groups collaborate within the EMN  such as the Netherlands (where the headquarter is located)  Italy (with the data centre of the network)  Germany  Austria  France  Spain  Greece  Czech Republic  the UK  Norway  Denmark  Switzerland  Turkey  and many more countries will participate in the EMN projects in the future.
