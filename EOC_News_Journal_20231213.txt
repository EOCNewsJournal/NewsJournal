The plan includes several steps  such as identifying assets to which the measure can be applied  deducting expenses and national taxes  and accounting for the resulting profits in accordance with statutory capital and risk management requirements  the media outlet said. After that  the profits can be transferred to the EU budget  it added. The plan also includes measures to protect financial institutions holding the assets from legal risks and Russia's potential countermeasures  the report said. On Monday  European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said the commission was preparing to adopt a proposal to immobilize revenues from assets of the Russian Central Bank at a meeting on December 12. Most of the frozen Russian assets are held at the Belgium-based Euroclear central securities depository  with profits generated from them since the time they were sanctioned amounting to almost 3 billion euros  Bloomberg said in late November. Belgium reportedly said that it would invest 1.7 billion euros in the reconstruction of Ukraine next year. After the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine on February 24  2022  Western countries imposed comprehensive sanctions against Moscow  including freezing Russian assets worth approximately 300 billion euros. The EU has been discussing a legal framework that would allow for the confiscation of assets of Russian citizens and entities accused of violating EU sanctions. Russia argues that any attempt by the EU to confiscate frozen assets would violate international law. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Sputnik that Russia would do everything necessary to reclaim its assets.https://sputnikglobe.com/20231129/using-frozen-russian-assets-to-fund-ukraine-threatens-euros-reputation---ecb-1115278704.htmlrussiaSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 602023Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalanti-russian sanctions  russian assets frozen  eu sanctions russia,neutral,0.02,0.92,0.06,negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'Taxable Profit', '4 Years', 'Reports', 'Belgium-based Euroclear central securities depository', 'Russian central bank assets', 'risk management requirements', 'world european union', 'next four years', 'The European Commission', 'European Commission spokesman', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'Russian citizens', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'frozen assets', '15 billion euros', 'windfall tax', 'several steps', 'national taxes', 'statutory capital', 'media outlet', 'financial institutions', 'legal risks', 'potential countermeasures', 'Eric Mamer', '3 billion euros', 'late November', '1.7 billion euros', 'military operation', 'Western countries', 'comprehensive sanctions', '300 billion euros', 'legal framework', 'international law', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'Rosiya Segodnya', 'anti-russian sanctions', 'assets tax', 'Sputnik International', 'EU budget', 'EU sanctions', 'future reconstruction', 'Taxable Profit', 'resulting profits', 'new plan', '4 Years', 'sputnikglobe', 'frozen-russian-assets', 'bln', 'Reports', 'meta', 'description', 'cdn', 'day', 'funds', 'Ukraine', 'expenses', 'accordance', 'proposal', 'revenues', 'meeting', 'December', 'time', 'Bloomberg', 'start', 'February', 'Moscow', 'confiscation', 'entities', 'attempt', 'everything', 'reputation', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2023-12-12,2023-12-13,sputnikglobe.com
33795,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/eu-commission-tables-first-step-on-tapping-into-frozen-russian-funds-for-ukraine/,EU Commission tables first step on tapping into frozen Russian funds for Ukraine,The European Commission proposed on Tuesday (12 December) blocking all profits from the sanctioned Russian sovereign assets in the EU into separate accounts  in the first step towards making use of them to finance Ukraine's reconstruction.,The European Commission proposed on Tuesday (12 December) blocking all profits from the sanctioned Russian sovereign assets in the EU into separate accounts  in the first step towards making use of them to finance Ukraine’s reconstruction.The Commission is putting forward a “proposal on the immobilisation of extraordinary revenues  so-called ‘windfall revenues’  of the Russian Central Bank’s assets”  announced Vera Jourova  the vice-president of the EU executive.The Commission recommends that financial institutions put all profits stemming from the Russian Central Bank’s assets on separate accounts once the decision is adopted.This would mean to “immobilise the net profits and secure them so it can be used in the future”  one EU official said speaking on condition of anonymity.The step comes after EU countries urged the Commission to look into legal ways of using the stream of revenues from the Russian central bank’s money immobilised in the bloc to help rebuild Ukraine following Russia’s attack on the country.The European Commission estimates there is around €200 billion of the Russian Central Bank reserves frozen in the EU.The draft proposal  which is not public and has been sent directly to national capitals  however  falls short of proposing ways to do so. The member states will later take a decision in this regard  based on a future proposal by the executive.“Because it is unprecedented  each step needs to be carefully assessed and discussed. We think it is appropriate to step of separate registration assets  and it paves the way for the next steps ” the EU official said.As this has never been done before  EU experts  lawyers  and economists  including the European Central Bank  have called for caution in doing so.More hawkish Eastern and Central European member states have pushed for the move  while some countries such as Belgium  Estonia  and the Czech Republic have already started looking into how to use freezes within a national context.The EU’s proposal “will focus prudently on the windfall profits from the immobilised assets of the Russian Central Bank ” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had said after the meeting of leaders in July  but expressed caution.EU leaders are expected to review the Commission’s proposal at a summit on Thursday (14 December).They should “reiterate call for decisive progress  […] on how extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from Russia’s immobilised assets could be directed to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction”  according to draft conclusions seen by Euractiv.More than €100 billion of frozen Russian assets are stuck in the Belgium-based Euroclear and have generated around €3 billion according to the clearing house’s data since the beginning of Russia’s war on Ukraine.“There is good reason to consider that these revenues should be used to help the reconstruction and recovery of Ukraine  that is the long-term objective ” the EU official said.“The short-term objective is to make sure this is possible ” the official added  presenting two strands of work.“First  forcing the central security deposits (CSDs) to manage and register separately those revenues so they can be identified in the accounting system  and secondly  these net profits from today would be prohibited to redistribution to shareholders and third parties  so they have to stay in CSDs.”That way  the Russian Central Bank’s money will not be touched by the future steps  only the profits.Those can be used for Ukraine since they are “exceptional” and “only exist because of the immobilisation. It is a direct consequence [of the sanctions] ” the official said.The European Commission did not give any estimation as to how much cash could be generated from the move  which is also supported by the world’s biggest economies.The G7 will explore how “extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from immobilised Russian sovereign assets” could be used to support Ukraine’s reconstruction  the group said in a statement in October.The proposal also comes at a point in time as the EU leaders meet in Brussels later this week to discuss how to fund the next years in the EU’s future budget.Using revenues from Russian frozen assets has been raised as an idea  and is included in the latest framework proposal for the EU summit sent by the European Council President Charles Michel on Tuesday (12 December)  and seen by Euractiv  even though it has now been criticised by a majority of member states.[Edited by Alexandra Brzozowski/Zoran Radosavljevic]Read more with Euractiv,neutral,0.06,0.62,0.32,negative,0.04,0.29,0.68,True,English,"['EU Commission tables', 'frozen Russian funds', 'first step', 'Ukraine', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'European Council President Charles Michel', 'Russian Central Bank reserves', 'Central European member states', 'European Central Bank', 'The European Commission', 'central security deposits', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'Russian frozen assets', 'latest framework proposal', 'separate registration assets', 'one EU official', 'The Commission', 'Russian assets', 'The G7', 'separate accounts', 'Vera Jourova', 'financial institutions', 'national capitals', 'next steps', 'hawkish Eastern', 'Czech Republic', 'national context', 'decisive progress', 'private entities', 'draft conclusions', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'clearing house', 'good reason', 'long-term objective', 'short-term objective', 'two strands', 'accounting system', 'third parties', 'direct consequence', 'biggest economies', 'next years', 'Alexandra Brzozowski', 'Zoran Radosavljevic', 'EU experts', 'future steps', 'future budget', 'draft proposal', 'extraordinary revenues', 'windfall revenues', 'net profits', 'legal ways', 'windfall profits', 'EU leaders', 'first step', 'future proposal', 'EU executive', 'EU countries', 'EU summit', 'Tuesday', 'December', 'Ukraine', 'reconstruction', 'immobilisation', 'vice-president', 'decision', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'stream', 'money', 'bloc', 'attack', 'country', 'regard', 'lawyers', 'economists', 'caution', 'More', 'move', 'Estonia', 'freezes', 'meeting', 'July', 'Thursday', 'call', 'recovery', 'Euractiv', 'data', 'beginning', 'war', 'CSDs', 'today', 'shareholders', 'sanctions', 'estimation', 'cash', 'world', 'group', 'statement', 'October', 'point', 'time', 'Brussels', 'idea', 'majority']",2023-12-12,2023-12-13,euractiv.com

The EU wants to target those revenues  said an EU official who was granted anonymity as they were not allowed to speak on the record.The Commission's initial proposal would force the proceeds of invested assets to be deposited in a separate account of the clearinghouse ― financial institutions that facilitate transactions ― where they are held.Once that is agreed  the EU executive would have to put forward a second proposal to trigger the transfer of cash to the EU budget and then to Ukraine.Interest ratesThe European Central Bank has expressed concerns about the plan to use the proceeds of frozen assets  warning that it could cause instability in the euro currency. Going after the revenues is seen as a legally safer option than a full-scale handover of assets.“The active discussion is around the interest rates … from a legal standpoint the interest rate does not belong to Russia ” Vladyslav Vlasyuk  an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  told POLITICO. ""So these are not sovereign funds  strictly speaking ” He estimated that this move would generate around €3 billion per year.Russian foreign reserves were frozen by countries participating in sanctions at the onset of Moscow’s war on Ukraine and the majority sit in the EU. The Commission's proposal would target €180 billion worth of frozen assets that are with Belgium’s Euroclear  a clearinghouse acting as a custodian for Russian reserves.Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen stressed that the proceeds from Russian frozen funds should finance the long-term reconstruction of Ukraine  which is estimated at $411 billion by the World Bank.The EU's proposed wider Ukraine fund has been designed to provide €33 billion of loans and €17 billion of grants to Ukraine until 2027  but is currently blocked by Hungary.",neutral,0.03,0.76,0.21,negative,0.02,0.18,0.8,True,English,"['Russian frozen assets', 'first step', 'EU', 'money', 'Ukraine', 'Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'The European Central Bank', 'The European Commission', 'Russian foreign reserves', 'Russian frozen funds', 'wider Ukraine fund', 'The Commission', 'World Bank', 'Russian reserves', 'wider discussion', 'dedicated fund', 'sovereign funds', 'Russian securities', 'Vladimir Putin', 'first step', 'war-torn country', 'financial intermediaries', 'separate account', 'financial institutions', 'Interest rates', 'euro currency', 'safer option', 'full-scale handover', 'active discussion', 'legal standpoint', 'Vladyslav Vlasyuk', '€180 billion worth', 'long-term reconstruction', 'Russian assets', 'frozen assets', 'EU officials', 'EU leaders', 'EU executive', 'EU budget', 'initial proposal', 'second proposal', 'EU countries', 'ways', 'earnings', 'invasion', 'iStock', 'BRUSSELS', 'plan', 'Tuesday', 'proceeds', 'process', 'money', 'issue', 'summit', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'months', 'February', 'maturity', 'profit', 'revenues', 'anonymity', 'record', 'clearinghouse', 'transactions', 'transfer', 'cash', 'concerns', 'instability', 'adviser', 'POLITICO', 'move', 'year', 'sanctions', 'onset', 'Moscow', 'majority', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'custodian', 'loans', 'grants', 'Hungary']",2023-12-12,2023-12-13,politico.eu

It is to be construed strictly "" he said.Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan dismissed Illumina's arguments.""Ilumina and Grail's arguments are... essentially a policy manifesto about what they think should be the jurisdictional limits of EU merger control "" he said.""Illumina's arguments are simply a demand to rewrite the merger regulations.""If it loses its appeal  Illumina  which closed the deal prior to the EU veto  has said it will divest Grail within a year.The Commission is set to review U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm's bid for Israeli auto-chip maker Autotalks and the Deutsche Boerse-owned European Energy Exchange's (EEX) acquisition of Nasdaq's European power trading and clearing business using its Article 22 power.The cases are C-611/22 P and C-625/22 P Grail v Commission and Illumina.

33801,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dboey-vs-otcm-stock-better-164010419.html,DBOEY vs. OTCM: Which Stock Is the Better Value Option?,Another notable valuation metric for DBOEY is its P/B ratio of 3.89. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison  OTCM has a P/B of 15.13.,Investors interested in Securities and Exchanges stocks are likely familiar with Deutsche Boerse AG (DBOEY) and OTC Markets Group Inc. (OTCM). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently  Deutsche Boerse AG has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy)  while OTC Markets Group Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that DBOEY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P/E ratio  P/S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.DBOEY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 19.57  while OTCM has a forward P/E of 23.44.

In 2022  NREL found that with modest government support  recycled materials from the solar energy sector can meet at least 25-30% of domestic solar manufacturing needs in the United States by 2040. For the U.S. renewables industry to scale to its full potential  EDPR NA is supporting the advancement of U.S. renewable energy supply chains tied to a vibrant secondary market for recycled materials through the establishment of specific ESG targets.“As an innovative solar recycling company with industry-leading technology that can recycle and recover over 95% of the valuable material from a solar panel  we are thrilled that EDP Renewables North America has chosen SOLARCYCLE as a top  trusted partner for its new Close the Loop Program ” said Suvi Sharma  CEO and Co-Founder of SOLARCYCLE. “With this new partnership  EDP is not only demonstrating its leadership on sustainability  but also joining us in our mission to build a more circular industry that strengthens the solar supply chain.”Globally  EDP Renewables has set a target of 85% waste recovery by 2026 covering total waste during the construction  operational  and dismantling phases of its projects’ lifecycle  with an ambition to take that figure to 90% total waste recovered by 2030. This move comes as EDP Renewables aims to aid in global decarbonization goals laid out at COP28 through the deployment of more than 4 GW of new renewable energy assets per year  reaching 17 GW of gross additions by 2026.“We’re excited to be ending the year focusing on tackling one of the key challenges our industry has had to date – namely the sustainability practices associated with recycling of materials during and post-construction of renewables projects ” stated Sandhya Ganapathy  CEO of EDP Renewables North America. “We have the opportunity to support and spotlight innovation and entrepreneurship through EDPR NA’s Close the Loop Program and look forward to delivering cutting-edge renewables projects that come with a full zero-waste circular economy in mind for hundreds of our customers nationwide.”In addition to working with SOLARCYCLE  EDPR NA will be collaborating across the solar  wind  and storage sectors with several recycling leaders including ALAMO1  Eco Environmental  ERI  Everpoint Services  FabTech Solar Solutions  Green Century Recycling  Green Clean Solar  Logisticus Group  Ontility – powered by TerrePower  Powerhouse Recycling (dba Solarpanelrecycling.com)  ReElement Technologies  TPI Composites  Vestas  We Recycle Solar  Wind Power Solutions  and WindWorx Renewable Services.Echo Environmental  ERI  FabTech  SOLARYCYCLE and We Recycle Solar have recycling facilities that have been endorsed by the Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA’s) National PV Recycling Program. All Close the Loop solar-related participants are ISO 14001 compliant  which is a set of standards created to help companies around the world reduce their adverse impact on the environment. This standard in addition provides a framework for improved and more environmentally conscious quality management systems. Many of the participants are also ISO 9001 and ISO 45001 compliant  which ensures the protection of local communities  workers  and the environment. Lastly  several program partners are in the process of becoming R2 (Responsible Recycling Certification for PV Solar) compliant  tied to establishing responsible recycling practices for the recycling of electronics globally.Through this collaboration  Close the Loop will aim to provide EDPR NA’s customers with a suite of tailored services to ensure materials are properly recycled following stringent environmental standards  accompanied by advanced and transparent environmental reporting showcasing net environmental benefits.Janette Freeman  Director of Business Development at Fabtech Solar Solutions added  “We’re looking forward to our continued collaboration with EDP Renewables North America on the launch of their Close the Loop Program in supporting a truly circular economy focused on recycling. As an innovative leader in the sector  we’re proud of their strides in the North American market and in their pushing the envelope to ensure high sustainability measures extend beyond construction to include the full project lifecycle of their solar  wind  and storage projects.”The launch of the Close the Loop Program continues EDPR NA's leadership in the market for its innovative approach to sustainability  having been recognized through several ESG and climate-related awards in 2023 including CohnReznick’s ESG Gamechangers Award and the GRIT ESG & Climate Champion Award by Ally Energy. In addition  the EDP Group was awarded Environmental Finance’s 2023 Company Award for “Circular Economy Transition of the Year – Global” and most recently was lauded as “the most sustainable electric utility in the world” with the highest score in the world amongst electric utilities as part of S&P’s Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA).Multimedia resources include:EDPR NA: Fact SheetAbout EDPR NA: VideoSustainability at the EDP Group: WebpageAbout EDP Renewables North America (EDPR NA)EDP Renewables North America LLC (EDPR NA)  its affiliates  and its subsidiaries develop  construct  own  and operate wind farms  solar parks  and energy storage systems throughout North America.

The announcement comes on the heels of EDPR NA’s partnership with SOLARCYCLE  an advanced technology-based solar recycling company  alongside continuing work with 18 additional leaders in the recycling services sector throughout North America.The move builds on EDPR NA’s continued innovative approach to “future-proofing” its asset operations and ensuring the company’s sustainability practices span from development to the culminating production of clean electrons. In 2022  NREL found that with modest government support  recycled materials from the solar energy sector can meet at least 25-30% of domestic solar manufacturing needs in the United States by 2040. For the U.S. renewables industry to scale to its full potential  EDPR NA is supporting the advancement of U.S. renewable energy supply chains tied to a vibrant secondary market for recycled materials through the establishment of specific ESG targets.“As an innovative solar recycling company with industry-leading technology that can recycle and recover over 95% of the valuable material from a solar panel  we are thrilled that EDP Renewables North America has chosen SOLARCYCLE as a top  trusted partner for its new Close the Loop Program ” said Suvi Sharma  CEO and Co-Founder of SOLARCYCLE. “With this new partnership  EDP is not only demonstrating its leadership on sustainability  but also joining us in our mission to build a more circular industry that strengthens the solar supply chain.”Globally  EDP Renewables has set a target of 85% waste recovery by 2026 covering total waste during the construction  operational  and dismantling phases of its projects’ lifecycle  with an ambition to take that figure to 90% total waste recovered by 2030. This move comes as EDP Renewables aims to aid in global decarbonization goals laid out at COP28 through the deployment of more than 4 GW of new renewable energy assets per year  reaching 17 GW of gross additions by 2026.“We’re excited to be ending the year focusing on tackling one of the key challenges our industry has had to date – namely the sustainability practices associated with recycling of materials during and post-construction of renewables projects ” stated Sandhya Ganapathy  CEO of EDP Renewables North America. “We have the opportunity to support and spotlight innovation and entrepreneurship through EDPR NA’s Close the Loop Program and look forward to delivering cutting-edge renewables projects that come with a full zero-waste circular economy in mind for hundreds of our customers nationwide.”In addition to working with SOLARCYCLE  EDPR NA will be collaborating across the solar  wind  and storage sectors with several recycling leaders including ALAMO1  Eco Environmental  ERI  Everpoint Services  FabTech Solar Solutions  Green Century Recycling  Green Clean Solar  Logisticus Group  Ontility – powered by TerrePower  Powerhouse Recycling (dba Solarpanelrecycling.com)  ReElement Technologies  TPI Composites  Vestas  We Recycle Solar  Wind Power Solutions  and WindWorx Renewable Services.Echo Environmental  ERI  FabTech  SOLARYCYCLE and We Recycle Solar have recycling facilities that have been endorsed by the Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA’s) National PV Recycling Program. All Close the Loop solar-related participants are ISO 14001 compliant  which is a set of standards created to help companies around the world reduce their adverse impact on the environment. This standard in addition provides a framework for improved and more environmentally conscious quality management systems. Many of the participants are also ISO 9001 and ISO 45001 compliant  which ensures the protection of local communities  workers  and the environment. Lastly  several program partners are in the process of becoming R2 (Responsible Recycling Certification for PV Solar) compliant  tied to establishing responsible recycling practices for the recycling of electronics globally.Through this collaboration  Close the Loop will aim to provide EDPR NA’s customers with a suite of tailored services to ensure materials are properly recycled following stringent environmental standards  accompanied by advanced and transparent environmental reporting showcasing net environmental benefits.Janette Freeman  Director of Business Development at Fabtech Solar Solutions added  “We’re looking forward to our continued collaboration with EDP Renewables North America on the launch of their Close the Loop Program in supporting a truly circular economy focused on recycling. As an innovative leader in the sector  we’re proud of their strides in the North American market and in their pushing the envelope to ensure high sustainability measures extend beyond construction to include the full project lifecycle of their solar  wind  and storage projects.”The launch of the Close the Loop Program continues EDPR NA's leadership in the market for its innovative approach to sustainability  having been recognized through several ESG and climate-related awards in 2023 including CohnReznick’s ESG Gamechangers Award and the GRIT ESG & Climate Champion Award by Ally Energy. In addition  the EDP Group was awarded Environmental Finance’s 2023 Company Award for “Circular Economy Transition of the Year – Global” and most recently was lauded as “the most sustainable electric utility in the world” with the highest score in the world amongst electric utilities as part of S&P’s Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA).Multimedia resources include:EDPR NA: Fact SheetAbout EDPR NA: VideoSustainability at the EDP Group: WebpageAbout EDP Renewables North America (EDPR NA)EDP Renewables North America LLC (EDPR NA)  its affiliates  and its subsidiaries develop  construct  own  and operate wind farms  solar parks  and energy storage systems throughout North America.

The 2023 Indicator Main Score rose from an index level of 94 in the 2022 survey results to 119 this year  a 25-point index increase.The primary contributors to this surge include a three-fold increase in the dollar amount of regulatory fines imposed over the past 12 months  moving from $1.3 billion for the 2022 survey period to $3.9 billion this year. Compliance-related hurdles  such as perceived heightened scrutiny of fair lending practices  continued reliance on manual processes  and competing business priorities further compound the challenges faced by financial institutions.“Lenders have faced many headwinds recently  from the turmoil generated earlier this year by a few but significant bank closures  to the interest rate environment and the effects of inflation  leading to 30-year fixed-rate mortgages in the U.S. reaching rates of 8%—their highest in more than two decades ” said Tim Burniston  Senior Advisor  Regulatory Strategy  for Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions.The concerns shared in this year’s survey responses also come against a backdrop of major regulatory changes that include the finalization of new  updated Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rules and the small business data collection and reporting regulations issued under Section 1071 of the Dodd Frank Act. “These developments pose major implementation challenges even for an industry that consistently demonstrates a high level of resilience and flexibility in dealing with regulatory change ” Burniston noted.Respondents rank the small business lending rules foremost among their concerns  with 74% expressing it as a high or moderate worry  followed by UDAAP compliance (67%) and CRA rule changes (62%). Noteworthy concerns cited in relation to the small business lending rules include accurately capturing new data fields  system upgrades  and staff training for compliance.Respondents also perceive the scrutiny of fair lending practices to have increased or at least remained the same  with 48% citing a considerable or slight increase in scrutiny  an eight percent uptick from last year’s survey.The Indicator underscores the increasing role of technology in managing workflows  recordkeeping  and regulatory change management. A notable 69% of respondents identify technology as a crucial factor in addressing these challenges  marking a seven percent increase from the 2022 survey. Speed (44%) and analysis (38%) are identified as the most important aspects of automation.Looking ahead  respondents anticipate increased investment in managing new or changed regulatory content (57%)  updating compliance policies and procedures (45%)  and improving quality assurance capabilities (41%) in their compliance management systems.Environmental factors impacting enterprise risk planning include heightened concerns about interest rate increases (74%) and ransomware attacks (65%). Inflation worries (54%) and recession fears (47%) have declined somewhat from the previous year.Survey respondents also express skepticism about a reduction in regulatory burdens over the next two years  with 58% considering it very unlikely and 17% somewhat unlikely.The survey was conducted from July 20 to September 11  2023. Now in its eleventh year  the Indicator remains a vital tool for gauging the pulse of the U.S. banking industry  offering insights into regulatory and risk concerns  anticipated impacts  and ongoing risk management efforts.Wolters Kluwer regulatory compliance experts Tim Burniston and Elaine Duffus will conduct a webinar Thursday  December 14 to delve deeper into this year’s survey results and their implications for bank risk management and regulatory compliance practices.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG.

More than two dozen hedge funds disclosed new or increased positions in CRH’s American Deposit Receipts on the Nasdaq in the months before its listing moved.While CRH’s departure has paid off for shareholders  it has heightened concerns for Euronext  the owner of the Dublin bourse.The exchange has seen an exodus of A-listers in the last number of years  including Greencore  DCC  Aryzta and Grafton Group.Flutter  which replaced CRH as the biggest company on the Dublin market  will also delist from Euronext Dublin when it moves its primary listing to New York in early 2024.,positive,0.52,0.46,0.01,negative,0.03,0.25,0.73,True,English,"['biggest activist investor', 'CRH play', 'Cevian', 'returns', 'Europe', 'two dozen hedge funds', 'Irish building materials giant', 'substantial North American income', 'Cevian Capital II fund', 'American Deposit Receipts', 'largest activist firm', 'large Irish investment', 'CEO Albert Manifold', 'large minority stakes', 'Stockholm-based Cevian Capital', 'new trading venue', 'MSCI Europe index', 'liquid US market', 'The Financial Times', 'Euronext Dublin market', 'The CRH shares', 'investment gains', 'market capitalisation', 'three times', 'Dublin bourse', 'New York', 'shareholder value', 'managing partner', 'Christer Gardell', 'US move', 'billionaire financier', 'Carl Icahn', 'European companies', 'general rise', 'same period', 'major factor', 'overall result', 'George Soros', 'Seth Klarman', 'last number', 'Grafton Group', 'biggest company', 'leading shares', 'primary listing', 'biggest shareholders', 'Billionaire investors', 'CRH peers', '20pc', 'report', 'price', 'September', 'London', 'idea', 'change', 'assets', 'ABB', 'Ericsson', 'SKF', 'Pearson', 'Rexel', 'anticipation', 'premium', 'positions', 'summer', 'More', 'Nasdaq', 'months', 'departure', 'concerns', 'owner', 'exodus', 'A-listers', 'years', 'Greencore', 'DCC', 'Aryzta', 'Flutter', 'early']",2023-12-12,2023-12-13,independent.ie
