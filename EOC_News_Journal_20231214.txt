The European Union has long sought to make its fragmented capital markets more efficient  with Britain also trying to find new ways to attract big-ticket IPOs since Brexit.And while there has always been a healthy tension between exchanges and their users over fees  more than 10 brokers  investors and analysts interviewed by Reuters said Europe's main operators now needed to act to entice investments.""If you can improve or reduce the costs of execution in the market  then that has a huge effect potentially on boosting turnover and investability "" said Ben Springett  head of European electronic and program trading at Jefferies.Illustrating the problems facing Europe  the Association for Financial Markets in Europe said IPO issuance in the region fell 72 per cent year-on-year to a record low in the first half of 2023  and was headed for the lowest annual issuance volume since 2011.Britain's biggest chip company ARM opted to IPO in New York this year after building supplies firm CRH shifted its main listing to the United States.Meanwhile  a BMLL Technologies study shows notional U.S. trading volumes grew more than 2.5 times the European rate between 2018 and 2023.Market liquidity is a critical consideration when choosing an IPO venue  with healthy trading volumes offering ideal conditions  said Nate Palmer  President of investment and trading platform Moomoo Financial Inc.But complex and varied fees are ""major disincentives to invest for many middle-class and working-class Europeans "" said Samuel Gregg  a Political Economy fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research  as many see the market ""as a rich person's game"".The operators argue their fees are already straightforward  with Deutsche Boerse's Head of Market Analytics and Pricing Andreas Heuer saying its model is ""quite simple"".Euronext  which operates exchanges in Paris  Amsterdam  Brussels  Lisbon  Dublin  Oslo and Milan  has already made progress in simplifying fees  said Simon Gallagher  Head of Global Sales for Euronext and CEO of Euronext London.And a spokesperson for London Stock Exchange Group said standard pricing on its primary exchange was publicly available and based on value traded within a banded structure.AUCTIONSFees during closing auctions  a key trading window that only primary exchanges can operate  are under particular scrutiny. These bring buyers and sellers together in the final five minutes of the day  establishing a final price for stocks.Aquis Exchange estimates around 2 trillion euros ($2.2 trillion) of trading takes place annually in Europe during closing auctions  which are ""particularly lucrative"" for primary exchanges.While popular among exchange-traded funds and other investors needing official end-of-day prices to rebalance and value portfolios  the higher fees are making some high-turnover  low margin hedge fund strategies increasingly unviable on some European markets  sources told Reuters.Data from Rosenblatt Securities showed a record 17.4 per cent of total European equity trading took place during closing auctions in September  while intraday volumes are falling  accounting for about 33 per cent of volumes.Euronext's Gallagher said it charged a very small number of clients higher fees to trade in closing auctions compared with the rest of the trading session.SIX Swiss Exchange  which runs the Swiss and Spanish bourses  also charges more during closing auctions. Joerg Schneider  spokesperson for the firm said they were ""an important liquidity event"" with ""a relevant weight of daily trading volumes executed during the window allowing members to benefit from enhanced liquidity"".Reuters was unable to determine which  or how many  SIX or Euronext users were subject to higher charges.A paper published in June by the University of Melbourne  supported by the Plato Partnership of asset managers and broker-dealers  said closing auction fees on primary exchanges ranged from 0.2bps to 0.95bps  with some also charging a fixed 'per message' fee.While they do not impose closing auction surcharges  LSEG and Deutsche Boerse could offer clearer structures to attract more investors and support liquidity  sources said.Thomson Reuters  the owner of Reuters News  has been a shareholder in LSEG since 2021. LSEG also pays Reuters for news.A spokesperson for the World Federation of Exchanges said ""complexities of price structures vary significantly and are influenced by a multitude of factors"".AFME declined to comment. Britain's Financial Conduct Authority did not respond to a request for comment.While others like Aquis and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE.Z) have launched alternatives to closing auctions  liquidity and execution can be less predictable.Users of these alternatives  known as Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs)  could pay fees of between 0.075bps and 0.3bps  or a monthly subscription  the University of Melbourne study found.While MTFs had grown quickly since the pandemic  they still only accounted for between 5.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent of on-venue trading activity during the close  said Will Hadfield  European Market Structure Analyst at Rosenblatt Securities.""If you need to sell 5 million euros of BMW stock  you might want the certainty you're going to get the transaction done so you stick it in the closing auction on Deutsche Boerse.""European trading costs are often higher and more complex because exchange groups and clearing houses face duplicate regulatory  real estate and tech expenses in the countries they operate in  sources said  making change harder.""When you consider what drives healthy markets  competition and so on  these situations don't help "" Springett said.",neutral,0.04,0.86,0.1,mixed,0.11,0.32,0.57,True,English,"['stock exchanges', 'Wall Street', 'Europe', 'calls', 'reform', 'fees', 'high-turnover, low margin hedge fund strategies', 'notional U.S. trading volumes', 'biggest chip company ARM', 'Chicago Board Options Exchange', 'lowest annual issuance volume', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'Top stock exchange operators', 'total European equity trading', 'BMLL Technologies study', 'Political Economy fellow', 'new company listings', 'Multilateral Trading Facilities', 'Moomoo Financial Inc.', 'Financial Conduct Authority', 'The European Union', 'daily trading volumes', 'Pricing Andreas Heuer', 'final five minutes', 'fragmented capital markets', 'closing auction surcharges', 'healthy trading volumes', 'building supplies firm', 'deeper capital market', 'key trading window', 'important liquidity event', 'record 17.4 per cent', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'closing auction fees', 'record low', 'primary exchange', 'Financial Markets', '33 per cent', 'European markets', 'program trading', 'trading platform', 'intraday volumes', 'trading session', 'IPO issuance', 'Aquis Exchange', 'European electronic', 'European rate', 'healthy tension', 'standard pricing', 'final price', 'Euronext London', 'new ways', 'main operators', 'New York', 'Wall Street', 'big-ticket IPOs', 'huge effect', 'Ben Springett', 'first half', 'main listing', 'United States', 'critical consideration', 'ideal conditions', 'Nate Palmer', 'major disincentives', 'many middle-class', 'working-class Europeans', 'Samuel Gregg', 'American Institute', 'Economic Research', 'rich person', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Global Sales', 'banded structure', 'closing auctions', 'particular scrutiny', '2 trillion euros', 'exchange-traded funds', 'official end', 'Rosenblatt Securities', 'small number', 'Spanish bourses', 'Joerg Schneider', 'relevant weight', 'higher charges', 'Plato Partnership', 'asset managers', 'clearer structures', 'World Federation', 'price structures', 'Market Analytics', 'enhanced liquidity', 'IPO venue', 'Market liquidity', 'varied fees', 'Simon Gallagher', 'day prices', 'value portfolios', 'higher fees', 'Thomson Reuters', 'other investors', 'Reuters News', 'Euronext users', 'exchanges', 'pressure', 'brokers', 'allure', 'Britain', 'Brexit', 'analysts', 'investments', 'costs', 'execution', 'investability', 'head', 'Jefferies', 'problems', 'Association', 'region', 'year', 'CRH', 'President', 'complex', 'game', 'model', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'Brussels', 'Lisbon', 'Dublin', 'Oslo', 'Milan', 'progress', 'simplifying', 'CEO', 'spokesperson', 'buyers', 'sellers', 'stocks', 'place', 'sources', 'Data', 'September', 'clients', 'rest', 'members', 'paper', 'June', 'University', 'Melbourne', 'broker-dealers', '0.95bps', 'message', 'LSEG', 'owner', 'shareholder', 'multitude', 'factors', 'AFME', 'request', 'comment', 'others', 'CBOE', 'alternatives', 'MTFs', '0.075bps', '0.3bps', '0.2']",2023-12-14,2023-12-14,zeebiz.com

EURONEXT)  CMI Inc. and Life Molecular Imaging (LMI) are pleased to announce that the Japanese Ministry of Health has approved the reimbursement by governmental health insurance…,Louvain-la-Neuve  Belgium  13 December  2023 – IBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.  EURONEXT)  CMI Inc. and Life Molecular Imaging (LMI) are pleased to announce that the Japanese Ministry of Health has approved the reimbursement by governmental health insurance of the amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) diagnostic Neuraceq® (florbetaben 18F).Amyloid-PET imaging using agents like Neuraceq® is used in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of cognitive impairment. It detects amyloid plaques in the brain  which are characteristic markers of Alzheimer's disease. With this approval  Neuraceq® is the first amyloid PET diagnostic tool reimbursed in Japan. Neuraceq® is produced with IBA’s Synthera®+  a fully automated synthesizer optimized for the production of florbetaben 18F.With the reimbursement of this diagnostic tool  Japanese physicians can use this state-of-the-art imaging technology to accurately evaluate their patients with cognitive decline. The density of amyloid plaques can be assessed to improve an earlier diagnosis  and to further guide therapy and patient management.Amyloid PET  including Neuraceq®  had a pivotal role in the recent positive clinical study outcomes of new anti-amyloid drugs by making selective inclusion of patients with confirmed amyloid pathology in the brain. Moreover  amyloid clearance was precisely measured with amyloid PET.Bruno Scutnaire  President of IBA RadioPharma Solutions commented  “We are thrilled to join forces with these esteemed companies and celebrate this groundbreaking advancement in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. We firmly believe this marks the initial stride towards establishing worldwide access to comprehensive care for this condition.”Dr. Ludger Dinkelborg  Managing Director of Life Molecular Imaging added  “Achieving reimbursement for amyloid PET using Neuraceq® in Japan is a notable milestone. We are pleased that our amyloid PET tracer  a very important and reliable diagnostic imaging agent  is now available for more Japanese patients.”Yasuhisa Fujibayashi  Chief Technology Officer  CMI Inc  commented  “CMI is intensively working for PET facilities in Japan and we are encouraging them to deliver amyloid-PET using Neuraceq® to patients with possible Alzheimer’s disease so that they may have an opportunity to access advanced therapeutic drugs.”***ENDS***About Neuraceq® (florbetaben 18F)Neuraceq® is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate β-amyloid neuritic plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline. Neuraceq® is available in Japan from the approved medical device Synthera®+. A negative Neuraceq® scan indicates sparse to no neuritic plaques and is inconsistent with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition; a negative scan result reduces the likelihood that a patient’s cognitive impairment is due to AD. A positive Neuraceq® scan indicates moderate to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques; neuropathological examination has shown this amount of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in patients with AD but may also be present in patients with other types of neurologic conditions as well as older people with normal cognition. Neuraceq® is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations.Limitations of UseA positive Neuraceq ® scan does not establish the diagnosis of AD or any other cognitive disorder.scan does not establish the diagnosis of AD or any other cognitive disorder. Safety and effectiveness of Neuraceq® have not been established for (i) predicting development of dementia or other neurologic conditions  or (ii) monitoring responses to therapies.Important Safety Information (as approved in Japan)Risk for Image Interpretation and Other ErrorsErrors may occur in the Neuraceq® estimation of brain neuritic β-amyloid plaque density during image interpretation. Image interpretation should be performed independently of the patient's clinical information. Errors may also occur in cases with severe brain atrophy that limits the ability to distinguish gray and white matter on the Neuraceq® scan. Errors may also occur due to motion artifacts that result in image distortion. Neuraceq® scan results are indicative of the presence of brain neuritic β-amyloid plaques only at the time of image acquisition and a negative scan result does not preclude the development of brain neuritic β-amyloid plaques in the future.Radiation RiskNeuraceq®  similar to other radiopharmaceuticals  contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure.Common Adverse ReactionsThe overall safety profile of Neuraceq® is based on data from 1 090 administrations of Neuraceq® to 872 subjects. Adverse Reactions occurring with a frequency of more than 1% include injection/application site erythema  injection site irritation and injection site pain.For more information please visit: https://neuraceq.comAbout Life Molecular Imaging (LMI)Life Molecular Imaging (LMI  formerly Piramal Imaging) was formed in 2012 with the acquisition of the molecular imaging research and development portfolio of Bayer Pharma AG.

As the number of shares subscribed for under either shareholders’ subscription rights or applications for excess shares was higher than the 2 956 248 shares offered  applications to subscribe for shares on a free basis were not fulfilled.Philippe Bringuier  CEO of Egide says: “I am delighted by the successful outcome of this share capital increase  which was oversubscribed  with a subscription rate of 151%. This success shows our shareholders’ confidence in Egide's future. I would like to thank them. They have strengthened Egide's shareholder structure and given us additional resources to turn our US subsidiaries around.”The gross proceeds of the capital increase are €1 921 561.20  including the issue premium  corresponding to the issuing of 2 956 248 new shares at a subscription price of €0.65 per new share.The funds raised will in particular enable Egide to:- Refinance the €750 000 bond loan with CNN maturing on 14 December 2023;- Continue to work on turning around its US subsidiaries.Settlement of the transaction and admission of the new shares to trading on Euronext Growth are scheduled for 14 December 2023. The new shares will bear current dividend rights and will give entitlement  as of their issue date  to all distributions decided by Egide as of that date. They will be immediately fungible with Egide’s existing shares and will be traded on the same listing line under ISIN FR0000072373.As of 14 December 2023  Egide’s share capital will thus be €8 129 682  divided into 16 259 364 shares with a par value of €0.5 each.To date  Egide is not aware of the exact number of new shares allocated to each subscriber.

As the number of shares subscribed for under either shareholders’ subscription rights or applications for excess shares was higher than the 2 956 248 shares offered  applications to subscribe for shares on a free basis were not fulfilled.Philippe Bringuier  CEO of Egide says: “I am delighted by the successful outcome of this share capital increase  which was oversubscribed  with a subscription rate of 151%. This success shows our shareholders’ confidence in Egide's future. I would like to thank them. They have strengthened Egide's shareholder structure and given us additional resources to turn our US subsidiaries around.”The gross proceeds of the capital increase are €1 921 561.20  including the issue premium  corresponding to the issuing of 2 956 248 new shares at a subscription price of €0.65 per new share.The funds raised will in particular enable Egide to:- Refinance the €750 000 bond loan with CNN maturing on 14 December 2023;- Continue to work on turning around its US subsidiaries.Settlement of the transaction and admission of the new shares to trading on Euronext Growth are scheduled for 14 December 2023. The new shares will bear current dividend rights and will give entitlement  as of their issue date  to all distributions decided by Egide as of that date. They will be immediately fungible with Egide’s existing shares and will be traded on the same listing line under ISIN FR0000072373.As of 14 December 2023  Egide’s share capital will thus be €8 129 682  divided into 16 259 364 shares with a par value of €0.5 each.To date  Egide is not aware of the exact number of new shares allocated to each subscriber. The company will come back to the market if it becomes aware of significant new shareholder blocks in the course of the operation.CONTACTSEgide – Philippe Bringuier – CEO and CFO – + 33 4 90 30 97 11 – pbringuier@fr.egide-group.comFIN’EXTENSO – Isabelle Aprile – Media Relations – +33 6 17 38 61 78 – i.aprile@finextenso.frAbout the Egide Group – You can find all the latest news about the Group online at: www.egide-group.com and LinkedInEgide is an international group specialising in the manufacture of hermetic packages and heat-dissipating solutions for sensitive electronic components.

EURONEXT)  CMI Inc. and Life Molecular Imaging (LMI) are pleased to announce that the Japanese Ministry of Health has approved the reimbursement by governmental health insurance of the amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) diagnostic Neuraceq® (florbetaben 18F).Amyloid-PET imaging using agents like Neuraceq® is used in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of cognitive impairment. It detects amyloid plaques in the brain  which are characteristic markers of Alzheimer's disease. With this approval  Neuraceq® is the first amyloid PET diagnostic tool reimbursed in Japan. Neuraceq® is produced with IBA’s Synthera®+  a fully automated synthesizer optimized for the production of florbetaben 18F.With the reimbursement of this diagnostic tool  Japanese physicians can use this state-of-the-art imaging technology to accurately evaluate their patients with cognitive decline. The density of amyloid plaques can be assessed to improve an earlier diagnosis  and to further guide therapy and patient management.Amyloid PET  including Neuraceq®  had a pivotal role in the recent positive clinical study outcomes of new anti-amyloid drugs by making selective inclusion of patients with confirmed amyloid pathology in the brain. Moreover  amyloid clearance was precisely measured with amyloid PET.Bruno Scutnaire  President of IBA RadioPharma Solutions commented  “We are thrilled to join forces with these esteemed companies and celebrate this groundbreaking advancement in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. We firmly believe this marks the initial stride towards establishing worldwide access to comprehensive care for this condition.”Dr. Ludger Dinkelborg  Managing Director of Life Molecular Imaging added  “Achieving reimbursement for amyloid PET using Neuraceq® in Japan is a notable milestone. We are pleased that our amyloid PET tracer  a very important and reliable diagnostic imaging agent  is now available for more Japanese patients.”Yasuhisa Fujibayashi  Chief Technology Officer  CMI Inc  commented  “CMI is intensively working for PET facilities in Japan and we are encouraging them to deliver amyloid-PET using Neuraceq® to patients with possible Alzheimer’s disease so that they may have an opportunity to access advanced therapeutic drugs.”***ENDS***About Neuraceq® (florbetaben 18F)Neuraceq® is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate β-amyloid neuritic plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline. Neuraceq® is available in Japan from the approved medical device Synthera®+. A negative Neuraceq® scan indicates sparse to no neuritic plaques and is inconsistent with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition; a negative scan result reduces the likelihood that a patient’s cognitive impairment is due to AD. A positive Neuraceq® scan indicates moderate to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques; neuropathological examination has shown this amount of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in patients with AD but may also be present in patients with other types of neurologic conditions as well as older people with normal cognition. Neuraceq® is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations.Limitations of UseA positive Neuraceq ® scan does not establish the diagnosis of AD or any other cognitive disorder.scan does not establish the diagnosis of AD or any other cognitive disorder. Safety and effectiveness of Neuraceq® have not been established for (i) predicting development of dementia or other neurologic conditions  or (ii) monitoring responses to therapies.Important Safety Information (as approved in Japan)Risk for Image Interpretation and Other ErrorsErrors may occur in the Neuraceq® estimation of brain neuritic β-amyloid plaque density during image interpretation. Image interpretation should be performed independently of the patient's clinical information. Errors may also occur in cases with severe brain atrophy that limits the ability to distinguish gray and white matter on the Neuraceq® scan. Errors may also occur due to motion artifacts that result in image distortion. Neuraceq® scan results are indicative of the presence of brain neuritic β-amyloid plaques only at the time of image acquisition and a negative scan result does not preclude the development of brain neuritic β-amyloid plaques in the future.Radiation RiskNeuraceq®  similar to other radiopharmaceuticals  contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure.Common Adverse ReactionsThe overall safety profile of Neuraceq® is based on data from 1 090 administrations of Neuraceq® to 872 subjects. Adverse Reactions occurring with a frequency of more than 1% include injection/application site erythema  injection site irritation and injection site pain.For more information please visit: https://neuraceq.comAbout Life Molecular Imaging (LMI)Life Molecular Imaging (LMI  formerly Piramal Imaging) was formed in 2012 with the acquisition of the molecular imaging research and development portfolio of Bayer Pharma AG.

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today the expansion of its rare disease pipeline with plans to develop leniolisib for additional primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) beyond activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS).Pharming has engaged with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has received feedback on its plans to develop leniolisib for PID disorders with immune dysregulation. This includes the recent FDA review of a Phase 2  proof of concept  clinical trial protocol in PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kẟ signaling submitted under the existing leniolisib IND.The Phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate leniolisib in PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kẟ signaling in lymphocytes  with similar clinical phenotypes to APDS. These PID disorders are defined by loss-of-function variants in the following genes: cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4)  FAS (causing autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome or ALPS)  and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)  among others. The epidemiology of these targeted PID genetic disorders suggests a prevalence of approximately 5 patients per million.The Phase 2 clinical trial is a single arm  open-label  dose range-finding study  to be conducted in approximately 12 patients and is planned to start in 2Q 2024. The objectives for the trial will be to assess safety and tolerability  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  and explore clinical efficacy of leniolisib in this new PID population. The trial has been designed to inform a subsequent Phase 3 program. The Phase 2 clinical trial will be conducted at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) – part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – with lead investigator Gulbu Uzel  M.D.  Senior Research Physician and co-investigator V. Koneti Rao  M.D.  FRCPA  Senior Research Physician  Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic (ALPS Clinic).Dr. Jocelyn Farmer  MD/PhD  Director  Clinical Immunodeficiency Program  Beth Israel Lahey Health  commented:“As a physician who manages a care program for primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients  I understand the large disease burden they face  with no approved therapies to target their underlying immune dysregulation. PI3Kẟ is an important regulator of lymphocytes  and unbalanced PI3Kẟ signaling in lymphocytes is a key signature of immune dysregulation among PID patients who develop lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease. Therefore  I am very excited to see Pharming progressing the evaluation of the PI3Kẟ inhibitor leniolisib into PIDs beyond the FDA-approved APDS indication  where it promises an opportunity to provide critical benefit to patients with a large  currently unmet  clinical need.”Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer  commented:“Today’s announcement is an exciting first step towards expanding our clinical pipeline into additional primary immunodeficiencies beyond APDS. Building upon the success of leniolisib for APDS  we believe that leniolisib will continue to have efficient uses in rebalancing immune dysregulation in PIDs. Our priority is the preparation and start of a Phase 2 clinical trial with leniolisib for targeted PID genetic disorders with immune dysregulation including CTLA4  ALPS-FAS and PTEN in the second quarter of 2024.”About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About Joenja® (leniolisib)Joenja® (leniolisib) is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the US as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja® inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy of Joenja® in the coprimary endpoints; demonstrating statistically significant impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype within these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term leniolisib administration.8 9 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review in Europe  Canada  Australia and Israel  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in the UK and Japan. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in two Phase III clinical trials in children with APDS. For information about Joenja®  visit: Joenja.comAbout Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today the expansion of its rare disease pipeline with plans to develop leniolisib for additional primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) beyond activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS).Pharming has engaged with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has received feedback on its plans to develop leniolisib for PID disorders with immune dysregulation. This includes the recent FDA review of a Phase 2  proof of concept  clinical trial protocol in PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kẟ signaling submitted under the existing leniolisib IND.The Phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate leniolisib in PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kẟ signaling in lymphocytes  with similar clinical phenotypes to APDS. These PID disorders are defined by loss-of-function variants in the following genes: cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4)  FAS (causing autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome or ALPS)  and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)  among others. The epidemiology of these targeted PID genetic disorders suggests a prevalence of approximately 5 patients per million.The Phase 2 clinical trial is a single arm  open-label  dose range-finding study  to be conducted in approximately 12 patients and is planned to start in 2Q 2024. The objectives for the trial will be to assess safety and tolerability  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  and explore clinical efficacy of leniolisib in this new PID population. The trial has been designed to inform a subsequent Phase 3 program. The Phase 2 clinical trial will be conducted at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) – part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – with lead investigator Gulbu Uzel  M.D.  Senior Research Physician and co-investigator V. Koneti Rao  M.D.  FRCPA  Senior Research Physician  Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic (ALPS Clinic).Dr. Jocelyn Farmer  MD/PhD  Director  Clinical Immunodeficiency Program  Beth Israel Lahey Health  commented:“As a physician who manages a care program for primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients  I understand the large disease burden they face  with no approved therapies to target their underlying immune dysregulation. PI3Kẟ is an important regulator of lymphocytes  and unbalanced PI3Kẟ signaling in lymphocytes is a key signature of immune dysregulation among PID patients who develop lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease. Therefore  I am very excited to see Pharming progressing the evaluation of the PI3Kẟ inhibitor leniolisib into PIDs beyond the FDA-approved APDS indication  where it promises an opportunity to provide critical benefit to patients with a large  currently unmet  clinical need.”Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer  commented:“Today’s announcement is an exciting first step towards expanding our clinical pipeline into additional primary immunodeficiencies beyond APDS. Building upon the success of leniolisib for APDS  we believe that leniolisib will continue to have efficient uses in rebalancing immune dysregulation in PIDs. Our priority is the preparation and start of a Phase 2 clinical trial with leniolisib for targeted PID genetic disorders with immune dysregulation including CTLA4  ALPS-FAS and PTEN in the second quarter of 2024.”About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About Joenja® (leniolisib)Joenja® (leniolisib) is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the US as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja® inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy of Joenja® in the coprimary endpoints; demonstrating statistically significant impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype within these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term leniolisib administration.8 9 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review in Europe  Canada  Australia and Israel  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in the UK and Japan. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in two Phase III clinical trials in children with APDS. For information about Joenja®  visit: Joenja.comAbout Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

This model relies on several factors to effectively manage profit margins:Rigorously selecting contracts combined with a streamlined  standardized approach for managing launch phasesHiring and training technicians and selecting subcontractors in Europe  to facilitate the ramp-up of contractsDeveloping IT tools and platforms to standardize operations and enhance business managementLeveraging offshore resources to effectively manage back-office tasksClose monitoring of operational profitability  with extensive KPIs for each technician and business unitStandardizing project organization to manage internal and external resourcesKey Actions to Improve Margins in Each CountrySolutions30 is present in 8 major geographical areas with 3 main businesses:Connectivity (fiber  mobile  and dismantling of copper networks)Energy (smart meters  charging stations for electric vehicles  renewable energy  especially solar power  and electrical grids)Technology (IT  networks  security  and connected objects)The group has proven its ability to incorporate new regions and is committed to increasing each country’s EBITDA margin to reach its double-digit target. To reach this goal  the group is focused on optimizing efficiency in terms of its variable and fixed costs.

This involves implementing strategies tailored to the unique challenges and characteristics of each country it operates in:Tier 1 zones (France  Benelux): improving process industrialization  optimizing costs  diversifying activitiesTier 2 zones (Germany  Poland  United Kingdom): reaching critical size  training technicians  automating processes  controlling central costsTier 3 zones (Italy  Spain): refocusing on the most profitable contracts and maintaining a flexible cost structure.Tools and Solutions to Improve Efficiency and Customer SatisfactionSolutions30 has developed numerous tools and innovative technologies to improve its efficiency in three main areas:Process: visual AI and augmented reality tools to automate the verification of call-out complianceServices: real-time call-out monitoring tools to improve quality and customer satisfactionBusiness: expanded range of services  from installation to maintenance  customer support  consulting  and project managementFinancing Plan for GrowthSolutions30 has a solid financial position  with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.7x at June 30  2023  well below the 2.5x threshold of its banking covenants. The group has sufficient capital to support its organic growth  which demands minimal cash due to:An estimated additional WCR of 1.5% to 5% of revenue  financed by customer advances and the deconsolidating factoring programA limited level of investment  between 1% and 2% of revenueSolutions30 estimates that only around €35 million of cash would be needed to finance €500 million in additional revenue.The net debt/EBITDA ratio should peak at the end of 2023  while remaining well below the 2.5x ceiling  before beginning a steady decline from 2024 onwards.For the year 2023  Solutions30 reaffirms its goal of surpassing €1 billion in revenue  coupled with a sustained improvement in profit margins. This positive trajectory is expected to extend into 2024.Communication timetable for 20242023 Revenue Report: January 24  20242023 Earnings Report: April 3  20242023 Annual Report: April 19  2024Capital Markets Day: May 20242024 Q1 Revenue Report: May 13  2024Annual Shareholders Meeting: June 20242024 Q2 Revenue Report: July 24  20242024 HY Earnings Report: September 18  20242024 Q3 Revenue Report: November 6  2024About Solutions30 SEThe Solutions30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

In conjunction  Ebu…,"Deurne  13 December 2023 - As indicated during the third quarter update 2023  Ebusco (Euronext: EBUS) today provides an update with respect to its progress in 2023  outlook for the full year 2024 and other operational developments. In conjunction  Ebusco announces an accelerated bookbuild offering and concurrent convertible bond private placement in a separate press release.Narrowing of the 2023 guidanceBased on the current production in Deurne and the development at our assembly partners  Ebusco narrows its revenue guidance for the full year 2023 to arrive in the range of EUR 145-155 million  which reflects the lower half of the guidance as provided at the Q3 update.Operational expansion outside of Deurne is on track with the first serial produced 3.0 buses successfully assembled at our assembly partners in China and ready to be shipped this year. Furthermore  the first cascos based on a local supply chain have been completed at our assembly partner and the commencement of production at our plant in Rouen is on track.Supply chain imbalances continue to impact our business as missing components lead to inefficiencies and additional costs. However  Ebusco continues to make progress on the efficiency of its assembly lines and expects a significant improvement of EBITDA in 2H23 compared to 1H23.Outlook 2024: revenue in excess of EUR 300 million and a positive EBITDAFully based on the execution of existing customer orders for 2024  Ebusco expects revenue to be in excess of EUR 300m for the full year 2024. Furthermore  Ebusco confirms that it expects to achieve a positive EBITDA for the full year 2024. Ebusco will provide narrower guidance on the EBITDA outlook in the course of 2024.As of the first quarter of 2024  Ebusco will implement cost measures that have been developed in recent months to lower its indirect cost base and bring the direct cost base in line with the adapted assembly strategy.Funding initiativesTo cover the working capital need in relation to the 2024 guidance  Ebusco simultaneously announces in a separate press release the launch of an accelerated bookbuild offering and concurrent convertible bond private placement. Ebusco will convene an extraordinary general meeting on 29 January 2024 to request the required shareholder approvals.To further increase its financial flexibility  Ebusco is having constructive and advanced discussions with lenders to extend and increase its existing bank guarantee/letter of credit facility. The structure under discussion is similar to the structure that Ebusco successfully deployed in the past to shorten its cash cycle.OrganisationalchangesBob Fleuren has informed the Management Board and Supervisory Board of Ebusco that he will not stand for re-election as COO at the end of his current term (May 2024 AGM).Bob remains highly supportive of the adapted assembly strategy  which he co-initiated. However  he has decided that his personal ambitions lie elsewhere  and he will be looking to pursue these outside of Ebusco. During his remaining tenure  Bob will continue his work with the same dedication and commitment to Ebusco  its employees and customers. A search for a replacement COO has been initiated  with a view to further align the composition of the management board with the adapted assembly strategy.Furthermore  Ebusco has appointed Mr. Frank Meurs as an advisor to the management board with the intention to nominate him for a position on the supervisory board at the AGM in May 2024. Frank brings with him a wealth of experience in the fields of business development  operations and supply chain.Most recently  Frank acted as the managing director of Toray Advanced Composites EMEA. Prior to that  he was chief operating officer of Ten Cate Advanced Composites Global. With this background  Frank will provide invaluable support to both the management and supervisory boards and the broader company as Ebusco scales up its business.Capital Markets Day 2024Ebusco will organize a Capital Markets Day in the second quarter of 2024 to provide more insight in market developments  its long-term strategy  and technological roadmap.Important informationThe securities referred to herein have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933  as amended (the « Securities Act"")  may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or except pursuant to an exemption from  or in a transaction not subject to  the registration requirements of the Securities Act and in compliance with any applicable securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States.

Hofseth International’s receivables have been incurred historically in exchange for fresh raw material of salmon heads  backbone  and skin  that the company has supplied to HBC over the years. Hofseth International will continue to supply HBC in the coming years.The completion of the Transaction is conditional upon the approval of an HBC extraordinary general meeting  to be convened on 4 January 2024 (the ""EGM"")  registration of the share capital increase pertaining to the issuance of the B-Shares in the Norwegian Registry for Business Enterprises and registration of the B-Shares in Euronext Securities Oslo (VPS). The Company has already received voting undertakings from shareholders representing the necessary majority requirement to approve the Transaction and related resolutions at the EGM.The B-Shares will not hold any voting rights and will carry a preferential right to receive dividends over the Company's ordinary shares (listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange under ticker code ""HBC"") (the ""Ordinary Shares"") and will receive an annual dividend corresponding to 3-month NIBOR + 0% p.a for the first four years. After this period  the return will be as follows:after five (5) years  the return will be 3-month NIBOR + 1 % after seven (7) years  the return will be 3-month NIBOR + 2 %  andafter nine (9) years  the return will be 3-month NIBOR + 3 %.In the event HBC does not distribute preferred dividends to B-Shares in any given year  the unpaid portion shall carry an interest of 3-month NIBOR + any additional margin based on the periods shown above per year. Furthermore  the unpaid dividend plus interest shall be accumulated and added to the preferred dividend for the subsequent year (collectively the “Preferred Amount”).Following a minimum of five (5) years after the issuance of the B-Shares  Hofseth International can request the B-Shares to be converted into Ordinary Shares. The subscription price shall be NOK 9 per new Ordinary Share. If conversion rights are exercised after seven (7) years  a subscription price of NOK 12 per new Ordinary Share shall apply. Such conversion into Ordinary Shares will technically be done through a redemption value  equivalent to the Investment Value in addition to the Preferred Amount.Jon Olav Ødegård  CEO of HBC  said: “This transaction represents a milestone moment and a significant capital restructuring for HBC by significantly reducing our liabilities and boosting the equity ratio and thereby meaningfully strengthening our Balance Sheet. This will hopefully increase confidence in stakeholders across our business. It is important that we take the necessary steps in a shareholder friendly manner to position HBC for growth. Hofseth International has been our strongest supporter and this transaction endorses this view  communicating to us the confidence that they have in our business model. HBC has accumulated trade payables debt to the Hofseth International group over the past few years whilst its business has been growing towards profitability. Given the confidence in management and market outlook for HBC products  Hofseth International is now willing to exchange that debt into an equity investment at a significant premium to market value. The decision reached by our Board to approve this transaction with Hofseth International is a testament to our unwavering commitment to financial prudence and putting shareholder interests first.

It is of the opinion that the proposed Transaction follows these requirements. In reaching this conclusion  the Board has emphasized  among other things  that the Transaction will significantly reduce the incurred liabilities of the Company and strengthens the Company's balance sheet providing it with a long-term financing on attractive terms compared with alternative options using either debt or equity. The Board has further emphasized that the subscription price for the B-Shares has been set at NOK 9  which is significantly higher than the closing price of the Ordinary Shares at NOK 2.70 on the last trading day  Wednesday  13 December 2023. Against this background  the Board considers that the subscription price and entitlement to preferred dividend carried by the B-Shares represents an attractive opportunity for the Company and its current shareholders when viewed together with the benefits entailed by the Transaction.About Hofseth BioCare ASA:HBC is a Norwegian consumer and pet health ingredient supplier and an incubator for new pharmaceutical drug leads.

The European Union has long sought to make its fragmented capital markets more efficient  with Britain also trying to find new ways to attract big-ticket IPOs since Brexit.And while there has always been a healthy tension between exchanges and their users over fees  more than 10 brokers  investors and analysts interviewed by Reuters said Europe's main operators now needed to act to entice investments.""If you can improve or reduce the costs of execution in the market  then that has a huge effect potentially on boosting turnover and investability "" said Ben Springett  head of European electronic and program trading at Jefferies.Illustrating the problems facing Europe  the Association for Financial Markets in Europe said IPO issuance in the region fell 72 per cent year-on-year to a record low in the first half of 2023  and was headed for the lowest annual issuance volume since 2011.Britain's biggest chip company ARM opted to IPO in New York this year after building supplies firm CRH shifted its main listing to the United States.Meanwhile  a BMLL Technologies study shows notional U.S. trading volumes grew more than 2.5 times the European rate between 2018 and 2023.Market liquidity is a critical consideration when choosing an IPO venue  with healthy trading volumes offering ideal conditions  said Nate Palmer  President of investment and trading platform Moomoo Financial Inc.But complex and varied fees are ""major disincentives to invest for many middle-class and working-class Europeans "" said Samuel Gregg  a Political Economy fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research  as many see the market ""as a rich person's game"".The operators argue their fees are already straightforward  with Deutsche Boerse's Head of Market Analytics and Pricing Andreas Heuer saying its model is ""quite simple"".Euronext  which operates exchanges in Paris  Amsterdam  Brussels  Lisbon  Dublin  Oslo and Milan  has already made progress in simplifying fees  said Simon Gallagher  Head of Global Sales for Euronext and CEO of Euronext London.And a spokesperson for London Stock Exchange Group said standard pricing on its primary exchange was publicly available and based on value traded within a banded structure.AUCTIONSFees during closing auctions  a key trading window that only primary exchanges can operate  are under particular scrutiny. These bring buyers and sellers together in the final five minutes of the day  establishing a final price for stocks.Aquis Exchange estimates around 2 trillion euros ($2.2 trillion) of trading takes place annually in Europe during closing auctions  which are ""particularly lucrative"" for primary exchanges.While popular among exchange-traded funds and other investors needing official end-of-day prices to rebalance and value portfolios  the higher fees are making some high-turnover  low margin hedge fund strategies increasingly unviable on some European markets  sources told Reuters.Data from Rosenblatt Securities showed a record 17.4 per cent of total European equity trading took place during closing auctions in September  while intraday volumes are falling  accounting for about 33 per cent of volumes.Euronext's Gallagher said it charged a very small number of clients higher fees to trade in closing auctions compared with the rest of the trading session.SIX Swiss Exchange  which runs the Swiss and Spanish bourses  also charges more during closing auctions. Joerg Schneider  spokesperson for the firm said they were ""an important liquidity event"" with ""a relevant weight of daily trading volumes executed during the window allowing members to benefit from enhanced liquidity"".Reuters was unable to determine which  or how many  SIX or Euronext users were subject to higher charges.A paper published in June by the University of Melbourne  supported by the Plato Partnership of asset managers and broker-dealers  said closing auction fees on primary exchanges ranged from 0.2bps to 0.95bps  with some also charging a fixed 'per message' fee.While they do not impose closing auction surcharges  LSEG and Deutsche Boerse could offer clearer structures to attract more investors and support liquidity  sources said.Thomson Reuters  the owner of Reuters News  has been a shareholder in LSEG since 2021. LSEG also pays Reuters for news.A spokesperson for the World Federation of Exchanges said ""complexities of price structures vary significantly and are influenced by a multitude of factors"".AFME declined to comment. Britain's Financial Conduct Authority did not respond to a request for comment.While others like Aquis and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE.Z) have launched alternatives to closing auctions  liquidity and execution can be less predictable.Users of these alternatives  known as Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs)  could pay fees of between 0.075bps and 0.3bps  or a monthly subscription  the University of Melbourne study found.While MTFs had grown quickly since the pandemic  they still only accounted for between 5.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent of on-venue trading activity during the close  said Will Hadfield  European Market Structure Analyst at Rosenblatt Securities.""If you need to sell 5 million euros of BMW stock  you might want the certainty you're going to get the transaction done so you stick it in the closing auction on Deutsche Boerse.""European trading costs are often higher and more complex because exchange groups and clearing houses face duplicate regulatory  real estate and tech expenses in the countries they operate in  sources said  making change harder.""When you consider what drives healthy markets  competition and so on  these situations don't help "" Springett said.",neutral,0.04,0.86,0.1,mixed,0.11,0.32,0.57,True,English,"['stock exchanges', 'Wall Street', 'Europe', 'calls', 'reform', 'fees', 'high-turnover, low margin hedge fund strategies', 'notional U.S. trading volumes', 'biggest chip company ARM', 'Chicago Board Options Exchange', 'lowest annual issuance volume', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'Top stock exchange operators', 'total European equity trading', 'BMLL Technologies study', 'Political Economy fellow', 'new company listings', 'Multilateral Trading Facilities', 'Moomoo Financial Inc.', 'Financial Conduct Authority', 'The European Union', 'daily trading volumes', 'Pricing Andreas Heuer', 'final five minutes', 'fragmented capital markets', 'closing auction surcharges', 'healthy trading volumes', 'building supplies firm', 'deeper capital market', 'key trading window', 'important liquidity event', 'record 17.4 per cent', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'closing auction fees', 'record low', 'primary exchange', 'Financial Markets', '33 per cent', 'European markets', 'program trading', 'trading platform', 'intraday volumes', 'trading session', 'IPO issuance', 'Aquis Exchange', 'European electronic', 'European rate', 'healthy tension', 'standard pricing', 'final price', 'Euronext London', 'new ways', 'main operators', 'New York', 'Wall Street', 'big-ticket IPOs', 'huge effect', 'Ben Springett', 'first half', 'main listing', 'United States', 'critical consideration', 'ideal conditions', 'Nate Palmer', 'major disincentives', 'many middle-class', 'working-class Europeans', 'Samuel Gregg', 'American Institute', 'Economic Research', 'rich person', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Global Sales', 'banded structure', 'closing auctions', 'particular scrutiny', '2 trillion euros', 'exchange-traded funds', 'official end', 'Rosenblatt Securities', 'small number', 'Spanish bourses', 'Joerg Schneider', 'relevant weight', 'higher charges', 'Plato Partnership', 'asset managers', 'clearer structures', 'World Federation', 'price structures', 'Market Analytics', 'enhanced liquidity', 'IPO venue', 'Market liquidity', 'varied fees', 'Simon Gallagher', 'day prices', 'value portfolios', 'higher fees', 'Thomson Reuters', 'other investors', 'Reuters News', 'Euronext users', 'exchanges', 'pressure', 'brokers', 'allure', 'Britain', 'Brexit', 'analysts', 'investments', 'costs', 'execution', 'investability', 'head', 'Jefferies', 'problems', 'Association', 'region', 'year', 'CRH', 'President', 'complex', 'game', 'model', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'Brussels', 'Lisbon', 'Dublin', 'Oslo', 'Milan', 'progress', 'simplifying', 'CEO', 'spokesperson', 'buyers', 'sellers', 'stocks', 'place', 'sources', 'Data', 'September', 'clients', 'rest', 'members', 'paper', 'June', 'University', 'Melbourne', 'broker-dealers', '0.95bps', 'message', 'LSEG', 'owner', 'shareholder', 'multitude', 'factors', 'AFME', 'request', 'comment', 'others', 'CBOE', 'alternatives', 'MTFs', '0.075bps', '0.3bps', '0.2']",2023-12-14,2023-12-14,zeebiz.com

The publication also includes outflow data on NCX 470 in a different in vivo non clinical model and on NCX 470 compared to equimolar bimatoprost in in vitro human trabecular meshwork/Schlemm’s canal constructs suggesting that NCX 470-mediated increase in outflow facility and uveoscleral outflow accounts for the robust IOP reduction exerted by this compound.The publication “NCX 470 Reduces Intraocular Pressure More Effectively Than Lumigan in Dogs and Enhances Conventional and Uveoscleral Outflow in Non-Human Primates and Human Trabecular Meshwork/Schlemm’s Canal Constructs” by Galli et al. is available by clicking here.NCX 470  a novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eyedrop  is in Phase 3 clinical development for the lowering of IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. NCX 470 is designed to release both bimatoprost and NO into the eye to lower IOP by two pathways. Lumigan  marketed by Allergan  Inc.  is the leading branded product by sales in the class of prostaglandin analogs  the most widely used class of drugs for IOP-lowering in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.IOP Lowering StudyIOP lowering was measured in ocular normotensive beagle dogs following either single or repeat once-daily morning dosing over 5 consecutive days  in an open-label crossover design  of either NCX 470 (0.1%)  Lumigan® (bimatoprost ophthalmic solution  0.01%) or vehicle. After single-dosing  NCX 470 demonstrated greater IOP reduction than Lumigan at most timepoints tested up to 24 hours post-dosing  with the greatest difference seen at 5 hours. In the repeat dosing study  the effects of both NCX 470 and Lumigan were generally stable throughout the period of the study  with NCX 470 showing consistently greater IOP reduction than Lumigan® at all timepoints tested.Outflow StudyAqueous humor dynamics were studied in ocular normotensive non-human primates treated in a crossover design with either NCX 470 or vehicle over 4 days. Measurements were taken on the fourth day and demonstrated that NCX 470 increased both outflow facility and uveoscleral outflow compared to vehicle. Aqueous humor outflow was also investigated in human trabecular meshwork/Schlemm’s canal constructs treated with equimolar NCX 470 or bimatoprost  or vehicle. Outflow facility was increased by both NCX 470 and bimatoprost compared to vehicle  with NCX 470 having a greater effect than bimatoprost. This data has been previously presented at the 2023 World Glaucoma Congress.Nicox Corporate Status UpdateThe Company is currently funded until the end of June 2024  exclusively on the basis of the development of NCX 470. The Company is pursuing licensing discussions which could extend the cash runway.
