Then this plan is for you.""Measures concerning these unexpected and exceptional revenues are  therefore  without prejudice to the international rules on state immunities "" it added.But the ""exceptional revenues"" — estimated to be €3bn a year at current interest rates — don't belong to EU treasuries either  the EEAS said.EU capitals ""cannot legitimately expect to gain what would constitute an undue and unintended economic benefit"" of the anti-war sanctions regime  it warned.""It is therefore appropriate and necessary to ensure that the extraordinary and unexpected profits ... benefit Ukraine "" it said.The proposed EU measures run the risk that global investors flee European financial institutions  if they feared their assets could one day face a Russia-type fate.Belgium's Euroclear  for instance  has frozen €191bn of Russian money  but this is just a tiny part of its asset-sheet  which was worth some €36 trillion in 2022.But at the same time  the longer Russia drags out the war  the more money the EU scheme will generate for Ukraine's future.The €3bn-or-so a year for Ukraine will keep ""accruing in the time period between the entry into force of this decision and the moment when the temporary restrictive measures concerning assets and reserves of the Central Bank of Russia will be discontinued""  the EU proposal said.The EU text made pinpoint clear where the annual €3bn of legal-limbo money comes from.It arises because interest  maturing-bond payments  and other dividends linked to the Russian ""cash balances"" are going in  but no payments are going out due to the EU freeze.All this growing money will still belong to Russia.But when firms such as Euroclear ""prudently manage"" the inflated Russian accounts  they generate the war-time windfall for themselves  to which neither they or Russia have a rightful claim  the blueprint said.The EU proposed creating a two-step regime.Step one would see EU securities boards which hold €1m or more of frozen Russian funds to create new accounts in which they would keep ""revenues corresponding to interest  coupon  dividends or other income on or value accruing from or generated by the [Russian] cash balances"".They would also hold back the ""net profit"" that they generated by their ""prudent management"" and report how much there was in their new Ukraine funds to the European Commission ""by 30 June of each year"".Step two would see EU states decide how to pool the Ukraine money into the EU budget  based on a legal template that hasn't yet been drafted.Sign up for EUobserver’s daily newsletter All the stories we publish  sent at 7.30 AM. By signing up  you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.Meanwhile  EU states will still be entitled to levy corporate taxes on the ""net profit""  while being voluntarily ""invited"" to ""contribute a large share"" of the taxes to the Ukraine fund.EU states will also decide in future ""the amount that central securities depositories may provisionally and gradually retain in view of complying with statutory capital and risk management requirements""  the proposal noted.The risk of global flight from EU financial centres aside  going after Russian assets also raises the risk of Russian retaliation.But the draft EU measures are designed to address this risk.""To protect the concerned central securities depositories  it is appropriate to prevent the satisfaction of claims in connection with any contract ... the performance of which has been affected  directly or indirectly  in whole or in part  by retaliatory measures taken by the Russian Federation "" the proposal said.""This concerns in particular the illegal seizing or confiscation of assets owned by or held on behalf of central securities depositories  which were frozen by the Russian Federation "" it added.Sanctions and vetoesThe Russia frozen-asset talks come as EU countries also put finishing touches on their 12th round of Russia sanctions.These are to feature a ban on Russian diamonds  more dual-use tech  and more visa-bans and asset-freezes on Russian officials and entities.""In principle  there's an agreement  but Austria has an analytical reserve "" an EU diplomat said.

This has been adjusted to a minimum of €200m  with organic growth of at least 5%  lower than the 8% announced at the start of the year and confirmed at end-October.The factors behind this adjustment  for the Medical and Photonics divisions  do not call into question the Group’s robust commercial development or its outlook for growth over the medium term. This primarily concerns:deliveries deferred from the fourth quarter to 2024 linked to technical delays with the qualification and production of certain product lines;orders deferred due to regulatory reasons and scheduling adjustments by some clients;persistent unfavorable foreign exchange effects during the fourth quarter.The Medical division’s robust development is expected to be in line with the 8% announced.For the Photonics division  the Defense and Space line of business is expected to exceed the 8% announced  while this growth will not offset the temporary contraction affecting the Industrial and Scientific and Lidar -lines of business. However  within the Lidar line of business  the Lidar Systems business will deliver a good performance.The adjustment of the full-year revenues will mechanically have an impact on the EBITDA margin  which is expected to come in at over 17%  below the 20% announced1.With strong demand in its growing markets  highlighted by a still very robust order book  Lumibird continues to be confident about its outlook for growth over the short and medium term. The Group has further strengthened its positions both technologically and industrially to continue building on its growth and ramping up its profitability over the coming years.Next date: 2023 full-year revenues on January 29  2024 (after close of trading)LUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading specialists in lasers.

This has been adjusted to a minimum of €200m  with organic growth of at least 5%  lower than the 8% announced at the start of the year and confirmed at end-October.The factors behind this adjustment  for the Medical and Photonics divisions  do not call into question the Group’s robust commercial development or its outlook for growth over the medium term. This primarily concerns:deliveries deferred from the fourth quarter to 2024 linked to technical delays with the qualification and production of certain product lines;orders deferred due to regulatory reasons and scheduling adjustments by some clients;persistent unfavorable foreign exchange effects during the fourth quarter.The Medical division’s robust development is expected to be in line with the 8% announced.For the Photonics division  the Defense and Space line of business is expected to exceed the 8% announced  while this growth will not offset the temporary contraction affecting the Industrial and Scientific and Lidar -lines of business. However  within the Lidar line of business  the Lidar Systems business will deliver a good performance.The adjustment of the full-year revenues will mechanically have an impact on the EBITDA margin  which is expected to come in at over 17%  below the 20% announced1.With strong demand in its growing markets  highlighted by a still very robust order book  Lumibird continues to be confident about its outlook for growth over the short and medium term. The Group has further strengthened its positions both technologically and industrially to continue building on its growth and ramping up its profitability over the coming years.Next date: 2023 full-year revenues on January 29  2024 (after close of trading)LUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading specialists in lasers. With 50 years of experience and a mastering of solid state laser  laser diodes and fiber laser technologies  the Group designs  manufactures and markets high performance lasers for scientific (laboratories and universities)  industrial (manufacturing  defense  Lidar sensors) and medical (ophthalmology  ultrasound diagnostic) markets.Born from the combination of Keopsys Group with Quantel in October 2017  LUMIBIRD has more than 1 000 employees and over €191 million of consolidated revenues in 2022 and is present in Europe  America and Asia.LUMIBIRD shares are listed on the Euronext Paris B Compartment.

The Digital Twin simulates how the drug will behave when taken by the patient (blood concentration  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics  interactions with other drugs).

Dans le but d'adapter au mieux la prise de médicament en fonction des caractéristiques individuelles de chaque patient.With this approach  ExactCure has already received numerous awards  including being the winner of the iNov competition  the AMI Santé Numérique award as part of the France 2030 Plan  the innovation prize from the French interns' union  and the ""Seal of Excellence"" from the European Commission.In the context of commercializing this device  ExactCure particularly targets pharmaceutical laboratories and Contract Research Organizations (CROs)  where personalized drug simulation can be a significant asset economically:In the case of drugs under development  it can enhance patient segmentation for inclusion in clinical trials  leading to time savings and a reduction in the associated costs of conducting these studies.For drugs already authorized on the market  it can promote proper usage  serving as a negotiating point for pricing with Health Authorities.Indeed  medication-induced iatrogenesis is responsible for over 10 000 deaths annually in France (three times more than road accidents)  over 130 000 hospitalizations  and nearly 1.3 million hospitalization days. Pharmacovigilance is thus a major challenge for the pharmaceutical industry  both in terms of reputation and cost.ExactCure has already signed partnership and licensing agreements for its device with providers of medical software solutions  contributing to strong visibility among healthcare professionals. Notable partners include Vidal and Cegedim  two leading French companies  as well as Elsevier in Europe.The merger aims to establish ExactCure's Digital Twin as an essential component for the proper use of medications within the healthcare ecosystem  spanning from the pharmaceutical industry to healthcare facilities and insurance entities.The technological breakthrough offered by ExactCure has enabled the company to raise €7 million since its inception  including €2.2 million from the i-Nov Innovation Competition and €1.4 million as part of the France 2030 Plan.The technological innovation proposed by ExactCure  the financial contribution  and the stock listing of Quantum Genomics  along with the complementary expertise of the teams  are all strengths that should position the new entity as a key player in pharmaceutical laboratories and the healthcare ecosystem.The merger of Quantum Genomics and ExactCure will  in fact  allow:Acceleration of the deployment of personalized drug simulation to medical solution providers  health insurers  and pharmaceutical laboratories.Continued implementation of the device:Increase the number of simulated drugs from 5 200 to 10 000.Incorporate a feature for detecting multi-drug interactions  a significant challenge in cases of multiple prescriptions.They said :Frédéric Dayan  CEO of ExactCure: ""I am delighted about this merger that will propel ExactCure into a new dimension. The new financial and human resources brought by Quantum Genomics will allow us to accelerate the development of our device and become an essential partner for pharmaceutical laboratories in the development of new drugs and the support of drugs already on the market.""Francois Durvye  General Manager of Otium Capital  the largest shareholder of Quantum Genomics and a historical leader in private equity in France  with €1.5 billion in assets under management: ""We renew our complete confidence in the Quantum Genomics team with whom we wish to continue this entrepreneurial adventure. The technological innovation based on artificial intelligence developed by ExactCure  combined with the complementarity of experiences and skills of the teams  will make this new structure a success.""Jean-Philippe Milon  CEO of Quantum Genomics: ""With the aim of successfully repositioning Quantum Genomics  we have tirelessly sought collaboration with a health-focused company that meets our four key criteria: a major field of activity  an innovative and differentiating project  replicable expertise internationally  and a high-performing team complementary to ours to support the project. ExactCure  which meets all these criteria  appeared to us as the ideal partner for a promising future.""As of the date of this press release:Otium Capital and Jean-Philippe Milon hold 11.6% and 2.2%  respectively  of the capital of Quantum Genomics.Frédéric Dayan  Sylvain Benito  Fabien Astic  and OneRagtime hold 39.5%  17.6%  13.4%  and 16.7%  respectively  of the capital (fully diluted) of ExactCure.Characteristics of the Proposed TransactionKey Terms of the Transaction:A letter of intent outlining the main terms of the proposed transaction was signed on December 13  2023  by all shareholders of ExactCure and Quantum Genomics  following a decision by their respective Boards of Directors.The envisaged capital merger operation involves the contribution of all ExactCure shares to Quantum Genomics  followed by a merger absorption by Quantum Genomics of ExactCure. The transaction is fully supported by the main shareholders of both Quantum Genomics and ExactCure  namely Otium Capital for Quantum Genomics  and Frédéric Dayan (CEO and founder)  Sylvain Benito (Chief Scientist and founder)  Fabien Astic (Business Director and founder)  and OneRagtime for ExactCure.The letter of intent notably stipulates  as suspensive conditions for the completion of the transaction  the conduct of satisfactory reciprocal audits and the issuance of reports by an independent auditor providing a favorable opinion regarding the valuation of the contributed securities and the fairness of the exchange ratio. The letter of intent includes an exclusivity obligation for the parties until March 31  2024.Indicative Timeline and Next StepsThe Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of Quantum Genomics  expected to be convened in the first quarter of 2024  will be called upon to approve the proposed transaction. The EGM will also be asked to approve the name change of the new entity  marking the beginning of a new stage in strategic development. As a reminder  decisions at the EGM are made by a two-thirds majority of the votes cast by the attending or represented shareholders. As an indicative timeline  the envisaged operation would unfold as follows:February 2024: Communication of the Commissioner's report on contributions and convening of the Extraordinary General Assembly of Quantum Genomics.March 2024: Holding of the Extraordinary General Assembly of Quantum Genomics  contribution of ExactCure shares to Quantum Genomics.2nd quarter 2024: Merger of ExactCure and Quantum Genomics and commencement of the activities of the entity resulting from the mergerGovernance of the New StructureFollowing the proposed transaction  Mr. Jean-Philippe Milon  CEO of Quantum Genomics  will resign from his position as CEO but will retain the social mandate as Chairman of the Board of the new entity. Mr. Frédéric Dayan  co-founder of ExactCure  will assume the position of CEO of the new entity. Mr. Sylvain Benito  co-founder of ExactCure  will become Chief Scientist of the new entity. Mr. Fabien Astic  co-founder of ExactCure  will take on the role of Chief Operating Officer for the new entity. The Board of Directors of the new entity will be composed of management members  investors  and independent directors  reflecting the capital balance of the two merged entities.Dilutive impactThe valuations considered  approximately €6 million for ExactCure and approximately €6 million for Quantum Genomics  must ensure that Quantum Genomics shareholders retain about 50% of the merged entity's capital after the operation. Therefore  a Quantum Genomics shareholder holding 1% of Quantum Genomics' capital before the operation (based on a share capital of €13 935 691.31 divided into 34 854 981 shares) would have a capital holding of approximately 0.5% in the merged entity of ExactCure and Quantum Genomics following the envisaged operation (based on a share capital of €27 871 382.62 divided into 69 709 962 shares). A nominal value division of Quantum Genomics' shares (which will not impact the number of shares issued by Quantum Genomics) will be carried out before the envisaged operation to ensure this exchange ratio.Prospectus / Exemption DocumentThis operation will not require a prospectus or an exemption document submitted for approval to the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF).WarningShareholders may experience a loss of their invested capital due to a significant decrease in the value of Quantum Genomics' shares if the operation outlined in the letter of intent signed on December 13  2023  is not ultimately completed. In the event of the operation's completion  Quantum Genomics shareholders will experience significant dilution due to the large number of shares issued to ExactCure shareholders  as indicated above. Investors are advised to exercise caution before deciding to invest in Quantum Genomics shares  particularly by becoming familiar with the risks inherent in the operation as explained above.Based in Paris  the company is listed on the Euronext Growth market in Paris (FR0011648971 - ALQGC)ContactsQuantum Genomicscontact@quantum-genomics.comEdifice Communication (EUROPE)Financial Communication and Mediaquantum-genomics@edifice-communication.com[1] As of the date of this press release  Quantum Genomics' cash position is €3.7 millionThis publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: nXCalpRqkpecm29sapVtbGZjbmtlmpOVlmSZx5JqY8jIaG1oyWtjZseZZnFkmGps- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Inside Information:- Operations of the issuer (acquisitions  salesÃ¢Â€Â¦) Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/83356-cp-loi-exactcure-v13122023-eng-vdef.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2023 ActusNews",neutral,0.08,0.91,0.02,mixed,0.43,0.21,0.36,True,English,"['Quantum Genomics', 'exclusive negotiations', 'ExactCure', 'December', '12:10', 'AMI Santé Numérique award', 'Official QUANTUM GENOMICS press release', 'Frédéric Dayan', 'two leading French companies', 'private French HealthTech company', ""Quantum Genomics' major shareholders"", 'innovative artificial intelligence device', 'significant healthcare solution providers', ""French interns' union"", 'consolidated cash position', 'caractéristiques individuelles', 'Contract Research Organizations', '1.3 million hospitalization days', 'medical solution providers', 'Quantum Genomics shareholders', 'sous-dosages médicamenteux', 'innovative medical device', 'personalized drug simulation', 'Extended financial visibility', 'i-Nov Innovation Competition', 'medical software solutions', 'interactions médicamenteuses', 'The Digital Twin', 'first companies', 'major challenge', 'significant asset', 'significant challenge', 'iNov competition', 'strong visibility', 'healthcare professionals', 'healthcare ecosystem', 'healthcare facilities', 'innovation prize', 'technological innovation', 'financial contribution', 'new financial', 'drug administration', 'Digital Health', 'ExactCure shareholders', 'CE marking', 'pharmaceutical laboratories', 'first quarter', 'fourth quarter', 'closing date', 'Euronext Growth', 'exclusive negotiations', 'biomathematical modeling', 'specific characteristics', 'renal function', 'hepatic function', 'genetic mutations', 'blood concentration', 'maximum effectiveness', 'numerous awards', 'European Commission', 'clinical trials', 'time savings', 'associated costs', 'proper usage', 'negotiating point', 'Health Authorities', 'medication-induced iatrogenesis', 'road accidents', 'pharmaceutical industry', 'licensing agreements', 'Notable partners', 'essential component', 'proper use', 'insurance entities', 'technological breakthrough', 'stock listing', 'complementary expertise', 'key player', 'health insurers', 'Continued implementation', 'multi-drug interactions', 'multiple prescriptions', 'new dimension', 'human resources', 'resulting entity', 'France 2030 Plan', 'new entity', 'other drugs', 'specific case', 'simulated drugs', 'patient segmentation', 'individual', 'profile', 'technology', 'Completion', 'merger', 'operation', 'transaction', 'merged', 'ALQGC', 'Development', 'weight', 'gender', 'treatments', 'pharmacokinetics', 'pharmacodynamics', 'anti-inflammatory', 'noon', '12:20 PM', '1:30 PM', '6:30 PM', 'objectif', 'surdosages', 'prise', 'fonction', 'approach', 'winner', 'Seal', 'Excellence', 'context', 'CROs', 'inclusion', 'reduction', 'studies', 'market', 'pricing', '10,000 deaths', '130,000 hospitalizations', 'Pharmacovigilance', 'terms', 'reputation', 'partnership', 'Vidal', 'Cegedim', 'Elsevier', 'medications', 'inception', 'teams', 'strengths', 'fact', 'Acceleration', 'deployment', 'number', 'feature', 'cases', 'CEO']",2023-12-14,2023-12-15,marketscreener.com

During COP28  a prevailing collective momentum among diverse sectors was showcased  followed by official announcements  commitments and declarations  driving global ambition for climate action.Acknowledging the goals of the Paris Agreement as a multilateral process  action is focused on collaboration towards reducing GHG emissions  enabling decarbonization across heavy-emitting sectors among energy producers  industries  and transportation. Annual energy efficiency improvements must be doubled by 2030  followed by a threefold increase in the renewable energy generation capacity in the same timeframe.Most importantly  25 global utilities united for a joint commitment to advance electrification  RES-ready grids  and clean energy deployment. In addition  climate finance would be pivotal in mobilizing private capital for nature  allocated to climate adaptation and resilience projects  especially when considering the impact of recent record-breaking temperatures and climate-induced disasters on vulnerable communities.As a key contributor in greater electrification  Cenergy Holdings welcomes the announcement of Ocean Energy Pathway (OEP)  a flagship initiative supported by the Ocean Resilience and Climate Alliance (ORCA)  a $250M funder collaborative  focusing on advancing ocean-based solutions to fight climate change. The initiative would act as a catalyst in tripling the renewable energy generation capacity to at least 11 000 GW by 2030 worldwide  therefore unlocking the tremendous potential of offshore wind power.Massive upscaling of offshore wind farms would drive strong economic growth  bolster energy security  and create a feasible alternative to fossil fuel dependency. Enabling the low-carbon transition and with a steady gaze on a 1.5oC trajectory  we are driving the expansion of renewable energy generation and the modernization and expansion of the electricity grids  vital components to decarbonize electricity supply. Cenergy Holdings is envisioning a pathway free of climate-related irreversible tipping points  in expectation for COP29.About Cenergy HoldingsCenergy Holdings is a Belgian holding company listed on both Euronext Brussels and Athens Stock Exchange  investing in leading industrial companies  focusing on the growing global demand of energy transfer  renewables and data transmission.

Arcadis will work as part of a closely integrated team with WellGear  a leading company in the closure of oil and gas wells  on the decommissioning program  which covers 350 locations and 1 750 kilometers of pipelines.This latest appointment builds on Arcadis' longstanding relationship with Dutch-headquartered NAM  a 50:50 joint venture between Shell and ExxonMobil that is responsible for supplying 25% of the natural gas required by households and businesses in the Netherlands.The work will involve the permanent closure of the wells up to a depth of 3.5 kilometers  which will be overseen by WellGear  with Arcadis responsible for the removal of all above-ground installations and horizontal pipelines  before the sites are restored to their original state and returned to the landowner. Arcadis' activities will include comprehensive planning of work preparation and permits  industrial cleaning of installations  dismantling  remediation of contaminated soil  and agricultural restoration.The appointment will see the further integration of underground and above-ground work  ensuring activity is conducted in harmony with the surrounding environment.Prior to developing the decommissioning plans  Arcadis  WellGear and NAM will also explore possibilities for site redevelopment in the context of the energy transition. Reusing capital assets is more sustainable than demolishing them.Alan Brookes  CEO of Arcadis  said: ""Rewiring the global economy for a net-zero future is a massive challenge and  given the joined-up nature of the energy transition challenge  a system-wide approach is vital. Great progress is being made in transforming the energy sector to move away from fossil fuels  but at the same time we need to address the complex  long-term  environmental challenges that remain at these former sites. Ensuring decommissioning is conducted safely  securely  and cost-effectively - and always with an eye to extending future useful life - is critical as we continue our sustainability journey.""NAM Director Johan Atema said: ""Just like our gas and oil extraction  the cleanup of wells and sites should be done safely and with minimal inconvenience to the surroundings. Additionally  this is an activity that will be necessary not only in the Netherlands but worldwide in the coming decades. As a company from the northern Netherlands  we are happy to work together with WellGear and Arcadis to contribute to the development of regional knowledge and employment.""Sigo Tjeerdsma  CEO of WellGear  added: ""In this extensive program  various areas of expertise from NAM  Arcadis and WellGear come together. We will organize the execution in consultation with stakeholders from the region. This is something that greatly appeals to us.""",neutral,0.29,0.69,0.02,positive,0.81,0.14,0.05,True,English,"['former gas extraction sites', 'large project', 'Arcadis', 'NAM', 'clean-up', 'Netherlands', 'December', '01:45', 'complex, long-term, environmental challenges', 'NAM Director Johan Atema', '800 former gas extraction sites', 'next 10-15 years', 'future useful life', 'leading global design', 'energy transition challenge', 'Dutch Oil Company', 'former sites', 'oil extraction', 'leading company', 'global economy', 'net-zero future', 'massive challenge', 'energy sector', 'consultancy organization', 'built assets', 'large project', 'longstanding relationship', '50:50 joint venture', 'original state', 'comprehensive planning', 'industrial cleaning', 'contaminated soil', 'agricultural restoration', 'surrounding environment', 'site redevelopment', 'capital assets', 'Alan Brookes', 'up nature', 'system-wide approach', 'Great progress', 'fossil fuels', 'same time', 'sustainability journey', 'minimal inconvenience', 'coming decades', 'regional knowledge', 'Sigo Tjeerdsma', 'extensive program', 'various areas', 'Dutch-headquartered NAM', 'natural gas', 'decommissioning program', 'decommissioning plans', 'gas wells', 'latest appointment', 'permanent closure', 'ground installations', 'horizontal pipelines', 'work preparation', 'northern Netherlands', 'December', 'Arcadis', 'EURONEXT', 'clean-up', 'part', 'team', 'WellGear', '350 locations', '1,750 kilometers', 'Shell', 'ExxonMobil', 'households', 'businesses', 'depth', '3.5 kilometers', 'removal', 'landowner', 'activities', 'permits', 'dismantling', 'remediation', 'integration', 'underground', 'activity', 'harmony', 'possibilities', 'context', 'CEO', 'Ensuring', 'eye', 'cleanup', 'surroundings', 'employment', 'expertise', 'execution', 'consultation', 'stakeholders', 'something']",2023-12-14,2023-12-15,marketscreener.com

The publication also includes outflow data on NCX 470 in a different in vivo non clinical model and on NCX 470 compared to equimolar bimatoprost in in vitro human trabecular meshwork/Schlemm’s canal constructs suggesting that NCX 470-mediated increase in outflow facility and uveoscleral outflow accounts for the robust IOP reduction exerted by this compound.The publication “NCX 470 Reduces Intraocular Pressure More Effectively Than Lumigan in Dogs and Enhances Conventional and Uveoscleral Outflow in Non-Human Primates and Human Trabecular Meshwork/Schlemm’s Canal Constructs” by Galli et al. is available by clicking here.NCX 470  a novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eyedrop  is in Phase 3 clinical development for the lowering of IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. NCX 470 is designed to release both bimatoprost and NO into the eye to lower IOP by two pathways. Lumigan  marketed by Allergan  Inc.  is the leading branded product by sales in the class of prostaglandin analogs  the most widely used class of drugs for IOP-lowering in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.IOP Lowering StudyIOP lowering was measured in ocular normotensive beagle dogs following either single or repeat once-daily morning dosing over 5 consecutive days  in an open-label crossover design  of either NCX 470 (0.1%)  Lumigan® (bimatoprost ophthalmic solution  0.01%) or vehicle. After single-dosing  NCX 470 demonstrated greater IOP reduction than Lumigan at most timepoints tested up to 24 hours post-dosing  with the greatest difference seen at 5 hours. In the repeat dosing study  the effects of both NCX 470 and Lumigan were generally stable throughout the period of the study  with NCX 470 showing consistently greater IOP reduction than Lumigan® at all timepoints tested.Outflow StudyAqueous humor dynamics were studied in ocular normotensive non-human primates treated in a crossover design with either NCX 470 or vehicle over 4 days. Measurements were taken on the fourth day and demonstrated that NCX 470 increased both outflow facility and uveoscleral outflow compared to vehicle. Aqueous humor outflow was also investigated in human trabecular meshwork/Schlemm’s canal constructs treated with equimolar NCX 470 or bimatoprost  or vehicle. Outflow facility was increased by both NCX 470 and bimatoprost compared to vehicle  with NCX 470 having a greater effect than bimatoprost. This data has been previously presented at the 2023 World Glaucoma Congress.Nicox Corporate Status UpdateThe Company is currently funded until the end of June 2024  exclusively on the basis of the development of NCX 470. The Company is pursuing licensing discussions which could extend the cash runway. In parallel  the Company is exploring multiple strategic options and is also discussing with its creditors to restructure its debt.,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,neutral,0.04,0.95,0.01,True,English,"['More Effective Intraocular Pressure Lowering', 'New Nonclinical Data', 'Nicox', 'Publication', 'NCX', 'Lumigan', 'Nicox Corporate Status Update', 'vivo non clinical model', 'ocular normotensive beagle dogs', 'ocular normotensive non-human primates', 'vivo nonclinical model', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'human trabecular meshwork', 'novel nitric oxide', 'leading branded product', 'Aqueous humor dynamics', 'multiple strategic options', 'open angle glaucoma', '2023 World Glaucoma Congress', 'Phase 3 clinical development', 'repeated (5-day) dosing', 'robust IOP reduction', 'Aqueous humor outflow', 'new nonclinical data', 'open-label crossover design', 'greater IOP reduction', 'international ophthalmology company', 'greater intraocular pressure', 'bimatoprost ophthalmic solution', 'repeat dosing study', 'NCX 470-mediated increase', 'IOP Lowering Study', 'Nicox SA', 'Ocular Pharmacology', 'ocular hypertension', 'greater effect', 'open-angle glaucoma', 'Outflow Study', 'outflow data', 'outflow facility', 'uveoscleral outflow', 'Sophia Antipolis', 'canal constructs', 'two pathways', 'prostaglandin analogs', 'greatest difference', 'fourth day', 'licensing discussions', 'cash runway', 'equimolar bimatoprost', '5 consecutive days', 'most timepoints', 'to 24 hours', 'The Company', 'equimolar NCX', '5 hours', '4 days', 'December', 'release', 'CET', 'France', 'ALCOX', 'Lumigan®', 'single', 'peer-reviewed', 'Journal', 'Therapeutics', 'publication', 'different', 'vitro', 'Schlemm', 'compound', 'Conventional', 'Galli', 'patients', 'eye', 'Allergan', 'sales', 'class', 'drugs', 'IOP-lowering', 'vehicle', 'effects', 'period', 'Measurements', 'end', 'June', 'basis', 'parallel', 'creditors', 'debt', '7:30']",2023-12-14,2023-12-15,globenewswire.com

National Gas and Fluxys Belgium have already worked in harness to secure energy resilience via the gas Interconnector between Bacton and Zeebrugge  which is marking 25 years of operation during an event at the UK Embassy in Brussels today.Looking to the future  Fluxys Belgium is developing large-scale hydrogen and CO 2 corridors for transport in and through Belgium. Meanwhile in Great Britain  National Gas has initiated Project Union to connect hydrogen production sources to end users across power and industrial sectors  and Scottish Cluster  a collection of industrial carbon capture and CO 2 transportation and storage infrastructure projects.In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding  Fluxys Belgium and National Gas will explore the benefits of a hydrogen link between their respective infrastructures  unlocking North Sea hydrogen for mainland Europe.Based on their existing strong relationship and sharing the same strategy to play a key role in decarbonisation of industry and society  both partners will combine their complementarities  expertise  and common vision to develop large-scale  long-distance hydrogen transport. They will also explore the possibility to extend their collaboration to CCU (carbon capture and utilisation) and CCS (carbon capture and storage).UK Energy Minister Andrew Bowie said: ""Today the UK cemented its position as a world-leader in green hydrogen production  backing new projects from the South-West of England to the Scottish Highlands. This agreement between the British and Belgian gas transmission networks will provide the essential infrastructure for transporting hydrogen and build on 25 years of collaboration to bolster the UK and Europe's energy security for the coming decades.""Belgian Minister for Energy Tinne Van der Straeten said: ""Today we celebrate a significant milestone in the Belgian-UK relations. A silver jubilee marking 25 years of collaboration through the Interconnector and a 5-year celebration for Nemo Link  the first submarine power cable between our two countries. It is a reflection on the past but also a testament to the forward-looking cooperation that will shape the next chapters of our energy ties. And the future looks promising. A second hybrid interconnection  Nautilus  will connect our two countries' power grids and connect offshore wind farms directly to the mainland. Also  on hydrogen we advance cooperation. Today's agreement between Fluxys Belgium and National Gas marks a significant stride forward in crucial hydrogen and CO 2 infrastructure. It fosters a collaborative synergy that transcends national borders and integrates the unique strengths of the UK and Belgium.""Jon Butterworth  CEO of National Gas  said: ""For the critical UK businesses that we serve  this agreement with Fluxys will help to secure their future and fuel growth and innovation. We have all the components of a world-leading hydrogen industry  and through Project Union we have the capability to connect hydrogen production and storage with end users through a hydrogen network of up to 2 000km - equivalent to 25% of Britain's current methane transmission network.""Pascal De Buck  CEO and Managing Director of Fluxys Belgium  said: ""Multiple strong partnerships are essential in our focus area of developing open-access infrastructure. We see an array of opportunities in pushing up our cooperation with National Gas for the development of infrastructure to further connect both markets in a decarbonised world  creating a hydrogen link between our systems and possibly other options for achieving large-scale decarbonisation.""About Fluxys BelgiumFluxys Belgium is a Euronext listed subsidiary of infrastructure group Fluxys headquarted in Belgium.

This acquisition would enable Atawey to accelerate its development and become a European leader;The contemplated transaction will enable McPhy to focus on its core business as an electrolyzer manufacturer  especially given the launch of its Gigafactory in Belfort.Grenoble  France  December 14  2023 - 6:00 pm CET - McPhy Energy  specialized in low-carbon hydrogen production and distribution equipment (electrolyzers and refueling stations)  announces that it has entered into exclusive negotiations with Atawey for the sale of its refueling station business. As a reminder  the supply of stations accounted for 32% of McPhy's revenues in 2022  with a portfolio of projects signed  commissioned and/or under execution  representing 40 stations.Successful negotiations shall enable McPhy to allocate its resources primarily to electrolyzer manufacturing  while ensuring further expansion of the stations business by leveraging the capabilities provided by an industry leader. Thanks to a portfolio of 30 installed stations and 10 years' experience  Atawey is indeed one of the leading players in the French market. By bringing together the two station activities  this will accelerate Atawey’s growth and create a European leader.McPhy and Atawey share common history and values  as key players and pioneers in the French hydrogen mobility sector. Their geographical proximity  successful collaborations on several projects and complementary station offerings should ensure the success of the transaction. The merger would indeed enhance the value of the investments made for the Grenoble site and enable Atawey to support the strong growth of its business by acquiring an additional industrial facility and high-quality technological expertise  as demonstrated by McPhy's recent commissioning of several stations. Should the sale process come to an end  McPhy intends to remain involved alongside Atawey to ensure the continuity of its station business  in the interests of all stakeholders.The repositioning of McPhy’s focus on electrolyzer manufacturing has been driven by the need for greater specialization in each of the hydrogen industry’s core business activities  given the strong growth in the market. The size of hydrogen projects  particularly for industry  is expanding rapidly  requiring more resources for the mass production of high capacity electrolyzers. McPhy will now exclusively devote to this task  drawing on its pan-European industrial setup  including its upcoming Gigafactory in Belfort and support functions in Grenoble  France  its engineering site in Wildau  Germany  and its manufacturing facility in San Miniato  Italy.McPhy will continue the ongoing negotiations with the required confidentiality and will inform the market of its possible outcome  especially should a binding offer be received. During this period  particular attention will be given to the execution of ongoing projects and customer satisfaction. In addition  an information-consultation process with McPhy’s employee representatives will be initiated depending on the progress of the divestiture project. Those representatives have already been informed at this stage of the ongoing process.Jean-Baptiste Lucas  Chief Executive Officer of McPhy  comments: ""We have decided to initiate the process of selling off our station business in order to concentrate on developing our electrolyzer business. By combining equipment manufacturing activities for both the production and distribution of hydrogen  McPhy has benefited from a significant learning curve  making its transition towards industrial scale easier. The possibility of associating our teams with the emergence of a new European leader by selling our station activities to a recognized player  with whom we share fundamental values  is undoubtedly a path to pursue. Concurrently  our Gigafactory dedicated to the new generation of electrolyzers  whose construction is nearing completion  will require the mobilization of all our resources to become a major player in the substantial low-carbon hydrogen market.”Jean-Michel Amaré  CEO and co-founder of Atawey  adds: ""This is a fantastic opportunity to confirm Atawey as a European leader in hydrogen stations. The complementary nature of our activities and the proximity of our corporate cultures will help us to achieve a transaction that satisfies all our stakeholders  including first and foremost our employees. This would undoubtedly be a major step forward not only for Atawey  but also for the structuring of the French hydrogen mobility ecosystem.""Next financial event:Publication of 2023 Annual Revenue  February 5  2024  after market closeAbout McPhySpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

This acquisition would enable Atawey to accelerate its development and become a European leader;The contemplated transaction will enable McPhy to focus on its core business as an electrolyzer manufacturer  especially given the launch of its Gigafactory in Belfort.Grenoble  France  December 14  2023 - 6:00 pm CET - McPhy Energy  specialized in low-carbon hydrogen production and distribution equipment (electrolyzers and refueling stations)  announces that it has entered into exclusive negotiations with Atawey for the sale of its refueling station business. As a reminder  the supply of stations accounted for 32% of McPhy's revenues in 2022  with a portfolio of projects signed  commissioned and/or under execution  representing 40 stations.Successful negotiations shall enable McPhy to allocate its resources primarily to electrolyzer manufacturing  while ensuring further expansion of the stations business by leveraging the capabilities provided by an industry leader. Thanks to a portfolio of 30 installed stations and 10 years' experience  Atawey is indeed one of the leading players in the French market. By bringing together the two station activities  this will accelerate Atawey’s growth and create a European leader.McPhy and Atawey share common history and values  as key players and pioneers in the French hydrogen mobility sector. Their geographical proximity  successful collaborations on several projects and complementary station offerings should ensure the success of the transaction. The merger would indeed enhance the value of the investments made for the Grenoble site and enable Atawey to support the strong growth of its business by acquiring an additional industrial facility and high-quality technological expertise  as demonstrated by McPhy's recent commissioning of several stations. Should the sale process come to an end  McPhy intends to remain involved alongside Atawey to ensure the continuity of its station business  in the interests of all stakeholders.The repositioning of McPhy’s focus on electrolyzer manufacturing has been driven by the need for greater specialization in each of the hydrogen industry’s core business activities  given the strong growth in the market. The size of hydrogen projects  particularly for industry  is expanding rapidly  requiring more resources for the mass production of high capacity electrolyzers. McPhy will now exclusively devote to this task  drawing on its pan-European industrial setup  including its upcoming Gigafactory in Belfort and support functions in Grenoble  France  its engineering site in Wildau  Germany  and its manufacturing facility in San Miniato  Italy.McPhy will continue the ongoing negotiations with the required confidentiality and will inform the market of its possible outcome  especially should a binding offer be received. During this period  particular attention will be given to the execution of ongoing projects and customer satisfaction. In addition  an information-consultation process with McPhy’s employee representatives will be initiated depending on the progress of the divestiture project. Those representatives have already been informed at this stage of the ongoing process.Jean-Baptiste Lucas  Chief Executive Officer of McPhy  comments: ""We have decided to initiate the process of selling off our station business in order to concentrate on developing our electrolyzer business. By combining equipment manufacturing activities for both the production and distribution of hydrogen  McPhy has benefited from a significant learning curve  making its transition towards industrial scale easier. The possibility of associating our teams with the emergence of a new European leader by selling our station activities to a recognized player  with whom we share fundamental values  is undoubtedly a path to pursue. Concurrently  our Gigafactory dedicated to the new generation of electrolyzers  whose construction is nearing completion  will require the mobilization of all our resources to become a major player in the substantial low-carbon hydrogen market.”Jean-Michel Amaré  CEO and co-founder of Atawey  adds: ""This is a fantastic opportunity to confirm Atawey as a European leader in hydrogen stations. The complementary nature of our activities and the proximity of our corporate cultures will help us to achieve a transaction that satisfies all our stakeholders  including first and foremost our employees. This would undoubtedly be a major step forward not only for Atawey  but also for the structuring of the French hydrogen mobility ecosystem.""Next financial event:Publication of 2023 Annual Revenue  February 5  2024  after market closeAbout McPhySpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

A split that removed the conglomerate discount could see Vivendi’s share price increase by around 50% to €13 ($14) a share  JP Morgan analysts said.JP Morgan analysts  led by Daniel Kervan  said a split would make it easier for French billionaire Vincent Bolloré to up his stakes in any of the three newly-independent companies  for lesser amounts of money  through his family owned company Bolloré SE BOL  -1.43% .Bolloré SE first invested in Vivendi in 2011  before building up a 30% controlling stake in the conglomerate. Any split would see Bolloré SE  which is currently Vivendi’s top shareholder  continue to own 30% stakes in all three newly spun out companies.Bolloré SE’s stake in Vivendi gave Vincent Bolloré a seat on the Paris firm’s board and later saw him take a position as the company’s chair in 2014  before he stepped down in 2019. Vincent Bolloré’s son  Yannick Bolloré. is now chair of Vivendi and CEO of Havas.Bolloré’s exit from his position at Vivendi came after French authorities launched an investigation in April 2018 into allegations the billionaire’s PR company  Havas  gave discount services to politicians in Togo and Guinea  in return for lucrative contracts to run ports in the countries.Bolloré would most likely seek to build its stake in Canal+  which is currently Vivendi’s main source of revenues and profit  JP Morgan’s analysts said.The split plans come just weeks after Vivendi successfully completed its takeover of rival Lagardère Group  in a deal which added publishing house Hachette to its portfolio.Lagardère on Wednesday said Vincent Bolloré’s son  Yannick Bolloré  will take a seat on its board.,neutral,0.03,0.95,0.02,negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,True,English,"['Vivendi shares', 'media conglomerate', 'plans', 'three', 'lucrative Universal Music Group UMG', 'Amsterdam Euronext stock exchange', 'rival Lagardère Group', 'three separate listed companies', 'French billionaire Vincent Bolloré', 'three independent firms', 'initial public offering', 'external growth transactions', 'numerous investment opportunities', 'three newly-independent companies', 'filmmaker Groupe Canal+', 'French media conglomerate', 'JP Morgan analysts', 'high conglomerate discount', 'Bolloré SE BOL', 'lucrative contracts', 'French conglomerate', 'French authorities', 'three divisions', 'public relations', 'strong growth', 'discount services', 'Yannick Bolloré', 'share price', 'previous 12 months', 'recent years', 'development potential', 'international context', 'Daniel Kervan', 'lesser amounts', 'top shareholder', 'Paris firm', 'main source', 'publishing house', 'investment company', 'majority stake', '30% controlling stake', 'advertising company', 'PR company', 'publishing business', 'split plans', 'Vivendi', 'Wednesday', 'Havas', 'Thursday', 'statement', 'valuation', 'decision', '+1.09% subsidiary', 'distribution', 'listing', 'ability', 'subsidiaries', 'activities', 'Investors', 'past', 'concerns', 'lack', 'synergies', 'stakes', 'money', 'family', 'seat', 'board', 'position', 'chair', 'CEO', 'exit', 'investigation', 'April', 'allegations', 'politicians', 'Togo', 'Guinea', 'return', 'ports', 'countries', 'revenues', 'profit', 'takeover', 'deal', 'Hachette', 'portfolio', 'son']",2023-12-14,2023-12-15,marketwatch.com

MBW’s round-up is supported by Centtrip  which helps over 500 of the world’s best-selling artists maximize their income and reduce their touring costs.,Welcome to Music Business Worldwide’s weekly round-up – where we make sure you caught the five biggest stories to hit our headlines over the past seven days. MBW’s round-up is supported by Centtrip  which helps over 500 of the world’s best-selling artists maximize their income and reduce their touring costs.With 2024 soon upon us  the season for tallying up the numbers for 2023 is approaching quickly.One company that’s out ahead of the pack on that front is streaming service SoundCloud  which told MBW this week that  16 years after its founding  it has finally reached that elusive promised land: annual profitability.CEO Eliah Seton told MBW that the company is forecasting a €2 million positive EBITDA for 2023  a sharp turnaround from the €29 million negative EBITDA it posted in 2022. What’s more  the company has now achieved eight consecutive months of profitability on an EBITDA basis.Also this week  MBW dug deeper into Spotify‘s plans to alter its payout model in the new year. Among the details in the plan: Not only will tracks need a minimum of 1 000 streams in the previous 12-months to qualify for royalty payments  there will also be a minimum number of unique listeners that will be required for a track to get paid – though Spotify isn’t saying exactly how many.In other news  Universal Music Group (UMG)  the world’s largest music rightsholder  saw its shares hit €25.77 on the Euronext Amsterdam on Tuesday (December 12). That put UMG’s market cap at €46.944 billion  or around USD $50.68 billion at current exchange rates.Plus  Sony and Warner hit US internet provider Altice with a lawsuit over alleged music piracy on its network  while MBW interviewed Drew Simmons  manager of breakthrough artist Noah Kahan.Here’s what happened this week…SoundCloud is experiencing something new  a full 16 years after it was founded: annual profitability.According to company data shared with Music Business Worldwide  SoundCloud is currently on course to post a slim – but positive – EBITDA for calendar/fiscal 2023.The company is forecasting a €2 million in EBITDA for 2023  CEO Eliah Seton tells MBW  representing a significant improvement from the €29 million negative EBITDA the firm posted in 2022.What’s more  says Seton  SoundCloud has now achieved eight consecutive months of profitability on an EBITDA basis.“Reaching profitability matters because it reinforces that we are pursuing the right strategy and have taken the necessary steps to turn around the business ” Seton tells MBW…Universal Music Group (UMG) is finishing 2023 with a bang.The world’s largest music rightsholder ended its trading day Tuesday (December 12) on the Amsterdam Euronext with its highest share price of the year to date.In fact  with a share price of EUR €25.77  UMG finished the day with its largest public valuation for two years.According to Euronext data  UMG’s share price translated into a market cap valuation of EUR €46.944 billion.In US dollar terms at current exchange rates  that’s worth USD $50.68 billion.This is Universal’s highest share price since December 7  2021 (€25.78) – just over 24 months ago.UMG’s share price peak came in mid-November 2021  when its day-close stock price crested at €27.72…Internet service provider Altice USA is facing another lawsuit from music rightsholders over its alleged enabling of widespread music piracy through its service.Late last year  Altice was hit with a $1 billion lawsuit on behalf of music rightsholders including Universal Music Group  BMG  and Concord Music Group  who sought to have the internet provider held accountable for “millions” of alleged infringements of “thousands” of their songs.That lawsuit is ongoing  after a judge in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas rejected Altice’s motion to dismiss the case earlier this year.Now  Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group have filed a similar lawsuit in the same US District Court  accusing Altice of “knowingly contribut[ing] to  and reap[ing] substantial profits from  massive copyright infringement committed by thousands of its subscribers…”When Drew Simmons first found Noah Kahan on SoundCloud  he was convinced he’d discovered someone special. Only one problem: the feeling was not mutual.“Noah really didn’t have any concept of what the music industry was ” laughs Simmons. “He didn’t think I was real – he thought I was catfishing him.”So  Simmons drove hundreds of miles to Kahan’s rural Vermont home in order to convince the musician that  not only was he real  but that he was the manager to help the nascent singer-songwriter take on the world.The fact that  right now  Kahan is the hottest breakthrough act on the planet shows that Simmons succeeded in his mission.But  although there was less than a year between Kahan supporting Amos Lee at Red Rocks  and selling out the storied venue in his own right in July  this was no overnight viral success.Kahan’s rise has been an old-fashioned story of artist development  albeit one in which he reversed the traditional alternative-to-pop direction of travel…Spotify is introducing a significant update to the way it calculates recorded royalties next year.Starting in early 2024  tracks must have reached at least 1 000 streams in the previous 12 months in order to generate royalties on the platform.This policy is one of the more contentious amongst a suite of new changes coming to the platform in the new year  which were first reported by MBW in October  and subsequently confirmed by Spotify in a blog post last month.SPOT wrote in its blog post that the reasoning behind the new monetization policy is to “better distribute small payments that aren’t reaching artists”.The company explained further that “tens of millions” of the 100 million-plus tracks it hosts on its platform “have been streamed between one and 1 000 times over the past year and  on average  those tracks generated $0.03 per month.”The blog post continued: “Because labels and distributors require a minimum amount to withdraw (usually $2-$50 per withdrawal)  and banks charge a fee for the transaction (usually $1-$20 per withdrawal)  this money often doesn’t reach the uploaders. And these small payments are often forgotten about.”According to Spotify  in aggregate  these small “disregarded payments” added up to $40 million in 2022 alone  which the company adds “could instead increase the payments to artists who are most dependent on streaming revenue…”MBW’s Weekly Round-Up is supported by Centtrip  which helps over 500 of the world’s best-selling artists maximise their income and reduce their touring costs.Music Business Worldwide,neutral,0.23,0.76,0.01,mixed,0.08,0.26,0.66,True,English,"['$50bn+ public valuation', 'Weekly Round-Up', 'SoundCloud', 'profitability', 'Universal', 'MBW', 'same US District Court', 'US dollar terms', 'five biggest stories', 'past seven days', 'elusive promised land', 'eight consecutive months', 'current exchange rates', 'largest public valuation', 'massive copyright infringement', 'rural Vermont home', 'overnight viral success', 'largest music rightsholder', 'Concord Music Group', 'day-close stock price', 'US internet provider', 'hottest breakthrough act', '€29 million negative EBITDA', 'highest share price', 'share price peak', 'Universal Music Group', 'widespread music piracy', 'Music Business Worldwide', 'CEO Eliah Seton', 'market cap valuation', '€2 million positive EBITDA', 'Sony Music Entertainment', 'Warner Music Group', 'Internet service provider', 'Eastern District', 'positive – EBITDA', 'music rightsholders', 'music industry', 'breakthrough artist', 'EBITDA basis', 'selling artists', 'touring costs', 'streaming service', 'sharp turnaround', 'payout model', 'previous 12-months', 'royalty payments', 'unique listeners', 'other news', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'significant improvement', 'necessary steps', 'Amsterdam Euronext', 'two years', 'Euronext data', 'alleged infringements', 'substantial profits', 'one problem', 'nascent singer-songwriter', 'Amos Lee', 'Red Rocks', 'storied venue', 'fashioned story', 'artist development', 'traditional alternative', 'pop direction', 'new year', 'a year', 'annual profitability', 'profitability matters', 'weekly round-up', 'minimum number', 'right strategy', 'trading day', 'One company', 'Drew Simmons', 'company data', '$1 billion lawsuit', 'similar lawsuit', 'Noah Kahan', 'Altice USA', 'headlines', 'MBW', 'Centtrip', 'income', 'season', 'numbers', 'pack', 'front', 'SoundCloud', 'founding', 'Spotify', 'plans', 'details', 'tracks', '1,000 streams', 'UMG', 'shares', 'Tuesday', 'December', 'network', 'manager', 'something', 'course', 'slim', 'calendar/fiscal', 'firm', 'bang', 'date', 'fact', 'mid-November', 'enabling', 'behalf', 'BMG', 'millions', 'thousands', 'songs', 'judge', 'Texas', 'motion', 'case', 'subscribers', 'someone', 'feeling', 'concept', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'order', 'musician', 'planet', 'mission', 'less', 'July', 'rise']",2023-12-15,2023-12-15,musicbusinessworldwide.com
33981,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.ifre.com/story/4289570/back-to-school-europes-pre-ipo-training-programmes-fry0r39md4,Back to school: Europe's pre-IPO training programmes,Euronext recently launched its IPOready programme  a six-month IPO preparation scheme that amalgamates a number of its existing programmes such as TechShare and FamilyShare that had been running since 2015.,"Following a second year of sparse European IPO activity one focus is on how exchanges can attract new listings.A key area that is often overlooked is education to ensure companies fully understand the relevance and benefits of going public and providing them with the knowledge and capability to successfully complete the process  while introducing them to investors at an early stage.Across Europe a number of exchanges now run programmes aimed at training senior executives for life as a public company and generating a pipeline of IPO-ready candidates.SIX Swiss Exchange recently launched the third round of its Sparks IPO Academy that began in 2021. This year's round involves 16 companies based on a range of criteria from turnover to their prominence in the financial ecosystem.The six-month programme  which was oversubscribed  involves a mixture of online and in-person sessions covering topics such as corporate governance  financial readiness  valuation considerations and the buyside  plus networking events with investors and experts.“We found education has a central role to equip companies with the necessary tools ” said Fabian Gerber  senior relationship manager at SIX. “The goal is to show companies where they are  where the gaps are and find out if an IPO is an option or not. We have had companies that found it was not what they want to do. The idea is to make them aware of the option.""Gerber said a lot of companies have misconceptions around IPOs  a common one being that they come at the end of development and are often seen as an exit option rather than a means to help fast-growing companies expand using primary capital.Euronext recently launched its IPOready programme  a six-month IPO preparation scheme that amalgamates a number of its existing programmes such as TechShare and FamilyShare that had been running since 2015.“IPOready gives a clear view of what an IPO brings in terms of benefits and challenges ” said head of group listing activities Aurelien Narminio. “Participants are provided with tools to assess whether it's right for them and to understand how it works.""What we want is that the IPO is not discarded by lack of knowledge. We want the discussion about financing options to be one that is informed.""The Euronext programme is aimed at companies considering an IPO within the next three years but has attracted participants ranging from unicorns to small-cap businesses with valuations in the tens of millions of euros.Workshop sessions look at crafting an equity story  preparing a prospectus and sustainability  as well providing introductions to banks  lawyers and accounting firms.Since 2015  more than 25 companies that participated in one of Euronext's programmes have completed IPOs  with deals ranging from €9m to €252m.For Narminio another key aspect is preparing company executives to juggle their day jobs – keeping up company performance – while leading an IPO  particularly CFOs.""Recently I was with a participant from the 2021 edition who took his firm public and told me 'I don’t understand how executives get through the IPO process without having this experience'.""Not all exchanges opt for a formal programme. The London Stock Exchange discontinued its Elite programme after its developer Borsa Italiana was acquired by Euronext.According to Marcus Stuttard  head of AIM and UK primary markets at the LSE  the needs are different in the UK  given the greater number and diversity of companies that list in different stages.""One benefit of a structured programme is the number of companies who can support each other but actually we tend to find that area is well served in the UK by organisations like Innovate UK  the Catapult Network  and venture capital and private equity portfolios if you think of the Business Growth Fund  for example  so a lot of networks exist "" said Stuttard.Many features of other exchange programmes still exist  with LSE providing direct advice and connections to companies in addition to monthly events such as panel sessions  breakfast and lunch sessions  and IPO forums.""We put prospective companies in contact with founders and entrepreneurs who have done IPOs "" said Stuttard. ""A company will spend a lot of time with advisers  lawyers and banks so chemistry is important. The company’s roster of advisers needs to understand the business. So if we engage early on and it looks like an IPO is a valid opportunity  while we don’t make specific recommendations  we do look at size  sector and base and suggest a number of banks to start with.""The London Stock Exchange is part of LSEG  which also owns IFR.Successful alumniFrench chemical group Afyren completed a €66.5m Paris IPO in September 2021  around 18 months after going through Euronext's TechShare programme.""You meet a lot of people who have been there before you and understand how the process works "" said CFO Maxime Cordonnier. ""To see that there were companies like us that managed it was very helpful. It can be a mountain you consider too high to be climbed.""During the programme Afyren was introduced to Portzamparc and Lazard  which became bookrunner and adviser on the IPO  respectively.According to Cordonnier the IPO process was largely as expected following the programme  though one area of surprise and frustration was the lack of direct involvement for the company during pre-marketing  which emphasised the need for a close relationship with its advisers.""I would not have done it with people who I couldn’t see would fit when times were hard "" he said. ""Trust with the banks is so important.""Although not having run for as long  and coming during an IPO drought  graduates of SIX’s Sparks IPO Academy are looking to come to market.Around 40 companies have come through the programme of which two have embarked on the IPO process  however these are currently on hold until market conditions improve.In addition to the knowledge gained during the programme one of the companies acquired a new chairman via the mentoring pool.Varied listing optionsThe programmes are not just for those larger companies that could go straight to listing on the main market of an exchange. SIX operates Sparks Exchange  tailored specifically for SMEs coming through the programme  though companies could go straight for a Swiss main market listing if suitable. The same is true for SIX-owned Spanish exchange BME.""We’re trying to reach companies who wouldn’t think going public is available to them "" said Jesus Gonzalez  head of BME Growth and BME Scaleup  who said the aim is to find a balance between what smaller companies can do and what investors need.BME Scaleup launched in June and gives smaller companies longer to prepare audit reports and does not have minimum free-float requirements.BME’s Pre-Market Environment is a programme of training and networking that pairs companies with a mentor analyst from BME Growth.The programme started four years ago and has seen six companies list on the growth market.""We aim to be with them from the very beginning "" said Gonzalez. ""If you wait to attract a US$10bn company from scratch it is very difficult as they are free to list when and where they want  and don’t necessarily value a local listing. Walking alongside them is very important.""In London consideration is also taking place beyond traditional public markets with innovations such as a proposed intermittent trading venue that allows private companies to trade unlisted shares at regular intervals and a partnership with Floww  a networking platform linking companies with venture capitalists and angel investors.""We recognise that companies have unique funding needs and that for some an IPO might not be the most suitable way to access capital ” said Stuttard. “These needs will change as a company grows and develops  whether that is eventually through an IPO or accessing capital in private markets. We have solutions and tools to support them to ensure a seamless funding continuum through their journey.""",neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,mixed,0.62,0.23,0.15,True,English,"['pre-IPO training programmes', 'school', 'Europe', 'The London Stock Exchange', 'sparse European IPO activity', 'six-month IPO preparation scheme', 'group listing activities', 'next three years', 'French chemical group', 'CFO Maxime Cordonnier', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'senior relationship manager', 'private equity portfolios', 'other exchange programmes', 'Sparks IPO Academy', 'Business Growth Fund', '€66.5m Paris IPO', 'UK primary markets', 'The Euronext programme', 'six-month programme', 'primary capital', 'equity story', 'senior executives', 'second year', 'one focus', 'new listings', 'early stage', 'IPO-ready candidates', 'financial ecosystem', 'person sessions', 'corporate governance', 'financial readiness', 'valuation considerations', 'networking events', 'central role', 'common one', 'clear view', 'financing options', 'small-cap businesses', 'Workshop sessions', 'accounting firms', 'key aspect', 'day jobs', 'Borsa Italiana', 'different stages', 'One benefit', 'Catapult Network', 'venture capital', 'Many features', 'direct advice', 'monthly events', 'panel sessions', 'lunch sessions', 'IPO forums', 'valid opportunity', 'specific recommendations', 'Successful alumni', 'formal programme', 'Elite programme', 'public company', 'company performance', 'A company', 'existing programmes', 'Innovate UK', 'key area', 'third round', 'necessary tools', 'Fabian Gerber', 'Aurelien Narminio', 'company executives', 'IPOready programme', 'TechShare programme', 'exit option', 'IPO process', 'Marcus Stuttard', 'greater number', 'fast-growing companies', 'prospective companies', 'SIX.', '16 companies', '25 companies', 'exchanges', 'education', 'relevance', 'benefits', 'knowledge', 'capability', 'investors', 'life', 'pipeline', 'range', 'criteria', 'turnover', 'prominence', 'mixture', 'online', 'topics', 'buyside', 'experts', 'goal', 'gaps', 'idea', 'lot', 'misconceptions', 'IPOs', 'development', 'means', 'FamilyShare', 'terms', 'challenges', 'head', 'Participants', 'lack', 'discussion', 'unicorns', 'valuations', 'tens', 'millions', 'euros', 'prospectus', 'sustainability', 'introductions', 'banks', 'lawyers', 'deals', 'CFOs', '2021 edition', 'experience', 'developer', 'AIM', 'LSE', 'needs', 'diversity', 'structured', 'organisations', 'example', 'networks', 'connections', 'addition', 'breakfast', 'contact', 'founders', 'entrepreneurs', 'time', 'advisers', 'chemistry', 'roster', 'size', 'sector', 'base', 'IFR', 'Afyren', 'September', 'people', 'mountain']",2023-12-15,2023-12-15,ifre.com
