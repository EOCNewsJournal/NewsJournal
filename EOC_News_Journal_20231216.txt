The total number of shares that may be issued shall amount to not more than the number of shares that corresponds to sufficient issue proceeds mainly for the purpose to refinance the company's bridge loan facility of approximately USD 120 million for the acquisition of Red Lion Controls Inc. and Red Lion Europe GMBH as well as certain assets in other jurisdictions (“Red Lion”) and  additionally  to secure an efficient capital structure.

This roadmap builds upon the collaborative and successful partnership between ADNOC and OCI formed with the creation of Fertiglobe in 2019 and demonstrated by its successful landmark initial public offering (""IPO"") in 2021.Headquartered in Abu Dhabi  Fertiglobe was formed as a strategic partnership between OCI and ADNOC in September 2019  with a subsequent listing on the ADX in 2021. The value-added partnership created a first-mover innovative export platform with best-in-class cash conversion metrics throughout the commodity cycle. Fertiglobe today is the world's largest seaborne exporter of ammonia.

A world first  this solution will allow the generation of 131 GW…,"Veolia launches the deployment of a residual cold recovery solution at the Enagás LNG terminal in Barcelona. A world first  this solution will allow the generation of 131 GWh of local  affordable and environmentally-friendly energy per year. Commissioning is scheduled for the 2nd quarter of 2024. This solution allows us to avoid the emissions linked to energy production that would have been necessary in the absence of recovered energy. This represents over 42 000 tonnes of CO2 avoided per year for the Barcelona project.This innovation is part of Veolia's strategy to make the most of local  available and affordable energy. It allows to recover the energy emitted during the conventional regasification process  which circulates liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the seawater loop at minus 160°C in order to deliver it to the network in the form of gas at a temperature of around -2°C / 0°C. The cold generated during this process is generally rejected into the sea  and therefore lost.With over 150 regasification terminals worldwide  this solution offers considerable technological potential  particularly for sites where urban and industrial densities are sufficiently suitable for its implementation.Thanks to the cooperation with Enagás and the commitment of Barcelona City Council  Veolia will be able to supply the port area of Barcelona with decarbonated local energy  using energy from the residual cold of the LNG terminal  which will be recycled and reinjected into the urban grid. In this way  the project will contribute to the competitiveness of several industrial and tertiary sites  public infrastructures (Palacio de Congresos) and the Mercabarna  a major food market for the region  all located in the port area. This is a major asset for these economic players  who are seeking to decarbonize their energy consumption while controlling energy costs in an area undergoing major urban transformation and striving for sustainability.""In the fight against global warming  we must do everything in our power to avoid unnecessary energy loss and waste. The recovery of waste heat and cold is thus a major component of Veolia's strategy for the ecological transformation of its energy mix. The replicability of the project initiated in Barcelona  which transforms lost cold into local  available and environmentally-friendly energy  opens up huge potential. Original and virtuous  it demonstrates the positive impact of territorial energy solutions on the decarbonization and competitiveness of territories "" commented Estelle Brachlianoff  Chief Executive Officer of Veolia.About VeoliaVeolia group aims to be the benchmark company for ecological transformation. In 2022  with nearly 213 000 employees worldwide  the Group designs and provides game-changing solutions that are both useful and practical for water  waste and energy management.

December 15  2023. Sanofi  DNDi and the HAT-r-ACC consortium announce the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive scientific opinion of Fexinidazole Winthrop as first oral treatment of acute form of sleeping sickness (rhodesiense). This positive opinion is for the treatment in adults and children six years of age or older and weighing at least 20 kg  of both first-stage (haemo-lymphatic) and second-stage (meningo-encephalitic) Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.) rhodesiense sleeping sickness  an acute and lethal form of this parasitic disease found in Eastern and Southern Africa.This CHMP opinion follows an application by Sanofi under Article 58 and clinical trials in Malawi and Uganda led by the non-profit medical research organization Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi). The CHMP first adopted in 2018  a positive opinion of Fexinidazole Winthrop as the first all-oral treatment   in adults and children six years of age or older and weighing at least 20 kg  of both first-stage (haemo-lymphatic) and second-stage (meningo-encephalitic) of the more common T.b. gambiense form of sleeping sickness found in West and Central Africa.Sleeping sickness  or human African trypanosomiasis (HAT)  is usually fatal without treatment. Both forms of sleeping sickness are transmitted by the bite of infected tsetse flies  which are found in 36 African countries. It causes neuropsychiatric symptoms  including aggressiveness  psychosis  a debilitating disruption of sleep patterns that have given this neglected disease its name  and ultimately  death.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDHead of Development and Chief Medical Officer  Sanofi“The CHMP’s positive opinion is another step forward in Sanofi’s commitment to help deliver innovative treatments to vulnerable patient communities impacted by sleeping sickness  a deadly neglected tropical disease. By working with WHO and DNDi  we have made tremendous progress in improving treatment outcomes and simplifying treatment delivery. This partnership and our donation of Fexinidazole Winthrop through Foundation S  reflect our mission to provide innovative treatments to patients  no matter where they live.”For the T.b. rhodesiense variant  Fexinidazole Winthrop is indicated as a 10-day  once-daily oral treatment. Data from DNDi’s Phase 2/3 clinical trial were recently presented at the European Congress of Tropical Medicine and International Health and showed that Fexinidazole Winthrop was highly effective in treating the T.b. rhodesiense form of sleeping sickness and is a safe alternative to the existing drugs. In periodic follow-up evaluations that continued for 12 months after treatment  only one patient (2.94%) with the advanced form of the disease had relapsed and required treatment with the arsenic derivative that is the standard of care for patients with the most severe stage of the disease.Dr Westain NyirendaPrincipal Investigator and physician at Rumphi Hospital in Malawi“T.b. rhodesiense sleeping sickness is a terrifying disease that progresses more rapidly than T.b. gambiense  killing quickly if untreated. Until now  due to the lack of innovation for this strain of sleeping sickness  old and toxic treatment options have to be administered in a hospital under strict surveillance. Having a simple and safer oral pill to treat this frightening disease will allow doctors to rapidly save lives. It will also help patients to trust the new treatment.”While humans are the main host of T.b. gambiense  T.b. rhodesiense is a zoonotic disease  meaning that the infection can spread from animals to humans. Cattle and wild animals such as bushbucks and zebras are the most common reservoirs for this disease. Movements of these animals – potentially sparked by droughts or changes in climate – could put new populations at risk of T.b. rhodesiense sleeping sickness. In some cases  tourists visiting game reserves have been infected with T.b. rhodesiense.Dr Olaf Valverde MordtClinical Project Leader for sleeping sickness  DNDi“We are already seeing how an all-oral treatment for T.b. gambiense sleeping sickness has simplified the treatment of this variant in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo. Although there are comparatively few cases of T.b. rhodesiense  last year Ethiopia recorded its first cases since the 1970s. The drought at the time of the infections brought humans and cattle in closer proximity to tsetse flies’ habitat. Environmental changes could be one of the reasons behind this resurgence.”The CHMP opinion today paves the way for the update of WHO guidelines on treatment for sleeping sickness  and distribution by WHO of Fexinidazole Winthrop in African countries where T.b. rhodesiense is prevalent. Fexinidazole Winthrop will be donated to WHO by Foundation S  Sanofi’s philanthropic organization.Dr Ibrahima Socé FallDirector of Neglected Tropical Diseases  World Health Organization“The impact of climate change extends to the shifting geographical spread of vector-borne diseases such as sleeping sickness  heightening the likelihood of spillover events where diseases transfer from animals to humans. These shifts disproportionately affect the most vulnerable communities  underscoring the urgency of sustained investment in programs addressing NTDs. This includes the development of innovative tools and improved treatment methods. We extend our gratitude to our partners DNDi for their research for the most neglected and Sanofi for their ongoing support and contribution to these vital efforts.”Fexinidazole Winthrop has already been registered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda as a treatment for T.b. gambiense and is recommended for use in a further 10 African countries: (Angola  Burkina Faso  Central African Republic  Chad  Congo  Côte d'Ivoire  Equatorial Guinea  Gabon  Guinea  and South Sudan).Dr Michelle HelinskiSenior Project Officer for Neglected Infectious Diseases at the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Association (EDCTP)“We congratulate the HAT-r-ACC consortium on developing a better treatment option for this truly neglected disease and are thrilled with the positive opinion by CHMP.”The DNDi clinical trial for T.b. rhodesiense was conducted by the HAT-r-ACC Consortium  with funding from the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Association (EDCTP2) programme supported by the European Union; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia from Portugal; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC)  from Switzerland; Médecins Sans Frontières International; and UK International Development  United Kingdom; and other private foundations and individuals.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

December 15  2023. Sanofi  DNDi and the HAT-r-ACC consortium ann…,Official SANOFI press releaseEMA gives positive opinion to Fexinidazole Winthrop as first oral treatment of acute form of sleeping sickness (rhodesiense) found in East and Southern AfricaParis  Geneva and Nairobi. December 15  2023. Sanofi  DNDi and the HAT-r-ACC consortium announce the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive scientific opinion of Fexinidazole Winthrop as first oral treatment of acute form of sleeping sickness (rhodesiense). This positive opinion is for the treatment in adults and children six years of age or older and weighing at least 20 kg  of both first-stage (haemo-lymphatic) and second-stage (meningo-encephalitic) Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.) rhodesiense sleeping sickness  an acute and lethal form of this parasitic disease found in Eastern and Southern Africa.This CHMP opinion follows an application by Sanofi under Article 58 and clinical trials in Malawi and Uganda led by the non-profit medical research organization Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi). The CHMP first adopted in 2018  a positive opinion of Fexinidazole Winthrop as the first all-oral treatment   in adults and children six years of age or older and weighing at least 20 kg  of both first-stage (haemo-lymphatic) and second-stage (meningo-encephalitic) of the more common T.b. gambiense form of sleeping sickness found in West and Central Africa.Sleeping sickness  or human African trypanosomiasis (HAT)  is usually fatal without treatment. Both forms of sleeping sickness are transmitted by the bite of infected tsetse flies  which are found in 36 African countries. It causes neuropsychiatric symptoms  including aggressiveness  psychosis  a debilitating disruption of sleep patterns that have given this neglected disease its name  and ultimately  death.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDHead of Development and Chief Medical Officer  Sanofi“The CHMP’s positive opinion is another step forward in Sanofi’s commitment to help deliver innovative treatments to vulnerable patient communities impacted by sleeping sickness  a deadly neglected tropical disease. By working with WHO and DNDi  we have made tremendous progress in improving treatment outcomes and simplifying treatment delivery. This partnership and our donation of Fexinidazole Winthrop through Foundation S  reflect our mission to provide innovative treatments to patients  no matter where they live.”For the T.b. rhodesiense variant  Fexinidazole Winthrop is indicated as a 10-day  once-daily oral treatment. Data from DNDi’s Phase 2/3 clinical trial were recently presented at the European Congress of Tropical Medicine and International Health and showed that Fexinidazole Winthrop was highly effective in treating the T.b. rhodesiense form of sleeping sickness and is a safe alternative to the existing drugs. In periodic follow-up evaluations that continued for 12 months after treatment  only one patient (2.94%) with the advanced form of the disease had relapsed and required treatment with the arsenic derivative that is the standard of care for patients with the most severe stage of the disease.Dr Westain NyirendaPrincipal Investigator and physician at Rumphi Hospital in Malawi“T.b. rhodesiense sleeping sickness is a terrifying disease that progresses more rapidly than T.b. gambiense  killing quickly if untreated. Until now  due to the lack of innovation for this strain of sleeping sickness  old and toxic treatment options have to be administered in a hospital under strict surveillance. Having a simple and safer oral pill to treat this frightening disease will allow doctors to rapidly save lives. It will also help patients to trust the new treatment.”While humans are the main host of T.b. gambiense  T.b. rhodesiense is a zoonotic disease  meaning that the infection can spread from animals to humans. Cattle and wild animals such as bushbucks and zebras are the most common reservoirs for this disease. Movements of these animals – potentially sparked by droughts or changes in climate – could put new populations at risk of T.b. rhodesiense sleeping sickness. In some cases  tourists visiting game reserves have been infected with T.b. rhodesiense.Dr Olaf Valverde MordtClinical Project Leader for sleeping sickness  DNDi“We are already seeing how an all-oral treatment for T.b. gambiense sleeping sickness has simplified the treatment of this variant in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo. Although there are comparatively few cases of T.b. rhodesiense  last year Ethiopia recorded its first cases since the 1970s. The drought at the time of the infections brought humans and cattle in closer proximity to tsetse flies’ habitat. Environmental changes could be one of the reasons behind this resurgence.”The CHMP opinion today paves the way for the update of WHO guidelines on treatment for sleeping sickness  and distribution by WHO of Fexinidazole Winthrop in African countries where T.b. rhodesiense is prevalent. Fexinidazole Winthrop will be donated to WHO by Foundation S  Sanofi’s philanthropic organization.Dr Ibrahima Socé FallDirector of Neglected Tropical Diseases  World Health Organization“The impact of climate change extends to the shifting geographical spread of vector-borne diseases such as sleeping sickness  heightening the likelihood of spillover events where diseases transfer from animals to humans. These shifts disproportionately affect the most vulnerable communities  underscoring the urgency of sustained investment in programs addressing NTDs. This includes the development of innovative tools and improved treatment methods. We extend our gratitude to our partners DNDi for their research for the most neglected and Sanofi for their ongoing support and contribution to these vital efforts.”Fexinidazole Winthrop has already been registered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda as a treatment for T.b. gambiense and is recommended for use in a further 10 African countries: (Angola  Burkina Faso  Central African Republic  Chad  Congo  Côte d'Ivoire  Equatorial Guinea  Gabon  Guinea  and South Sudan).Dr Michelle HelinskiSenior Project Officer for Neglected Infectious Diseases at the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Association (EDCTP)“We congratulate the HAT-r-ACC consortium on developing a better treatment option for this truly neglected disease and are thrilled with the positive opinion by CHMP.”The DNDi clinical trial for T.b. rhodesiense was conducted by the HAT-r-ACC Consortium  with funding from the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Association (EDCTP2) programme supported by the European Union; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia from Portugal; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC)  from Switzerland; Médecins Sans Frontières International; and UK International Development  United Kingdom; and other private foundations and individuals.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.
