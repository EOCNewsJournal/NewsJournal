34025,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/589161-russian-central-bank-warning-euro/,Russian central bank chief warns about credibility of euro,The euro could lose its status as a reserve currency if Brussels taps into frozen Russian assets  Elvira Nabiullina says Read Full Article at RT.com,The currency’s reputation has been jeopardized by Brussels’ freezing of Russian assets  Elvira Nabiullina saysThe euro could lose its status as a global reserve currency if Brussels goes through with threats to use frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine  the head of the Russian central bank  Elvira Nabiullina  warned on Friday.“As for the withdrawal of income from investing frozen funds  both the withdrawal and  in principle  the freezing of funds  in our opinion  worsens the prospects for the development of the euro as a reserve currency [and] its use in international settlements ” she said at a press briefing.Nabiullina noted that the regulator is currently working on ways to return the frozen assets  possibly through court  though the process could be “challenging.”The EU  US  and their allies have frozen billions worth of Russian sovereign assets and property belonging to Russian individuals and entities since last year as part of a sanctions campaign against Moscow over the Ukraine conflict. Western states have been actively exploring ways to use these funds to aid Kiev  despite repeated warnings from both Russia and numerous Western experts that this could jeopardize global trust in the Western financial system and its currencies.EU proposals have so far focused on skimming off profits generated from Russian assets held in its depositories  such as Euroclear  where €191 billion ($208 billion) in sovereign assets are held  instead of seizing the funds outright  as the latter could be more legally challenging.However  according to this week’s report from the Financial Times  citing an unnamed G7 official  the group has recently stepped up discussions on seizing Russia’s sovereign assets “as a countermeasure to induce Russia to end its aggression” and already determined a way to do it “consistent with international law.” The group is reportedly planning to come up with a detailed proposal by its leaders’ meeting on the second anniversary of the Ukraine conflict in February next year.Russia considers the freezing of its assets unlawful  and the potential seizure of the funds as outright theft.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.04,0.66,0.31,negative,0.02,0.2,0.78,True,English,"['Russian central bank chief', 'credibility', 'euro', 'numerous Western experts', 'Russian central bank', 'Western financial system', 'global reserve currency', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'Western states', 'Russian individuals', 'global trust', 'Financial Times', 'frozen assets', 'international settlements', 'press briefing', 'billions worth', 'last year', 'sanctions campaign', 'G7 official', 'international law', 'detailed proposal', 'leaders’ meeting', 'second anniversary', 'potential seizure', 'outright theft', 'business section', 'Elvira Nabiullina', 'Ukraine conflict', 'frozen funds', 'EU proposals', 'Brussels’ freezing', 'reputation', 'euro', 'status', 'threats', 'head', 'Friday', 'withdrawal', 'income', 'principle', 'opinion', 'prospects', 'development', 'use', 'regulator', 'ways', 'court', 'process', 'allies', 'property', 'entities', 'part', 'Moscow', 'Kiev', 'repeated', 'warnings', 'currencies', 'profits', 'depositories', 'week', 'report', 'unnamed', 'group', 'discussions', 'countermeasure', 'aggression', 'February', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-12-16,2023-12-17,rt.com
