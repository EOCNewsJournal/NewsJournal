The Requisition proposes to remove five existing directors from the Board of the Company  with five new directors proposed as replacements  and also requests the Board put forth a resolution to require the Company to initiate a strategic review process. The Board considers that Vision Capital's actions are part of a campaign to undermine the good governance of the Company and to override normal corporate governance standards. The Board believes an EGM is not in the interests of the Company's shareholders and wider stakeholders. The Board is in the process of reviewing the content and validity of the Requisition with its advisers. A further announcement will be made in due course. In the meantime  shareholders are urged to take no action.
