This was mainly due to the expansion of the property portfolio and index-based rent increases. By contrast  the result from property management was burdened by higher running costs and expenses relating to other periods and therefore rose only marginally.Funds from operations (""FFO"")  on the other hand  declined and fell by around 19.4% year-on-year to EUR 33.1 million (previous year: EUR 41.1 million) or EUR 0.66 per share (fully diluted) (previous year: EUR 0.82 per share). FFO is therefore below the guidance (EUR 36 million to EUR 39 million). This was primarily due to significantly higher net interest expenses  which were around EUR 6.3 million higher than in the previous year  as well as higher property management expenses.Similarly  aFFO (FFO after deduction of capitalised modernisation measures) declined and amounted to around EUR 11.1 million (previous year: EUR 22.5 million) due to several major revitalisation measures (capex) at various properties.Property portfolio enlarged / portfolio devalued by EUR 114 millionAs a result of the transfer of ownership of twelve properties acquired in the previous year less three properties sold in the financial year  the property portfolio grew by a total of nine properties with an area of around 35 000 square metres and generates an annual rent of around EUR 79.2 million (30 September 2022: EUR 73.2 million).The annual revaluation of the property portfolio as at 30 September 2023  on the other hand  leads to a devaluation of around 9% (like-for-like) and a negative valuation result of around EUR 114 million  which is mainly due to the significant change in the interest rate environment with higher interest rates in many cases. After years of significant revaluations fuelled by the low interest rate policy  the ECB's interest rate turnaround with ten interest rate hikes in a row resulted in a valuation decline for the first time. Accordingly  DKR's real estate portfolio (including properties for sale) is valued at around EUR 995 million as at 30 September 2023 which equals around 12.6x the annual rent (30 September 2022: EUR 1 050 million or 14.2x the annual rent).The gross acquisition yield of the overall portfolio averaged more than 10% as at 30 September 2023.Repayment and collateral agreement with Obotritia Capital KGaA concluded on outstanding loan / value adjustment of the loanOn 9 December 2023  DKR reached a notarised agreement with Obotritia Capital KGaA regarding the repayment of the outstanding loan receivable  which amounted to EUR 62.5 million as at the balance sheet date. DKR was also granted a comprehensive collateral package. In return  DKR granted Obotritia a deferral of the loan receivable until 30 June 2025 at the latest. For reasons of prudence  DKR has based the carrying amount of the loan exclusively on very short-term and realisable collaterals and has thus made a value adjustment to the loan of around 70%.First-time recognition of deferred taxesFurthermore  the Management Board has decided that  due to the unclear time perspective and the unclear outcome of the legal dispute with the Brandenburg tax authorities with regard to maintaining REIT status  all possible tax risks will be recognised for reasons of prudence. Accordingly  the previously recognised tax receivables are derecognised and deferred taxes are recognised for the first time. This leads to tax expenses totalling around EUR 50.2 million in the annual financial statements  of which around EUR 31.7 million comprises the first-time recognition of (non-cash) deferred taxes. The difference of around EUR 18.5 million comprises the recognition of back tax payments for the period from 2016 onwards  of which a portion had already been settled by DKR as at the balance sheet date and further payments were made by the Company after the balance sheet date.Total comprehensive income for the period at EUR -181 million / No dividend for the 2022/2023 financial yearFor the full year 2022/2023  there is a negative result for the period totalling around EUR -181 million  which is significantly influenced by non-cash expenses such as the property devaluation (EUR -113.5 million)  the value adjustment of the loan receivable from Obotritia Capital KGaA (EUR -40.1 million) and the first-time recognition of deferred tax liabilities (EUR -31.7 million).As previously announced  no dividend proposal can be made due to the negative annual result for the past financial year 2022/2023.EPRA NTA (fully diluted) at EUR 7.64 per share / Net LTV increases to around 61.6%After accounting for all of the aforementioned risks  the EPRA NTA (fully diluted) as at 30 September 2023 is around EUR 7.64 per share (30 September 2022: EUR 10.98 per share). This means that the intrinsic value of the share is still significantly higher than the current share price.The net LTV increased to 61.6% on the balance sheet date  mainly due to the devaluation of the property portfolio and the value adjustment of the loan.Conference CallDeutsche Konsum REIT-AG will hold an analysts' conference (webcast and conference call) on the annual results of the 2022/2023 financial year today  19 December 2023  10:00 a.m. CET/11:00 SAST.

The DSMB experts completed their latest regular safety assessment of the randomized  multicentred and double-blind phase 3 trial of DONESTA® in Europe (C301)  which has recruited 300 additional menopausal non-hysterectomised women  and recommended to continue the study extension. The last patient-out is expected in Q1 2024. Positive efficacy top line results have been previously reported from the menopause phase 3 program  including the European trial. Top level safety conclusions were reported as well from the US trial (C302). Mithra plans to submit DONESTA® for the treatment on menopause symptoms for approval by regulators in the U.S. and Europe in Q4 2024.Graham Dixon  Chief Scientific Officer of Mithra  commented  “This DSMB recommendation allows us to continue the extension of the DONESTA® phase 3 trial in Europe  which will generate important data for our marketing authorization applications. The role of the DSMB is to review the safety profile of a treatment during the clinical study  and to independently safeguard the interests of study participants. The DSMB review general safety data and endometrial safety data across the studies at regular  pre-defined intervals while the clinical studies are ongoing. The DSMB’s decision is a testament to the safety of DONESTA®— our next generation orally administrated E4-based hormone therapy product candidate— which offers a potential long-term solution for treating various symptoms of menopause.”E4 is the first native and selective estrogen  present in developing human fetuses and is manufactured from a plant-based source. It acts differently from classical estrogens and its unique metabolism results in a low impact on haemostasis and breast tissue with an expected improvement in the benefit-to-risk profile.In early 2022  Mithra announced positive top-line efficacy results of the DONESTA® phase 3 program  which demonstrated a meaningful reduction in vasomotor symptoms of menopause (VMS) from baseline and compared to placebo with all co-primary efficacy endpoints statistically met. Data also showed improved quality of life and reduction of genito-urinary symptoms of menopause  as secondary efficacy endpoints. Promising top-line safety results from the phase 3 trial in North America (C302) were announced in 2023  and primary safety data from the European trial are expected in H1 2024.Mithra has agreed with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that it will conduct additional endometrial data analyses  due to a variation observed by Mithra in the endometrial biopsy diagnoses  which could have resulted in a limited addressable market for DONESTA®. The US new drug application (NDA)  including the complementary data  is expected in Q4 2024. This additional safety data is foreseen to be included in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and FDA submissions  planned within the same time frame.For more information  please contact:Mithra Pharmaceuticals SAAlex Sokolowski  PhDHead of IR & Communicationsinvestorrelations@mithra.com +32 (0)4 349 28 22Frédérique DepraetereCommunications Directorinfo@mithra.com+32 (0)4 349 28 22About MithraMithra Pharmaceuticals SA (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming Women’s Health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

NCX 470  a novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop  is our lead product candidate in Phase 3 clinical development for IOP lowering in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.“The model we are using to investigate the effects on aqueous humor outflow is well established and we are pleased to be working with one of the experts in this field  Dr Arthur Sit at the Mayo Clinic. The data from this trial is expected to provide further evidence of the dual mechanism of action of NCX 470 as we should be able to tease out parameters related to how the nitric oxide and the prostaglandin analog components of NCX 470 function.” said Doug Hubatsch  EVP  Chief Scientific Officer of Nicox.The Whistler Phase 3b trial will enroll ~20 healthy volunteers with ocular hypertension in a double-masked  placebo-controlled study which will investigate the action of NCX 470 on aqueous humor parameters including trabecular meshwork outflow and episcleral venous pressure. Each subject will participate in the trial for ~8 days and will provide insight into the mechanism of action of NCX 470. The trial is expected to take approximately 1 year to complete.Nicox Corporate Status UpdateThe Company is currently funded until the end of June 2024  exclusively on the basis of the development of NCX 470. The Company is pursuing licensing discussions which could extend the cash runway. In parallel  the Company is exploring multiple strategic options and is also discussing with its creditors to restructure its debt.About NCX 470NCX 470  a novel NO-donating bimatoprost eye drop  is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the lowering of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

The purpose of the study was to provide an initial safety assessment of a TET vaccine as a basis for future TET platform development. TET is a new therapeutic vaccine concept for activating specific T cells that can target and eradicate cancer cells.“We value the positive outcome of this exploratory study as well as the results from dedicated efforts in preclinical research  technology development and manufacturing. These advances position us for the future expansion of our proprietary technologies with the potential to develop new vaccine candidates ” said Carlos de Sousa  Chief Executive Officer of Ultimovacs. “We have an exciting year ahead of us  with important clinical trial readouts and upcoming value-inflection points in our UV1 clinical development program.”The TENDU trial is a first-in-human  dose-escalation trial with a TET therapeutic cancer vaccine  with the objective of generating initial safety and immune activation data. The trial investigated a prostate cancer-specific therapeutic vaccine in patients experiencing relapse after radical prostatectomy. Twelve patients were enrolled in the trial  which was conducted at the Oslo University Hospital. Three dose levels were explored. Three patients were treated with each of the two lower doses (40 and 400 microgram)  while six patients received the high dose (960 microgram).The dose range investigated in the study was considered safe. No serious adverse reactions were reported  and there were no indications of systemic risks of cytokine release or complement activation. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed  indicating a potential for increasing the dose of tetanus-based vaccines in future clinical studies. Vaccine specific T cell responses were observed indicating immune activation. Further results from the study will be presented in a peer-reviewed publication.In parallel with the TENDU study  Ultimovacs is conducting activities to develop and explore the potential of the TET vaccine technology platform. Preclinical experiments support the TET concept of targeted delivery of antigens and adjuvant signals to antigen presenting cells. The combination of exploratory research using Ultimovacs’ conjugation technology  significant progress made in the manufacturing process and the clinical data provide a valuable basis for potential expansion of Ultimovacs’ pipeline. Ultimovacs’ will continue the ongoing TET non-clinical activities. Future development of TET-based vaccine candidates in prostate cancer and other indications will take into consideration the evolution of the therapeutic landscape and medical needs in different tumor types.==ENDS==About TENDUThe TENDU clinical trial (NCT04701021) is an exploratory  first-in-human  phase I study and the first clinical trial of a vaccine from Ultimovacs' Tetanus-Epitope Targeting (TET)-platform. The study was conducted at Oslo University Hospital  Norway  and evaluated the safety of the vaccine in patients with documented progressive disease (radiologically assessed  PSA progression  or both) after radical prostatectomy. The study's primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of three different dose levels of the vaccine. Patients received the vaccine before obtaining standard-of-care treatment consisting of radiation and antihormone therapy. The patients were followed for six months after the last dose of the vaccine for assessment of immunological responses  including antibody response to the tetanus-derived parts of the vaccine and T cell responses against the vaccine antigens.About the TET-platformAll vaccines consist of two components  adjuvant and antigen. The adjuvant activates the immune system so that a relevant immune response can occur. The antigen directs the quality of the immune response. Together  the adjuvant and the antigen ensure a specific and effective immune response.The Tetanus-Epitope Targeting (TET) technology offers an approach to strengthening and increasing T cell responses against tumor cells by conjugating cancer-specific antigens and peptides derived from tetanus into one molecule. The technology harnesses the immune activation function of immune complexes that is formed between the tetanus-derived parts of the TET vaccine molecules and pre-existing antibodies against tetanus resulting from standard tetanus vaccinations. The strategy thereby allows for targeted delivery of antigens and adjuvant signals to dendritic cells. The TET technology is a platform technology for generation of new  first-in-class cancer vaccine candidates that can be tailored to many types of cancer.About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines with broad applicability. Ultimovacs’ lead cancer vaccine candidate UV1 is directed against human telomerase (hTERT)  an antigen present in 85-90% of cancers in all stages of tumor growth. A broad clinical program  with Phase II trials in five cancer indications enrolling more than 670 patients  aims to demonstrate UV1’s impact in combination with other immunotherapies in multiple cancer types expressing telomerase and where patients have unmet medical needs. UV1 is universal  off-the-shelf and easy to use  and is a patented technology owned by Ultimovacs.In addition  Ultimovacs holds all rights of the proprietary TET technology platform for any possible future use of formulations in various solid tumor indications.

These advances position us for the future expansion of our proprietary technologies with the potential to develop new vaccine candidates ” said Carlos de Sousa  Chief Executive Officer of Ultimovacs. “We have an exciting year ahead of us  with important clinical trial readouts and upcoming value-inflection points in our UV1 clinical development program.”The TENDU trial is a first-in-human  dose-escalation trial with a TET therapeutic cancer vaccine  with the objective of generating initial safety and immune activation data. The trial investigated a prostate cancer-specific therapeutic vaccine in patients experiencing relapse after radical prostatectomy. Twelve patients were enrolled in the trial  which was conducted at the Oslo University Hospital. Three dose levels were explored. Three patients were treated with each of the two lower doses (40 and 400 microgram)  while six patients received the high dose (960 microgram).The dose range investigated in the study was considered safe. No serious adverse reactions were reported  and there were no indications of systemic risks of cytokine release or complement activation. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed  indicating a potential for increasing the dose of tetanus-based vaccines in future clinical studies. Vaccine specific T cell responses were observed indicating immune activation. Further results from the study will be presented in a peer-reviewed publication.In parallel with the TENDU study  Ultimovacs is conducting activities to develop and explore the potential of the TET vaccine technology platform. Preclinical experiments support the TET concept of targeted delivery of antigens and adjuvant signals to antigen presenting cells. The combination of exploratory research using Ultimovacs’ conjugation technology  significant progress made in the manufacturing process and the clinical data provide a valuable basis for potential expansion of Ultimovacs’ pipeline. Ultimovacs’ will continue the ongoing TET non-clinical activities. Future development of TET-based vaccine candidates in prostate cancer and other indications will take into consideration the evolution of the therapeutic landscape and medical needs in different tumor types.==ENDS==About TENDUThe TENDU clinical trial (NCT04701021) is an exploratory  first-in-human  phase I study and the first clinical trial of a vaccine from Ultimovacs' Tetanus-Epitope Targeting (TET)-platform. The study was conducted at Oslo University Hospital  Norway  and evaluated the safety of the vaccine in patients with documented progressive disease (radiologically assessed  PSA progression  or both) after radical prostatectomy. The study's primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of three different dose levels of the vaccine. Patients received the vaccine before obtaining standard-of-care treatment consisting of radiation and antihormone therapy. The patients were followed for six months after the last dose of the vaccine for assessment of immunological responses  including antibody response to the tetanus-derived parts of the vaccine and T cell responses against the vaccine antigens.About the TET-platformAll vaccines consist of two components  adjuvant and antigen. The adjuvant activates the immune system so that a relevant immune response can occur. The antigen directs the quality of the immune response. Together  the adjuvant and the antigen ensure a specific and effective immune response.The Tetanus-Epitope Targeting (TET) technology offers an approach to strengthening and increasing T cell responses against tumor cells by conjugating cancer-specific antigens and peptides derived from tetanus into one molecule. The technology harnesses the immune activation function of immune complexes that is formed between the tetanus-derived parts of the TET vaccine molecules and pre-existing antibodies against tetanus resulting from standard tetanus vaccinations. The strategy thereby allows for targeted delivery of antigens and adjuvant signals to dendritic cells. The TET technology is a platform technology for generation of new  first-in-class cancer vaccine candidates that can be tailored to many types of cancer.About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines with broad applicability. Ultimovacs’ lead cancer vaccine candidate UV1 is directed against human telomerase (hTERT)  an antigen present in 85-90% of cancers in all stages of tumor growth. A broad clinical program  with Phase II trials in five cancer indications enrolling more than 670 patients  aims to demonstrate UV1’s impact in combination with other immunotherapies in multiple cancer types expressing telomerase and where patients have unmet medical needs. UV1 is universal  off-the-shelf and easy to use  and is a patented technology owned by Ultimovacs.In addition  Ultimovacs holds all rights of the proprietary TET technology platform for any possible future use of formulations in various solid tumor indications.

ENOGIA will design  engineer  manufacture and test the main supercritical CO2 turbomachines used in this project where a groundbreaking Carnot battery architecture will be developed and tested by the partners of the project.This project emphasizes ENOGIA's recognized ability to develop cutting-edge supercritical CO2 turbomachinery  acquired through years of research and several development projects (including the H2020 I-Therm project). ENOGIA is also heavily involved in thermodynamic electricity storage research  which is a promising way of storing electricity without using limited and polluting resources such as chemical batteries.Total funding of the project is 4 7M€  including a grant of 875 5 k€ for ENOGIA to support its activities in the project critical hot sCO2 turbomachinery design  manufacturing and testing.Introducing SCO2OP-TES's Groundbreaking ""Carnot Batteries"" : EU Pioneers in Revolutionizing Energy StorageIn a bold move to revolutionize energy storage and transition towards renewable energy sources  the European Union has intensified its efforts through the innovative SCO2OP-TES project. This initiative is a pivotal part of the EU's strategy to reduce emissions in the energy and industrial sectors  further propelled by the recent REPowerEU Plan. The plan sets an ambitious goal of achieving 1236 GW of installed renewable energy source (RES) power capacity by 2030  a significant increase from the 1067 GW target set in the “Fit for 55” package. But this huge amount of RES needs a proper energy storage solution  that can guarantee both grid stability and the possibility to exploit RES all over the day and the year.Addressing the Challenges of Energy TransitionThe transition towards 100% RES by 2050 is indeed not without its challenges. Current inverter-driven storage methods  like batteries and power-to-hydrogen systems  fall short in covering specific grid flexibility services that only rotating machines can provide. In this sense the estimated 780 TWh electricity storage needed for EU RES transition cannot be provided only by battery  thus the EU is on the lookout for novel energy storage solutions that are not only cost-effective but also provide extended storage durations and grid services.SCO2OP-TES: A Step Towards Sustainable Energy FutureEnter SCO2OP-TES  a project that aims to develop and validate the next generation of Power-to¬Heat-to-Power (P2H2P) energy storage solutions. This project is a collaborative effort of 16 partners from 10 European countries  combining their expertise in advanced energy systems and turbomachinery  with a particular focus on sCO2 ones. The SCO2OP-TES project focuses on developing a new type of Carnot Battery that valorises freely available heat from thermal RES or waste heat from industries and fossil-based power plants  can guarantee high round-trip efficiency and makes industrial/power plants more grid-flexible.Empowering Europe's Energy TransitionSCO2OP-TES is more than just an energy storage project. It represents a technological paradigm shift  integrating Thermally Integrated-Pumped Thermal Energy Storage (TI-PTES) with supercritical CO2 (sCO2) cycles. This approach promises affordable long-duration (>10hrs) and large-scale storage solutions  crucial for integrating bulky RES into the EU energy systems and transforming traditional power plants into flexible renewable energy plants.Consortium PartnersThe SCO2OP-TES project brings together a diverse group of partners  each contributing unique expertise. The consortium partners  including leading universities  research centers  and industry experts  are united in their mission to develop sustainable  technically viable  and environmentally friendly energy storage solutions. Together  they are paving the way.To learn more about the SCO2OP-TES project and partners :https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101136000The project has been funded by the European Union in the Horizon Europe framework under Grant Agreement n. 10113600.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYVolta Finance posted a positive monthly performance of +1.8% in November 2023. This was the fifth positive month in a row and brought the YTD performance of the fund to 21.3%.From Sovereign debt to Equities  Credit and CLOs the rally experienced in November was extra-ordinary  fueled by better-than expected outcomes in terms of geopolitical risks  company earnings  macroeconomics indicators and central banks guidance. For instance  the VIX Index dropped below 12.5  a level not seen since the pre-pandemic era  while 10-year Treasuries moved from a yield of c. 5% to 4.3%. The Leveraged Loan market benefited indeed from the global rally  the Morningstar US Leverage Loan Index gained c. 60cts and the European one c. 30cts. CLO-wise  it became difficult to find bargains as bonds found strong bids while news that Primary transactions were all over-subscribed kept the positive momentum going. Near-term pipeline dried up and the lack of opportunities to invest before year-end gave legs to the rally into December.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: +0.5% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +2.4% for CLO Equity tranches  +3.3% for CLO Debt tranches and -0.5% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS. In terms of cashflows  Volta received €1.3m of distributions through the month  leading to €25.7m cashflow generation over the last 6 months or 21.1% annualized equivalent based on latest NAV.In terms of activity  we took advantage of the positive market momentum to realize profits on some of the most seasoned US CLO BB transactions of the fund. We then deployed part of the proceeds in fresh new issue transactions that benefit from higher carry and cleaner collateral portfolios. Our holding in REO (a non-CLO asset) was also sold  leaving the fund 97.5% invested in CLO (excluding cash). Overall  it was a fairly busy trading month for the fund with a total of seven individual trades being implemented (€12m equivalent in total).As of end of November 2023  Volta’s NAV was €243.6m  i.e. €6.66 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 4.83% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 0.72% as at 14 November 2023  0.98% as at 31 October  3.13% as at 30 September 2023.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCavendish Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

The income statement for the first half breaks down as follows: French standards in million euros From 01/03/23 to 08/31/23 From 01/03/22 to 08/31/22 Revenues 11 2 15 9 Cost of sales -5 2 -10 5 Other operational income -2 2 1 3 Gross Commercial Margin 3.8 6.7 External expenses 4 3 4 7 Personnel expenses 2 8 3 4 Tax and duties 0 1 0 1 Other operational expenses 0 0 0 3 Gross Operating Profit -3 4 -1 7 Depreciation and amortization 1 4 1 8 Operating income -4 9 -3 5 Financial income 2 9 0 1 Exceptional income -0 0 -0 7 Net income -1 8 -3 9Over the half-year  the downturn in sales was significant and was due to the following factors:-- The sale of the Boston sub-group-- Extremely long delivery times  particularly for Artificial Intelligence products  resulting in delayedorders for the first half of the year.-- The transfer of assembly  testing and logistics activities to the ""ADIMES"" subsidiary  resulting in adrop in both sales and payroll (from 3.4 to 2.8 million euros).-- Other operating income amounted to -2.2 million euros  compared with 1.3 million euros in 2022-2023  dueto lower production inventories during the year.Despite rigorous cost management  the gross operating surplus reflects the low level of activity for the semester and amounts to -3.4 million euros. After depreciation and amortization  operating income came to -4.9 million euros.The financial result includes an amount of 2.1 million euros resulting from the distribution of an interim dividend following the transfer of the Boston group.During this first semester  the net result shows a loss of -1.8 million euros. The current customer order book exceeds 40 million euros  and management forecasts a return to profit for the second semester ending on June 30  2024  for an exceptional duration of 10 months.A controlled financial situation2CRSi's bank loans and debts (including bank overdrafts) totaled 13.1 million euros at the end of August  including 10.4 million euros in bank loans. These are mainly composed of French State Guaranteed Loans (PGE) taken out since 2020.As a reminder  the Convertible Bonds were reimbursed in November 2023  for an amount of 1.201 million euros.During the first half  the loan that had financed the acquisition of Boston Ltd shares in December 2019 was repaid in full as part of the sale of BOSTON. The outstanding capital amounted to 9 million euros.Significant improvement in sales and earnings expected in the coming months2CRSi enters this period with very positive outlooks  both in terms of growth and improved results. This confidence is reinforced by recent commercial successes and the expansion of partnerships  which contribute to boosting the business.Following the refocusing achieved through the sale of its distribution business  2CRSi is now ideally positioned to fully leverage the research and development efforts undertaken since 2013. The current commercial successes of its products dedicated to Artificial Intelligence  'Godì 1.8NV' and 'Atlas 1.8 ' ensure an extraordinary growth forecast for the second half of the year.An 'Investor' presentation will be conducted in partnership with the French Society of Financial Analysts (SFAF) on January 31  2024  at 11:00 AM at the Maison de l'Alsace in Paris.The half-year financial report is available on the company's website  under the investors section: https:// investors.2crsi.com/en/annual-reports-registration-documents/About 2CRSiFounded in Strasbourg  the 2CRSi group designs  produces and markets customized  ecoresponsible high-performance IT servers. 2CRSi has been listed since June 2018 on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN Code: FR0013341781)  and its shares were transferred to Euronext Growth in November 2022.For more information: 2crsi.comContacts 2CRSi2CRSi Actifin Actifin Philippe Steinmetz Michael Scholze Stéphane Ruiz Group Chief Financial Office Financial Press Relations Financial communication sruiz@actifin.fr investors@2crsi.com michael.scholze@actifin.fr +33 1 80 18 26 33 +33 3 68 41 10 70 +33 1 56 88 11 14-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Regulatory filing PDF file File: 2CRSi half-year financial report 2023=---------------------------------------------------------------------- Language: English Company: 2CRSi SA 32  rue Jacobi-Netter 67200 Strasbourg France Phone: +33 3 68 41 10 70 E-mail: investors@2crsi.com Internet: www.2crsi.com ISIN: FR0013341781 Euronext Ticker: AL2SI AMF Category: Inside information / News release on accounts  results EQS News ID: 1800493 End of Announcement EQS News Service =------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1800493 19-Dec-2023 CET/CESTImage link: https://eqs-cockpit.com/cgi-bin/fncls.ssp?fn=show_t_gif&application_id=1800493&application_name=news(END) Dow Jones NewswiresDecember 19  2023 11:55 ET (16:55 GMT)",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.39,0.19,0.42,True,English,"['half-year financial report', '2CRSi SA', 'high-performance, energy-efficient IT solutions', 'current customer order book', 'French State Guaranteed Loans', 'current commercial successes', 'Annual General Meeting', '1,3 Gross Commercial Margin', 'long delivery times', 'lower production inventories', 'recent commercial successes', 'gross operating surplus', 'controlled financial situation', 'French Regulatory News', 'Other operational expenses', 'Other operational income', 'half-year financial report', 'extraordinary growth forecast', 'Other operating income', 'Boston Ltd shares', '0,3 Gross Operating Profit', 'Boston Limited group', '2023/24 financial year', 'Artificial Intelligence products', 'rigorous cost management', 'first fiscal half', 'DJ 2CRSi SA', 'Financial income', 'bank loans', 'half-yearly financial', 'financial statements', 'financial result', 'Financial Analysts', 'Boston group', 'EQS Group', 'French standards', 'External expenses', 'Personnel expenses', 'French Society', 'first half', 'income statement', 'Exceptional income', 'Net income', 'Boston sub-group', 'second half', 'fiscal year', 'CEST Dissemination', 'Press release', 'ISIN code', 'many issues', 'foreign subsidiaries', 'several decisions', 'following factors', 'logistics activities', 'ADIMES"" subsidiary', 'low level', 'interim dividend', 'net result', 'exceptional duration', 'bank overdrafts', 'Convertible Bonds', 'outstanding capital', 'Significant improvement', 'positive outlooks', 'development efforts', 'Godì 1.8NV', ""Investor' presentation"", 'Maison de', 'investors section', 'first semester', '2CRSi shares', 'million euros', 'distribution branch', 'second semester', 'Euronext Growth', 'exceptional period', 'coming months', 'distribution business', '9 Cost', '1 million', '9 million', '16 months', '10 months', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'Strasbourg', 'France', 'December', 'designer', 'manufacturer', 'publication', 'August', 'March', 'contract', 'sale', 'June', 'work', 'auditors', 'postponement', 'November', 'transfer', 'accordance', 'figures', 'extension', '01/03', '08/31/22', 'Revenues', 'Tax', 'duties', 'Depreciation', 'amortization', 'downturn', 'delayedorders', 'assembly', 'testing', 'adrop', 'payroll', 'activity', 'amount', 'loss', 'return', 'debts', 'PGE', 'reminder', 'acquisition', 'part', 'earnings', 'terms', 'results', 'confidence', 'expansion', 'refocusing', 'research', 'Atlas', 'SFAF', 'January', '11:00 AM', 'Paris', 'company', 'website', 'annual-reports-registration', 'documents', '0,0', '2.8']",2023-12-06,2023-12-19,finanznachrichten.de

March milling wheat BL2H4 ,"PARIS  Dec 19 (Reuters) - Euronext wheat eased on Tuesday to return to a two-week low as a sharp rise in the euro and ample offers of Russian wheat in an Egyptian tender maintained export concerns in western Europe.March milling wheat BL2H4  the most active contract on the Paris-based Euronext  was down 0.5% at 223.00 euros ($244.74) a metric ton by 1655 GMT.It earlier equalled Friday's two-week low of 222.50 euros but again found chart support at that level.Volumes on Euronext were again light  with year-end company meetings and the approach of the Christmas period keeping some participants away from their desks.The euro rallied against a broadly weaker dollar  making European grain more expensive overseas. FRX/Offers in Egypt's tender were mostly for Russian wheat  which was cheaper than other origins including French and Romanian wheat.""Russian wheat continues to dominate international purchase tenders despite the Russian export price floor and concern about the winter disruption to Black Sea logistics "" one German trader said.While the price advantage of Russian wheat in international tenders had narrowed due to a semi-official price floor that appeared to be around $260 a ton  free on board (fob)  Russian export prices in private deals remained much cheaper  traders said.In Germany  12% protein wheat for January delivery in Hamburg was offered for sale at a premium of about 5 euros over the Euronext March contract.Weekly European Union data on Tuesday showed the bloc has exported almost 14 million tons of soft wheat so far in 2023/24  14% less than a year ago.While the gap with last season has narrowed in recent weeks  helped by the incorporation of delayed Bulgarian figures  EU exports continued to be curbed by large Russian shipments as well as a revival in Ukrainian sea trade.($1 = 0.9112 euros)(Reporting by Gus Trompiz in Paris and Michael Hogan in Hamburg; editing by David Evans)((gus.trompiz@thomsonreuters.com; +33 1 49 49 52 18; Reuters Messaging: gus.trompiz.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq  Inc.",negative,0.01,0.17,0.82,negative,0.02,0.3,0.68,True,English,"['EU wheat', 'euro', 'export', 'doubts', 'Weekly European Union data', 'March milling wheat BL2H', 'Russian export price floor', 'semi-official price floor', 'year-end company meetings', 'Black Sea logistics', 'one German trader', 'Ukrainian sea trade', 'Russian export prices', 'large Russian shipments', 'international purchase tenders', 'Euronext March contract', 'export concerns', 'European grain', 'price advantage', 'international tenders', 'Russian wheat', 'active contract', 'Euronext wheat', 'Romanian wheat', '12% protein wheat', 'soft wheat', 'two-week low', 'sharp rise', 'western Europe', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'metric ton', 'chart support', 'Christmas period', 'weaker dollar', 'other origins', 'winter disruption', 'private deals', 'January delivery', '14 million tons', 'last season', 'recent weeks', 'Bulgarian figures', 'EU exports', 'Michael Hogan', 'David Evans', 'ample offers', 'Egyptian tender', 'Gus Trompiz', 'Reuters Messaging', 'Dec', 'Tuesday', '223.00 euros', '1655 GMT', '222.50 euros', 'level', 'Volumes', 'approach', 'participants', 'desks', 'FRX', 'French', 'board', 'fob', 'traders', 'Germany', 'Hamburg', 'sale', 'premium', '5 euros', 'bloc', 'gap', 'incorporation', 'revival', '0.9112 euros', 'thomsonreuters', 'views', 'opinions', 'author', 'Nasdaq']",2023-12-19,2023-12-19,nasdaq.com
