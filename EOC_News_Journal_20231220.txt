Copies of the Euroclear Agreements  the Collateral Monitoring Agent Agreement  the Trust Deed and the Pledge Agreement are available for inspection by Securityholders during normal business hours at the offices of the relevant Agent. A prospective purchaser of the Securities should also carefully review the risk factors in relation to Collateralised Securities set out in the section of this Listing Prospectus entitled ""Risk Factors"" before purchasing any Securities. Unless otherwise defined  defined terms in this section have the meanings set out in the Secured Conditions. In order to secure its obligations in respect of the Securities  the London branch or head office in Frankfurt of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (the ""Issuer"") will enter into security arrangements with the Collateral Arrangement Parties under the Collateral Transaction Documents for such series of Collateralised Securities. The Collateral Transaction Documents comprise: The Pledge Agreement  which is governed by Belgian law  under which the Issuer grants security over securities and cash in the Secured Accounts held in the Euroclear System in favour of the Security Trustee for the benefit of the Securityholders of the Securities and the other Secured Parties.The Trust Deed  which is governed by English law  under which the Issuer appoints the Security Trustee to hold the security constituted by the Pledge Agreement in favour of the Securityholders and the other Secured Parties and perform certain other functions.The Collateral Monitoring Agent Agreement  which is governed by English law  under which the Issuer appoints the Collateral Monitoring Agent to calculate the Required Collateral Value and perform the Collateral Test in respect of the Securities and perform certain other functions.The Custody Agreement  which is governed by English law  under which the Security Trustee appoints the Custodian (Security Trustee) to act as its custodian in relation to the Collateral Assets held in the Secured Accounts in the Euroclear System.The Euroclear Agreements  which are governed by English law  which relate to the operation of the Secured Accounts and Euroclear's role as triparty agent in respect of the Secured Accounts. The Euroclear Agreements comprise the Euroclear Terms and Conditions  the Collateral Service Agreement and the Single Pledgor Pledged Account Agreement. The terms and operation of the collateral arrangements in respect of the Securities may differ from the collateral arrangements of other series of Collateralised Securities principally in relation to: the method and frequency of calculating the Required Collateral Value; the types of Eligible Collateral Assets that may be held in the Secured Accounts and the haircut or margin used to discount the market value of such Eligible Collateral Assets; and 4the process for monitoring that sufficient Eligible Collateral Assets are held in the Secured Accounts  namely the Collateral Test  and the frequency with which the Collateral Test is performed. Each series of Collateralised Securities (including the Securities) will be secured by a separate pool of collateral comprising Collateral Assets held in segregated Secured Accounts in the Euroclear System. Operation of the Secured Accounts The Secured Accounts are held in the Euroclear System in Belgium in the name of the Pledgee's Representative. The Euroclear System is a securities clearing and settlement system operated in Brussels by Euroclear. The Pledgee's Representative structure is a method by which the Pledgee's Representative can act on behalf of the Security Trustee which is not a direct participant in the Euroclear System. The Pledgee's Representative is a direct participant in the Euroclear System. The Secured Accounts are opened in the name of the Pledgee's Representative  which in turn acts in its own name but for the account of the Security Trustee in relation to the operation of the Secured Accounts. Euroclear provides a triparty collateral service in relation to the Secured Accounts for the Issuer and the Pledgee's Representative in accordance with the terms of the Euroclear Agreements. Euroclear's triparty collateral service has three primary features: the processing of operations (such as adjustments and substitution of Collateral Assets) relating to the Secured Accounts  marking to market securities that are (or are proposed to become) Collateral Assets  and supplying reports to the Issuer  the Pledgee's Representative and the Collateral Monitoring Agent. Required Collateral Value The Required Collateral Value of the Securities is the value of Collateral Assets that  after taking into account certain adjustments  are required to be held in the Secured Accounts. On or before each periodic Required Collateral Value Notification Date  the Required Collateral Value is calculated by the Collateral Monitoring Agent and notified to the Pledgee's Representative and the Issuer. The Required Collateral Value may fluctuate during the term of the Securities. The methodology used to calculate the Required Collateral Value for the Securities is ""Par Plus Accrued Interest Collateralisation"". The Required Collateral Value in respect of the Collateral Pool and a Collateral Test Date will be the product of (i) the Collateralisation Percentage  and the aggregate of the par value and accrued but unpaid interest (if any) of each outstanding Non-Inventory Collateralised Security of such series of Collateralised Securities on the Collateralised Securities Valuation Date  as determined by the Collateral Monitoring Agent. Inventory Collateralised Securities that are held by the Issuer or its affiliates will be disregarded in the calculation of the Required Collateral Value and will not be collateralised. The Collateral Monitoring Agent will notify the Issuer and the Pledgee's Representative of the Required Collateral Value for each periodic Required Collateral Value Notification Date. The Issuer and the Pledgee's Representative will in turn provide matching instructions to Euroclear specifying the Required Collateral Value as the ""Intended Transaction Amount"" pursuant to the Collateral Service Agreement if the Required Collateral Value has changed from the last Required Collateral Value jointly notified via matching instructions to Euroclear. 5Collateral Test Euroclear will use the ""Margined Value""1 of eligible securities and cash held in the Secured Accounts to determine and report whether a ""Transactional Margin Deficit""2 exists for the purposes of reporting any such deficit to the Issuer and the Pledgee's Representative  which will in turn provide such reports to the Collateral Monitoring Agent. On a daily basis  Euroclear will calculate the Margined Value of eligible securities and cash held in the Secured Accounts relating to the Securities. When calculating the Margined Value of a security  Euroclear first determines the ""Market Value""3 of the security by marking the security to market based on pricing information obtained in the ordinary course of business using certain specified methods and sources. Euroclear then reduces the Market Value of the security or the amount of the cash by its applicable ""Margin Percentage""4 or ""Haircut Percentage""5 as specified in Annex II of the CSA Terms and Conditions and converts the result into the Collateral Valuation Currency. A Transactional Margin Deficit is the excess of the Transaction Amount6 (being the Required Collateral Value jointly notified by the Issuer and Pledgee's Representative to Euroclear as the ""Intended Transaction Amount"" following adjustment of such amount for certain settlement failures) as of such day over the Margined Values of all eligible securities and cash held in the Secured Accounts as of such day. If ""Autoselect"" applies under the Euroclear Documents and the Transactional Margin Deficit is greater than or equal to the ""Minimum Margin Amount""7  Euroclear will automatically attempt to The Collateral Service Agreement defines Margined Value as: In case a Margin Percentage is chosen: with respect to an Eligible Security or Collateral Security  the Market Value of that Security (including any accrued interest on that Security) divided by the applicable Margin Percentage (expressed as a decimal) and converted into the applicable Transaction Currency or  with respect to an amount of Eligible Cash or Collateral Cash  the amount of that Cash divided by the applicable Margin Percentage (expressed as a decimal) and translated into the applicable Transaction Currency. In case a Haircut Percentage is chosen: with respect to an Eligible Security or Collateral Security  the Market Value of that Security (including any accrued interest on that Security) multiplied by the applicable Haircut Percentage (expressed as a decimal) and converted into the applicable Transaction Currency or  with respect to an amount of Eligible Cash or Collateral Cash  the amount of that Cash multiplied by the applicable Haircut Percentage (expressed as a decimal) and translated into the applicable Transaction Currency. The Collateral Service Agreement defines ""Transactional Margin Deficit"" as: On any Business Day  with respect to a Transaction  the excess (if any) of: The Transaction Amount of the Transaction as of such day; overThe sum of the Margined Values of all Collateral Securities and all amounts of Collateral Cash with respect to the Transaction as of such day. The Collateral Service Agreement defines Market Value as: On any Business Day  with respect to any Security  the market value of such Security as calculated by the Bank based on pricing information obtained by the Euroclear Operator in the ordinary course of its business using methods and sources described in the Operating Procedures. The Collateral Service Agreement defines Margin Percentage as: The percentage(s) specified in Annex II to the CSA Terms and Conditions  in one or more sets  as such Annex may be amended from time to time. The Collateral Service Agreement defines Haircut Percentage as: The percentage(s) specified in Annex II to the CSA Terms and Conditions  in one or more sets  as such Annex may be amended from time to time. The Collateral Service Agreement defines Transaction Amount as: With respect to a Transaction  the Intended Transaction Amount: increased by the amount of any collateral which fails to be received in Collateral Giver's Account due to a failure of instructions to settle  with respect to a Transaction-size decrease;Transaction-size decrease; increased by the amount of any cash which fails to be received in Collateral Taker's Account due to a failure of instructions to settle  with respect to a substitution of Eligible Securities for Collateral Securities;decreased by the amount of any collateral which fails to be received in Collateral Taker's Account  whether due to a failure of instructions to settle or to the unavailability of Eligible Securities selected in accordance with the AutoSelect Methodology  in each case with respect to an initiation of a Transaction-size increase; andTransaction-size increase; and decreased by the amount of any cash which fails to be received in Collateral Giver's Account  whether due to a failure of instructions to settle or to the unavailability of Eligible Securities selected in accordance with the AutoSelect Methodology  in each case with respect to a substitution of Eligible Securities for Collateral Securities  provided that any of the above increases or decreases may be reversed to the extent that the relevant fail is cured. The Collateral Service Agreement defines Minimum Margin Amount as: The amount(s)  or the amount(s) determined by application of the percentage(s)  specified in Annex II to the CSA Terms and Conditions  in one or more sets  as such Annex may be amended from time to time. 6select available eligible securities to correct the deficit and will transfer those securities to the Secured Accounts. If ""Autoselect"" does not apply under the Euroclear Documents  Euroclear will report the deficit to the Pledgee's Representative and the Issuer and those parties will provide matching instructions to Euroclear to transfer additional eligible securities or cash into the Secured Accounts. On each periodic Collateral Test Monitoring Date  the Collateral Monitoring Agent will check that Euroclear's report for the final hourly optimisation run by Euroclear on such Collateral Test Date (i) does not report a Transactional Margin Deficit that is greater than or equal to the Minimum Margin Amount and (ii) specifies an ""Intended Transaction Amount"" that is equal to or greater than the Required Collateral Value for such Collateral Test Date. The Collateral Test in respect of a Collateral Test Date will be satisfied if (i) the Transactional Margin Deficit is less than the Minimum Margin Amount and (ii) the ""Intended Transaction Amount"" is equal to or greater than the Required Collateral Value for the relevant Collateral Test Date. However  the Collateral Test in respect of a Collateral Test Date will not be satisfied if either (i) the Transactional Margin Deficit is greater than or equal to the Minimum Margin Amount or (ii) the ""Intended Transaction Amount"" is less than the Required Collateral Value for the relevant Collateral Test Date. If the Collateral Test is not satisfied  the Collateral Monitoring Agent will send a Collateral Shortfall Notice to the Issuer. If the Collateral Test is not satisfied for the Required Collateral Default Period following delivery of such Collateral Shortfall Notice  the Collateral Monitoring Agent will send a Required Collateral Default Notice to the Issuer  the relevant Agent and the Pledgee's Representative. Acceleration and Enforcement If an Event of Default occurs or is continuing with respect to the Securities  then if Securityholder(s) of at least 33 per cent. of Non-Inventory Collateralised Securities send Acceleration Notice(s) through the relevant Clearing Agent to the relevant Agent  and the default is not cured  an Acceleration Event shall occur in respect of the Securities and the relevant Agent shall promptly send an Acceleration Instruction to the Security Trustee. Following receipt of an Acceleration Instruction  the Security Trustee will  subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction  deliver a Collateral Enforcement Notice and a Notice of Exclusive Control to the relevant parties. Upon delivery of the Collateral Enforcement Notice  all Securities will become immediately due and repayable at the Early Termination Amount. Realisation of Collateral Assets and distribution of proceeds Following delivery of a Collateral Enforcement Notice in respect of the Securities  the Security Trustee will enforce the security constituted by the Pledge Agreement and will  acting in accordance with instructions provided by the Instructing Securityholder(s)  appoint a Disposal Agent and give instructions to such Disposal Agent to effect a liquidation and realisation of all the Collateral Assets in the Collateral Pool which secures the Securities and subsequently distribute the relevant Collateral Enforcement Proceeds Share to the Securityholders. The Security Trustee will not be obliged to act unless it has first been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction. The Security Trustee will instruct the Disposal Agent to use the proceeds of such realisation and liquidation of the Collateral Assets to make payment of any amounts payable to the Secured Parties ranking prior to the Securityholders of Non-Inventory Collateralised Securities in accordance with the Order of Priority. Following such payment  Securityholders will be entitled to receive the pro rata share of any remaining proceeds attributable to each Non- Inventory Collateralised Security held by such Securityholder provided that such amount does By default  this amount is set at: 5000 units for Transactions with JPY as Reference Currency500 units for Transactions with NOK  DKK or SEK as Reference Currency50 unit for Transactions with all other Reference Currencies 7not exceed the Early Termination Amount. Where the pro rata share of the remaining proceeds for a particular Security is less than the Early Termination Amount  the Securityholder will be entitled to claim against the Issuer for the shortfall on an unsecured basis. By acquiring and holding the Securities  each Securityholder will be deemed to acknowledge and agree that no Securityholder shall be entitled to have recourse to the Collateral Assets contained in a Collateral Pool other than the Collateral Pool which secures the Securities held by such Securityholder. Euroclear Event and Collateral Disruption Events Upon the occurrence of a Euroclear Event or a Collateral Disruption Event  certain Events of Default (including a Required Collateral Default) will be disapplied for the period during which such events are continuing  such period not to exceed 30 days. The Issuer may at its option and in its sole discretion treat such Collateral Disruption Event as an Adjustment/Termination Event and may take certain actions  including adjusting the Terms and Conditions or cancelling the Securities. 8RISK FACTORS An investment in the Securities involves complex risks. Prospective investors should refer to the risk factors as described in this section. Capitalised terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given thereto in the Final Terms and/or Programme. All references to ""Deutsche Bank AG""  ""Deustche Bank""  the ""Bank""  or ""we"" or ""or"" refers to the Issuer. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE ISSUER In relation to the risks relating to the Issuer  prospective investors should refer to the risk factors set forth in the section entitled ""Risk Factors"" of the Deutsche Bank AG Registration Document (including the introductory paragraph thereto) contained on pages 3 to 32 (both inclusive). RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE SECURITIES In relation to the risks relating to the Securities  prospective investors should refer to the risk factors set forth in the sections of the Base Prospectus entitled ""Risk Factors Related to the Securities Generally"" (excluding the sub-section headed ""Risk Factors in relation to Collateralised Securities"" thereto) contained on pages 197 to 206 (both inclusive) and ""Risk Factors relating to the Market Generally"" contained on pages 209 to 212 (both inclusive). In addition  prospective investors should refer to the risk factors set forth in the section entitled ""Risk Factors related to the Collateralised Securities"" below and the risk factors set forth in the section of the Base Prospectus entitled ""Conflicts of Interest"" contained on pages 213 to 215 (both inclusive). RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE COLLATERALISED SECURITIES The Security Trustee may be entitled not to act following an Acceleration Event if it has not been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded by the Securityholders Following an Event of Default and subsequent Acceleration Event  the Security Trustee shall be under no obligation to take any action to liquidate or realise any Collateral Assets  if it has not first been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction by the Securityholders of the Collateralised Securities. In any such event  the Security Trustee may decide not to take any action and such inaction will not constitute a breach by it of its obligations under the any Collateral Transaction Document. Consequently  if applicable  the Securityholders of the Collateralised Securities would have to either arrange for such indemnity and/or security and/or pre-funding  accept the consequences of such inaction by the Security Trustee or appoint a replacement Security Trustee. Securityholders of at least 33 per cent. in aggregate nominal amount or by number (as applicable) of Non-Inventory Collateralised Securities outstanding may remove the Security Trustee and appoint a replacement Security Trustee. Securityholders of the Collateralised Securities should be prepared to bear the costs associated with any such indemnity and/or security and/or pre-funding and/or the consequences of any such inaction by the Security Trustee and/or the replacement of the Security Trustee. Any consequential delay in the liquidation or realisation of the Collateral Assets may adversely affect the amount distributable to Securityholders of Collateralised Securities. If the Security Trustee fails to enforce the security or fails to apply the proceeds of enforcement for any reason  the Securityholders will be unable to recover the amounts due to them until such time as the security is enforced and the proceeds thereof are distributed (although the Securityholders will have the right to remove the Security Trustee and appoint a replacement Security Trustee). 9",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,negative,0.04,0.48,0.48,True,English,"['Deutsche Bank', 'Amendment', 'terms', 'conditions', 'December', '08:04', 'Collateral Monitoring Agent Agreement', 'Execution Version PROHIBITION', 'EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA', 'DEUTSCHE BANK AG', 'Material Adverse Change', 'normal business hours', 'Luxembourg Stock Exchange', 'Collateral Transaction Documents', '1,000,000,000 Fixed Rate Notes', 'Insurance Distribution Directive', 'LONDON BRANCH LEI', 'key information document', 'Tranche Two Securities', 'Tranche One Securities', 'RESTATED LISTING PROSPECTUS', 'original Listing Prospectus', 'Pledge Agreement', 'relevant Agent', 'COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS', 'Luxembourg Law', 'UNITED KINGDOM', 'MiFID II', 'professional client', 'qualified investor', 'Quarterly Coupons', 'single series', 'Professional Segment', 'Euro MTF', 'reasonable care', 'CONTENTS Page', '4 RISK FACTORS', '16 FINAL TERMS', '19 SECURED CONDITIONS', 'Euroclear Agreements', 'Trust Deed', 'prospective purchaser', 'retail investor', 'retail client', 'X-markets Programme', 'Prospectus Regulation', 'PRIIPs Regulation', 'Full information', 'Collateralised Securities', 'detailed provisions', 'Issuer Listing', 'Responsibility Statement', 'INVESTORS', '1 Securities', 'SALES', 'THE', 'EEA', 'UK', 'purposes', 'person', 'point', 'Article', 'customer', 'meaning', 'time', '7LTWFZYICNSX8D621K86', 'January', '19 August', 'ISIN', 'DE000DL8YQ26', 'issuance', 'Certificates', 'Warrants', 'conjunction', 'accordance', 'requirements', 'prospectuses', 'reference', 'admission', 'trading', 'basis', 'combination', 'case', 'knowledge', 'facts', 'import', 'authorisation', 'representation', 'connection', 'dealer', 'prospects', '31 December', 'TABLE', 'OVERVIEW', 'INCORPORATION', 'entirety', 'Copies', 'inspection', 'Securityholders', 'offices', 'relation', 'section']",2023-12-19,2023-12-20,marketscreener.com

This was mainly due to the expansion of the property portfolio and index-based rent increases. By contrast  the result from property management was burdened by higher running costs and expenses relating to other periods and therefore rose only marginally.Funds from operations (""FFO"")  on the other hand  declined and fell by around 19.4% year-on-year to EUR 33.1 million (previous year: EUR 41.1 million) or EUR 0.66 per share (fully diluted) (previous year: EUR 0.82 per share). FFO is therefore below the guidance (EUR 36 million to EUR 39 million). This was primarily due to significantly higher net interest expenses  which were around EUR 6.3 million higher than in the previous year  as well as higher property management expenses.Similarly  aFFO (FFO after deduction of capitalised modernisation measures) declined and amounted to around EUR 11.1 million (previous year: EUR 22.5 million) due to several major revitalisation measures (capex) at various properties.Property portfolio enlarged / portfolio devalued by EUR 114 millionAs a result of the transfer of ownership of twelve properties acquired in the previous year less three properties sold in the financial year  the property portfolio grew by a total of nine properties with an area of around 35 000 square metres and generates an annual rent of around EUR 79.2 million (30 September 2022: EUR 73.2 million).The annual revaluation of the property portfolio as at 30 September 2023  on the other hand  leads to a devaluation of around 9% (like-for-like) and a negative valuation result of around EUR 114 million  which is mainly due to the significant change in the interest rate environment with higher interest rates in many cases. After years of significant revaluations fuelled by the low interest rate policy  the ECB's interest rate turnaround with ten interest rate hikes in a row resulted in a valuation decline for the first time. Accordingly  DKR's real estate portfolio (including properties for sale) is valued at around EUR 995 million as at 30 September 2023 which equals around 12.6x the annual rent (30 September 2022: EUR 1 050 million or 14.2x the annual rent).The gross acquisition yield of the overall portfolio averaged more than 10% as at 30 September 2023.Repayment and collateral agreement with Obotritia Capital KGaA concluded on outstanding loan / value adjustment of the loanOn 9 December 2023  DKR reached a notarised agreement with Obotritia Capital KGaA regarding the repayment of the outstanding loan receivable  which amounted to EUR 62.5 million as at the balance sheet date. DKR was also granted a comprehensive collateral package. In return  DKR granted Obotritia a deferral of the loan receivable until 30 June 2025 at the latest. For reasons of prudence  DKR has based the carrying amount of the loan exclusively on very short-term and realisable collaterals and has thus made a value adjustment to the loan of around 70%.First-time recognition of deferred taxesFurthermore  the Management Board has decided that  due to the unclear time perspective and the unclear outcome of the legal dispute with the Brandenburg tax authorities with regard to maintaining REIT status  all possible tax risks will be recognised for reasons of prudence. Accordingly  the previously recognised tax receivables are derecognised and deferred taxes are recognised for the first time. This leads to tax expenses totalling around EUR 50.2 million in the annual financial statements  of which around EUR 31.7 million comprises the first-time recognition of (non-cash) deferred taxes. The difference of around EUR 18.5 million comprises the recognition of back tax payments for the period from 2016 onwards  of which a portion had already been settled by DKR as at the balance sheet date and further payments were made by the Company after the balance sheet date.Total comprehensive income for the period at EUR -181 million / No dividend for the 2022/2023 financial yearFor the full year 2022/2023  there is a negative result for the period totalling around EUR -181 million  which is significantly influenced by non-cash expenses such as the property devaluation (EUR -113.5 million)  the value adjustment of the loan receivable from Obotritia Capital KGaA (EUR -40.1 million) and the first-time recognition of deferred tax liabilities (EUR -31.7 million).As previously announced  no dividend proposal can be made due to the negative annual result for the past financial year 2022/2023.EPRA NTA (fully diluted) at EUR 7.64 per share / Net LTV increases to around 61.6%After accounting for all of the aforementioned risks  the EPRA NTA (fully diluted) as at 30 September 2023 is around EUR 7.64 per share (30 September 2022: EUR 10.98 per share). This means that the intrinsic value of the share is still significantly higher than the current share price.The net LTV increased to 61.6% on the balance sheet date  mainly due to the devaluation of the property portfolio and the value adjustment of the loan.Conference CallDeutsche Konsum REIT-AG will hold an analysts' conference (webcast and conference call) on the annual results of the 2022/2023 financial year today  19 December 2023  10:00 a.m. CET/11:00 SAST.

This is Galapagos’ third oncology CAR-T program in clinical development.GLPG5301 is an autologous  second-generation/4-1BB B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed CAR-T product candidate  administered as an intravenous infusion of a fresh product in a single fixed dose  at point-of-care.“Patients living with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma have a very poor prognosis and a significant high unmet medical need for novel treatment options. CAR-T therapy is one such option. By combining innovative science with breakthrough point-of-care delivery of novel CAR-T therapies  we aim to enhance patient outcomes and improve their quality of life ” said Jeevan Shetty  Head of Clinical Development Oncology at Galapagos. “We are very pleased that the first patient with rrMM in PAPILIO-1 has been dosed with our BCMA CAR-T candidate  GLPG5301. This marks another milestone in the roll-out of our point-of-care network and the build-up of our CAR-T portfolio  which now consists of three ongoing clinical programs in severe hemato-oncology indications.”About the PAPILIO-1 Phase 1/2 study (EU CT 2022-500782-27-00)PAPILIO-1 is a Phase 1/2  open-label  multi-center study to evaluate the feasibility  safety  and efficacy of point-of-care manufactured GLPG5301  our BCMA CAR-T product candidate  in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (rrMM) after ≥2 prior lines therapy. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the PAPILIO-1 study is to evaluate safety and determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of GLPG5301  as measured by the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary objectives for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 include further assessment of the safety of GLPG5301  additional efficacy endpoints  including assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD)  as well as the feasibility of point-of-care manufacture of GLPG5301 in rrMM patients. Each enrolled patient will be followed for 24 months.During Phase 1  up to 3 dose levels will be evaluated and at least 12 patients will be enrolled to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose. Approximately 30 additional patients will be enrolled in the Phase 2 part of the study to confirm the safety and efficacy of GLPG5301.About Galapagos’ innovative approach to CAR-T manufacturing near the point-of-careGalapagos’ decentralized  innovative point-of-care CAR-T manufacturing platform consists of an end-to-end xCellit™ workflow management and monitoring software system  a decentralized  functionally closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell therapies (using Lonza’s Cocoon®) and a proprietary quality control (QC) testing and release strategy. The combination of these three core components offers the potential for administration of a fresh product  a median vein-to-vein time of 7 days (i.e. the time between T-cell collection and CAR-T infusion)  and greater physicians oversight throughout the process.About Relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (rrMM)Multiple myeloma (MM) is typically characterized by the neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells producing a monoclonal immunoglobulin. The plasma cells proliferate in the bone marrow and may result in extensive skeletal destruction with osteopenia  and osteolytic lesions with or without pathologic fractures. The diagnosis of MM is made when one (or more) of the following clinical presentations are present: bone pain with lytic lesions discovered on routine skeletal films or other imaging modalities  an increased total serum protein concentration with the presence of a monoclonal protein in the urine or serum  and anemia  hypercalcemia or renal failure. The patient may be either symptomatic or their disease may be discovered incidentally.Despite improvements in treatment  patient with MM ultimately relapse or become refractory to available regiments. Triple-refractory (refractory to CD38 monoclonal antibodies [mAbs]  proteasome inhibitor [PI] and immunomodulatory drug [IMiD] or penta-refractory (refractory to CD38 mAbs  2 Pls and 2 IMiDs) patients have a poor prognosis and are in urgent need of novel treatment options.About GalapagosWe are a global biotechnology company with operations in Europe and the US dedicated to developing transformational medicines for more years of life and quality of life. Focusing on high unmet medical needs  we synergize the most compelling science  technology  and collaborative approaches to create a deep pipeline of best-in-class small molecules  CAR-T therapies  and biologics in oncology and immunology.

The contract for the sale of 2CRSi's distribution branch  the Boston Limited group  was signed on June 30  2023. However  at the end of this first fiscal half  many issues relating to this sale remained unresolved  and the work of the auditors could not be finalized in time  resulting in the postponement of 2CRSi's Annual General Meeting to November 30  2023.Following this sale and the transfer of 2CRSi shares from Euronext to Euronext Growth in November 2022  2CRSi is now publishing its financial statements as of August 31  2023  in accordance with French standards  without consolidating the figures of its French or foreign subsidiaries.At the Annual General Meeting on November 30  2023  several decisions were taken  including the extension of the fiscal year 2023/2024 until June 30  2024  for an exceptional period of 16 months.The income statement for the first half breaks down as follows:French standards in million euros From 01/03/23 to 08/31/23 From 01/03/22 to 08/31/22 Revenues 11 2 15 9 Cost of sales -5 2 -10 5 Other operational income -2 2 1 3 Gross Commercial Margin 3.8 6.7 External expenses 4 3 4 7 Personnel expenses 2 8 3 4 Tax and duties 0 1 0 1 Other operational expenses 0 0 0 3 Gross Operating Profit -3 4 -1 7 Depreciation and amortization 1 4 1 8 Operating income -4 9 -3 5 Financial income 2 9 0 1 Exceptional income -0 0 -0 7 Net income -1 8 -3 9Over the half-year  the downturn in sales was significant and was due to the following factors:The sale of the Boston sub-groupExtremely long delivery times  particularly for Artificial Intelligence products  resulting in delayed orders for the first half of the year.The transfer of assembly  testing and logistics activities to the ""ADIMES"" subsidiary  resulting in a drop in both sales and payroll (from 3.4 to 2.8 million euros).Other operating income amounted to -2.2 million euros  compared with 1.3 million euros in 2022-2023  due to lower production inventories during the year.Despite rigorous cost management  the gross operating surplus reflects the low level of activity for the semester and amounts to -3.4 million euros. After depreciation and amortization  operating income came to -4.9 million euros.The financial result includes an amount of 2.1 million euros resulting from the distribution of an interim dividend following the transfer of the Boston group.During this first semester  the net result shows a loss of -1.8 million euros. The current customer order book exceeds 40 million euros  and management forecasts a return to profit for the second semester ending on June 30  2024  for an exceptional duration of 10 months.A controlled financial situation2CRSi's bank loans and debts (including bank overdrafts) totaled 13.1 million euros at the end of August  including 10.4 million euros in bank loans. These are mainly composed of French State Guaranteed Loans (PGE) taken out since 2020.As a reminder  the Convertible Bonds were reimbursed in November 2023  for an amount of 1.201 million euros.During the first half  the loan that had financed the acquisition of Boston Ltd shares in December 2019 was repaid in full as part of the sale of BOSTON.

The objective of this approach is to formalize the development program for NFL-301 and represents an essential preliminary step in order to formalize the optimum clinical development plan for the product.In line with the initial strategy presented at the time of its IPO  NFL Biosciences is moving forward with the development of two drug candidates. On the one hand  NFL-101  a tobacco extract administered subcutaneously  targets smoking cessation and is in a phase 2b clinical trial with 318 participants  with the main results expected for July 2024. On the other hand  NFL-301  a purified kudzu plant extract administered orally to reduce excessive alcohol consumption  has taken a new significant step forward with the submission of a pre-IND application to the FDA following the patent application filed in July 2023.This pre-IND application is an essential step in the development of the product. It allows for the NFL-301 development plan to be presented to the FDA. This plan includes the manufacturing and quality control methods  as well as preclinical data and future clinical trials. The aim is to ensure the NFL-301 development plan is compliant with the FDA's expectations in order to reduce potential obstacles related to the regulatory process.The FDA response to the pre-IND application is expected by the end of the first quarter of 2024. It will lead to the formalization of the development plan  as well as to its budgeting  over a period that could run through to the third quarter of 2024. These preparatory stages do not require any significant cash outlays  while drawing up a development plan aligned with the FDA's expectations will ultimately reduce regulatory risks and ensure more effective budget control.The two therapeutic approaches  based on NFL-101 and NFL-301  illustrate NFL Biosciences' commitment to offering innovative treatments for addictions  capitalizing on the company´s expertise in the development of botanical drugs and addictions. The effective approach for conducting the Phase 2b clinical trial with NFL-101 for smoking cessation  involving 318 participants across nine clinical centers  and the swift management of the timeframes and budget  highlight NFL Biosciences' ability to move forward with ambitious projects  while maintaining minimum fixed costs.This balanced development strategy  supported by a pipeline of two drug candidates in the high-potential field of addiction treatment  is ramping up NFL Biosciences' appeal  further strengthening its position on the pharmaceutical market.About NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions. NFL Biosciences' ambition is to bring new  natural  safer and more effective therapeutic solutions to the entire world population  including low- and middle-income countries. Its most advanced product  called NFL-101  is a standardized  nicotine free tobacco leaf extract protected by two patent families. NFL Biosciences intends to offer smokers who want to quit a natural  safe  easy-to-administer and personalized alternative.

The results confirm the previous findings by independent academics as published earlier on Biotalys’ website.EVOCA aims to provide fruit and vegetable growers with a safe new crop protection product to help control the devastating fungal diseases Botrytis and powdery mildew. By offering a novel  biodegradable tool EVOCA can contribute to reducing dependency on chemical pesticides and development of pathogen resistance.Dr. Eva Van Hende  Biotalys’ Head of Regulatory and Field Development  noted: “These independent field trials by prestigious academic institutions in the United States continue to validate the efficacy of EVOCA  our first biocontrol developed on our AGROBODY™ technology platform. We are dedicated to obtaining regulatory approval for this product and to creating an expansive pipeline of biocontrols to support the transition to safer  more sustainable agricultural practices.”The trials were conducted in 2022 and 2023 by the University of California Davis and the University of Florida and are industry gold-standard studies that provide growers and crop advisors with detailed information on the performance of crop protection products. In these grape and strawberry trials  EVOCA was tested among many other treatments and a non-treated control plot  enabling the comprehensive comparison of its performance with conventional chemical and biological fungicide products.The outcome of the academic studies in California is particularly relevant as California is the largest U.S. grape market. In that respect  the Californian Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) has been reviewing the regulatory dossier for EVOCA submitted by Biotalys in April 2021. The company now understands that the CDPR has finalized its own in-depth review  opening a path to a swift approval at state level if the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approves the product at federal level.Study highlightsEVOCA performed as a true replacer for chemical products as well as a top performing biological option to combat Botrytis in grapes  in particular at the critical flower (or bloom) application window;EVOCA proved consistent protection against Botrytis in a variety of application programs for grapevines;EVOCA was part of the best performing biofungicide rotation scheme against Botrytis in grapes;In strawberry trials  rotation programs including EVOCA provided equivalent protection against powdery mildew as chemical-only rotations.Annex: Study detailsThe universities publish study details on their websites. Below is a summary of results for EVOCA.A. University of California Davis (Primary Investigator  Dr. Akif Eskalen) – grapevine trialsBotrytis fruit rot - 2023 - 389969.pdf (ucanr.edu)Across a total of 49 different treatment programs  EVOCA (with or without adjuvant) substituted one or two chemicals in a spraying program of leading fungicide products ranked 5/5 for excellent and consistent control of botrytis bunch rot. Results confirmed EVOCA’s strong performance as a true replacer for chemical solutions  on par with the reference product Switch. EVOCA was also used in the best performing rotation program  reducing bunch rot incidence by 65% compared to a full chemical program when used in combination with an adjuvant.GRAPES 2023: TREATMENT SCHEME 1: Evoca+Adjuvant (AD); Pristine (B); Elevate (C)GRAPES 2023: TREATMENT SCHEME 46: UntreatedBotrytis fruit rot - 2022 - 372339.pdf (ucanr.edu)**Across a total of 46 different treatment programs  6 entries contained EVOCA as a standalone treatment or integrated at flowering in a rotation program. Treatments were applied throughout the trial during the standard application windows (bloom (A)  pre-closure (B)  veraison (C) and pre-harvest (D)). Some of the EVOCA treatments were mixed with adjuvants.EVOCA showed its strength in a standalone program  both with and without an adjuvant. Integration of EVOCA in a rotation program proved to be an excellent replacement for a chemical application at flowering. 5 out of the top 8 best performing application schemes contained EVOCA  earning recognition as the best performing biofungicide rotation scheme.GRAPES 2022: TREATMENT SCHEME 2: Evoca+Adjuvant (A); Switch (B); Pristine (C); Elevate (D)GRAPES 2022: TREATMENT SCHEME 43: UntreatedB.

EVOCA substitution for chemical product Captan in rotation with Switch performed as well as the reference Captan/Switch rotation  being the highest performing scheme with biofungicides.In 2023  EVOCA was further assessed in four rotation programs  substituting chemicals  across 22 different spraying schemes.

Qualifying companies that fail to submit beneficial ownership information may be subject to a civil penalty of up to $500 per day  a criminal fine of up to $10 000  as well as imprisonment ” he writes.Aronowitz explains that law firms’ inconsistent readiness for the CTA extend from knowledge of the filing requirements to preparedness for the new regulation. “While some firms have dedicated committees to the planning and directing of new policies and procedures  a number of the attorneys we have spoken to have said they were not familiar with the new BOI reporting requirements ” he says  emphasizing that law firms should be prepared to answer questions that clients may have about CTA  including advising whether or not they may be exempt from the reporting requirement and how they will need to comply.Wolters Kluwer has been fully engaged in following developments around the new beneficial ownership rule taking effect January 1  2024. It has created a range of helpful resources such as an easy-to-use self-guided eligibility quiz  webinar presentations  and content to ensure impacted entities are able to effectively prepare for and navigate the new requirements within the target timeframe to meet their compliance obligations.

The new unit will be installed at the Group's hydrogen production plant located in the port of Rotterdam and will be connected to Porthos  one of Europe's largest carbon capture and storage infrastructure aiming at signifcantly reducing CO2 emissions in this large industrial basin.Air Liquide will capture the CO2 from its existing world-scale hydrogen plant in the port of Rotterdam  leveraging CryocapTM  a technological solution for CO2 capture using a cryogenic process. Captured CO2 will then be transported through the Porthos infrastructure  which is currently being developed  and permanently stored in depleted gas felds in the North Sea  approximately 20 kilometers off the coast. The carbon capture unit will be operational in 2026. Through this project  Air Liquide will be able to supply hydrogen that will be signifcantly decarbonized  to its long-term customers  as contracted.The Porthos infrastructure overall will enable to reduce emissions by 2.5 million tons of CO2 per year - equivalent to around 10% of the current Rotterdam industry CO2 emissions. The European Union has recognised Porthos as a major cross-border infrastructure project  contributing to the achievement of energy and climate policy objectives  and has included Porthos to the list of Project of Common Interest.Emilie Mouren-Renouard  member of Air Liquide's Executive Committee and Chief Executive Ofcer of the Europe Industries Hub  said: ""We are pleased to take another concrete step to contribute to the decarbonization of one of Europe's largest industrial basins while participating to the development of Porthos.

Qualifying companies that fail to submit beneficial ownership information may be subject to a civil penalty of up to $500 per day  a criminal fine of up to $10 000  as well as imprisonment ” he writes.Aronowitz explains that law firms’ inconsistent readiness for the CTA extend from knowledge of the filing requirements to preparedness for the new regulation. “While some firms have dedicated committees to the planning and directing of new policies and procedures  a number of the attorneys we have spoken to have said they were not familiar with the new BOI reporting requirements ” he says  emphasizing that law firms should be prepared to answer questions that clients may have about CTA  including advising whether or not they may be exempt from the reporting requirement and how they will need to comply.Wolters Kluwer has been fully engaged in following developments around the new beneficial ownership rule taking effect January 1  2024. It has created a range of helpful resources such as an easy-to-use self-guided eligibility quiz   webinar presentations  and content to ensure impacted entities are able to effectively prepare for and navigate the new requirements within the target timeframe to meet their compliance obligations.

Following the publication of topline results on December 11  2023[1]  the analysis is still ongoing and will last through Q1 2024.REFINE ANAYLSIS OF THE RESULTSWhile primary analyses confirm the pivotal Phase III topline results obtained on the Overall Neuropathy Limitation Scale (ONLS) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score version 2 (CMTNS-v2)  showing no significant difference in clinical response between treatment and placebo  additional subgroup analysis do suggest an efficacy signal. Indeed  in an analysis of patient subgroups  a better response was observed in treated patients with a BMI[2]<25  or in patients under 45 years of age.Furthermore  analysis of the data revealed that while the study as a whole was randomized  double-blind  two-arm placebo-controlled  each of the clinical investigation centers were not stratified between the two arms in a balanced manner. As a result  in some centers  patients received only placebo  and in others only treatment. However  further analysis shows that when data from centers with fewer than two patients per arm are removed  there is a statistically significant difference between the treated and placebo groups on the CMTNS-v2 endpoint.FILE PREPARATION FOR REGULATORY PROPOSALS WITH THE FDA AND EMAFrom all these new results  results of the Phase II study  first Phase III study and extension studies  one of which is over 6 years  the product's remarkable safety profile  and the absence of any approved treatment or in advanced clinical stage for CMT1A  Pharnext believes there may be a chance to agree on a registration pathway for PXT3003 in CMT1A  with the FDA and the EMA.From now on  the team will concentrate on putting into perspective all the data accumulated over ten years  in parallel with the medical literature describing the natural history[3] of CMT1A. This analysis will enable the Company's Supervisory Board and Management to decide whether to initiate a meeting with the FDA or wait for the results of the Phase III trial currently being conducted in China by its partner Tasly  which acquired the licensing rights for PXT3003 in China in 2017.Hugo Brugière  Manager of Pharnext  said: “I'm pleased to be able to confirm today what I said on December 11: we remain hopeful of finally being able to bring a medical solution to patients with no treatment. The in-depth study of the clinical data reveals more about the possible claims for our drug candidate  and does not contradict the results of previous studies.This is an encouraging signal for the future  enabling the Supervisory Board  Management  opinion leaders and our partners to keep moving forward”.DisclaimerPharnext arranged (I) financing in the form of convertible bonds financing (OCEAN-BSA) with Global Tech Opportunities 13 which  after receiving the shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of these instruments  will not remain shareholder of the Company  and (II) financing in OS bonds which were subsequently transferred to a trust  which is now responsible for their equitization.The shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of the above-mentioned securities will generally be sold on the market at very short notice  which may create strong downward pressure on the share price. In the specific case of the trust  the shares are sold on the market in accordance with the terms set out in the trust agreement.Shareholders may suffer a loss of their invested capital due to a significant fall in the Company's share price  as well as significant dilution due to the large number of securities issued to Global Tech Opportunities 13 and/or the trust.Investors are advised to exercise extreme caution before deciding to invest in the securities of a listed company that carries out such dilutive financing transactions  particularly when they are carried out in succession. The Company wishes to point out that this is not the first dilutive financing transaction it has undertaken.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions.

The ten-year loan will contribute to accelerating the energy transition  strengthen the security of power supply and boost climate action. It is part of the EIB’s dedicated contribution to REPowerEU  the plan designed to end Europe's dependence on fossil-fuel imports. It will also reduce the carbon footprint of VGP and its clients.VGP Renewable Energy N.V. is a wholly owned subsidiary of VGP  a pan-European listed real estate business  specialized in the acquisition  development and management of warehouses and semi-industrial buildings. The company is implementing an ambitious initiative to expand its renewable energy production within its real estate portfolio across 14 EU countries. The focus of this programme is the installation of rooftop solar photovoltaic systems.The newly installed photovoltaics will generate up to 190 GWh in renewable electricity per year when the programme is rolled out and operational  enough to cover the consumption of 110 000 Europeans. A significant part of the electricity will be used in VGP buildings by its tenants  improving the viability of the project. The installation is planned on existing roof areas  hence the project will not require additional land. Furthermore  this new business use  will increase the sustainable value of the buildings.“There is large untapped potential for renewable energy on the roofs of warehouses and other industrial buildings ” said EIB Vice-President Thomas Östros  who is responsible for energy-related operations. “With loans like that to VGP Renewable Energy N.V. we can help save scarce agricultural land and natural spaces while increasing renewable energy production. More renewables will help Europe to break away from fossil fuels and lower its dependency on energy imports. Ultimately  this will not only be a win for the climate  but also bring down electricity prices  which is in everybody’s interest.”Jan Van Geet  CEO of VGP  commented: “We are delighted about the collaboration with the European Investment Bank  which plays a key role in enabling the green and efficient electrification of buildings in Europe as part of the energy transition. This is another important recognition of VGP's efforts to enable the transformation to a low carbon society.”CONTACT DETAILS VGPInvestor RelationsTel: +32 (0)3 289 1433investor.relations@vgpparks.eu Karen HuybrechtsHead of Marketing Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432ABOUT VGP RENEWABLE ENERGYVGP Renewable Energy N.V. was set up in 2020 by VGP N.V.

This is Galapagos’ third oncology CAR-T program in clinical development.GLPG5301 is an autologous  second-generation/4-1BB B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed CAR-T product candidate  administered as an intravenous infusion of a fresh product in a single fixed dose  at point-of-care.“Patients living with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma have a very poor prognosis and a significant high unmet medical need for novel treatment options. CAR-T therapy is one such option. By combining innovative science with breakthrough point-of-care delivery of novel CAR-T therapies  we aim to enhance patient outcomes and improve their quality of life ” said Jeevan Shetty  Head of Clinical Development Oncology at Galapagos. “We are very pleased that the first patient with rrMM in PAPILIO-1 has been dosed with our BCMA CAR-T candidate  GLPG5301. This marks another milestone in the roll-out of our point-of-care network and the build-up of our CAR-T portfolio  which now consists of three ongoing clinical programs in severe hemato-oncology indications.”About the PAPILIO-1 Phase 1/2 study (EU CT 2022-500782-27-00)PAPILIO-1 is a Phase 1/2  open-label  multi-center study to evaluate the feasibility  safety  and efficacy of point-of-care manufactured GLPG5301  our BCMA CAR-T product candidate  in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (rrMM) after ≥2 prior lines therapy. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the PAPILIO-1 study is to evaluate safety and determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of GLPG5301  as measured by the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary objectives for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 include further assessment of the safety of GLPG5301  additional efficacy endpoints  including assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD)  as well as the feasibility of point-of-care manufacture of GLPG5301 in rrMM patients. Each enrolled patient will be followed for 24 months.During Phase 1  up to 3 dose levels will be evaluated and at least 12 patients will be enrolled to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose. Approximately 30 additional patients will be enrolled in the Phase 2 part of the study to confirm the safety and efficacy of GLPG5301.About Galapagos’ innovative approach to CAR-T manufacturing near the point-of-careGalapagos’ decentralized  innovative point-of-care CAR-T manufacturing platform consists of an end-to-end xCellit™ workflow management and monitoring software system  a decentralized  functionally closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell therapies (using Lonza’s Cocoon®) and a proprietary quality control (QC) testing and release strategy. The combination of these three core components offers the potential for administration of a fresh product  a median vein-to-vein time of 7 days (i.e. the time between T-cell collection and CAR-T infusion)  and greater physicians oversight throughout the process.About Relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (rrMM)Multiple myeloma (MM) is typically characterized by the neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells producing a monoclonal immunoglobulin. The plasma cells proliferate in the bone marrow and may result in extensive skeletal destruction with osteopenia  and osteolytic lesions with or without pathologic fractures. The diagnosis of MM is made when one (or more) of the following clinical presentations are present: bone pain with lytic lesions discovered on routine skeletal films or other imaging modalities  an increased total serum protein concentration with the presence of a monoclonal protein in the urine or serum  and anemia  hypercalcemia or renal failure. The patient may be either symptomatic or their disease may be discovered incidentally.Despite improvements in treatment  patient with MM ultimately relapse or become refractory to available regiments. Triple-refractory (refractory to CD38 monoclonal antibodies [mAbs]  proteasome inhibitor [PI] and immunomodulatory drug [IMiD] or penta-refractory (refractory to CD38 mAbs  2 Pls and 2 IMiDs) patients have a poor prognosis and are in urgent need of novel treatment options.About GalapagosWe are a global biotechnology company with operations in Europe and the US dedicated to developing transformational medicines for more years of life and quality of life. Focusing on high unmet medical needs  we synergize the most compelling science  technology  and collaborative approaches to create a deep pipeline of best-in-class small molecules  CAR-T therapies  and biologics in oncology and immunology. With capabilities from lab to patient  including a decentralized  point-of-care CAR-T manufacturing network  we are committed to challenging the status quo and delivering results for our patients  employees and shareholders.

This innovative trading service allows clients to trade ETFs listed on primary exchanges like the London Stock Exchange  Deutsche Boerse  Euronext  Nasdaq OMX  and more via ETF QOD Europe  in addition to the 1 700 tradable products already listed at SIX Swiss Exchange. The service offers efficient straight-through processing using the interoperable Central Counterparty (CCP) model with settlement into domestic Central Security Depositories (CSDs). Trading participants can achieve better execution and higher liquidity  with over 95% of trades executed at the European Best Bid Offer (EBBO) or better. The service also eliminates counterparty risk and increases settlement efficiency  optimizing costs for trading participants. SIX Swiss Exchange aims to set a new standard in the European ETF landscape with ETF QOD Europe.(PRESS RELEASE) ZÜRICH  20-Dec-2023 — /EuropaWire/ — On December 4th 2023  SIX introduced a novel service extension to its Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) franchise  called Quote-on-Demand Europe (QOD Europe). In addition to over 1 700 tradable products listed at SIX Swiss Exchange  clients are now able to trade ETFs listed on other primary exchanges like the London Stock Exchange  Deutsche Boerse  Euronext  Nasdaq OMX and Wiener Boerse and more via ETF QOD Europe. This innovative trading service offers efficient straight-through processing using the interoperable Central Counterparty (CCP) model with settlement into domestic Central Security Depositories (CSDs). Complementary to the established multilateral open order-book  the range of tradable ETFs reaches to almost 6 000 products tradable at SIX Swiss Exchange.For over two decades  SIX Swiss Exchange has been at the forefront of the ETF industry  continuously delivering innovative and future-proof services. The launch of ETF QOD Europe reinforces SIX Swiss Exchange’s commitment to providing a one-stop-shop experience  allowing users to trade instruments from different European markets  in particular those of the London Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam  Euronext Brussels  Euronext Paris  Deutsche Börse XETRA  Borsa Italiana  Wiener Börse AG or Nasdaq Stockholm AB. This service-extension positions SIX as leading primary regulated exchange operator offering the biggest ETF product universe: approx. 6 000 ETFs and ETPs are tradable on its on-exchange Request for Quote (RFQ)-platform QOD.Higher Liquidity  Better Prices  More ListingsTrading participants can now use ETF QOD Europe to achieve best execution across European ETFs: over 95% of trades in QOD are executed at the European Best Bid Offer (EBBO) or better  leading to significantly improved liquidity and higher execution quality. Through existing trading interfaces  users now gain access to ETFs listed on the biggest and most important European primary venues. SIX Swiss Exchange’s straight-through-processing accelerates processing of transactions through automation  lowers execution fees and costs  and thus enables a more efficient cross-EU trading in ETFs. For ETF issuers  this increases the attractiveness of an ETF listing at SIX Swiss Exchange  as with one single listing all corresponding EU-cross listings will be admitted to trading on ETF QOD Europe. In addition  high quality reference data powering QOD Europe is sourced from Ultumus  the leading provider of ETF and index data.Close cooperation in clearing and settlementAs the first pan-European exchange-traded RFQ platform and thanks to its open access concept  ETF QOD Europe enables trading participants to benefit from on-exchange straight-through processing  including central counterparty (CCP) clearing into the various European central securities depositories (CSDs). By eliminating counterparty risk and increasing settlement efficiency in RFQ trading  costs can be optimized as trading participants can take advantage of their established CCP. This can be done without establishing additional links to third parties. To this end  SIX Swiss Exchange is working together with the Group’s internal CCP SIX x-clear as well as with Cboe Clear Europe and LCH Ltd.
