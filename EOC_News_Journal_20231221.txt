He then explained that the proposal has its roots in an October plan put forward by European Commission (EC) President Ursula von der Leyen. She said at the time that the EC is still working on this plan  which involves seizing the profits derived from Russian state assets frozen in Brussels and transferring them to Ukraine for the latter's post-war reconstruction.Von der Leyen remarked that the value of frozen Russian sovereign assets amounts to €211 billion ($230.83 billion). Meanwhile  authorities in Belgium – where most of Moscow's assets are deposited – said the assets frozen there could yield around €3 billion ($3.28 billion) annually.Spain  which will assume the rotating presidency of the European Union's Council of Ministers for this semester  has continued to push von der Leyen's plan. According to Madrid's estimates  the benefits from Central Bank of Russia reserves frozen in EU countries could generate between €15 billion ($16.41 billion) and €17 billion ($18.6 billion) for Kyiv by 2027.Under the proposal  the EC will provide Kyiv with €17 billion ($18.6 billion) in subsidies and another €33 billion ($36.1 billion) in low-interest loans until 2027 to avoid Ukraine's bankruptcy. But Adel could not help but point out: ""Amid the EU's economic recession  the confiscation and sale of frozen Russian assets emerge as a possible way to raise funds for Ukraine at a time when they are scarce for community policies.""The idea of reinvesting frozen Russian assets and using the profits to support Ukraine isn't new as the EC first put forward the idea in late November 2022. According to the commission's estimate  rebuilding Ukraine would require at least €600 billion ($656.34 billion). The cost  however  has likely skyrocketed since then. (Related: ""Reconstruction bank"" set up by globalist financiers to help Ukraine secure more than $411bn needed to rebuild.)Madrid's idea met with skepticismThe idea generated much skepticism in some EU member states such as France and Germany. Diplomatic sources told POLITICO magazine that the skepticism arose from the conviction that it may take years before the money reaches Kyiv. Moreover  the calculation Madrid used to come up with the amount has also generated confusion.Adel also noted that the EC could find itself in legal trouble if it appropriates frozen Russian assets for Ukraine's use. ""Under international law  state assets enjoy immunity from execution "" he wrote. ""Regardless of the changes that are introduced in legislation  the EU cannot confiscate these reserves.""International law practitioner Francis Bond told Euronews that for instance  Russian entities could claim they are entitled to some of the profits generated from the investment of the frozen assets. They could also challenge the decision to send the profits to Ukraine in both the European General Court and the European Court of Human Rights.Bond  a senior associate at the London-based Macfarlanes law firm  also noted that Russia will have the right to go to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The ICSID  which is the World Bank's arbitration court  is often the venue where these disputes are ironed out. Adel noted that such a prospect won't bode well for Spain  ""which has a long history of losing these types of cases.""Most of Russia's frozen foreign exchange reserves are at the Brussels-based Euroclear  a financial security clearing and settlement house that acts as a depository. Euroclear holds around €180 billion ($196.81 billion) in Russian securities. Clearstream  another clearing house based in Luxembourg  also holds Moscow's assets.However  both Belgium and Luxembourg want guarantees that they will not be forced to assume all the legal and financial risks of an unprecedented measure. If the investments lose money  Bond explained  the EC would have to guarantee the Russian assets with public money or risk an avalanche of legal action from the asset owners.""Given these conditions  attempts to redirect Russian assets and profits to Kyiv is nothing more than a pipe dream that will not eventuate – unless the entire EU wants to ruin its reputation and trustworthiness across the world "" concluded Adel.Head over to UkraineWitness.com for similar stories.Watch Col.

This evolution is not only about enhancing the dining experience but also about streamlining operational efficiency and adapting to the changing preferences of consumers. For example  according to Deloitte  60% of consumers believe that technology improves their dining experience by streamlining operations and reducing wait times.Such statistics including the fact that there has been a 65% growth in online food orders and a 31% increase in takeaway service since the pandemic  are transforming restaurants from traditional eating spaces into technologically advanced environments where payment technologies are integrated into the customer experience. This has led to the creation of comprehensive  immersive experiences that bridge physical and digital  including not only augmented-reality menus and AI-driven meal recommendations but also a seamless integration of the dining experience with digital platforms  all the way through to an almost unnoticeable act of payment.Worldline Food Services Payments Suite has been developed specifically to:Answer our customers’ food and beverage use cases beyond traditional payment processing. For example  it encapsulates developments and trends within the industry by facilitating the latest digital solutions like wallets  QR codes  and in-app payments.Put the emphasis on the customer engagement experience  particularly at point of checkout. This new and innovative solution creates a more memorable and satisfying experience where the use of data-driven analytics  often powered by AI  plays a pivotal role.Enable extended connectivity into the food services ecosystem by using customer data. This offering integrates closely with the hardware and maintenance partners  to offer more targeted and appropriate services and nurture a more loyal customer base.Florian Cottereau  Global Head of Sales for Retail and Food & Beverage  Merchant Services at Worldline  explains: “Worldline is a major payment service partner of main international brands of Quick Service Restaurants in Europe and the UK  such as Subway SSP  or Areas.

CARBIOS  (Euronext Growth Paris : ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  has received an initial payment of €1.2 million1 from the French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME) for the OPTI-ZYME research project  carried out in partnership with INRAE2  INSA3 and CNRS4 via the TWB5 joint service and TBI6 research units  a project co-funded by the French State as part of France 2030 operated by ADEME. With CARBIOS' aim to optimize and continuously improve its unique enzymatic PET depolymerization technology  the 4-year7 OPTI-ZYME project aims to investigate the scientific and technical levers for improving the competitiveness of the process  optimizing the necessary investments and reducing its environmental footprint.This collaborative R&D program focuses on the technical and economic optimization of process stages  while preserving the quality of the monomers obtained. These optimizations  new developments and the exploration of innovative solutions should enhance the technology's flexibility with regards to incoming waste. Raw materials could come from different sources that are currently rarely or not recycled  notably food trays and textiles  or a mix of incoming materials. It also aims to limit input and water consumption  as well as regenerate or reduce co-products and ultimate residual waste. Finally  it seeks to support enzyme optimization to maximize the process’ economic profitability and competitiveness. The project therefore aims to achieve an overall improvement in performance  combining efficiency  quality and environmental sustainability  to benefit the Longlaville plant which is currently under construction  and future licensed plants.Emmanuel Ladent  CEO of CARBIOS: ""Innovation is at the heart of all CARBIOS activities. In our constant drive for technological improvement  and to support industrial and commercial deployment  we must continue to innovate at every stage of the process. The targeted optimizations will improve enzyme performance and contribute to greater productivity  while reducing production costs and the environmental impact of the process to meet the economic and sustainable development challenges of our future licensees. Our aim is to remain the most attractive offer on the recycling market"".In May 2023  CARBIOS  the project leader and coordinator  announced that it had been awarded a total of €11.4M in funding by the French State as part of France 2030  operated by ADEME  including €8.2M directly for CARBIOS (€3.2M in grants and €5M in repayable advances) and €3.2M for its academic partners INRAE  INSA and CNRS (via the TWB mixed service and TBI research units). This funding  which is made up of grants and repayable advances  will be paid out in several instalments over the course of the project  including an initial instalment of 15%  equivalent to €1.2 million  received by CARBIOS on 5 December 2023. The first Monitoring Committee with ADEME for the first key stage of the project will be held in February 2024 to validate the granting of the second instalment of funding.This project 2282D0513-A is funded by the French State as part of France 2030 operated by ADEME.###About CARBIOS:CARBIOS is a biotech company developing and industrializing biological solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles.

To shed light on anticipated trends and innovations impacting the healthcare industry in 2024  leading experts from across Wolters Kluwer Health offer their expectations for healthcare AI in 2024. Cutting through the hype  the predictions offer a compelling narrative of what’s ahead and guide us toward a more informed  connected  and resilient future in healthcare.Top 4 impact-drivers for generative AI in 2024“2024 will be a watershed year for GenAI  particularly in healthcare. Look for solutions emerging in four key areas in 2024: lightening administrative burdens across the hospital; helping sharpen clinicians' decision-making; boosting the efficiency of medical researchers; and helping the next generation of healthcare workers ramp up proficiency with smarter learning tools.”Stacey Caywood  CEO of Wolters Kluwer HealthGenAI is here to stay: for clinical decision support  easing bottlenecks“The adoption of artificial intelligence in the clinical setting will continue to evolve  particularly with generative AI for clinical decision support  as healthcare organizations begin piloting and evaluating these solutions for responsible and safe patient care applications. GenAI has the potential to help clinicians make decisions more accurately and efficiently at the point of care.”“The capabilities of AI will far outpace the scaled-up adoption of AI applications  which are constrained by workflow  competing priorities and economic considerations driving uptake. We expect most of the uptake to be dominated by existing workflow applications such as EMRs and related services like documentation  although operational applications such as nurse scheduling  revenue cycle management  and prior authorization will also get an AI boost.”Peter Bonis  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Wolters Kluwer HealthBuilding trust into healthcare GenAI: content quality is the critical driver in 2024“Leveraging GenAI with clinical decision support could provide a way for providers to make faster and better decisions. We predict as healthcare explores GenAI and patient care  the source and vetting of the underlying content will become a key factor in the speed in which it is deployed. It is said that innovation happens at the speed of trust – in healthcare that trust is based on the quality of the underlying content and its evidence base.”Greg Samios  President & Chief Executive Officer of Clinical Effectiveness at Wolters Kluwer HealthFrom rat’s nest to ready: taming health data for AI prime-time“Health organizations are making it a strategic priority to extract more value from the volumes of data they're moving to the cloud. One big health data target in 2024? Training AI models on all that data. To make it happen however  they'll first need to untangle a rat's nest of messy data. In the race to build data-rich AI models in '24  many will turn to AI-driven terminology tech that speeds normalization of data  making it ready for prime-time.”Brian Laberge  Solutions Engineer  Health Language at Wolters Kluwer HealthThe AI has to be right: the role of AI in nursing education“In 2024  we will see students and professors continue to experiment with the use of AI in education. Both students and educators are looking for ways to improve the traditional workflows of the classroom. By leveraging AI  faculty can reduce some of the workload burden with development of lesson plans  and more efficiently testing student knowledge and adjusting learning accordingly. For students  the proper use of AI can give them access to trusted learning materials in an easier to find  and digestible  conversational format.”“Education companies will act as fast movers since they are already dealing with time-pressed students – who are also savvy consumers – who expect to be engaged and leverage personalized study resources. For medical and nursing education  the AI has to be right – students must graduate clinically competent and confident  and they cannot learn from content that is not evidence-based  current and accurate. While there are many discussions and pilots happening currently  2024 will be the year we see both of these groups push their institutions for real-life implementations.”Julie Stegman  Vice President  Health Learning & Practice at Wolters Kluwer HealthBuilding the future on Wolters Kluwer’s solid AI foundationIn healthcare  trust is at the center of every interaction. A recent Wolters Kluwer survey found consumers worry about a lack of transparency in the origins of information being used by GenAI. Most need to know the company behind the GenAI has a long track record in healthcare. (Survey executive summary)Around 50% of Wolters Kluwer’s digital revenues now come from products that leverage artificial intelligence. Wolters Kluwer products  services and expert solutions are based on a foundation of trust  transparency  and responsibility – in line with the company’s values.

Introduction and explanation of the important changes   This remuneration policy sets out the principles used by Montea NV for the remuneration of its directors and executive management in accordance wit…,"Remuneration policy 1. Introduction and explanation of the important changes This remuneration policy sets out the principles used by Montea NV (Montea) for the remuneration of its directors and executive management in accordance with article 7:89/1 of the Companies and Associations Code (CAC) and the Belgian Corporate Governance Code 2020 (Code 2020). This policy has been prepared by the board of directors of the statutory director Montea Management NV (referred to hereinafter as the Board of Directors)  based on the recommendations of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. The remuneration policy was approved for the first time by Montea's annual general meeting of shareholders of 18 May 2021. The main change in this version compared to the remuneration policy approved at the annual general meeting of shareholders of 2021 is the introduction of the option to introduce a long-term incentive plan in order to meet market demand for a part of the executive management's remuneration to be based on long- term performance targets. This proposed amendment is further described in section 5.3.2. This remuneration policy will be presented for approval to the annual general meeting of shareholders to be held in 2022 and  if approved  will apply to the remuneration of directors and members of the executive management as from the 2022 financial year onwards. The aim is to apply this remuneration policy for several years. However  the policy may be amended whenever this is deemed necessary by the Board of Directors  upon the recommendation of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and  to the extent required by law  subject to the approval of the general meeting of shareholders. In any event - whether amended or not - the policy will be presented to the general meeting of shareholders for approval at least every four years. In case a significant number of votes are casted against the remuneration policy  the Board of Directors will take the necessary steps to take into account the concerns of those who voted against the policy in relation to the further application and amendment of the policy. 2. General principles regarding remuneration Remuneration supports the realisation of Montea's strategic objectives. Montea is a pure logistics real estate player. It seeks to achieve sustainable value creation by making high-quality property investments aimed at profitable growth. In the first instance  the remuneration of the executive management is based on the overall performance of Montea and is designed to enable the members of the executive management to benefit from its profitable growth. Also individual performance criteria are taken into account based on evolving strategic implementation priorities. For non-executive directors  their remuneration needs to be such that sufficient expertise can be attracted in order to formulate a clear growth strategy and monitor its implementation. The remuneration policy is designed to attract  reward and retain the talent required to safeguard the long-term interests of Montea and to enable sustainable value creation. Montea seeks to offer competitive remuneration  on the one hand  while at the same time avoiding excessive remuneration  on the other hand. The pay and working conditions of Montea employees form the basis for determining the remuneration of the executive management. Employees may be allocated options or the ability to purchase shares of Montea as part of the same option plan or the same share purchase plan as the executive management (see section 5.1.2). 3. The statutory director The function of Montea Management NV as statutory director is remunerated in accordance with what is set out in Montea's articles of association. The statutory director's remuneration is made up of (i) a variable 1Remuneration policy remuneration  based on Montea's financial results; (ii) a fixed remuneration; and (iii) reimbursement of expenses associated with the statutory director's function: The variable remuneration is equal to 0.25% of the sum of: The adjusted result: net result + depreciation + write-downs - reversal of write-downs - reversal of rentals carried forward and discounted +/- other non-monetary items +/- result from the sale of real estate ; Net gains on the realisation of property not exempt from the mandatory distribution of profits. Fixed remuneration is €15 000 per annum. Any reimbursement of expenses associated with the statutory director's task. In principle  this remuneration covers the total cost of remuneration for the directors of the statutory director  remuneration for the CEO and the operating overhead costs of Montea Management NV. Final allocation of remuneration will be submitted annually for approval to the Montea's general meeting of shareholders of the following financial year. 4. Board of Directors and its committees 4.1 General Given the management structure of Montea  this remuneration policy applies to the directors of the statutory director of Montea  i.e. Montea Management NV. As required by the legislator and set out in Montea's corporate governance charter  this structure is transparent and  for governance purposes  the Board of Directors is considered as the board of directors of Montea itself. The remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors depends on their qualification as non-executive or executive directors. The remuneration is discussed each year by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and submitted to the Board of Directors. Conflicts of interest will be dealt with in accordance with Montea's corporate governance charter and the applicable legislation. No one will participate in a meeting at which his/her own remuneration is being dealt with. The amount of director remuneration is determined based on benchmark studies regarding the remuneration policy of other Belgian GVV/SIR and/or listed companies. 4.2 Non-executive directors General The amounts for the directors' remuneration for non-executive directors are approved annually by the general meeting of shareholders of Montea Management NV at the proposal of the Board of Directors and on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. The Board of Directors determines the amount of the remuneration on the basis of the principle of continuity  on the one hand  and on benchmark studies  on the other hand. Non-executive members of the Board of Directors do not receive performance-related remuneration. Non-executive directors are not paid (not even partially) in Montea shares. By this  Montea deviates from recommendation 7.6 of the Code 2020 to compensate non-executive directors in part with shares in the listed company concerned. Through this recommendation  the Belgian Corporate Governance Committee aims to better align the interests of non-executive directors with the long-term shareholding interest. However  Montea is of the opinion that the long-term shareholding interest is sufficiently represented in the Board of Directors through the directors who are part of the Pierre De Pauw family  a major shareholder in Montea. 2Remuneration policy Non-independentnon-executive directors Non-independentnon-executive directors do not receive a fixed remuneration or attendance fee as non- executive member of the Board of Directors. However  they do receive a fixed remuneration if they chair the Board of Directors or an Investment Committee.an attendance fee for their participation in and contribution to meetings of the Investment Committee(s) of which they may be a member (see below). Independent directors Independent non-executive directors receive fixed annual director's remuneration  as well as attendance fees for attending meetings of the Board of Directors  the Audit Committee  the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and the Investment Committee(s) of which they are a member. If they chair a committee of the Board of Directors  they receive an additional fixed remuneration for this. 4.3 Executive directors Executive directors do not receive a remuneration for the exercise of their mandate as director. They are only remunerated in the context of their position as a member of the executive management  as set forth in section 5 (Executive management) of this remuneration policy. They do not receive any remuneration for their participation in and contribution to meetings of the Investment Committee(s) of which they are members unless they are chairman of an Investment Committee (in which case they receive a fixed remuneration for this mandate). 4.4 Chairman of the Board of Directors and committees The chairman of the Board of Directors and the chairmen of the Audit Committee  the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and the Investment Committees1 receive a fixed remuneration in proportion to the responsibility and time associated with the position of chairman.

There are currently three investment committees: Investment Committee France  Investment Committee the Netherlands and Investment Committee Internal which discusses investment and disinvestment project in Belgium and other countries in which Montea operates. These are committees on which members other than directors sit. 3Remuneration policy 4.5 Schematic representation Board of Audit Remuneration and Investment Fixed Nomination remuneration Directors Committee Committee Committee per annum Non-independent non- attendance fee for each meeting executive director attended attendance fee attendance fee attendance fee for attendance fee Independent director for each meeting for each meeting each meeting for each meeting Yes attended attended attended attended Executive director * Executive management Chairman of the Board Yes of Directors Chairman of the Audit Yes Committee Chairman of the Remuneration and Yes Nomination Committee Chairman of an Yes Investment Committee Unless such person is chairman of an Investment Committee  in which case he/she received a fixed remuneration for such function.5. Executive management The remuneration of the members of the executive management depends on their respective responsibilities and the market practice in the sector. The remuneration of the members of the executive management consists of a fixed part and a variable part. The variable part consists of  on the one hand  a performance-related payment over a reference period of 1 (one) year and  on the other hand  a performance-related payment over a reference period equal to or exceeding 3 (three) years. The variable remuneration can take the form of cash and/or share- related payments (including  but not limited to  share options) and is payable on expiry of the relevant reference period. Each year  on the proposal of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee  the Board of Directors decides on the short-term variable remuneration of the members of the executive management. In this context  the Board of Directors determines the amount of variable remuneration  as well as the targets for the performance criteria on which this remuneration will depend in the coming performance period. As regards long-term variable remuneration  the Board of Directors  upon the proposal of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee  will determine the objectives as well as the amounts and the duration prior to the implementation of the relevant plan. For more details on the variable remuneration  please refer to section 5.3 of this remuneration policy. In case the member of the executive management in question is also a director  the conflict of interest procedures as set forth in articles 36 to 38 of the GVV/SIR Act and article 7:96 Companies and Associations Code will be applied in relation to any decisions concerning the remuneration of the executive management. The members of the executive management will not receive a remuneration for their participation for their participation in and contribution to meetings of the Investment Committee(s) of which they are a member. 4Remuneration policy The relative share of the components of the annual remuneration is as follows: Manager Fixed remuneration  Short-term variable CAP additional short-term variable pension and fringe benefits remuneration (on-target) remuneration in case of overachievement CEO ± ≥ 75% ± ≤ 25% 25% of the total on-target remuneration Other members of ± ≥ 75% ± ≤ 25% 25% of the total on-target the executive remuneration management If it is decided to offer long-term variable remuneration  the Board of Directors shall ensure that - if the relative share of the variable remuneration (on-targetshort-term and long-termperformance-related remuneration) exceeds 25% of the relevant total annual remuneration - the distribution rule of article 7:91 of the Code of Companies and Associations is complied with. Moreover  the remuneration for exceeding the targets related to the long-term variable remuneration may not exceed 50% of the total on-targetlong-term variable remuneration. 5.1 Fixed remuneration When referring to ""fixed remuneration"" Montea refers to  on the one hand  the annual fixed remuneration to be paid to the member of the executive management as stated in the individual management agreement or employment agreement with the person concerned (see section 5.1.1). On the other hand  the Board of Directors has the option  but not the obligation  to grant share options and/or to have the executive management participate in a share purchase plan (see section 5.1.2). These instruments are not necessarily used on an annual basis. 5.1.1 Remuneration based on the individual management agreement or employment agreement The basic remuneration of the executive management is assessed each year by the Board of Directors on the advice and at the proposal of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. The Board of Directors determines the amount of the remuneration based on the principle of continuity  on the one hand  and on benchmark studies  on the other hand. 5.1.2 Option plan and share purchase plan On the recommendation of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee  the Board of Directors has decided not to oblige the executive management to maintain a minimum level of shares in Montea  in derogation of article 7.9 of the Code 2020. The Remuneration and Nomination Committee will assess this recommendation on a regular basis and report accordingly to the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the absence of an obligation for the executive management  there is an option plan and share purchase plan in place to the benefit of the members of the (executive and non-executive) management  as well as to certain other employees. The options/shares under these plans are allocated on a discretionary basis by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee (the aim of which is to reach as wide an audience as possible). Given that neither the allocation under the option plan  nor the offer under the share purchase plan is subject to achieving performance criteria  these plans qualify as fixed remuneration. 5Remuneration policy The beneficiaries under the option plan and share purchase plan have  as the case may  the possibility to: acquire options with a term of ten years that can be exercised at a price equal to the lowest of(a) the closing price of the share on Euronext Brussels to which the option grants a right on the trading day prior to the day of the offer; and (b) the average closing price of the share on Euronext Brussels to which the option grants a right for a period of 20 trading days prior to the day of the offer. Options become permanently acquired (""vesting"") after a period of three years; or purchase shares at a price per share equal to 83.33% of the price equal to the lowest of (a) the closing price of the share on Euronext Brussels to which the option grants a right on the trading day prior to the day of the offer; and (b) the average closing price of the share on Euronext Brussels to which the option grants a right for a period of 20 trading days prior to the day of the offer. Under this plan  the shares are subject to a lock-up period of 3.5 years. In case the lock-up period does not longer justify said discount  the Board of Directors has the option to reassess this lock-up period. In both plans  exercising the option / purchase of shares is carried out using the private funds of the beneficiaries. The company does not facilitate the financing of these transactions. The number of options or shares that can be acquired in this manner is determined each year by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. Notwithstanding the fact that on the date of this remuneration policy neither the option plan nor the share purchase plan is subject to the achievement of performance criteria  Montea considers both plans to be an adequate long-term incentive mechanism for the following reasons: The option planThose employees  company managers (natural persons only) and self-employed service providers (natural persons only) who are taxable in Belgium on their earnings or on their profits and dividends  are subject to the Belgian Share Option Act of 26th March 1999. Under the Belgian Share Option Act  the aforementioned types of beneficiaries are taxed at the time the Options are allocated. This is on the basis of the actual market value of the shares in Montea at the time of the Offer. In other words  given that (i) these types of beneficiaries already have to pay tax at the time of accepting the options and (ii) the vesting period is three years  they will be given an incentive to make a contribution towards the long-term value of Montea so that the tax already paid can be recouped.In this context it must be underlined that during the period between accepting the offer and exercising the options  the holder has no right to any dividend associated with the underlying Montea share. The share purchase planThe shares that a beneficiary may purchase under the share purchase plan are subject to a lock-up period of 3.5 years. This means that it is in the interests of the beneficiary to work towards increasing the value of Montea shares in the long term. Each year the Remuneration and Nomination Committee will review whether it is advisable to link certain performance criteria to said plans. It also retains the right to make proposals aimed at altering the plans in question in this sense  if applicable. If the Remuneration and Nomination Committee makes such a recommendation  it will limit itself to the same performance criteria as those set out in section 5.3. If the option plan and/or share purchase plan is linked to achieving certain performance criteria  these plans will no longer qualify as fixed remuneration  but as variable remuneration. 6Remuneration policy 5.2 Pensions and benefits in kind Montea provides a supplementary pension for the members of its executive management who provide services to Montea as natural persons. Montea will bear the expense of a number of other benefits  such as a company car  mobile phone  laptop  hospitalisation insurance  D&O policy  etc. allocated to the members of the executive management. The terms and conditions for (the use of) these benefits are the same as for Montea employees. In the context of potential professional liability claims  the executive management and all directors are covered by a director liability policy (D&O policy). The total premium is borne by Montea. No other additional forms of remuneration will be paid to the directors. 5.3 Variable remuneration Variable remuneration for the executive management consists partly of a short-term bonus that is paid in cash or any other payment instrument with a similar cost for Montea  and partly of a long-term remuneration that can be paid out in cash and/or share options and/or shares depending on the plan. Variable remuneration can only be allocated to the extent that (a) the part of the variable remuneration that is linked to the results only relates to Montea's consolidated net result  excluding any fluctuation in the fair value of the assets and the hedging instruments  and (b) no remuneration is allocated on the basis of a specific operation or transaction by Montea. The amount that the individual in question can earn is capped (for more details on this  see section 5.3.1 and section 5.3.2). 5.3.1 Short-term variable remuneration The short-term variable remuneration of the CEO and the other members of the executive management depends on predetermined performance criteria linked to Montea's strategic priorities over a reference period of one year. The actual implementation and weighting for each year of each KPI will be determined each year by the Board of Directors on the proposal of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. These performance criteria contribute to Montea's business strategy  long-term interests  and sustainability  as follows: 7Remuneration policy Strategy KPI Growth of the portfolioIN Offering a stable and - insofar as possible - growingN dividend C I A L Maintaining a high occupancy rate by focusing on the type of customer and their activity N O N Implementation of Plan 2030/2050 in which Montea's aims are linked to the 4 Ps approach (People  Planet  Profit and Policy). F I N A N High-quality HR managementI A L Achieving the targeted growth of the property portfolio in logistics real estate Achieving the targeted EPRA result per share (EPS) Achieving and maintaining a targeted occupancy rate of the buildings Achieving 1 ESG KPI at minimum Organising of and participating to initiatives to maintain team spirit  performance and staff satisfaction at a high level By way of an assessment interview between the chairman of the Board of Directors and the member of the executive management  it is established each year whether the predetermined (financial and non-financial) targets have been achieved. This assessment and the variable remuneration linked to it  is discussed by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee  and is subsequently submitted to the next meeting of the Board of Directors which decides on the final allocation of the short-term variable remuneration. In that context the actual realisation of the financial performance targets is verified on the basis of Montea's consolidated annual accounts. An overachievement can be acknowledged. The amount paid for overachievement of short-term targets should not exceed 25% of the total on-targetshort-term variable remuneration. 5.3.2 Long-term variable remuneration In addition to the short-termperformance-related remuneration  the CEO and certain members of the executive management are  on the proposal of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and after approval by the Board of Directors  also eligible for a long-termperformance-related remuneration in cash and/or share options and/or shares. The vesting of this long-term payment is subject to the realisation of long-term targets over a reference period between 3 and 5 years  as determined by the Board of Directors. The long-term variable remuneration becomes unconditional in February of the year following the end of the reference period concerned  in proportion to the achievement of the long-term objectives. The long-term objectives are linked to predetermined performance criteria in line with Montea's strategic priorities. The KPIs to which the long-termperformance-related fee will be linked will relate to  among other things  portfolio growth  growth of the result and the creation of shareholder value  thereby contributing to Montea's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability. The concrete interpretation and weighting for each KPI will be determined at the beginning of a reference period by the Board of Directors on the proposal of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. 8Remuneration policy For the long-term variable remuneration  the remuneration for exceeding the long-term objectives may amount to a maximum of 50% of the total on-targetlong-term variable remuneration. 6. Agreements 6.1 Term In principle  the term of the directors' mandates is 3 years  except in case of reappointment. The term of a director's mandate who is reappointed is  in principle  4 years. The general meeting of shareholders of Montea Management NV may deviate from this  in line with Montea's corporate governance charter  in order to enable a certain degree of rotation within the Board of Directors. The directors do not benefit from any dismissal protection. 6.2 Claw-back At current  Montea does not provide for the right to withdraw or claim back variable remuneration paid to the executive management if the remuneration is allocated based on incorrect financial data. However  going forward  Montea will include such claw-back right if new agreements would be entered into with the executive management. 6.3 Pensions Montea provides a pension plan for the members of its executive management who provide services as natural persons to Montea  as set out above in section 5.2. Montea does not provide a pension plan for the directors. 6.4 Severance pay In principle  Montea concludes a management agreement of an indefinite term with the self-employed members of the executive management. Severance pay is negotiated on an individual basis and determined in the management agreement. The Board of Directors ensures that any severance pay does not exceed 12 months' remuneration. For those members of the executive management who perform their function as part of an employment agreement  Montea applies the rules from the Employment Agreements Act. The shares acquired in the context of the share purchase plan and which are still subject to the lock-up period can be bought back by Montea. The number of shares than can be bought back depends on the fact of whether the person involved is considered as a good or a bad leaver by the Board of Directors and the extent to which the lock-up period has already elapsed. The price at which the shares can be bought back is the purchase price concerned. The consequences of the departure of a person on the options that have been allocated to this person under the option plan will depend  among others  on whether this person is leaving on his/her own initiative  the reasons for the departure and whether the options have already been vested. Depending on the circumstances  the options may either be retained  in full or in part  and (temporarily) exercised  or lapse by force law. In case of creation of any other share-related plans  similar rules will be determined in line with the applicable legislation and this remuneration policy. 9",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.03,0.38,0.59,True,English,"['Remuneration Policy', 'Montea', 'December', '10:04', 'pure logistics real estate player', 'long- term performance targets', 'same share purchase plan', 'evolving strategic implementation priorities', 'Belgian Corporate Governance Code', 'corporate governance charter', 'sustainable value creation', 'individual performance criteria', 'operating overhead costs', 'long-term incentive plan', 'other non-monetary items', 'clear growth strategy', 'same option plan', 'high-quality property investments', 'annual general meeting', 'following financial year', 'Montea Management NV', 'Remuneration policy remuneration', 'strategic objectives', 'overall performance', 'same time', '2022 financial year', 'long-term interests', 'other hand', 'executive management', 'Associations Code', 'profitable growth', 'financial results', 'management structure', 'Montea NV', 'important changes', 'statutory director', 'Nomination Committee', 'first time', 'main change', 'market demand', 'several years', 'significant number', 'necessary steps', 'first instance', 'sufficient expertise', 'one hand', 'working conditions', 'Net gains', 'mandatory distribution', 'total cost', 'Final allocation', 'General principles', 'competitive remuneration', 'excessive remuneration', 'fixed remuneration', 'net result', 'remuneration Remuneration', 'variable remuneration', 'non-executive directors', 'Montea employees', 'Introduction', 'explanation', 'accordance', 'article', 'Companies', 'CAC', 'board', 'recommendations', 'shareholders', '18 May', 'version', 'order', 'part', 'amendment', 'section', 'approval', 'members', 'aim', 'extent', 'law', 'event', 'case', 'votes', 'account', 'concerns', 'relation', 'application', 'realisation', 'talent', 'pay', 'basis', 'options', 'ability', 'shares', 'function', 'reimbursement', 'expenses', 'sum', 'depreciation', 'write-downs', 'reversal', 'rentals', 'sale', 'profits', 'annum', 'task', 'CEO', 'committees', 'legislator']",2023-12-20,2023-12-21,marketscreener.com

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALTME)  a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME)  announces that with median overall survival (mOS) has now passed 19 months and will improve further in the GLORIA expansion arm for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients receiving NOX-A12with the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab and radiotherapy.""The survival data in the cohort receiving the combination of NOX-A12  bevacizumab and radiotherapy has continued to improve with treatment or follow-up of enrolled brain cancer patients. Passing 19 months suggests a large survival benefit for patients on NOX-A12-basedtherapy since we are seeing more than an 80% increase in survival over the 10.5 months in the matched standard of care reference cohort of patients with the same profile as those we recruited into the study of NOX-A12:newly-diagnosed aggressive brain cancer (glioblastoma) with chemotherapy refractory tumors not amenable to complete surgical resection "" said Aram Mangasarian  CEO of TME Pharma. ""With further perspective on the data we can now say with certainty that median overall survival will be between 19.0 and 19.9 months and plan to provide an update before the end of February 2024.""The NOX-A12-based combination with bevacizumab and radiotherapy has now further surpassed the median overall survival figures achieved in what TME Pharma believes to be all the relevant competitor studies conducted in the US or EU involving newly diagnosed  chemotherapy-resistant (MGMT unmethylated) glioblastoma patients which ranged from 13.4 to 16.5 months mOS for therapies in clinical development and 16.9 months demonstrated by the Tumor Treating Fields device that was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for newly-diagnosed glioblastoma in 20151. In addition  the NOX-A12-based therapy achieved this result despite having a more difficult population to treat since only patients with residual detectable tumor after surgery were included the NOX-A12 trial  while competing trials included patients with complete removal of detectable tumor.1 See annex to the TME Pharma press release published on 13 September 2023",neutral,0.02,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.29,0.33,0.39,True,English,"['TME Pharma N', 'Other news releases', 'Inside Information', 'December', '03:13', 'Tumor Treating Fields device', 'TME Pharma N.V.', 'TME Pharma press release', 'median overall survival figures', 'GLORIA BRAIN CANCER TRIAL', 'MGMT unmethylated) glioblastoma patients', 'GLORIA expansion arm', 'aggressive brain cancer', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'chemotherapy refractory tumors', 'relevant competitor studies', 'large survival benefit', 'TME PHARMA ANNOUNCES', 'residual detectable tumor', 'brain cancer patients', 'The NOX-A12-based combination', 'bevacizumab Survival rate', 'care reference cohort', '13.4 to 16.5 months mOS', 'tumor microenvironment', 'NOX-A12 trial', 'NOX-A12-based therapy', 'survival data', 'FURTHER IMPROVEMENT', 'biotechnology company', 'VEGF inhibitor', 'same profile', 'surgical resection', 'Aram Mangasarian', 'clinical development', 'Drug Administration', 'difficult population', 'competing trials', 'complete removal', 'NOX-A12 combination', 'novel therapies', 'US Food', '19 MONTHS', '10.5 months', '19.9 months', '16.9 months', 'radiotherapy', 'standard', 'Berlin', 'Germany', 'CET', 'ALTME', 'treatment', 'NOX-A12with', 'follow', 'up', 'NOX-A12-basedtherapy', '80% increase', 'study', 'CEO', 'perspective', 'certainty', 'end', 'February', 'chemotherapy-resistant', 'FDA', 'addition', 'result', 'surgery', 'annex', '13 September', '08.00', '19.0']",2023-12-20,2023-12-21,marketscreener.com

Lanifibranor is believed to be the first drug candidate to receive such designation from both the FDA and the NMPA.As of December 20  2023  a total of 793 patients have been randomized in NATiV3 of which 657 in the main cohort and 136 in the exploratory cohort. 607 patients are currently in the screening process.The last patient first visit in the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial is now expected in the first quarter of 2024  and the target number of randomized patients in the main cohort is expected to be reached in the second quarter of 2024.Analysis of the baseline characteristics of all patients randomized in the main cohort suggests a patient profile aligned with those of patients randomized in the NATIVE Phase II clinical trial.Lanifibranor continues to show a favorable tolerability profile as confirmed by the third Data Monitoring Committee2 of November 2023.Topline results of the proof-of-concept Phase II clinical trial  LEGEND  evaluating lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin are expected in the first quarter of 2024.Daix (France)  Long Island City (New York  United States)  December 20  2023 – Inventiva (Euronext Paris and Nasdaq: IVA) (the “Company”)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs  today announced that the first patient has been randomized in China in the global NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial and provided an update on its clinical development program.Milestone payment from CTTQ and EIB loanFollowing the randomization of the first patient in China  Inventiva is eligible to receive a $3 million milestone payment from Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co.  Ltd. (“CTTQ”). This would be the second of the two short-term milestone payments following the $2 million milestone payment from CTTQ received on July 19  2023  under the license and collaboration agreement with CTTQ. Upon the anticipated receipt in January 2024 of this $3 million milestone  Inventiva is expected to have met all financial and operational conditions precedent required to draw the second €25 million tranche under the finance contract with the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) dated May 16  2022 (the ""Finance Contract""). The Company expects to draw this second tranche in early 2024  following the issuance of warrants to the EIB as provided in the Finance Contract.Breakthrough Therapy Designation for lanifibranor in NASH by China’s NMPALanifibranor was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for NASH by China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). Similar to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Breakthrough Therapy Designation  this designation is intended to accelerate the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The NMPA granted “Breakthrough Therapy Designation” based on the results of Inventiva's Phase IIb NATIVE clinical trial. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor is the first drug candidate to receive “Breakthrough Therapy Designation” from both the FDA and the NMPA for the treatment of NASH.NATiV3 updateFrederic Cren  CEO and co-founder of Inventiva said: ”While we are not reaching the first visit of the last patient by the end of 2023 as previously projected  the improvements in the randomization  screening numbers and screen failure rate give us confidence that we can reach this milestone in the first quarter of 2024. The recommendation of our third Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) in November 20242 to continue the trial without modification to the protocol is further confirmation of the good safety profile of lanifibranor. Furthermore  we have high hopes that the results of the LEGEND trial will show benefit of the combination of lanifibranor with empagliflozin in patients with NASH.”As of December 20  2023  468 clinical sites have been activated in 24 countries  including China  and a total of 793 patients have been randomized  of which 657 in the main cohort and 136 in the exploratory cohort. 607 patients are in the screening process and  based on the recent screen failure rate of approximately 80%  Inventiva expects 121 additional patients to be randomized in the main cohort in the next 10 weeks.Since July  with limited contribution from the sites in China  the newly opened sites and a third party clinical network in Mexico  between 250 to 300 patients are screened and approximately 50 patients are randomized in the main cohort each month  and the monthly enrolment rate is averaging 0.14 patient/site/month in the main cohort. Therefore  if the current screen failure rate for the main cohort and the number of patients entering the screening process are maintained  Inventiva now expects the first visit of the last patient to be in the first quarter of 2024 and to complete randomization in the second quarter of 2024.Topline results for the Phase III NATiV3 clinical trial are now expected to be published in the first half of 2026 versus the second half of 2025  as previously communicated.If the results of the trial confirm sufficient clinical benefit and a continued good safety profile  Inventiva plans to submit an application for accelerated approval in the United States and conditional approval in the European Union for the marketing of lanifibranor. In addition  CTTQ would also be in capacity to submit an application for a marketing authorization in Greater China.NATiV3 patients distribution and characteristicApproximately 70% of the patients randomized in the main and exploratory cohorts are from the United States  ~20% from Europe and ~10% from Latin America and the rest of the world.At baseline  13% of patients randomized in the main cohort are receiving a stable dose GLP1 receptor agonists and 8% are receiving stable SGLT2 inhibitors.The baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled so far in the main cohort are in line with expectations and the patient population in the NATIVE Phase IIb clinical trial. The main difference in patient characteristics observed thus far is that there is a higher percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the main cohort of the NATiV3 Phase III trial compared to the NATIVE Phase IIb trial (55% vs 42%  respectively). The effect size of lanifibranor therapy over placebo in the Phase IIb clinical trial on the composite endpoint “NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement” (which corresponds to the primary efficacy endpoint in the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial)  was higher in patients with T2D than in patients without diabetes: 21% and 26% for lanifibranor 800 and 1200 mg/day  respectively  in patients with T2D compared to 7% and 22%  respectively  in patients without T2D. Given the higher risk of hepatic and extrahepatic morbidity in patients with T2D and NASH3  the higher effect size observed in patients with NASH and T2D treated with lanifibranor in the Phase IIb trial is an important result for this specific patient population if confirmed in the larger clinical trial.As of December 20  2023  136 patients are randomised in the exploratory cohort including approximately 30% of patients with fibrosis stage F4. Inventiva believes that this subgroup of patients will provide valuable data on lanifibranor efficacy and safety.Lanifibranor continues to show a favorable tolerability profile as confirmed by the third Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) that took place late November 20232. This safety assessment was based on the review of safety data from more than 500 patients  including patients that have been treated with lanifibranor for more than 72 weeks.Update on Phase II clinical trial LEGENDEnrolment in the proof of concept  LEGEND Phase II clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in combination with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in patients with NASH has been stopped  and data collection and cleaning is ongoing. The first topline results on primary and secondary endpoints are expected for the end of the first quarter of 2024. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial is a change in Hemoglobin A1c (“HbA1c”) at the end of the 24-week treatment compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints include changes in liver enzymes  glycaemic and lipids parameters  and inflammatory markers. The trial has been designed to provide valuable information on body weight evolution in patients with NASH and T2D when treated with lanifibranor and empagliflozin  and on the reduction of hepatic steatosis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce antifibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (“PPAR”) isoforms  which are well-characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well-balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.About the NATiV3 Phase III trialNATiV3 is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of lanifibranor (800mg/daily and 1200mg/daily) in adult patients with biopsy-proven non-cirrhotic NASH and F2/F3 stage of liver fibrosis. The trial takes place in 24 countries and in more than 400 clinical sites and to recruit approximately 900 patients to be treated over a 72-week period. The effect of lanifibranor will be assessed on several histological endpoints  including NASH resolution and improvement of fibrosis of at least one stage.An exploratory cohort is anticipated to enrol approximately 200 patients with NASH and fibrosis screen-failed on histology for the main NATiV3 clinical trial. Inventiva anticipates that this exploratory cohort may allow the generation of additional data using non-invasive tests and contribute to the regulatory safety database requirement to support the planned submission for potential accelerated approval to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and potential conditional approval to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) of lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.Topline results of NATiV3 are expected for the half 2026.

Lanifibranor is believed to be the first drug candidate to receive such designation from both the FDA and the NMPA.As of December 20  2023  a total of 793 patients have been randomized in NATiV3 of which 657 in the main cohort and 136 in the exploratory cohort. 607 patients are currently in the screening process.The last patient first visit in the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial is now expected in the first quarter of 2024  and the target number of randomized patients in the main cohort is expected to be reached in the second quarter of 2024.Analysis of the baseline characteristics of all patients randomized in the main cohort suggests a patient profile aligned with those of patients randomized in the NATIVE Phase II clinical trial.Lanifibranor continues to show a favorable tolerability profile as confirmed by the third Data Monitoring Committee2 of November 2023.Topline results of the proof-of-concept Phase II clinical trial  LEGEND  evaluating lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin are expected in the first quarter of 2024.Daix (France)  Long Island City (New York  United States)  December 20  2023 – Inventiva (Euronext Paris and Nasdaq: IVA) (the “Company”)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs  today announced that the first patient has been randomized in China in the global NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial and provided an update on its clinical development program.Milestone payment from CTTQ and EIB loanFollowing the randomization of the first patient in China  Inventiva is eligible to receive a $3 million milestone payment from Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co.  Ltd. (“CTTQ”). This would be the second of the two short-term milestone payments following the $2 million milestone payment from CTTQ received on July 19  2023  under the license and collaboration agreement with CTTQ. Upon the anticipated receipt in January 2024 of this $3 million milestone  Inventiva is expected to have met all financial and operational conditions precedent required to draw the second €25 million tranche under the finance contract with the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) dated May 16  2022 (the ""Finance Contract""). The Company expects to draw this second tranche in early 2024  following the issuance of warrants to the EIB as provided in the Finance Contract.Breakthrough Therapy Designation for lanifibranor in NASH by China’s NMPALanifibranor was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for NASH by China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). Similar to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Breakthrough Therapy Designation  this designation is intended to accelerate the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The NMPA granted “Breakthrough Therapy Designation” based on the results of Inventiva's Phase IIb NATIVE clinical trial. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor is the first drug candidate to receive “Breakthrough Therapy Designation” from both the FDA and the NMPA for the treatment of NASH.NATiV3 updateFrederic Cren  CEO and co-founder of Inventiva said: ”While we are not reaching the first visit of the last patient by the end of 2023 as previously projected  the improvements in the randomization  screening numbers and screen failure rate give us confidence that we can reach this milestone in the first quarter of 2024. The recommendation of our third Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) in November 20242 to continue the trial without modification to the protocol is further confirmation of the good safety profile of lanifibranor. Furthermore  we have high hopes that the results of the LEGEND trial will show benefit of the combination of lanifibranor with empagliflozin in patients with NASH.”As of December 20  2023  468 clinical sites have been activated in 24 countries  including China  and a total of 793 patients have been randomized  of which 657 in the main cohort and 136 in the exploratory cohort. 607 patients are in the screening process and  based on the recent screen failure rate of approximately 80%  Inventiva expects 121 additional patients to be randomized in the main cohort in the next 10 weeks.Since July  with limited contribution from the sites in China  the newly opened sites and a third party clinical network in Mexico  between 250 to 300 patients are screened and approximately 50 patients are randomized in the main cohort each month  and the monthly enrolment rate is averaging 0.14 patient/site/month in the main cohort. Therefore  if the current screen failure rate for the main cohort and the number of patients entering the screening process are maintained  Inventiva now expects the first visit of the last patient to be in the first quarter of 2024 and to complete randomization in the second quarter of 2024.Topline results for the Phase III NATiV3 clinical trial are now expected to be published in the first half of 2026 versus the second half of 2025  as previously communicated.If the results of the trial confirm sufficient clinical benefit and a continued good safety profile  Inventiva plans to submit an application for accelerated approval in the United States and conditional approval in the European Union for the marketing of lanifibranor. In addition  CTTQ would also be in capacity to submit an application for a marketing authorization in Greater China.NATiV3 patients distribution and characteristicApproximately 70% of the patients randomized in the main and exploratory cohorts are from the United States  ~20% from Europe and ~10% from Latin America and the rest of the world.At baseline  13% of patients randomized in the main cohort are receiving a stable dose GLP1 receptor agonists and 8% are receiving stable SGLT2 inhibitors.The baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled so far in the main cohort are in line with expectations and the patient population in the NATIVE Phase IIb clinical trial. The main difference in patient characteristics observed thus far is that there is a higher percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the main cohort of the NATiV3 Phase III trial compared to the NATIVE Phase IIb trial (55% vs 42%  respectively). The effect size of lanifibranor therapy over placebo in the Phase IIb clinical trial on the composite endpoint “NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement” (which corresponds to the primary efficacy endpoint in the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial)  was higher in patients with T2D than in patients without diabetes: 21% and 26% for lanifibranor 800 and 1200 mg/day  respectively  in patients with T2D compared to 7% and 22%  respectively  in patients without T2D. Given the higher risk of hepatic and extrahepatic morbidity in patients with T2D and NASH3  the higher effect size observed in patients with NASH and T2D treated with lanifibranor in the Phase IIb trial is an important result for this specific patient population if confirmed in the larger clinical trial.As of December 20  2023  136 patients are randomised in the exploratory cohort including approximately 30% of patients with fibrosis stage F4. Inventiva believes that this subgroup of patients will provide valuable data on lanifibranor efficacy and safety.Lanifibranor continues to show a favorable tolerability profile as confirmed by the third Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) that took place late November 20232. This safety assessment was based on the review of safety data from more than 500 patients  including patients that have been treated with lanifibranor for more than 72 weeks.Update on Phase II clinical trial LEGENDEnrolment in the proof of concept  LEGEND Phase II clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in combination with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in patients with NASH has been stopped  and data collection and cleaning is ongoing. The first topline results on primary and secondary endpoints are expected for the end of the first quarter of 2024. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial is a change in Hemoglobin A1c (“HbA1c”) at the end of the 24-week treatment compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints include changes in liver enzymes  glycaemic and lipids parameters  and inflammatory markers. The trial has been designed to provide valuable information on body weight evolution in patients with NASH and T2D when treated with lanifibranor and empagliflozin  and on the reduction of hepatic steatosis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce antifibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (“PPAR”) isoforms  which are well-characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well-balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.About the NATiV3 Phase III trialNATiV3 is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of lanifibranor (800mg/daily and 1200mg/daily) in adult patients with biopsy-proven non-cirrhotic NASH and F2/F3 stage of liver fibrosis. The trial takes place in 24 countries and in more than 400 clinical sites and to recruit approximately 900 patients to be treated over a 72-week period. The effect of lanifibranor will be assessed on several histological endpoints  including NASH resolution and improvement of fibrosis of at least one stage.An exploratory cohort is anticipated to enrol approximately 200 patients with NASH and fibrosis screen-failed on histology for the main NATiV3 clinical trial. Inventiva anticipates that this exploratory cohort may allow the generation of additional data using non-invasive tests and contribute to the regulatory safety database requirement to support the planned submission for potential accelerated approval to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and potential conditional approval to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) of lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.Topline results of NATiV3 are expected for the half 2026.

These steps  updating our Terra approach  come after governments at COP28 agreed to transition away from fossil fuels and triple renewable energy capacity.Steven van Rijswijk  CEO of ING said: “Climate change is one of the world’s biggest challenges. The world needs energy  but still too much of that is coming from fossil fuels. Building on the progress made by world leaders at the COP28 conference and the most recent scientific insights and scenarios  we’re today announcing our next impactful actions to contribute to the acceleration of the energy transition. We significantly increase our commitment to renewable energy and at the same time give a clear  accelerated path for the complete phasing out of oil and gas extraction from our financing portfolio. We realise more work will be necessary by all parties to reach a net zero society. We will therefore continue to adapt our financing and policies  collaborating with clients  sector experts  scientists  regulators  and governments in addressing the urgency to transition to more sustainable ways of doing business.”ING will speed up phasing out the financing of upstream (exploration and production) oil and gas activities. With our Terra approach we aim to steer our oil and gas portfolio in line with the Net Zero Emissions scenario for Advanced Economies of the International Energy Agency (IEA). As a result  loans to upstream oil and gas activities will be reduced by 35% by 2030  which translates into a reduction of 50% absolute emissions financed linked to our upstream portfolio (scope 1  2  and 3). By 2040 the financed emissions linked to our portfolio will be reduced to zero. We take an inclusive approach and support our energy clients’ transition towards net zero.ING will also aim to triple the financing of renewable power generation to €7.5 billion annually by 2025  up from €2.5 billion in 2022. This follows the agreement made by governments at COP28 and the guidance provided by the IEA that renewable power generation must triple in capacity by 2030 to meet net-zero goals. Our new target  which is five years ahead of the COP28 guidance  replaces the previous target of increasing renewables financing by 50% by 2025 from the €1.5 billion base in 2021.As society transitions to a low-carbon economy  so do our clients  and so does ING. The low-carbon transition cannot happen overnight. So even though we finance a lot of sustainable activities  we still finance more that’s not. That is a reflection of the current global economy  how far the world has come and still needs to go. About 80% of energy used globally today is fossil fuel-based. Electrification is key for the decarbonisation of the global energy system. The IEA stresses the critical importance of the massive build-out of renewable power generation  like wind  solar  water and geothermal.In developing ING’s energy strategy  we balance three key interests: the need to decarbonise to fight climate change  the need for energy to remain affordable for people and companies  and the need for the energy supply to remain secure. Earlier major steps in adapting our policies included to stop financing coal fired power generation and thermal coal mining and the ending of dedicated financing of upstream and midstream for new oil and gas fields. We are guided by the IEA’s 1.5-degree climate scenario and will continue to update our targets in line with their net zero by 2050 pathways.Note for editorsFor further information on ING  please visit www.ing.com.

The ADDRESS results show the proportion of PV patients achieving the primary endpoint of complete remission on a minimal dose of steroids (CRmin) was not significantly different between efgartigimod SC and placebo.argenx will not pursue additional development in pemphigus and plans to prioritize clinical development of efgartigimod in its ongoing severe autoimmune indications.“We are disappointed by today’s results  particularly for pemphigus patients who have seen little innovation in this treatment space ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at argenx. “At argenx  we are in the business of transformation  providing new medicines that go beyond incremental benefit and raise the bar for what patients can expect from a treatment. While we will not move forward into pemphigus  our job today is the same as yesterday – continue to be execution-focused and data-driven  apply learnings across our ongoing development programs  and pursue optimal development of efgartigimod  empasiprubart and our earlier stage programs. 2023 was a remarkable year of growth for argenx across the business and we are poised to build on our success in 2024.“We are grateful to the pemphigus community and all involved in the ADDRESS study  including patients  healthcare professionals  and our argenx teams ” continued Dr. Truyen.ADDRESS Study ResultsThe Phase 3 ADDRESS study enrolled 222 adult patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing moderate-to-severe PV (n=190) or PF (n=32). Patients were randomized to efgartigimod SC or placebo with both treatment groups receiving concomitant steroids at a starting dose of 0.5mg/kg  which is a lower dose than recommended by current treatment guidelines and was tapered according to protocol upon achievement of complete remission.Consistent pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of efgartigimod SC : Treatment with efgartigimod SC led to total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and desmoglein autoantibody (DSG-1 and DSG-3) reductions up to 75%. The observed PD effect was consistent with previous clinical trials of efgartigimod.: Treatment with efgartigimod SC led to total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and desmoglein autoantibody (DSG-1 and DSG-3) reductions up to 75%. The observed PD effect was consistent with previous clinical trials of efgartigimod. Unexpected PD effect of corticosteroids : There was a higher than expected response to background treatment with corticosteroids  which showed a reduction of DSG-1 and DSG-3 levels of up to 70% in the placebo arm and correlated to sustained clinical benefit. The level of autoantibody reduction driven by corticosteroids in both treatment arms was sufficient for patients to achieve CRmin. The significant PD effect of corticosteroids was specific to DSG-1 and DSG-3 autoantibodies  while the observed effect on total IgG reduction was in line with the literature (up to 10%).: There was a higher than expected response to background treatment with corticosteroids  which showed a reduction of DSG-1 and DSG-3 levels of up to 70% in the placebo arm and correlated to sustained clinical benefit.

Study did not meet primary endpoint : Treatment with efgartigimod SC led to CRmin in 35.5% (44/124) of patients compared to 30.3% (20/66) with placebo (p=0.5956). Secondary endpoints were also not met  including CRmin in the overall pemphigus population (PV and PF)  cumulative dose of corticosteroids and time to disease control or complete remission: Treatment with efgartigimod SC led to CRmin in 35.5% (44/124) of patients compared to 30.3% (20/66) with placebo (p=0.5956). Secondary endpoints were also not met  including CRmin in the overall pemphigus population (PV and PF)  cumulative dose of corticosteroids and time to disease control or complete remission Consistent and favorable safety profile: Efgartigimod SC was well-tolerated in ADDRESS. The observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with other clinical trials and the confirmed safety profile of VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo.Update on BALLAD Studyargenx is reviewing the BALLAD study in light of the ADDRESS results and the comparable biology between pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid  and has decided not to make a GO/NO GO decision at this time but rather wait for learnings from all currently enrolled patients and consider a new trial design for the path forward.Conference Call Detailsargenx will host a conference call today at 2:30 pm CET (8:30am ET) to discuss the ADDRESS results.

Enrolled patients had newly diagnosed or relapsing moderate-to-severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV) or pemphigus foliaceus (PF) with PDAI scores of ≥15. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive efgartigimod SC or placebo for a total of 30 weeks as part of the primary trial. All patients were on concomitant corticosteroids at a starting dose of 0.5mg/kg/day  which could be tapered according to protocol upon achievement of complete remission (PDAI = 0). The primary endpoint was measured by the proportion of PV patients who achieved sustained complete remission on a minimal dose of corticosteroids (CRmin) within 30 weeks. Key secondary endpoints included proportion of overall population (PV and PF) who achieved CRmin  cumulative corticosteroid dose  and time to disease control and complete remission. At the end of the 30-week study  eligible patients entered a double-blind 8-week follow-up as part of the ADDRESS open-label extension study during which CRmin off treatment (efgartigimod SC or placebo) was assessed.About PemphigusPemphigus is a rare group of chronic blistering autoimmune diseases that affect the skin and mucous membranes  and are characterized by painful blisters  erosions and acantholysis  or disruption of keratinocyte adhesion. Blisters often break open  causing serious pain and increased risk of infection. Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceous are the most common forms of pemphigus.About the BALLAD StudyThe BALLAD study is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multicenter trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of VYVGART Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) in adult patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP). Enrolled patients have moderate to severe BP and are a more fragile and older population than pemphigus patients. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for a total of 36 weeks as part of the primary trial. All patients are on concomitant corticosteroids at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day  which could be tapered according to protocol upon achievement of complete remission (BPDAI= 0). The primary endpoint is measured at 36 weeks by the proportion of BP patients who achieved clinical remission while receiving efgartigimod SC or placebo but off corticosteroids therapy for at least 8 weeks. Key secondary endpoints include cumulative dose of corticosteroids from baseline  proportion of patients who achieve an Investigator Global Assessment of BP (IGA-BP) score of 0 or 1  changes from baseline in the BP Disease Area Index (BPDAI) activity score  proportion of patients who are in CR on minimal corticosteroids for at least 8 weeks at week 36 and time to control of disease or complete remission.About Bullous PemphigusBullous pemphigoid is a rare chronic blistering autoimmune disease and is the most common form of pemphigoid diseases. It is characterized by autoantibodies against structural proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction and  clinically  by tense blisters and erosions of skin or mucous membranes close to the skin surface. The disease has a strong impact on a person’s quality of life and is associated with a high mortality.About VYVGART Hytrulo (efgartigimod SC)VYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART®  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics.

The ADDRESS results show the proportion of PV patients achieving the primary endpoint of complete remission on a minimal dose of steroids (CRmin) was not significantly different between efgartigimod SC and placebo.argenx will not pursue additional development in pemphigus and plans to prioritize clinical development of efgartigimod in its ongoing severe autoimmune indications.“We are disappointed by today’s results  particularly for pemphigus patients who have seen little innovation in this treatment space ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at argenx. “At argenx  we are in the business of transformation  providing new medicines that go beyond incremental benefit and raise the bar for what patients can expect from a treatment. While we will not move forward into pemphigus  our job today is the same as yesterday – continue to be execution-focused and data-driven  apply learnings across our ongoing development programs  and pursue optimal development of efgartigimod  empasiprubart and our earlier stage programs. 2023 was a remarkable year of growth for argenx across the business and we are poised to build on our success in 2024.“We are grateful to the pemphigus community and all involved in the ADDRESS study  including patients  healthcare professionals  and our argenx teams ” continued Dr. Truyen.ADDRESS Study ResultsThe Phase 3 ADDRESS study enrolled 222 adult patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing moderate-to-severe PV (n=190) or PF (n=32). Patients were randomized to efgartigimod SC or placebo with both treatment groups receiving concomitant steroids at a starting dose of 0.5mg/kg  which is a lower dose than recommended by current treatment guidelines and was tapered according to protocol upon achievement of complete remission.Consistent pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of efgartigimod SC : Treatment with efgartigimod SC led to total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and desmoglein autoantibody (DSG-1 and DSG-3) reductions up to 75%. The observed PD effect was consistent with previous clinical trials of efgartigimod.: Treatment with efgartigimod SC led to total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and desmoglein autoantibody (DSG-1 and DSG-3) reductions up to 75%. The observed PD effect was consistent with previous clinical trials of efgartigimod. Unexpected PD effect of corticosteroids : There was a higher than expected response to background treatment with corticosteroids  which showed a reduction of DSG-1 and DSG-3 levels of up to 70% in the placebo arm and correlated to sustained clinical benefit. The level of autoantibody reduction driven by corticosteroids in both treatment arms was sufficient for patients to achieve CRmin. The significant PD effect of corticosteroids was specific to DSG-1 and DSG-3 autoantibodies  while the observed effect on total IgG reduction was in line with the literature (up to 10%).: There was a higher than expected response to background treatment with corticosteroids  which showed a reduction of DSG-1 and DSG-3 levels of up to 70% in the placebo arm and correlated to sustained clinical benefit.

The significant PD effect of corticosteroids was specific to DSG-1 and DSG-3 autoantibodies  while the observed effect on total IgG reduction was in line with the literature (up to 10%). Study did not meet primary endpoint : Treatment with efgartigimod SC led to CRmin in 35.5% (44/124) of patients compared to 30.3% (20/66) with placebo (p=0.5956). Secondary endpoints were also not met  including CRmin in the overall pemphigus population (PV and PF)  cumulative dose of corticosteroids and time to disease control or complete remission: Treatment with efgartigimod SC led to CRmin in 35.5% (44/124) of patients compared to 30.3% (20/66) with placebo (p=0.5956). Secondary endpoints were also not met  including CRmin in the overall pemphigus population (PV and PF)  cumulative dose of corticosteroids and time to disease control or complete remission Consistent and favorable safety profile: Efgartigimod SC was well-tolerated in ADDRESS. The observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with other clinical trials and the confirmed safety profile of VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo.Update on BALLAD Studyargenx is reviewing the BALLAD study in light of the ADDRESS results and the comparable biology between pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid  and has decided not to make a GO/NO GO decision at this time but rather wait for learnings from all currently enrolled patients and consider a new trial design for the path forward.Conference Call Detailsargenx will host a conference call today at 2:30 pm CET (8:30am ET) to discuss the ADDRESS results. A webcast of the live call and replay may be accessed on the Investors section of the argenx website.Dial-in Numbers:Please dial in 15 minutes prior to the live call.Belgium 32 800 50 201 France 33 800 943355 Netherlands 31 20 795 1090 United Kingdom 44 800 358 0970 United States 1 888 415 4250 Japan 81 3 4578 9081 Switzerland 41 43 210 11 32About the ADDRESS StudyThe ADDRESS study was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multicenter  global trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of efgartigimod SC (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) in adult patients with pemphigus. Enrolled patients had newly diagnosed or relapsing moderate-to-severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV) or pemphigus foliaceus (PF) with PDAI scores of ≥15. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive efgartigimod SC or placebo for a total of 30 weeks as part of the primary trial. All patients were on concomitant corticosteroids at a starting dose of 0.5mg/kg/day  which could be tapered according to protocol upon achievement of complete remission (PDAI = 0). The primary endpoint was measured by the proportion of PV patients who achieved sustained complete remission on a minimal dose of corticosteroids (CRmin) within 30 weeks. Key secondary endpoints included proportion of overall population (PV and PF) who achieved CRmin  cumulative corticosteroid dose  and time to disease control and complete remission. At the end of the 30-week study  eligible patients entered a double-blind 8-week follow-up as part of the ADDRESS open-label extension study during which CRmin off treatment (efgartigimod SC or placebo) was assessed.About PemphigusPemphigus is a rare group of chronic blistering autoimmune diseases that affect the skin and mucous membranes  and are characterized by painful blisters  erosions and acantholysis  or disruption of keratinocyte adhesion. Blisters often break open  causing serious pain and increased risk of infection. Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceous are the most common forms of pemphigus.About the BALLAD StudyThe BALLAD study is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multicenter trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of VYVGART Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) in adult patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP). Enrolled patients have moderate to severe BP and are a more fragile and older population than pemphigus patients. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for a total of 36 weeks as part of the primary trial. All patients are on concomitant corticosteroids at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day  which could be tapered according to protocol upon achievement of complete remission (BPDAI= 0). The primary endpoint is measured at 36 weeks by the proportion of BP patients who achieved clinical remission while receiving efgartigimod SC or placebo but off corticosteroids therapy for at least 8 weeks. Key secondary endpoints include cumulative dose of corticosteroids from baseline  proportion of patients who achieve an Investigator Global Assessment of BP (IGA-BP) score of 0 or 1  changes from baseline in the BP Disease Area Index (BPDAI) activity score  proportion of patients who are in CR on minimal corticosteroids for at least 8 weeks at week 36 and time to control of disease or complete remission.About Bullous PemphigusBullous pemphigoid is a rare chronic blistering autoimmune disease and is the most common form of pemphigoid diseases. It is characterized by autoantibodies against structural proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction and  clinically  by tense blisters and erosions of skin or mucous membranes close to the skin surface. The disease has a strong impact on a person’s quality of life and is associated with a high mortality.About VYVGART Hytrulo (efgartigimod SC)VYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART®  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVGART Hytrulo results in the reduction of circulating IgG. VYVGART Hytrulo is the proprietary name in the U.S. for subcutaneous efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20. It is marketed in Europe as VYVGART and may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

These steps  updating our Terra approach  come after governments at COP28 agreed to transition away from fossil fuels and triple renewable energy capacity.Steven van Rijswijk  CEO of ING said: “Climate change is one of the world’s biggest challenges. The world needs energy  but still too much of that is coming from fossil fuels. Building on the progress made by world leaders at the COP28 conference and the most recent scientific insights and scenarios  we’re today announcing our next impactful actions to contribute to the acceleration of the energy transition. We significantly increase our commitment to renewable energy and at the same time give a clear  accelerated path for the complete phasing out of oil and gas extraction from our financing portfolio. We realise more work will be necessary by all parties to reach a net zero society. We will therefore continue to adapt our financing and policies  collaborating with clients  sector experts  scientists  regulators  and governments in addressing the urgency to transition to more sustainable ways of doing business.”ING will speed up phasing out the financing of upstream (exploration and production) oil and gas activities. With our Terra approach we aim to steer our oil and gas portfolio in line with the Net Zero Emissions scenario for Advanced Economies of the International Energy Agency (IEA). As a result  loans to upstream oil and gas activities will be reduced by 35% by 2030  which translates into a reduction of 50% absolute emissions financed linked to our upstream portfolio (scope 1  2  and 3). By 2040 the financed emissions linked to our portfolio will be reduced to zero. We take an inclusive approach and support our energy clients’ transition towards net zero.ING will also aim to triple the financing of renewable power generation to €7.5 billion annually by 2025  up from €2.5 billion in 2022. This follows the agreement made by governments at COP28 and the guidance provided by the IEA that renewable power generation must triple in capacity by 2030 to meet net-zero goals. Our new target  which is five years ahead of the COP28 guidance  replaces the previous target of increasing renewables financing by 50% by 2025 from the €1.5 billion base in 2021.As society transitions to a low-carbon economy  so do our clients  and so does ING. The low-carbon transition cannot happen overnight. So even though we finance a lot of sustainable activities  we still finance more that’s not. That is a reflection of the current global economy  how far the world has come and still needs to go. About 80% of energy used globally today is fossil fuel-based. Electrification is key for the decarbonisation of the global energy system. The IEA stresses the critical importance of the massive build-out of renewable power generation  like wind  solar  water and geothermal.In developing ING’s energy strategy  we balance three key interests: the need to decarbonise to fight climate change  the need for energy to remain affordable for people and companies  and the need for the energy supply to remain secure. Earlier major steps in adapting our policies included to stop financing coal fired power generation and thermal coal mining and the ending of dedicated financing of upstream and midstream for new oil and gas fields. We are guided by the IEA’s 1.5-degree climate scenario and will continue to update our targets in line with their net zero by 2050 pathways.Note for editorsFor further information on ING  please visit www.ing.com.

Margin loan rates from 5.83% to 6.83%.SoFi Invest Account Minimum $0 Fee $0 Active investing with SoFi makes it easy to start investing in stocks and ETFs.Vanguard Account Minimum $0 Fee Fees may vary Access lower costs and a wide variety of account types with Vanguard.Robinhood Account Minimum $0 Fee $0 No commission fees to trade stocks  options or crypto  and no account minimums to start. Move rightThat positive call comes after a tough year for bankers. So far  this year stands to be the second-worst for ECM transactions in the last decade after 2022  with $532 billion raised to date  according to Dealogic data.For IPOs  in particular  2023 has seen the lowest levels of activity in since 2016.Some of those that listed this year saw their share prices drop in the aftermarket  including chipmaker Arm Holdings and sandal maker Birkenstock.Many of those stocks are now trading above their issue price  amid a global rally in equities fuelled by growing consensus that interest rates have topped out.Markets are currently pricing in around 160 basis points of interest rate cuts from the Fed next year  while investors also think U.S. economy will avoid a major recession - both expectations reinforced by the latest economic data.""There is a clear understanding that we are  at worse  at a pause in the increase of interest rates and  at best  at the beginning of what could be a decline of interest rates "" said Stephane Boujnah  CEO of European stock exchange group Euronext. This would prompt investors to shift assets from bonds to shares  he said.The positive forecast from Goldman Sachs' Ludwig for 2024 is still far off the boom times of 2021. That said  the coming year could see Singapore-based fashion group Shein go public at a reported valuation as high as $90 billion  after recently filing paperwork for an IPO in the United States.Buyout group Permira is preparing to list Golden Goose  known for its luxury distressed sneakers  in Milan in a deal that could raise about 1 billion euros ($1.09 billion)  sources have said.Dealmakers expect buyout funds to be a vital source of business in the coming months  as these come under pressure to return capital to investors after one of the slowest years for private equity exits in a decade.""The pre-conditions are in place for IPO markets to re-open  and private equity owns large assets which are attractive to public market investors "" said Gareth McCartney  global co-head of ECM at UBS.Some asset managers are looking at going public like their portfolio companies  in a bid to finance expansion and allow their owners to sell their stakes.Britain's CVC could revive its listing plans after postponing a mooted IPO earlier this quarter  while General Atlantic is reportedly planning a U.S. listing.""Corporate break-ups and spin-offs are also an option for next year "" said Andreas Bernstorff  head of ECM at BNP Paribas for Europe  the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).Expected to join are European conglomerates including Bayer  Renault  Sanofi and Vivendi  which have announced plans to explore potential break-ups and spin-offs of their business divisions.Bankers warned that the market will need to see a few successful IPOs in the new year before it can open up to a wider group of companies. The U.S. presidential election may also limit the amount of time companies have access to the equity capital markets in the second half of 2024.While the IPO market recovers  dealmakers hope to continue raking in fees from arranging stake sales and capital increases at companies that are already publicly traded.""Secondary sell-downs have been a defining feature this year and will continue to be so next year  although to a lesser degree given the high volume in 2023 "" said James Palmer  head of EMEA ECM at Bank of America.The last few months have seen shareholders sell multibillion-dollar stakes in companies such as Heineken and the London Stock Exchange Group.Governments have also started to offload holdings in banks rescued during past crises  including Monte dei Paschi and ABN Amro.Company boards may also turn to equity and convertible debt as an alternative to refinance upcoming debt maturities  given higher borrowing costs.""I think 2024 has the potential to be very different "" Aloke Gupte  co-head of international ECM at JPMorgan.""While volatility is likely to persist  are there reasons to believe ’24 may be better than ’23?
