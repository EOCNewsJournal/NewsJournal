The parties discussed comprehensive bilateral relations in trade  tech  and political cooperation. Lavrov then convened a meeting with Kais Said  the President of Tunisia.Potential seizure of Russian frozen assets is a matter that has long been debated among the Kiev sponsors. The main issue is the lack of fundamental legal framework to carry out the procedure. Once Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine on February 24  2022  Western countries imposed unprecedented sanctions against Moscow  including freezing Russian assets roughly worth 300 billion euros ($329 billion). Almost 200 billion euros are stored in the European Union  mostly on Euroclear accounts  a European central securities depository.https://sputnikglobe.com/20231216/g7-takes-another-step-toward-global-pariah-status-with-russian-asset-theft-scheme-1115625780.htmlrussiatunisiakievSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 602023Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalseizing russian assets  russian assets stored in europe  eu stealing russian assets  russian money in eu  russia and tunisia  lavrov recent meetings  economic sanctions against russia,neutral,0.35,0.6,0.05,negative,0.02,0.2,0.79,True,English,"['Information US', 'Russian Assets', 'Europe', 'Laws', 'Lavrov', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'European central securities depository', 'comprehensive bilateral relations', 'fundamental legal framework', 'special military operation', 'Russian frozen assets', 'Russian Assets', 'European countries', 'European Union', 'russian money', 'United States', 'top-level talks', 'Tunisian counterpart', 'Nabil Ammar', 'political cooperation', 'Potential seizure', 'main issue', 'Western countries', 'unprecedented sanctions', 'Euroclear accounts', 'Sputnik International', 'Rosiya Segodnya', 'recent meetings', 'economic sanctions', 'Kais Said', '200 billion euros', 'Kiev sponsors', 'russia tunisia', 'sputnikglobe', 'information', 'laws', 'russian-assets', 'Thursday', 'world', 'meta', 'description', 'cdn1.', 'parties', 'trade', 'tech', 'President', 'matter', 'lack', 'procedure', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'Moscow', 'global-pariah-status', 'scheme', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2023-12-21,2023-12-22,sputnikglobe.com

So  it's not on top of the agenda for 2024 "" he added.Euronext's share price has recovered  but Allfunds' remains significantly lower.This has prompted Allfunds to appoint advisers for a strategic review that could result in a sale to a private equity fund  sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Allfunds declined to comment.Boujnah said Euronext – which operates bourses in Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Milan  Oslo and Paris – would consider adding new exchanges in continental Europe  although he said there are few left to consolidate.It will also explore acquisitions in adjacent sectors beyond Europe  having considered deals in Britain  the United States and some smaller transactions in Asia.""We will definitely look at assets in those geographies "" Boujnah  who has been Euronext CEO since 2015.Boujnah declined to comment on a Reuters report in September that Euronext was considering bidding for U.S. securities lending platform EquiLend.His update on Euronext's acquisition strategy come as stock exchange groups look for new revenue streams to reduce their reliance on more volatile listing and trading income.Global initial public offerings (IPOs) have had their worst year since 2016 so far in 2023  Dealogic data shows  as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty shook markets.However  Euronext said it is set to finish the year with 64 new listings  adding close to 50 billion euros in aggregate market capitalisation. These include the dual listings of Spanish transport giant Ferrovial in Amsterdam and U.S.-based fashion group Coty.Last year  the group reported 83 listings with a combined market value of 23 billion euros.""(International IPOs) don't go to London anymore  they go to Euronext markets "" he said.Asked about the risk of European firms moving their listings to the U.S. in search of higher valuations or deeper liquidity  Boujnah said the threat was bigger for the London Stock Exchange Group.""New York is a problem for London  not for Europe "" he said.""The main tension and the main problem of the attractiveness of New York has been for UK-based companies so far. For the moment  I don't see a risk of large European-based (firms) considering the same move.""The British capital is seeing a string of large firms shift their listings across the Atlantic  including construction materials group CRH and packaging firm Smurfit Kappa  as well as others pursuing IPOs abroad  such as chipmaker Arm Holdings.The UK is working to attract more IPOs by easing listing rules and encouraging investment into local start-ups. This week Britain's markets watchdog proposed a single entry point to simplify and speed up company listings  in the biggest shake up of its kind in three decades.Continental Europe has not been immune  however. German sandal maker Birkenstock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in October  while Ferrovial also wants a U.S. listing.The European Union has work to do to make its capital markets more competitive  including establishing a single markets watchdog akin to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  said Boujnah.""We need to proceed to a system of single supervision "" he said. ""There is a case and there is a momentum that is going in the right direction towards the emergence of a European SEC.""ECB President Christine Lagarde called for a European SEC and a consolidated capital market in a speech last month as a way to unlock financing for the bloc.

Shareholders approved the disposal of the Company's Russian business interests to Pavel Tetyakov  CEO of PetroNeft at the EGM on 12 October. Whilst all agreements are finalised  the Company still awaits final approval from the Russian government committee to enable the transaction to proceed.The Company had originally hoped that the sale of its Russian assets would occur in sufficient time to provide capital and time to source an auditor in respect of the Company's financial statements for the financial year ended 31st December 2022. However due to ongoing delays regarding the completion  the Company has been unable to secure the services of an auditor and it is therefore with regret that the Company will be unable to publish the 2022 Annual Report by 31 December 2023. Consequently  the admission of the Company's ordinary shares to trading on AIM and Euronext Growth will be cancelled on or around 2 January 2024.The Board and Management will continue to work to close the disposal of the Company's Russian assets in a timely fashion. Following closing of the sale  the proceeds will be used for full and final settlement of loan amounts outstanding pursuant to updated loan agreements  and the residual funds will be used to settle trade creditors and remaining staff salaries. Once payables have been satisfied  the Board will seek shareholder approval to close the Company through an orderly wind up.For further information  contact:,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,negative,0.01,0.14,0.85,True,English,"['PetroNeft Resources', 'Company Update', 'December', '04', 'Highlights Awaiting final sanction', 'remaining staff salaries', 'Russian business interests', 'Russian government committee', 'EuroNext Growth markets', 'final approval', 'final settlement', 'Russian assets', 'following update', 'Pavel Tetyakov', 'financial statements', 'financial year', 'ongoing delays', '2022 Annual Report', 'timely fashion', 'loan amounts', 'residual funds', 'trade creditors', 'shareholder approval', 'sufficient time', 'ordinary shares', 'loan agreements', 'The Board', 'The Company', 'PetroNeft', 'position', 'authorities', 'disposal', 'auditor', '2022 audit', 'trading', 'AIM', '31st', 'December', 'Background', '14 June', '1 August', 'sale', 'CEO', 'Shareholders', 'EGM', '12 October', 'transaction', 'capital', 'respect', 'completion', 'services', 'regret', 'admission', '2 January', 'Management', 'closing', 'proceeds', 'full', 'payables', 'orderly', 'information']",2023-12-21,2023-12-22,marketscreener.com

In November  the Company launched ‘Shares to Win’  its first employee share purchase plan  an ambitious incentive program that enables employees to become shareholders in the Company on preferential terms.Initially launched to 85 000 employees in France and Italy between November 13 and November 30  Shares to Win was met with great success  with a total investment of around €65 million  including €47 million from individual investment and €18 million matched by the Company  representing around 4.4 million additional shares held by employees.“The success of this step of Shares to Win in Italy and France demonstrates our employees’ confidence in the sustainable future of our Company supported by the execution of our Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  which maps out the path to achieving carbon net zero by 2038 and creating value for all our stakeholders ” said Xavier Chéreau  Chief HR & Transformation Officer. “Initiated in France and Italy  our ambition is to ensure that as many of our valuable employees as possible can also become Stellantis shareholders in the near future. This demonstrates our commitment to collective success and the sharing of value creation  while fostering cohesion and pride in belonging to Stellantis.”A total of 22% of eligible employees subscribed to Shares to Win this year  with an individual investment of around €2 470.In France  31% of eligible Stellantis employees subscribed to Shares to Win.

The reference share price is equal to the average closing price of Stellantis shares on the Milano stock exchange between October 12 and November 8  2023.- A contribution of 100% of the employee’s personal contribution  up to € 1 000 grossThis is equivalent to 62 to 68 shares offered by Stellantis for €1 000 invested by the employee  depending on the legislation in place in the country.This employee share purchase plan should be extended worldwide  starting in the first half of 2024 to 242 000 eligible employees in 18 countries  according to equivalent incentive guiding principles.Then  in 2025 it would be further expanded to all countries where Stellantis operates  as soon as the regulatory and economic context allows.About StellantisStellantis N.V.

The 550kW biomass heating system can efficiently and autonomously heat three tanks with a capacity of 15 cbm each. A heat recovery unit allows up to 40% of the energy produced to be saved. All of the biomass used is sourced from a range of less than 50km  the majority of which is produced autonomously on the participating farms.To bolster the site’s energy self-sufficiency  a biogas cogeneration engine was installed and connected by the group's teams in order to enable direct use  when needed  of this energy  which is decorrelated from market price fluctuations.Sales on this project amount to €1.1 million for 2023. It demonstrates Charwood Energy's ability to participate in biomass recovery projects with innovative solutions offering greater energy flexibility.The biogas produced from this unit will mainly be reinjected into the GRDF natural gas network.This latest achievement confirms the relevance of the agricultural methanization model which enables players to move away from fossil fuels by producing carbon-free energy at a local level  while also reducing the carbon footprint at the regional level.Next publicationFebruary 29  2024: Revenue for fiscal year 2023About Charwood EnergyConvinced that biomass is one of the keys to meeting the challenges of the energy transition  Charwood Energy designs  installs and maintains customized solutions for the production of renewable energy from biomass.Charwood Energy possesses a wealth of technical know-how and is proficient in all biomass recovery technologies - heating systems and networks  methanization and pyrogasification.Positioned since 2019 in the promising process of pyrogasification  Charwood Energy is now also involved in the development and operation of pyrogasification units on its own account  to produce and sell green gas (syngas)  biochar and carbon credits to industrial customers  through direct supply contracts.The company is listed on Euronext Growth® Paris (ISIN: FR001400AJ60  ticker: ALCWE) - Eligible for inclusion in French PEA and PEA-PME equity savings plans.

The production technology used has been determined  and will be based on the so-called ""direct pathway"" process  with total integration of the production chain and minimization of input requirements. The finalization of the basic engineering design  concurrent with the signing of the first tranche of financing for the plant  is expected in summer 2024. This first tranche will include part of the €16.4 million financing awarded by Bpifrance as part of the France 2030 plan. Once completed  the front end engineering design (FEED) will be carried out in order to finalize preparation for the construction of the plant which will take place between 2025 and 2027 on the French territory.This new plant will be the first in the world to convert plant-based resources into isobutene derivatives on a large scale  bearing specific high-performance properties. In the cosmetics market  the products will be marketed under the Isonaturane™ brand name  with applications ranging from make-up to skin care.Roland Desvignes  Industrial Director of Global Bioenergies  comments: ""I joined Global Bioenergies last July to implement this unique technology at the crossroads of industrial biotechnology and green chemistry. The project  already supported by the French government through a €16.4m financing  is progressing well and is taken care of by two engineering companies  each specialized in one of these two fields.”This plant will also kick-start the production of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF)  a market for which Global Bioenergies obtained ASTM certification last June and will open the door to the construction of multiple larger plants focused on this application. In this context  the Group recently initiated a plan to develop another production site  dimensioned at several tens of thousand tons specifically dedicated to SAF  with commissioning forecasted in 2030  at the time the European mandate expands to 6% SAF in all planes taking off from European airports.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies substitutes products of fossil origin with products of natural origin. In their quest for naturalness without compromising on performance  the cosmetics players are the Company's first customers. By 2027  the Company will be operating its innovative process in a large-scale plant. By 2030  the Company plans to become a leader in the huge emerging market for sustainable aviation fuels  in order to fight against global warming.

From 1 January 2024  Mercier Van Lanschot is the new name for the Mercier Vanderlinden and Van Lanschot Belgium combine.Upon completion of the transaction  Accuro’s clients and employees will be integrated into Mercier Van Lanschot  further expanding its offering and expertise for clients in Belgium  in particular in terms of investment advice.

We share the same vision of service: for the long haul  with the best experts and always personal. Following integration  our clients can rely on receiving investment advice from their trusted advisers  supported by the knowledge and experience of the Mercier Van Lanschot team. We’re extending a very warm welcome to our Accuro colleagues  whose founders’ continued engagement reflects the confidence we share in our joint future.”Hans De Schouwer  co-founder of Accuro  added: “Since inception  Accuro has grown into a prominent investment advice company in Belgium’s financial industry. To continue offering our clients the best possible care and continuity in an increasingly complex world  we’ve been searching for a strong partner that shares our standards and values  and we’re happy to have found them in Mercier Van Lanschot. We look forward to providing an even better service to our clients in this new set-up and with the scale it brings. Within our new alliance  we’ll be putting our weight behind the advisory department and build it into the benchmark for investment advice in the Belgian market.”The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to have a negative impact of 0.4 percentage points on Van Lanschot Kempen’s capital ratio. Van Lanschot Kempen will pay 60% in cash and 40% in existing shares for the acquisition  locked up until 2030.

The sole seller of these shares is Xtrion NV.Article 7:97  §1  second subparagraph of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code (BCAC) provides that listed companies (X-FAB) are not allowed to take any decision regarding a related party transaction without the prior approval by the board of directors having applied the special procedure contained in article 7:97 BCAC.Considering that X-FAB and Xtrion are related parties in accordance with IAS 24  the decision to approve the purchase price and terms and conditions of the Share Transfer Agreement by the board of directors of X-FAB  triggered the conflict of interests' procedure for related party transactions under article 7:97 BCAC.After advice from the committee of independent directors  dated December 21  2023  the board of directors approved the Transaction and the signing of the Share Transfer Agreement. This decision is in line with the conclusion of the committee of independent directors  which states:""It is the opinion of the Committee that the Transaction and the Share Transfer Agreement are:not such as to cause X-FAB a disadvantage which  in light of the strategy of X-FAB  is manifestly illegitimate; andX-FAB a disadvantage which  in light of the strategy of X-FAB  is manifestly illegitimate; and in the interest of X-FAB and do not cause a disadvantage to X-FAB which would not be outweighed by benefits for X-FAB.""The auditor has assessed the financial and accounting information mentioned in the related minutes of the board of directors and in the above-mentioned committee's advice.

So far  this year stands to be the second-worst for ECM transactions in the last decade after 2022  with $532 billion raised to date  according to Dealogic data.For IPOs  in particular  2023 has seen the lowest levels of activity in since 2016.Some of those that listed this year saw their share prices drop in the aftermarket  including chipmaker Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) and sandal maker Birkenstock (NYSE: ).Many of those stocks are now trading above their issue price  amid a global rally in equities fuelled by growing consensus that interest rates have topped out.Markets are currently pricing in around 160 basis points of interest rate cuts from the Fed next year  while investors also think U.S. economy will avoid a major recession - both expectations reinforced by the latest economic data.""There is a clear understanding that we are  at worse  at a pause in the increase of interest rates and  at best  at the beginning of what could be a decline of interest rates "" said Stephane Boujnah  CEO of European stock exchange group Euronext. This would prompt investors to shift assets from bonds to shares  he said.The positive forecast from Goldman Sachs' Ludwig for 2024 is still far off the boom times of 2021. That said  the coming year could see Singapore-based fashion group Shein go public at a reported valuation as high as $90 billion  after recently filing paperwork for an IPO in the United States.Buyout group Permira is preparing to list Golden Goose  known for its luxury distressed sneakers  in Milan in a deal that could raise about 1 billion euros ($1.09 billion)  sources have said.Dealmakers expect buyout funds to be a vital source of business in the coming months  as these come under pressure to return capital to investors after one of the slowest years for private equity exits in a decade.""The pre-conditions are in place for IPO markets to re-open  and private equity owns large assets which are attractive to public market investors "" said Gareth McCartney  global co-head of ECM at UBS.Some asset managers are looking at going public like their portfolio companies  in a bid to finance expansion and allow their owners to sell their stakes.Britain's CVC could revive its listing plans after postponing a mooted IPO earlier this quarter  while General Atlantic is reportedly planning a U.S. listing.""Corporate break-ups and spin-offs are also an option for next year "" said Andreas Bernstorff  head of ECM at BNP Paribas (OTC: ) for Europe  the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).Expected to join are European conglomerates including Bayer (OTC: )  Renault (EPA: )  Sanofi (NASDAQ: ) and Vivendi (OTC: )  which have announced plans to explore potential break-ups and spin-offs of their business divisions.Bankers warned that the market will need to see a few successful IPOs in the new year before it can open up to a wider group of companies. The U.S. presidential election may also limit the amount of time companies have access to the equity capital markets in the second half of 2024.While the IPO market recovers  dealmakers hope to continue raking in fees from arranging stake sales and capital increases at companies that are already publicly traded.""Secondary sell-downs have been a defining feature this year and will continue to be so next year  although to a lesser degree given the high volume in 2023 "" said James Palmer  head of EMEA ECM at Bank of America.The last few months have seen shareholders sell multibillion-dollar stakes in companies such as Heineken (AS: ) and the London Stock Exchange Group (LON: ).Governments have also started to offload holdings in banks rescued during past crises  including Monte dei Paschi and ABN Amro.Company boards may also turn to equity and convertible debt as an alternative to refinance upcoming debt maturities  given higher borrowing costs.""I think 2024 has the potential to be very different "" Aloke Gupte  co-head of international ECM at JPMorgan.""While volatility is likely to persist  are there reasons to believe ’24 may be better than ’23?

Sanofi is discontinuing the global clinical development program of tusamitamab ravtansine. The decision is based on the outcome of a prespecified interim analysis of the Phase 3 CARMEN-LC03 trial evaluating tusamitamab ravtansine as monotherapy compared to docetaxel in previously treated patients with metastatic non-squamous (NSq) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express high levels of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5).An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) found that tusamitamab ravtansine as a monotherapy did not meet its dual primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) compared to docetaxel. Despite an improved overall survival (OS) trend  termination of the program was based on non-improvement in PFS at the final analysis. Tusamitamab ravtansine had a similar safety profile as previously presented with a lower incidence of various important clinical categories of adverse events versus docetaxel. Trial participants will have the option to stay on their current therapy if they are benefitting  as deemed by their provider  or to transition to an appropriate standard-of-care therapy.Sanofi will continue exploring the potential of antibody tusamitamab-based ADCs and CEACAM5 research in several types of cancer.Dietmar BergerChief Medical Officer and Head of Development“Our team is grateful to the patients  families and healthcare professionals involved in the tusamitamab ravtansine development program. Although the results are not what we hoped for  our research and work to advance potentially transformative therapies in areas of high unmet need for people living with cancer will not stop. We will continue to explore the potential of CEACAM5 as a biomarker in cancer types where it is highly expressed.”CEACAM5 is a member of the CEACAM family of 12 glycoproteins and may drive cell adhesion and migration  as well as inhibit apoptosis  and may be overexpressed in many different cancer types.About the CARMEN-LC03 TrialCARMEN-LC03 was a randomized  open-label Phase 3 study evaluating tusamitamab ravtansine as monotherapy compared to docetaxel in patients with metastatic NSq NSCLC and high CEACAM5 expression. The dual primary endpoints of CARMEN-LC03 were progression-free survival and overall survival. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate  health-related quality of life  safety and duration of response.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

So far  this year stands to be the second-worst for ECM transactions in the last decade after 2022  with $532 billion raised to date  according to Dealogic data.For IPOs  in particular  2023 has seen the lowest levels of activity in since 2016.Some of those that listed this year saw their share prices drop in the aftermarket  including chipmaker Arm Holdings and sandal maker Birkenstock.Many of those stocks are now trading above their issue price  amid a global rally in equities fuelled by growing consensus that interest rates have topped out.""There is a clear understanding that we are  at worse  at a pause in the increase of interest rates and  at best  at the beginning of what could be a decline of interest rates "" said Stephane Boujnah  CEO of European stock exchange group Euronext. This would prompt investors to shift assets from bonds to shares  he said.The positive forecast from Goldman Sachs' Ludwig for 2024 is still far off the boom times of 2021. That said  the coming year could see Singapore-based fashion group Shein go public at a reported valuation as high as $90 billion  after recently filing paperwork for an IPO in the United States.Buyout group Permira is preparing to list Golden Goose  known for its luxury distressed sneakers  in Milan in a deal that could raise about 1 billion euros ($1.09 billion)  sources have said.Dealmakers expect buyout funds to be a vital source of business in the coming months  as these come under pressure to return capital to investors after one of the slowest years for private equity exits in a decade.""The pre-conditions are in place for IPO markets to re-open  and private equity owns large assets which are attractive to public market investors "" said Gareth McCartney  global co-head of ECM at UBS.Some asset managers are looking at going public like their portfolio companies  in a bid to finance expansion and allow their owners to sell their stakes.Britain's CVC could revive its listing plans after postponing a mooted IPO earlier this quarter  while General Atlantic is reportedly planning a U.S. listing.""Corporate break-ups and spin-offs are also an option for next year "" said Andreas Bernstorff  head of ECM at BNP Paribas for Europe  the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).Expected to join are European conglomerates including Bayer   Renault  Sanofi and Vivendi   which have announced plans to explore potential break-ups and spin-offs of their business divisions.Bankers warned that the market will need to see a few successful IPOs in the new year before it can open up to a wider group of companies. The U.S. presidential election may also limit the amount of time companies have access to the equity capital markets in the second half of 2024.While the IPO market recovers  dealmakers hope to continue raking in fees from arranging stake sales and capital increases at companies that are already publicly traded.""Secondary sell-downs have been a defining feature this year and will continue to be so next year  although to a lesser degree given the high volume in 2023 "" said James Palmer  head of EMEA ECM at Bank of America.The last few months have seen shareholders sell multibillion-dollar stakes in companies such as Heineken and the London Stock Exchange Group.Governments have also started to offload holdings in banks rescued during past crises  including Monte dei Paschi and ABN Amro.Company boards may also turn to equity and convertible debt as an alternative to refinance upcoming debt maturities  given higher borrowing costs.""I think 2024 has the potential to be very different "" Aloke Gupte  co-head of international ECM at JPMorgan.""While volatility is likely to persist  are there reasons to believe ’24 may be better than ’23? Yes  very much so.""($1 = 0.9142 euros)(Reporting by Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro in London; Editing by Anousha Sakoui and Louise Heavens)",positive,0.61,0.38,0.01,mixed,0.16,0.38,0.45,True,English,"['early holiday gift', 'new year', 'IPO', 'Fed', 'The U.S. presidential election', 'U.S. Federal Reserve', 'European stock exchange group', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'U.S. listing', 'initial public offerings', 'Singapore-based fashion group', 'luxury distressed sneakers', 'Monte dei Paschi', 'higher borrowing costs', 'Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro', 'stock market listings', 'upcoming debt maturities', 'chipmaker Arm Holdings', 'private equity exits', ""Goldman Sachs' Ludwig"", 'equity capital markets', 'public market investors', 'Buyout group', 'European conglomerates', 'wider group', 'Daniel Ludwig', 'convertible debt', 'capital increases', 'IPO markets', 'fastest escalation', 'interest rates', 'positive call', 'Dealogic data', 'lowest levels', 'share prices', 'sandal maker', 'issue price', 'global rally', 'growing consensus', 'clear understanding', 'Stephane Boujnah', 'positive forecast', 'boom times', 'United States', 'Golden Goose', 'buyout funds', 'vital source', 'slowest years', 'Gareth McCartney', 'global co', 'asset managers', 'listing plans', 'General Atlantic', 'Corporate break-ups', 'Andreas Bernstorff', 'BNP Paribas', 'Middle East', 'second half', 'stake sales', 'Secondary sell-downs', 'defining feature', 'lesser degree', 'high volume', 'James Palmer', 'past crises', 'ABN Amro', 'Company boards', 'Aloke Gupte', 'Anousha Sakoui', 'Louise Heavens', 'new year', 'tough year', 'next year', 'ECM transactions', 'last decade', '1 billion euros', 'coming months', 'large assets', 'potential break-ups', 'business divisions', 'successful IPOs', 'multibillion-dollar stakes', 'international ECM', 'portfolio companies', 'time companies', 'global head', 'EMEA ECM', '0.9142 euros', 'Reuters', 'Bankers', 'recovery', 'decades', 'gut', 'volumes', 'breath', 'access', 'date', 'activity', 'aftermarket', 'Birkenstock', 'stocks', 'equities', 'pause', 'beginning', 'decline', 'CEO', 'Euronext', 'bonds', 'shares', 'Shein', 'valuation', 'paperwork', 'Permira', 'Milan', 'sources', 'Dealmakers', 'pressure', 'pre-conditions', 'place', 'UBS', 'bid', 'expansion', 'owners', 'Britain', 'CVC', 'mooted', 'spin-offs', 'option', 'Africa', 'Bayer', 'Renault', 'Sanofi', 'Vivendi', 'amount', 'fees', 'America', 'shareholders', 'Heineken', 'Governments', 'banks', 'alternative', 'JPMorgan', 'volatility', 'reasons', 'Editing']",2023-12-21,2023-12-22,marketscreener.com

Sanofi is discontinuing the global clinical development program of tusamitamab ravtansine. The decision is based on the outcome of a prespecified interim analysis of the Phase 3 CARMEN-LC03 trial evaluating tusamitamab ravtansine as monotherapy compared to docetaxel in previously treated patients with metastatic non-squamous (NSq) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express high levels of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5).An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) found that tusamitamab ravtansine as a monotherapy did not meet its dual primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) compared to docetaxel. Despite an improved overall survival (OS) trend  termination of the program was based on non-improvement in PFS at the final analysis. Tusamitamab ravtansine had a similar safety profile as previously presented with a lower incidence of various important clinical categories of adverse events versus docetaxel. Trial participants will have the option to stay on their current therapy if they are benefitting  as deemed by their provider  or to transition to an appropriate standard-of-care therapy.Sanofi will continue exploring the potential of antibody tusamitamab-based ADCs and CEACAM5 research in several types of cancer.Dietmar BergerChief Medical Officer and Head of Development“Our team is grateful to the patients  families and healthcare professionals involved in the tusamitamab ravtansine development program. Although the results are not what we hoped for  our research and work to advance potentially transformative therapies in areas of high unmet need for people living with cancer will not stop. We will continue to explore the potential of CEACAM5 as a biomarker in cancer types where it is highly expressed.”CEACAM5 is a member of the CEACAM family of 12 glycoproteins and may drive cell adhesion and migration  as well as inhibit apoptosis  and may be overexpressed in many different cancer types.About the CARMEN-LC03 TrialCARMEN-LC03 was a randomized  open-label Phase 3 study evaluating tusamitamab ravtansine as monotherapy compared to docetaxel in patients with metastatic NSq NSCLC and high CEACAM5 expression. The dual primary endpoints of CARMEN-LC03 were progression-free survival and overall survival. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate  health-related quality of life  safety and duration of response.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Photograph: Andrey RudakovRussia-focused energy firm Petroneft is t0 cease trading on the Irish stock exchange at the end of the year  following the suspension of its shares this summer.The Dublin and London-listed company  which focuses on oil and gas exploration and production in Russia  said in a statement this morning that the move was a result of it being “unable to appoint an auditor for the 2022 audit”.As a result  trading of its shares in both London’s AIM exchange and on Euronext Dublin will be “cancelled”  it said.Dealings in the company's ordinary shares have been suspended since July this year  after it missed a June deadline to publish its 2022 audited annual report and accounts.In October  shareholders agreed to sell the firm’s Russian business interests to Pavel Tetyakov  its chief executive. The deal is still awaiting final approval from the Russian authorities.Petroneft said delays with the completion of the transaction mean it has been unable to source an auditor for its 2022 financial statements in time for an end-of-year deadline.“Consequently  the admission of the company's ordinary shares to trading on AIM and Euronext Growth will be cancelled on or around 2 January 2024 ” Petroneft said in a statement on Thursday morning.“The board and management will continue to work to close the disposal of the company's Russian assets in a timely fashion ” it said.Once it has paid off loans and remaining staff salaries  the Petroneft board is to seek shareholder approval to close the company through an orderly wind up.Petroneft has seen its share price plummet in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Shares in the oil and gas exploration firm plunged more than 50pc in the week following the invasion. Before the share suspension they had tumbled by almost 90pc.The company was set up in 2003 and was admitted to the London and Dublin stock exchanges in 2006.
