The contents of this letter are important and I would urge you to read it carefully and  in the case of Shareholders  to sign and return as soon as possible the accompanying Form of Proxy in accordance with the instructions given thereon and in the notes to the Notice at the end of this document. Business of the 2023 Annual General Meeting Three resolutions will be proposed at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (the ""AGM""). Resolutions numbers 1 to 3 will each be proposed as ordinary resolutions  meaning that for each of those resolutions to be passed  more than 50% of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution. The three Resolutions to be voted on at the AGM are as follows: Resolution 1 (Appointment of auditors and authority for the Directors to determine the auditors' remuneration) As announced on 3 July 2023 Crowe (UK) LLP  appointed at last AGM  resigned as auditors effective 1 June 2023 and have been succeeded by PKF Littlejohn LLP subject to shareholder approval. The Company is required in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991  to appoint (or re-appoint) auditors for the financial period and determine their remuneration. Resolution 1 is an ordinary resolution proposing to appoint PKF Littlejohn LLP as auditors to the Company  to hold office with immediate effect until the conclusion of the next General Meeting at which the Company's accounts are laid before the Company  and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration. As announced on 3 July 2023  the next audit date will be 31 December 2023. Resolution 2 (Re-election of Aimi Nasharuddin as Director of the Company) Pursuant to Article 9.2 of the Articles  at every AGM of the Company  one third of the Directors (or if their number is not a multiple of three  then the number nearest to and not exceeding one third) shall retire from office. Therefore one Director is required to retire from office at this AGM. Article 9.4 stipulates that the Director(s) to retire in accordance with Article 9.2 shall be those subject to retirement by rotation who have been longest in office since their last election. 3Mr Aimi Nasharuddin is the Director of the Company that meets the foregoing criteria and is therefore subject to retirement by rotation and re-election in accordance with Articles 9.2 and 9.4 of the Articles. Being eligible  Mr Nasharuddin has offered himself for re-election as a Director. Resolution 2 is therefore being proposed as an ordinary resolution to approve the re-election of Aimi Nasharuddin. Further details about Mr Nasharuddin can be found on the Company website www.upland.energy. Resolution 3 (Re-election of Andrew Hurst as a Director of the Company) Pursuant to Article 9.3 of the Articles of the Company  a Director who has been approved by the board of directors of the Company (the ""Board"") since the last AGM (8 December 2022) is required to retire from office at the subsequent AGM. Mr Andrew Hurst was appointed as a Non-Executive Technical Director on 11 January 2023 and will therefore retire from the Board at this year's AGM. Being eligible  Mr Hurst has offered himself for re-election as a Director. Resolution 3 is therefore being proposed as an ordinary resolution to approve the re-election of Mr Andrew Hurst. Further details about Mr Hurst can be found in the RNS on 11 January 2023 or on the Company website www.upland.energy Action to be taken by Shareholders To appoint a proxy  you can complete the enclosed Form of Proxy  in accordance with the instructions printed on it  and return it (together with any power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed  or a certified copy of such item) to Computershare Investor Services (Jersey) Limited  c/o The Pavilions  Bridgwater Road  Bristol BS99 6ZY  as soon as possible and in any event so as to be received by no later than 11 a.m. (UK time) on 27 December 2023. Unless the Form of Proxy is received by this date and time  it will be invalid. Members are strongly encouraged to appoint the 'Chair of the Meeting' as their proxy rather than any other named person who may not be permitted to attend the meeting and therefore might be unable to vote in accordance with the relevant members proxy instructions. If you hold your Ordinary Shares through CREST  you may appoint a proxy via the CREST electronic proxy appointment service by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. The CREST message in respect of such appointment must in order to be valid  be transmitted and received by Computershare Investor Services (Jersey) Limited no later than 11.00 a.m. (UK time) on 27 December 2023. Recommendation The Directors consider the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the Company and the shareholders of the Company as a whole. Consequently  the Directors unanimously recommend that shareholders of the Company vote in favour of each of the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM  as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings. Such holdings in aggregate amount to 53 782 058 Ordinary Shares in the Company  representing 4.50 % of the Company's existing issued ordinary share capital and voting rights.

BY ORDER OF THE BOARD Registered Office Ogier Global Company Secretary (Jersey) 3rd Floor Limited 44 Esplanade Company secretary St Helier Jersey JE4 9WG Dated: 07 December 2023 5NOTES: Voting at the AGM 1. Pursuant to article 40 of the Companies (Uncertificated Securities) (Jersey) Order 1999  as amended  the Company specifies that only those members entered in the Company's register of members at 11:00 a.m. on 27 December 2023 or  if the AGM is adjourned  48 hours prior to the adjourned AGM shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of the number of Ordinary Shares registered in their names at that time. Changes to entries on the Company's register of members after that time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any holder of Ordinary Shares to attend and vote at the AGM. Appointment of a proxy Any holder of ordinary shares of no par value in the Company ("" Ordinary Shares "") is entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise its rights to vote at the AGM. A Form of Proxy is enclosed with this document. In each case  members should appoint the chair of the meeting as their proxy  because that member or any other proxy appointed by them (excluding the chairman)  may be unable to attend the meeting in person and vote in accordance with that members instructions. To be valid  Forms of Proxy must be completed and deposited at Computershare Investor Services (Jersey) Limited  c/o The Pavilions  Bridgwater Road  Bristol BS99 6ZY not less than 48 hours before the time of the AGM (being 11:00 a.m. on 27 December 2023) and any proxies received in default of this paragraph will not be treated as valid. A failure to specify the number of Ordinary Shares each proxy appointment relates to or specifying a number of Ordinary Shares in excess of those held by the member will result in the proxy appointment being invalid. In the case of joint holders  the signature of only one of the joint holders is required on the Form of Proxy but the vote of the first named on the register of members of the Company will be accepted to the exclusion of other joint holders. CREST CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting and any adjournment(s) of it by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available to CREST members via www.euroclear.com ). CREST personal members  or other CREST sponsored members and those CREST Members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a "" CREST Proxy Instruction "") must be properly authenticated in accordance with the specifications of Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited ("" Euroclear "") and must contain the information required for such instruction  as described in the CREST Manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by Computershare Registrars (CREST participant ID 3RA50) no later than 11.00 am on 27 December 2023 (or  in the case of an adjournment of the AGM  48 hours before the time fixed for such adjournment). For this purpose  the time of receipt of the instruction will be taken to be the time (as determined by the time stamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which Computershare Registrars is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time  any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. CREST members and  where applicable  CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member  or sponsored member  or has appointed a voting service provider(s) to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by a particular time. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred  in particular  to the sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.

34295,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/25443/blockchain-technology-the-future-of-finance-or-a-distant-dream,Blockchain Technology: The Future of Finance or a Distant Dream? (David Newns),Blockchain has emerged as a transformative force  promising to reshape the very foundations of capit...,Blockchain has emerged as a transformative force  promising to reshape the very foundations of capital markets. As we navigate through this era of unprecedented innovation  it becomes imperative to understand both the potential benefits and the challenges to adoption associated with digital assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT). In this article  I will attempt to shed light on the significant developments in the blockchain space and their implications for the future of finance.The continued adoption of DLT along distinct target goalsWe are seeing no abatement in the adoption of blockchain and the tokenization of assets within financial services  and it continues to gain traction across a range of distinct objectives. Predictions by Citi suggest a potential $4-5 trillion market cap by 2030  an 80-fold increase from the current value of real-world assets “locked” on blockchains. Euroclear and Oliver Wyman calculated that DLT could lead to substantial cost savings for the industry  reaching up to $12 billion annually.In securities  we see this evolving towards a model that combines the digitization of existing securities as well as a gradual adoption of digitally native securities.Reduction of operational costs  particularly in post-trade  streamlining trade processing  reducing settlement times  and eliminating multiple reconciliations remain the key target areas for blockchain use cases across financial services.Similarly  use cases that focus on capital efficiency are a priority for banks  particularly in the collateral allocation and repo  as seen in J.P. Morgan’s Onyx intra-day repo settlements  processing over $950 billion on its blockchain network since its launch in 2020.Revenue growth remains a longer-term target aspiration with blockchain  opening up private markets to a wider buy-side via integrated models and asset transparency.Challenges on the path to adoptionOne of the primary challenges on the broader path to institutional adoption of digital assets is the tokenization of real-world assets  which involves converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. This process requires clear legal frameworks to ensure that digital representations are legally enforceable.Such legal clarity has been in place in Switzerland for many years as the existing intermediated securities laws lend themselves very well to supporting ledger-based securities.Securities are heavily regulated  and any digital asset representing a security must comply with existing securities laws  including registration  disclosure  and compliance requirements. Navigating these regulations in the context of innovative technology is complex.Moreover  in traditional finance  securities transactions often involve intermediaries that manage counterparty and settlement risks. In a blockchain-based system  these risks might be managed differently  raising questions about how to ensure transaction finality and mitigate counterparty risk.There is also substantial effort involved in integration with traditional systems which remains a significant hurdle to solve.I would also highlight challenges represented by cybersecurity and fraud prevention: digital assets  by their nature  can be susceptible to different cybersecurity risks to that of traditional assets. Ensuring robust security measures to prevent hacking  fraud  and unauthorized access is a major concern for institutions dealing with digital assets that are either linked to or are themselves real-world securities.Finally  there is still an absence of accepted universal standards and agreed definitions and terminology.The role of Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs)Financial Market Infrastructures  like SDX (SIX Digital Exchange  part of SIX Group)  play a significant role in evolving blockchain-based capital markets. Contrary to the assertion that FMIs are considered mere intermediaries  whose position was a “necessary evil” brought about by limitations of pre-blockchain technology and now made redundant  FMIs are  in fact  vital to the adoption and scaling of blockchain-based services. This holds true especially in the context of regulated services.FMIs are uniquely positioned to perform the role of neutral third parties that provide a legal foundation to the blockchain-based financial markets infrastructure of the future  facilitating its arrangement through sound governance. As the industry moves towards decentralized blockchain-based capital markets  FMIs are well suited to manage service and asset smart contracts' governance  identification and permissioning of AML/ KYC’s counterparties  bridging traditional with tokenized markets.Let us not forget that traditional market structures will not disappear overnight. The adoption of new blockchain-based operating models will be severely constrained without effective bridges built between new blockchain-based models and traditional infrastructure. FMIs  as neutral parties  are uniquely positioned to provide such bridges. We can also expect FMIs  for the benefit of issuers and investors  to play a critical role in bringing together bank issued tokens. FMIs can ensure neutral and fair access to liquidity that may otherwise remain locked on the separate bank tokenization islands now deployed by individual banks.By partnering together  FMIs and banks will also be able to integrate these assets into their offering  providing user-friendly options (e.g.  wallet abstraction solutions) to less tech-savvy individual customers and corporates  facilitating the adoption of this technology.The missing piece: tokenized Central Bank money (wCBDC)To enable the scalability of blockchain-based capital market infrastructure  we advocate for the inclusion of tokenized central bank money. Stablecoins and tokenized deposits are insufficient for genuine riskless settlement.For instance  on December 1  2023  digital bond issuances by the Cantons of Basel-City and Zurich settled using real CHF wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) issued by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) on SDX. It is the first time the SNB has issued real wCBDC in Swiss francs on a financial market infrastructure based on distributed ledger technology.As we embark on the next chapter of financial evolution  the industry's commitment to building a sound  safe  scalable  and sensible capital markets infrastructure based on blockchain technology becomes apparent.

Brent crude thus gained 1.2% to $80.3 a barrel.Gold  the safe-haven par excellence  is also at its highest at $2053 an ounce (+1%).In other French company news  Pernod Ricard has announced that it has signed an agreement to sell the Becherovka brand and associated assets  including the Karlovy Vary production site  to the Maspex group.

CMB.TECH builds  owns  operates and designs large marine and industrial applications that run on dual-fuel diesel-hydrogen and diesel-ammonia engines and monofuel hydrogen engines. CMB.TECH offers hydrogen and ammonia fuel that it either produces or sources from external produces to its customers. CMB.TECH is active throughout the full hydrogen value chain through four different divisions: Marine  Technology & Development  H2 infra  and Industry. The value creation of the new strategy is driven by CMB.TECH's ""future-proof"" (or low carbon emitting) fleet of 106 low-carbon vessels  of which 46 are under construction.The Transaction fits into the Company's renewed strategy of diversification  decarbonization and accelerated optimization of the Company's current crude oil tanker fleet. The parties believe that the Transaction will lead to the creation of the leading  future proof shipping platform  with the Company becoming the reference in sustainable shipping. CMB and Euronav believe that the addition of CMB.TECH to Euronav's business will enable a flywheel strategy - positioning the group to tap into each step of the energy transition towards low carbon shipping  with a clear vision on value creation for its shareholders. Euronav's older tanker tonnage provides excellent opportunities to recycle capital over time into more futureproof  attractive and diversified end-markets and contract types. In addition  Euronav's current customer portfolio is located at the centre of the energy transition and looking for low-carbon tanker shipping services.The Transaction falls within the scope of the related parties transactions procedure under Belgian law (Article 7:116 of the BCCA). It has been approved by the Euronav Supervisory Board on the advice of the Committee of independent directors  which appointed Degroof Petercam Corporate Finance as independent financial expert to provide a fairness opinion on the valuation of the Transaction. More information can be found in the announcement of Euronav attached to this press release. The fairness opinion provided by the independent financial expert and the advice of the Committee of independent directors are made available on the Company's website.Alexander Saverys  Euronav's and CMB's CEO  stated: ""After having reached an agreement with Famatown Finance Limited and Frontline plc on the strategic and structural deadlock for Euronav  we are pleased to announce another significant milestone for Euronav with the acquisition of CMB.TECH. This will allow the Company to rapidly and meaningfully execute its diversification and decarbonization strategy.""CMB.TECHCMB.TECH operates through four different divisions. The largest division of CMB.TECH is the marine division. It builds  owns  operates and designs a wide range of low and zero-carbon ships powered by dual-fuel diesel-hydrogen and diesel-ammonia and monofuel hydrogen engines: offshore wind support vessels  dry bulk vessels  container vessels  chemical tankers  and others (tugboats and ferries). The integration of the drivetrain  the storage and the bunkering of hydrogen and ammonia  is implemented with a diverse and experienced inhouse engineering team in partnership with Original Equipment Manufacturers and shipyards.CMB.TECH's H2 infra division offers hydrogen and ammonia fuel to its customers  either through its own production or by sourcing it from third party producers. Within H2 infra  the necessary technology and infrastructure is designed  developed and operated to produce and distribute green hydrogen and ammonia. The H2 infra division acts as a flywheel for both the Marine and Industry division - supporting that the green hydrogen and green ammonia value chain is a distinct part of a financially sustainable solution for the energy transition. A particular focus on hydrogen and ammonia production and storage completes the entire value chain to deliver the clean fuels of the future.CMB.TECH's Industry division develops hydrogen powered heavy-duty industrial applications. The focus on hydrogen solutions is driven by a commitment to offering affordable  reliable and sustainable solutions that reduce emissions and lower the environmental footprint of CMB.TECH's clients. The advanced technology allows the conversion of existing diesel engines into dual-fuel and monofuel engines  providing flexibility and cost-effectiveness. The engines include high-speed options for smaller-scale applications  as well as medium-speed and slowspeed engines for marine and heavy-duty applications.CMB.TECH has a strong track record with successful commercial projects throughout its various divisions with global best in class customers  and in addition also collaborates with a wide range of original equipment manufacturers on the development of its engines and applications.Transaction detailsOn 22 December 2023  the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with CMB to acquire 100% of the shares in CMB.TECH  for a total purchase price of USD 1.150 billion in cash.The purchase price will be financed from the cash proceeds of the sale of part of the VLCC fleet to Frontline (which was announced on 9 October 2023). The transaction includes USD 2.496 billion roll-over debt (bank  leasing and shipyard liabilities). This includes both net existing financial debt of USD 510 million and total nominal outstanding capital commitments of USD 1.986 billion. Of those outstanding capital commitments that will be paid over the coming 3 years  USD 1.625 billion has been secured and will be rolled over. The remaining unfunded capital commitment of USD 361 million will come from Euronav's own cash.The Transaction is also subject to important conditions  including approval by a special general meeting of Euronav's shareholders in accordance with Article 7:152 BBCA (the ""SGM"") and customary waivers of change of control provisions in view of the rollover of certain contracts. The Company and CMB expect to close the Transaction in February 2024.Further information on CMB.TECH and the Transaction will be included in an information note to Euronav shareholders to be prepared in the context of the abovementioned special general meeting of Euronav.Capital Markets DayEuronav invites investors  analysts and representatives from banks and financial media to its Capital Markets Day on 12 January 2024 from 10h00 till 13h00  on site at the Euronav HQ or via live web cast.

This communication is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell any ordinary shares or other securities.

The offer to purchase and related materials may also be obtained (when available) for free by U.S. shareholders by contacting the information agent for the tender offer that will be named in the tender offer statement on Schedule TO.ANTWERP  Belgium  22 December 2023 - The Supervisory Board of Euronav NV (""EURN""  ""Euronav"" or ""the Company"") (NYSE: EURN & Euronext: EURN) approved the entry into by the Company of a share purchase agreement (the ""SPA"") in relation to the acquisition by the Company of 100% of the shares in CMB.TECH NV (""CMB.TECH"") from CMB NV (""CMB"") (the ""Transaction"").CMB  the counterparty to the Transaction  owns 49.05% of the shares in the Company (representing 53.37% of the voting rights). The Company holds 8.09% of its shares in treasury. Therefore  CMB is the controlling shareholder of the Company and a related party of the Company within the meaning of IAS 24. Consequently  the Transaction is subject to the procedure provided for in Article 7:116 BCCA  which applies to any decision or transaction made in execution of a decision of the Supervisory Board of a listed company relating to a related party.CMB.TECH is a diversified cleantech maritime group that builds  owns  operates and designs large marine and industrial applications that run on dual-fuel diesel-hydrogen and diesel-ammonia engines and monofuel hydrogen engines. CMB.TECH offers hydrogen and ammonia fuel that it either produces or sources from external produces to its customers. CMB.TECH is active throughout the full hydrogen value chain through four different divisions: Marine  Technology & Development  H2 infra  and Industry.The total purchase price for the Transaction amounts to USD 1.150 billion in cash. The purchase price is based on the low point of the valuation range that the seller had proposed to the Company in respect of their valuation of CMB.TECH. Following discussions between CMB and Euronav  the following valuation methodologies have been agreed upon in order to come to the final purchase price in respect of CMB.TECH:- A fair market valuation of the marine division based on average broker valuations of the vessels; and- A discounted cash flow valuation of the industry and infrastructure divisions based upon the Company's business plan for these divisions. This results in an enterprise value of CMB.TECH of USD 3.649 billion. The projected net debt of CMB.TECH as at year-end 2023 corresponds to approximately USD 2.500 billion. This includes both net financial debt and total nominal capital commitments.Completion of the Transaction is subject to (i) approval by a special general meeting (SGM) of Euronav's shareholders in accordance with Article 7:152 BCCA  and (ii) the relevant counter parties to material agreements containing a change of control provision that is triggered by the Transaction having waived their respective rights under such change of control provisions.In order to ensure that a potential agency problem would not affect the Company's interests  the Company is planning to take out  prior to closing of the Transaction  W&I insurance to cover most of the warranties provided by the seller under the SPA. The insurance premium will be borne by CMB.While Euronav was previously exclusively focused on the crude oil tanker business  it will effectively diversify its operations. As CMB will remain active in dry-bulk carriers  chemical tankers and container vessels  it might thus compete with Euronav. In order to preserve the interests of Euronav in this regard  CMB has undertaken that certain commercial opportunities be offered first to Euronav. Euronav will benefit from a priority right to any potential charters for a term exceeding three months for which both vessels owned by Euronav/CMB.TECH and vessels owned by CMB compete.During its meeting of 22 December 2023  the Supervisory Board approved entering into the SPA. A Committee of three independent members of Euronav's Supervisory Board has reviewed the terms and conditions of the SPA in accordance with the provisions of Article 7:116 BCCA and has issued a written reasoned advice to the Supervisory Board. In its advice  the Committee stated that is of the view that the Transaction is not manifestly unlawful in nature and that it is unlikely that the Transaction would result in disadvantages to the Company that are not outweighed by benefits to the Company. The Committee therefore advised favourably on the Transaction.The assessment carried out by Euronav's statutory auditor in accordance with Article 7:116 BCCA provides as follows: Based on our assessment  nothing has come to our attention that makes us to believe that the financial and accounting data referred to in the opinion of the committee of independent members of the supervisory board dated 22 December 2023 or in the minutes of supervisory board dated 22 December 2023  motivating the proposed transaction  are not consistent in all material respects with the information available to us in the context of our assignment.The Committee has been assisted by Degroof Petercam Corporate Finance NV/SA as independent financial advisor (who has issued a fairness opinion on the valuation) and by Linklaters LLP as legal advisor.The full advice from the Committee of independent members of Euronav's Supervisory Board and the fairness opinion from the independent financial advisor can be consulted on the Company's website.Beschrijving",neutral,0.1,0.88,0.02,positive,0.67,0.32,0.01,True,English,"['new strategy', 'Euronav', 'CMB', 'TECH', 'part', 'December', '04:32', 'current crude oil tanker fleet', 'leading, future proof shipping platform', 'experienced inhouse engineering team', 'Degroof Petercam Corporate Finance', 'offshore wind support vessels', 'low carbon emitting) fleet', 'low-carbon tanker shipping services', 'related parties transactions procedure', 'diversified cleantech maritime group', 'full hydrogen value chain', 'The H2 infra division', 'green ammonia value chain', 'older tanker tonnage', 'current customer portfolio', 'low carbon shipping', 'entire value chain', 'Famatown Finance Limited', 'four different divisions', 'Original Equipment Manufacturers', 'third party producers', 'strong track record', 'successful commercial projects', 'dry bulk vessels', 'independent financial expert', 'existing diesel engines', 'share purchase agreement', 'Euronav Supervisory Board', 'heavy-duty industrial applications', 'monofuel hydrogen engines', '106 low-carbon vessels', 'sustainable shipping', 'diversified end-markets', 'monofuel engines', 'container vessels', 'heavy-duty applications', 'value creation', 'green hydrogen', 'purchase price', 'independent directors', 'largest division', 'slowspeed engines', 'smaller-scale applications', 'Industry division', 'controlling shareholder', 'ammonia fuel', 'external produces', 'energy transition', 'clear vision', 'excellent opportunities', 'futureproof, attractive', 'contract types', 'Belgian law', 'fairness opinion', 'More information', 'press release', 'Alexander Saverys', 'Frontline plc', 'structural deadlock', 'significant milestone', 'wide range', 'zero-carbon ships', 'chemical tankers', 'sustainable solution', 'clean fuels', 'hydrogen powered', 'hydrogen solutions', 'affordable, reliable', 'environmental footprint', 'high-speed options', 'marine division', 'new strategy', 'diesel-ammonia engines', 'dual-fuel diesel-hydrogen', 'necessary technology', 'advanced technology', 'distinct part', 'particular focus', 'ammonia production', 'large marine', 'flywheel strategy', 'decarbonization strategy', 'Euronav NV', 'TECH NV', 'CMB NV', 'CMB.TECH', 'ANTWERP', 'Belgium', 'EURN', 'Company', 'NYSE', 'Euronext', 'acquisition', 'shares', 'cash', 'sources', 'customers', 'Development', 'construction', 'diversification', 'accelerated', 'optimization', 'reference', 'addition', 'business', 'step', 'shareholders', 'capital', 'centre', 'scope', 'Article', 'BCCA', 'advice', 'Committee', 'valuation', 'announcement', 'website', 'CEO', 'strategic', 'others', 'tugboats', 'ferries', 'integration', 'drivetrain', 'storage', 'bunkering', 'diverse', 'partnership', 'shipyards', 'infrastructure', 'commitment', 'emissions', 'clients', 'conversion', 'flexibility', 'cost-effectiveness', 'medium-speed', 'thro']",2023-12-22,2023-12-23,marketscreener.com

Subject to the usual conditions precedent  the sale is expected to be finalized by the end of June 2024.Vinci reports that  via its local subsidiary Seymour Whyte  it has won a contract worth over 86 million euros to upgrade the Cressbrook dam at Toowoomba  near Brisbane in the Australian state of Queensland.Finally  Neoen announces that it has signed a turnkey EPC contract with a joint venture of Bouygues Construction Australia and Bouygues Energies & Services  officially launching the construction of the Culcairn solar power plant in the Australian state of New South Wales.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

This €15.0 M round of financing is designed to ensure the company's continued expansion and enable it to fund its own growth  while maintaining its focus on its current activities. Sébastien PELTIER  Chairman of the Board of Directors  and co-founder of Valbiotis comments: ""We express our great satisfaction with the success of this capital increase  characterized by a priority period  which confirms the trust and sustained commitment of investors towards our strategy and growth ambitions. This achievement validates our ambitious positioning as a future major player in the European market for 100% plant-based dietary supplements. With particular pride  we acknowledge the strong support of our shareholders  both institutional and individual  already present in our capital  and we thank all the new subscribers. Thanks to the successful fundraising  we now have strengthened resources  serving as a crucial lever to materialize our international marketing strategy through partnerships and direct operations in France. Consequently  these resources will be complemented by additional revenues from 2024 onward.""Reasons for the Offering Buoyed by the excellent results of the REVERSE-IT study published earlier in the year  Valbiotis is embarking on a new phase in its development  focused on generating revenues and based on the following three strategic priorities: Preparing to market TOTUM•63 alongside Nestlé Health Science;Launching direct marketing of other products in France  including TOTUM•070 as early as the 1 st half of 2024;Finalizing the signature of new global or regional licensing and/or distribution agreements with major players in nutrition and health  in addition to the global strategic partnership already signed for TOTUM•63 in February 2020 with Nestlé Health Science  bearing in mind that discussions are underway with over 60 identified prospects  while continuing its research efforts to prepare tomorrow's pipeline and complete clinical processes enabling proprietary health claims to be obtained for the majority of them  without this “label” constituting a prerequisite for marketing the products concerned. The Company is entering a new deployment phase with the start of commercialization  which  in view of the Company's expectations  requires additional financing. The company plans to use the net proceeds from the issuance (approximately €13.0 million) to finance: At 45% of net revenue  working capital requirements   mainly a result of the need to build up inventories of raw materials to be supplied by Valbiotis to Nestlé Health Science under the supply contract  with a 1 st order expected in the 1 st half of 2024  and subsequently under future agreements relating to other products  as well as the financing of trade receivables. At 35% of net revenue  sales  and marketing activities in France (excluding TOTUM•63)  including: Finalizing the Company's structure with a view to starting direct marketing in France. This strategic development involves: The need to finalize the buildup of sales and marketing teams to over 40 employees by 2026  with a gradual operational ramp-up;The enhancement of IT tools  with the implementation of a CRM  an e-commerce site  the integration of a sales module into the ERP and  finally  the interfacing of the various tools with those of the Company's logistics partner;Continued securing of the supply chain; Financing working capital requirements linked to the buildup of raw materials and finished goods inventories. And finally  At 20% of net revenue  the completion of a number of clinical trials not financed by partnerships (including the Phase II/III HEART 2 trial for TOTUM•070)  for an amount that is rather insignificant compared with the amounts devoted to this subject by the Company since its creation. After taking into account 100% of the net proceeds of the Offer  i.e.  €13.0 M  and taking into account the anticipated ramp-up in activity  the Company considers that it will be able to finance its own growth in the future within the current scope of its activities  without ruling out recourse to bank financing should the need arise. Terms and conditions of the issue of new shares The new shares not subscribed for under the priority subscription period were the subject of a global offering (the ""Global Offering"") comprising (a) a public offering in France (the ""Public Offering"") primarily aimed at individuals  and (b) a Global Placement. The subscription price for the new shares was set by the Company's Board (Directoire) on December 8  2023  at €4.46 per share  representing a discount of 20.1% relative to the closing price of €5.58 on December 8  2023  and of 16.5% relative to the volume-weighted average share price of €5.34 for the five trading days preceding the Board's decision on December 8  2023 (inclusive). The capital increase  with a total gross amount of €15.0 M including issue premium  will give rise to the issue of 3 363 229 new shares  i.e.  100% of the initial offer  it being specified that no possibility of implementing an extension clause had been decided by the Company's Board (Directoire) on December 8  2023. In the context of the priority period  the request from existing shareholders of the Company amounted to €3.9 M  representing 26% of the total amount of the capital increase. As part of the Offering  a total subscription demand of €4 M (representing 27% of the total issuance amount) was observed  broken down as follows  including: A demand of €3.5 M as part of the Global Placement; andA demand of €0.5 M as part of the Public Offering. In addition to a total subscription request for a gross amount (excluding fees) of €7.9 M  including the €2.1M subscription commitments obtained prior to the launch of the operation  it is recalled that the commitments received under the guarantee amounted to €11.6 M (bringing the total coverage of the operation to 130% of the issuance) and could be triggered as soon as the total subscription demand did not cover 100% of the initial offering. In light of all these elements  the allocation of the 3 363 229 shares  representing 100% of the Offering  was as follows: 883 692 shares were allocated for subscriptions during the priority period;773 745 shares were allocated for subscriptions as part of the Global Placement;120 468 shares were allocated for subscriptions in the context of the Public Offering; and finallyAn allocation from the guarantors of 1 585 324 new shares  representing a service rate of approximately 61% of their initial commitments.

The increase(s) of capital decided under such authorisation may be effected by contribution in cash or in kind  including as the case may be an issue premium not available for distribution  the amount of which shall be fixed by the Board of Directors  and by creation of new Shares conferring such rights as the Board of Directors shall determine. The increase(s) of capital may also be effected by capitalisation of reserves  including those not available for distribution  or an issue premium  with or without the creation of new Shares. When deciding to use the authorised capital  the Board of Directors may restrict or exclude the preference right of the existing shareholders (including in favour of identified persons who are not personnel of the Company or its subsidiaries) under the conditions set out in article 12.2 of the Articles of Association.9 Such authorisation is granted to the Board of Directors for a period of five years as from the date of publication of the amendment of the Articles of Association resolved upon by the extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of 27 April 2022. It can be renewed  once or several times  in accordance with the applicable legal provisions. 11.2 The Board of Directors may be expressly authorised by the Shareholders' Meeting  in case of public take-over bids on securities of the Company  to increase the capital  under the conditions set out in article 7:202 of the Code.

The preferential subscription right shall entitle each shareholder to subscribe for any new Equity Interests  pro rata to the proportion of existing share capital as it holds immediately prior to such issue and subject to the rules of article 7:188 of the Code. Each shareholder may exercise its preferential right in whole or in part. The time within which the preferential subscription right may be exercised shall be fixed by the Shareholders' Meeting or by the Board of Directors as the case may be  but shall not be less than fifteen calendar days from the date on which the subscription period was opened. The preferential subscription right shall be negotiable during the subscription period to the extent to which the Shares may be transferred. Subject to the rules of article 7:188 of the Code  the Board of Directors may decide that preferential subscription rights which were not or were only partly exercised by any shareholders shall accrue proportionally to the other shareholders of the same class who have already exercised their subscription rights prior to the exercise by the shareholders of the other class of their second ranking preferential subscription right as the case may be. The Board of Directors shall fix the practical terms for such subscription. The Board of Directors may also conclude  upon such terms as it shall determine  all agreements intended to secure the subscription of part or all of the new Shares to be issued. 12.2 The Shareholders' Meeting acting in accordance with article 7:191 of the Code may restrict or cancel the preferential subscription right for a purpose that is in the best interest of the Company  provided however that if the preferential subscription right is restricted or cancelled with respect to any issuance in which any existing shareholder subscribes to any Equity Interests  all existing shareholders shall be given the same right and be treated in the same way. Such equal treatment requirement shall not apply when the preferential subscription right is restricted or cancelled with respect to issuances of Equity Interests issued solely pursuant to any stock option plans or other compensation plans in the ordinary course of business. In the case the Shareholders' Meeting has granted an authorisation to the Board of Directors to effect a capital increase in the framework of the authorised capital and such authorisation allows the Board of Directors to do so  the Board of Directors may likewise restrict or cancel the preferential subscription right applying the same principles as set out in this paragraph. No Restricted Shares shall be issued other than to a Restricted Shareholder exercising its preferential subscription right in respect of its holding of Restricted Shares  without prejudice to the right of the Ordinary Shareholders to exercise their second ranking preferential subscription right in accordance with article 7:188 of the Code. 12.3 The Company may proceed with a reduction in capital in accordance with articles 7:208 and following of the Code. No such reduction may affect the Restricted Shareholders unless it is approved in accordance with the procedure provided by article 7:155 of the Code  if such article is applicable. 12.4 Any issue premium booked by the Company shall be recorded in an account that is not available for distribution and may be reduced or cancelled only by a resolution of the Shareholders' Meeting approved in accordance with the conditions of article 7:208 of the Code.10 Article 13. BONDS  SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS AND OTHER SECURITIES GIVING RIGHT TO SHARES 13.1 The Company may issue bonds by resolution of the Board of Directors and on such conditions as it shall determine.

Article 14. PAYMENTS 14.1 The Board of Directors may make calls upon the shareholders in such amounts and at such times as it shall fix in respect of any moneys to be paid on the Shares issued further to a capital increase.

After seemingly passing on the reins of Vivendi to hi…,In a comeback worthy of “Succession”‘s patriarch Logan Roy  French billionaire Vincent Bolloré has re-emerged from a fictive retirement to engineer a strategic overhaul of his listed media empire  Vivendi.After seemingly passing on the reins of Vivendi to his sons Yannick and Cyrille last year  Bolloré stepped back in with a plan to split the French conglomerate into three businesses – pay TV group Canal+  advertising banner Havas and an investment vehicle comprising Lagardere Group — that would each be listed separately at the Paris stock exchange.The supervisory board of Vivendi has approved the exploration of this three-way split which  if pursued  will see the Vivendi brand disappear along with Bolloré’s initial “synergy” strategy which was his mantra when he became the conglom’s largest shareholder in 2012. News of the forthcoming shift has been greeted with enthusiasm as Vivendi’s stock valuation climbed by 10% to €9.98 per share.In the last 10 years  Vivendi’s annual turnover fell from €29 billion to €10 billion after it divested high profile assets including Universal Music Group. But shareholders — which include Bolloré — have gotten richer in the process. Bolloré scored a major coup by listing Universal Music Group and giving Vivendi shareholders ownership of 60% of the music powerhouse whose talent roster includes Taylor Swift and Drake. In its first day at the Euronext Amsterdam exchange  UMG’s shares skyrocketed by 39% to reach a valuation of nearly $53 billion.The idea behind breaking down Vivendi into separate businesses is to help Bolloré and Vivendi shareholders seek a higher valuation for Canal+ and Havas and better leverage the growth of these assets.“Since the distribution and listing of Universal Music Group in 2021  Vivendi has endured a significantly high conglomerate discount  substantially reducing its valuation and thereby limiting its ability to carry out external growth transactions for its subsidiaries ” said Vivendi when announcing it was mulling this three-way split.Under the explored overhaul  Vivendi’s shareholders would have stakes in three thriving businesses instead of one. The pay TV group Canal+ would be listed as one banner comprising Dailymotion and GVA  as well as South Africa’s Multichoice Group  Hong Kong-based OTT service Viu International and Viaplay  the Scandinavian streaming platform.The second entity will revolve around Havas  a leading advertising and marketing banner  while the third will be an (unnamed) investment vehicle comprising Lagardere  the French media  publishing and travel retail conglomerate  Prisma  the press group  video game banner Gameloft and stakes into Prisa in Spain and 10% in UMG.Canal+ Group  which is led by Maxime Saada  has expanded internationally through a series of acquisitions and currently boasts a subscriber base of over 25 million in nearly 50 countries. Enders Analysis’ Francois Godard anticipates some synergies and/or rebranding between some streaming entities under the Canal+ vertical. Canal+ is also on track to acquire France’s second biggest pay TV group OCS and its film/TV production/distribution arm Orange Studio in a deal that is currently being examined by the anti-trust board. Canal+ Group is also the parent company of Studiocanal  the international film and TV company behind the “Paddington” franchise. The banner boasts dozens of production labels in key markets and direct distribution operations in France  the U.K.  Germany and Australia/New Zealand.Havas  meanwhile  brings together over 23 000 employees across more than 100 countries. The investment company  said Vivendi  would comprise “would actively support the strategic development of its portfolio companies … through targeted reinvestment policy.” All three businesses would be attached to a subsidiary of Bolloré’s family holding.,neutral,0.04,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.45,0.39,0.17,True,English,"['List Canal+ Group', 'Vincent Bolloré', 'Stock Market', 'Plans', 'Vivendi', 'Hong Kong-based OTT service', 'video game banner Gameloft', 'French billionaire Vincent Bolloré', 'biggest pay TV group', 'initial “synergy” strategy', 'Euronext Amsterdam exchange', 'film/TV production/distribution arm', 'high conglomerate discount', 'travel retail conglomerate', 'Paris stock exchange', 'Scandinavian streaming platform', 'Universal Music Group', 'high profile assets', 'external growth transactions', 'direct distribution operations', 'three thriving businesses', 'advertising banner Havas', 'French conglomerate', 'music powerhouse', 'TV company', 'French media', 'three businesses', 'Multichoice Group', 'press group', 'leading advertising', 'streaming entities', 'marketing banner', 'separate businesses', 'Lagardere Group', 'Logan Roy', 'fictive retirement', 'media empire', 'investment vehicle', 'supervisory board', 'three-way split', 'largest shareholder', 'forthcoming shift', 'stock valuation', 'last 10 years', 'annual turnover', 'major coup', 'talent roster', 'Taylor Swift', 'first day', 'South Africa', 'Viu International', 'Maxime Saada', 'subscriber base', 'Enders Analysis', 'Francois Godard', 'Orange Studio', 'anti-trust board', 'parent company', 'international film', 'Paddington” franchise', 'production labels', 'key markets', 'U.K.', 'New Zealand', 'investment company', 'strategic development', 'portfolio companies', 'reinvestment policy', 'family holding', 'Canal+ Group', 'one banner', 'strategic overhaul', 'higher valuation', 'second entity', 'Canal+ vertical', 'Vivendi brand', 'Vivendi shareholders', 'comeback', 'Succession', 'patriarch', 'reins', 'sons', 'Yannick', 'Cyrille', 'plan', 'exploration', 'mantra', 'News', 'enthusiasm', 'process', 'ownership', 'Drake', 'UMG', 'shares', 'idea', 'listing', 'ability', 'subsidiaries', 'stakes', 'Dailymotion', 'GVA', 'Viaplay', 'publishing', 'Prisma', 'Prisa', 'Spain', 'series', 'acquisitions', '50 countries', 'synergies', 'rebranding', 'track', 'France', 'OCS', 'deal', 'Studiocanal', 'dozens', 'Germany', 'Australia', '23,000 employees', '100 countries', 'targeted', 'subsidiary']",2023-12-22,2023-12-23,variety.com
