It allows for further preparation of a NDA1 for submission to the FDA expected in 2024.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: “We are one step closer to bringing a new and improved mode of administration for this well-known molecule  prescribed more than 5 million times annually in the U.S2. Multiple benefits are to be expected from our novel formulation which addresses potential dosing inaccuracies associated with crushing tablets  aiming to enhance stability and storability  ultimately contributing to increased patient compliance and improved quality of life.""About the pivotal studyThe primary objective was to compare the proprietary Valacyclovir Oral Suspension (200 mg/mL) with Valtrex® tablets (50 mg/mL) prepared as an extemporaneous suspension3. The relative bioavailability of valacyclovir and acyclovir4 was measured after administration under fasted conditions5. In addition  the effect of food on the bioavailability of acyclovir after administration of proprietary Valacyclovir Oral Suspension (200 mg/mL) was assessed.About ValacyclovirValacyclovir  currently commercialized as a solid oral in the U.S.  is used to treat herpes virus infections  including herpes labialis (also known as cold sores)  herpes zoster (also known as shingles)  and herpes simplex (also known as genital herpes) in adults. For pediatric patients  the drug was approved for cold sores (herpes labialis) and chickenpox. Valacyclovir is available by prescription only  and the dosage and duration of treatment depend on the specific condition being treated and the individual patient's medical history.Estimates indicate 5 5 million prescriptions6 to over 2 4 million patients in the U.S. in 2020. In 2022 more than 560 million tablets were sold  growing at a CAGR of 5%7.About HylorisHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

Dec. 26  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced that partner LianBio has entered into an agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (“Janssen”)  a Johnson & Johnson company  whereby LianBio has assigned to Janssen LianBio’s exclusive rights to develop and commercialize potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3 in China  South Korea  Singapore  and Thailand.“Our collaboration strategy for the development and commercialization of NBTXR3 is rooted in a shared commitment to delivering the potential first-in-class radioenhancer to millions of patients around the world ” said Laurent Levy  Nanobiotix co-founder and chairman of the executive board. “LianBio has served as an important partner in expanding our clinical development program in Asia  particularly with their support for our ongoing pivotal phase 3 study evaluating NBTXR3 in head and neck cancer. We look forward to continued momentum in our program and moving NBTXR3 toward global registration.”This agreement consolidates global development and commercialization rights of NBTXR3 with Janssen; streamlines the global alliance for co-development and registration of the radioenhancer with Nanobiotix; and includes all previously agreed upon economic terms between Nanobiotix and LianBio  including the Nanobiotix entitlement to receive up to an aggregate $220 million in potential contingent  development and commercialization milestone payments (less $15 million already paid to Nanobiotix by LianBio) along with tiered  low double-digit royalties based on net sales of NBTXR3 in Asian territories.Following the deal close  LianBio will support the transition of the asset to Janssen for a period no longer than six months.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized phase III study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the phase III study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023 Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.About NANOBIOTIX:Nanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity. The company’s philosophy is rooted in the concept of pushing past the boundaries of what is known to expand possibilities for human life.Incorporated in 2003  Nanobiotix is headquartered in Paris  France. The company also has subsidiaries in Cambridge  Massachusetts (United States)  France  Spain  and Germany. Nanobiotix has been listed on Euronext: Paris since 2012 and on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in New York City since December 2020.Nanobiotix is the owner of more than 30 umbrella patents associated with three (3) nanotechnology platforms with applications in 1) oncology; 2) bioavailability and biodistribution; and 3) disorders of the central nervous system. The company's resources are primarily devoted to the development of its lead product candidate–NBTXR3—which is the product of its proprietary oncology platform and has already achieved market authorization in Europe for the treatment of patients with soft tissue sarcoma under the brand name Hensify®.For more information about Nanobiotix  visit us at www.nanobiotix.com or follow us on LinkedIn and TwitterDisclaimerThis press release contains certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws  including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Dec. 26  2023 -- NANOBIOTIX   a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced that partner LianBio has…,Official NANOBIOTIX press releasePARIS and CAMBRIDGE  Mass.  Dec. 26  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced that partner LianBio has entered into an agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (“Janssen”)  a Johnson & Johnson company  whereby LianBio has assigned to Janssen LianBio’s exclusive rights to develop and commercialize potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3 in China  South Korea  Singapore  and Thailand.“Our collaboration strategy for the development and commercialization of NBTXR3 is rooted in a shared commitment to delivering the potential first-in-class radioenhancer to millions of patients around the world ” said Laurent Levy  Nanobiotix co-founder and chairman of the executive board. “LianBio has served as an important partner in expanding our clinical development program in Asia  particularly with their support for our ongoing pivotal phase 3 study evaluating NBTXR3 in head and neck cancer. We look forward to continued momentum in our program and moving NBTXR3 toward global registration.”This agreement consolidates global development and commercialization rights of NBTXR3 with Janssen; streamlines the global alliance for co-development and registration of the radioenhancer with Nanobiotix; and includes all previously agreed upon economic terms between Nanobiotix and LianBio  including the Nanobiotix entitlement to receive up to an aggregate $220 million in potential contingent  development and commercialization milestone payments (less $15 million already paid to Nanobiotix by LianBio) along with tiered  low double-digit royalties based on net sales of NBTXR3 in Asian territories.Following the deal close  LianBio will support the transition of the asset to Janssen for a period no longer than six months.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized phase III study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the phase III study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023 Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.About NANOBIOTIX:Nanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity. The company’s philosophy is rooted in the concept of pushing past the boundaries of what is known to expand possibilities for human life.Incorporated in 2003  Nanobiotix is headquartered in Paris  France.

CRYPTO BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRIES (""CBI""  Euronext Growth Paris: FR00140062P9 - ALCBI) announces its consolidated results for the first half of the 2023-2024financial year  ended September 30  2023. The results were approved by the Board of Directors on December 21  2023. These results have been subject to a limited review by the statutory auditors. CBI announces that it has made available to the public on its website the consolidated half-yearfinancial report to September 30  2023 and the related limited review report by the statutory auditors. Frédéric Chesnais  Chairman and CEO  commented: ""With AlphaVerse  our aim is to create a digital world that federates communities and develops a profitable business. But AlphaVerse's interest is twofold  as it also enables us to take stakes in third-party projects  through the exchange of digital assets  and to increase our economic weight in the blockchain ecosystem."" CBI: Consolidated half-year results to September 30  2023 in line with Group expectations  with recurring operating income at 20% of sales Key half-year figures to September 30  2023 are as follows. A detailed presentation of the financial statements is given below. As indicated in Appendix 1  a very significant revaluation of the crypto-currency portfolio has occurred on the markets since October 1  2023. As a result  the value of the portfolio stood at US$146.2 million on December 18  2023. If the interim consolidated financial statements had been prepared as at September 30  2023  based on the share price on December 18  2023  all provisions for token impairment recognized at September 30  2023 would have been reversed  resulting in a reversal of the accounting provision of 2.1 million euros. In addition  operating income and net income would have been positive. 1(*) Reversal of provisions resulting from the revaluation of crypto-currencies  calculated as at December 18  2023. Very significant appreciation of the crypto-currency portfolio since October 1er 2023  validating their long-term holding and CBI's strategic positioning The CBI share gives investors an opportunity to invest indirectly in bitcoin and the main crypto-currencies over the long term. Indeed  in addition to the development of AlphaVerse  CBI's strategy is to acquire  manage and enhance  over the long term  a large portfolio combining the main crypto-currencies (notably Bitcoin)  tokens issued by major projects currently under development  as well as tokens created by CBI. CBI's strategy is not to develop active trading on its entire portfolio. Thanks to AlphaVerse  CBI is also able to negotiate and complete exclusive OTC transactions . For example:CBI was able to acquire 54 million Chain Games tokens through an exchange. Chain Games operates a Play-to-Earn games business;games business; CBI holds a 1% stake in the company that manages the Cornucopias project  a digital world on the Cardano blockchain  and is in the process of acquiring by way of exchange around 0.75% of the COPI tokens issued by this project  thus combining long-term exposure of around 1.75% on a project valued at over US$400 million;long-term exposure of around 1.75% on a project valued at over US$400 million; CBI holds 26.5% of the as yet unlisted KTG token issued by the Karma The Game project  a blockchain game ;CBI holds 6 250 000 000 LIGHTS tokens  not yet listed  and linked to the Horyou AlphaVerse world  which focuses on charities and the fight against global warming.The token portfolio table is shown in Appendix 1 .According to this analysis : At December 18  2023  the total value of tokens in the portfolio and other assets was €146.3 million;At September 30  2023  the net book value of tokens in portfolio and other assets was 1.8 million euros  as unrealized capital gains are not recorded in the accounts. Highlights of the 1st half-year of the 2023-2024 financial year 1. $FAV token quotation CBI listed the $FAV token on the centralized Chiliz Exchange platform on September 26  2023. The $FAV token is also available on the decentralized PancakeSwap platform. As of October 2  2023  the capitalization of the $FAV token is approximately 135 million euros. CBI holds 80% of the $FAV tokens. 2. Conclusion of new partnership agreements with soccer clubs CBI is continuing its strategy of integrating numerous soccer clubs into its ""Football at AlphaVerse"" (FAV) universe  and has signed partnerships with European clubs such as Norwich  Braga  FC Porto and Celta de Vigo. These partnerships are in addition to those already signed with Real Betis  Real Sociedad  Sāo Paulo FC  Bologna  Cardiff  Spezia and Deportivo Cali. 3. Implementation of several agreements with Africarare On September 16  2023  CBI signed a first exchange agreement with Africarare for $1 million and $FAV tokens for $155K. Africarare gives all its partners privileged access to the AlphaVerse land acquired by Africarare;A second reciprocal agreement has been signed. The agreement includes an exchange of land. CBI and Africarare will be able to develop the land in cooperation with their own partners  or sell it. Thus  CBI/AlphaVerse and its partners will be able to use Africarare's land immediately to develop new experiments. The same applies to Africarare and its partners in the world developed by CBI/AlphaVerse. Alternatively  CBI and Africarare will be free to sell the land they have acquired should the interest arise. 4. Token exchange with DEGA LABS On June 7  2023  CBI entered into a token exchange agreement with DEGA LABS. 2Events post September 30  2023 As of the date of this press release  apart from the revaluation of the crypto-currency portfolio mentioned above  post- balance sheet events are as follows: 1.

Sales were stable compared with the same period last year. Consolidated operating income recurring Gross margin amounted to 99.6% of sales for the period. For purposes of comparison with other companies in the sector  CBI presents its income statement by function. Research and development costs Research and development costs were up 25.9% on the previous year. These costs include the operation of video games and the metaverse. Their evolution depends on the level of new functionalities developed. Classic video games are fully amortized  and there is no additional depreciation. With regard to the metaverse  the value of intellectual property rights is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and has not been amortized as at September 30  2023  as this amortization starts as soon as the metaverse opens  scheduled for the 2023-2024 financial year. Marketing and sales expenses Consolidated sales and marketing expenses include advertising  mainly through the launch of online campaigns. Marketing and sales expenses amounted to €988.6K for the period  compared with €667.0K for the previous year  a +48.2% variation. General and administrative expenses Consolidated general and administrative expenses for the period mainly reflect management costs  as well as overheads related to the listing of the company's shares on the Euronext Growth market. General and administrative expenses 4amounted to €633.6K for the year ended December 31  2006  compared with €569.3K for the previous year  representing an increase of 11.3%. Consolidated operating income recurring Consolidated operating income before non-recurring items amounted to €486.0K for the year  compared with €587.8K for the previous year. Consolidated operating income Given the trend in crypto-currency prices  particularly over the first half of the 2023-2024 financial year  an additional provision of €817.0K has been recognized. This provision breaks down into a portfolio provision of €960.0K to adjust the net valuation of the crypto-currency portfolio  which thus stands at €1 233.4K€ at the end of September 2023  and an adjustment to the debt payable in Chain Games tokens  which reduces the portfolio provision by €142.9K. Consolidated operating loss for the year was €-331.1K  compared with €-655.2K for the previous year  representing a change of +49.5%  due to the temporary impairment of tokens mentioned above.

No corporate income tax is payable for the period. Consolidated net income (Group share) came to €-724.1K for the period  compared with a deficit of €692.6K for the previous year  representing a variation of -4.5%. 5BALANCE SHEET Consolidated intangible assets Amounts invested in the development of games and the metaverse are capitalized and amortized from the time they are put into service. In the case of the metaverse  the value of intellectual property rights 5 is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet  and has not been amortized as at September 30  2023. Amortization will begin when the metaverse is opened  scheduled for the 2023-2024 financial year. 6Consolidated financial assets When listed  the portfolio of equities and financial instruments is valued on the basis of a six-monthvolume-weighted average price (V-WAP). Financial assets comprise shares in non-consolidated companies  investments in associates  derivatives not qualifying as hedges  deposits and loans  marketable securities  positive cash balances and operating receivables. Financial assets are classified as ""non-current""  except for those maturing in less than 12 months at the balance sheet date  which are classified as ""current assets"" or ""cash equivalents"" as appropriate. Financial assets held by the Group are analysed according to the business model and its objectives: assets measured at amortized cost (financial assets held to collect contractual cash flows) assets measured at fair value: financial assets held for resale  with a view to receiving contractual cash flows. Classification depends on the nature and purpose of each financial asset  and is determined at initial recognition. Traditional valuation methods are applied to unlisted securities. At each balance sheet date  investments are valued using standard methods  notably Net Asset Value or Discounted Cash Flows. These valuations give rise  where appropriate  to an impairment loss  which is recognized either in the income statement or as a deduction from shareholders' equity  in accordance with IFRS 9. The Company's subsidiaries and affiliates are listed below: Consolidated inventory of tokens and NFTs The inventory of tokens is recognized at cost  based on the acquisition price. At the balance sheet date  each crypto- currency is then valued on the basis of the closing price  to reflect the value of each crypto-currency and the overall portfolio. If the cost price of a crypto-currency exceeds its market value  an impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. At September 30  2023  inventory was valued at €1 233.4K. Consolidated shareholders' equity Consolidated shareholders' equity  Group share  amounted to €15 396.2 K for the year ended  compared with €21 494.8 K for the previous year.

The operator is now facing more pressure to secure a key EU satellite broadband contract  which won’t be easy due to.. politics.OneWeb (Eutelsat OneWeb) currently has 634 of their small (c.150kg) first generation (GEN1) Low Earth Orbit (LEO) platforms in space – orbiting at an altitude of 1 200km above the Earth (588 of them for coverage and the rest for redundancy). The network was technically completed in March 2023 (here) and promises both ultrafast speeds and fast latency times.NOTE: ISP ISP BT is currently working with OneWeb on a UK rural broadband trial ( here and here ).Just to recap. Eutelsat formally completed the acquisition of OneWeb in September 2023. Under the agreement  Eutelsat will remain headquartered in Paris  while OneWeb will be a subsidiary operating commercially as Eutelsat OneWeb with its centre of operations remaining in London. Eutelsat currently remains listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange and has applied for standard listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).The merger was intended to help Eutelsat enter the new market for LEO based broadband satellites  which is an area that has thus far been dominated by Starlink. By comparison  OneWeb saw the deal as being a way of potentially helping them to fund and start delivering their next (second) generation of satellites in a couple of years’ time.The problem is that Eutelsat’s share price has lost about a quarter of its value in just the past three months  which according to the Telegraph (paywall) now values the UK government’s remaining stake in the French company via OneWeb at around €225m (£195m) – roughly less than half of what they originally invested several years ago. But as a spokesperson for the government said: “Share prices fluctuate in the short term but this was a long-term investment.”As usual  there are a number of reasons for Eutelsat’s dismal performance. Firstly  the company was already under pressure from Starlink  but the OneWeb deal could only ever help to mitigate that by so much (it’s a much smaller network) and investors were uneasy about the cost of the deal. OneWeb will also need billions more in the future to deploy its second generation of satellites  but high interest rates make that much more expensive.NOTE: OneWeb has plans to launch another 1 280 satellites in the future (funds allowing)  which are expected to reflect a GEN2 model that could sit in a higher Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) of 8 500km. The GEN2s are widely expected to have more data capacity  support for OneWeb has plans to launch another 1 280 satellites in the future (funds allowing)  which are expected to reflect a GEN2 model that could sit in a higher(MEO) of 8 500km. The GEN2s are widely expected to have more data capacity  support for 5G mobile and may  possibly  introduce enhanced navigation and positioning features.In addition  Eutelsat’s debt was recently (November 2023) downgraded by Fitch due to “significantly increased execution and free cash flow risks“. The satellite operator is still hoping to tackle some of this by bidding on the EU’s own LEO network project  which is intended to provide an alternative to dependence upon Elon Musk’s Starlink (SpaceX).The problem is that EU leaders are known to be wary of such a bid because the UK government still retains veto powers over certain business deals via a golden share  which is applicable to specific points relating to national security  IP and changes to the nature and scope of OneWeb’s business. For example  this means the government could veto a decision to shift OneWeb’s HQ out of the UK or any sale of business to a hostile state (any changes to key UK suppliers of the OneWeb network might similarly throw up some issues).The UK Government has also previously hinted that OneWeb’s future GEN2 satellites could introduce enhanced navigation and positioning features  which is something they’ve long perceived as necessary due to being unable to stay a member of the Galileo project – Europe’s Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). But it remains unclear whether OneWeb’s second generation satellites will actually deliver this  assuming they do eventually get off the ground.Suffice to say that 2024 is going to be a very interesting year  although a quick look at Eutelsat’s historical trends over the past 5 years does rather suggest that things have been going downward a lot more than upward.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.09,0.18,0.72,True,English,"['OneWeb Satellite Broadband Firm', 'UK Gov', 'Stake', 'GEN1) Low Earth Orbit (LEO) platforms', 'small (c.150kg) first generation', 'key EU satellite broadband contract', 'free cash flow risks', 'higher Medium Earth Orbit', 'UK rural broadband trial', 'LEO based broadband satellites', 'Global Navigation Satellite System', 'Euronext Paris Stock Exchange', 'key UK suppliers', 'fast latency times', 'ISP ISP BT', 'London Stock Exchange', 'high interest rates', 'next (second) generation', 'LEO network project', 'European satellite operator', 'past three months', 'second generation satellites', 'tumbling share price', 'The UK Government', 'future GEN2 satellites', 'enhanced navigation', 'EU leaders', 'higher(MEO', 'Galileo project', 'past 5 years', 'GEN2 model', 'Share prices', 'golden share', 'Dec 27th', 'associated stake', 'ultrafast speeds', 'standard listing', 'new market', 'years’ time', 'a quarter', 'remaining stake', 'short term', 'long-term investment', 'dismal performance', 'smaller network', 'data capacity', '5G mobile', 'positioning features', 'Elon Musk', 'veto powers', 'specific points', 'national security', 'hostile state', 'interesting year', 'quick look', 'historical trends', 'French company', 'business deals', 'OneWeb network', 'OneWeb deal', 'Eutelsat OneWeb', '1,280 satellites', 'Wednesday', 'Score', 'value', 'pressure', 'politics', 'space', 'altitude', 'coverage', 'redundancy', 'March', 'NOTE', 'acquisition', 'September', 'agreement', 'subsidiary', 'centre', 'operations', 'LSE', 'merger', 'area', 'Starlink', 'comparison', 'way', 'couple', 'problem', 'Telegraph', 'paywall', 'less', 'half', 'spokesperson', 'number', 'reasons', 'investors', 'cost', 'billions', 'plans', 'funds', '500km', 'GEN2s', 'support', 'addition', 'debt', 'November', 'Fitch', 'execution', 'alternative', 'dependence', 'bid', 'IP', 'changes', 'nature', 'scope', 'example', 'decision', 'HQ', 'sale', 'issues', 'something', 'member', 'GNSS', 'ground', 'things']",2023-12-27,2023-12-27,ispreview.co.uk
