Several European ministers also stressed the need to maintain high levels of secrecy over the work  according to FT.Various options are being explored in Western capitals  ranging from directly confiscating and spending the Russian assets to generating income from them or using them as collateral for loans.The EU has not yet resorted to seizing Russian assets themselves instead exploring ways to withdraw the profits generated for financial institutions such as Euroclear  where Russian sovereign assets worth EUR 191 billion ($212.5 billion) are held.Washington has so far not publicly backed seizing Russian assets  but the U.S. privately circulated a discussion paper this year within the G7  suggesting that the arrest of frozen Moscow assets would be legal as ""a countermeasure to induce Russia to end its aggression.""Nevertheless  Europe  where the bulk of Russian assets is concentrated  is much more wary fearing potential repercussions on financial stability and the possibility of retaliatory action from Russia.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier said that the United States is considering legal options  together with the European Union  to redirect $300 billion in Russian assets to Ukraine’s economic reconstruction and other needs.The European Council Legal Service developed a plan on Jan. 26 to use frozen assets of the Russian Central Bank  valued at approximately $36.8 billion  for financing Ukraine's reconstruction.As a result of arrests and various asset confiscation mechanisms involving Russians and their collaborators in Ukraine since Feb. 24  2022  UAH 28.3 billion ($753 million) has been transferred to the state budget.However  the EU has assessed that it can’t legally confiscate outright frozen Russian assets  according to news agency Bloomberg. Instead the bloc is focusing on using those assets temporarily.Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo  in a joint conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  announced plans on Oct. 11 to create a special fund worth EUR 1.7 billion ($1.9 billion) this year to support Ukraine.The money for this fund will be sourced from frozen Russian assets within the country. Zelenskyy declared that Belgium would be the first country to employ frozen Russian assets to provide support to Ukraine.The FT reported on Dec. 16 that the G7 countries are close to potentially confiscating frozen Russian assets.The U.S. Senate supported an amendment on Dec. 22 to the bill that would enable seizing frozen Russian assets to help finance Ukraine’s defense against Russian aggression.Will you support Ukraine’s free press?

Pursuant to these agreements  Atlas will continue to fund Oxurion under the existing EUR 20.8 million funding program with a focus on Oxurion’s preclinical programs and monetizing its other existing assets  potentially including both THR-149 and THR-687  while at the same time Oxurion is putting in place a debt restructuring plan with Oxurion’s creditors and seeking future corporate transactions or a business combination that would be complementary to debt restructuring  all of which remains uncertain.For the last five years  Oxurion’s preclinical program has been focused on developing innovative therapeutics to preserve the vision of elderly people suffering from Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) generally  and Geographic Atrophy (GA) specifically. GA is an advanced form of AMD and is the leading cause of blindness worldwide - GA is estimated to affect between 5-8 million people currently and is expected to increase at a rate of 7% annually.The market potential for GA is estimated at between USD 3-6 billion by 2028. Given this market potential  vast amounts of time and capital that have been invested to find an effective treatment for GA. Earlier this year the FDA approved the first medicine for the treatment of GA  SYFOVRE®1 (pegcetacoplan injection) from Apellis. SYFOVRE was shown in clinical trials to reduce the rate of GA lesion growth by no more than 36% with monthly IVT injections  with no significant improvement in vision  which leaves a tremendous unmet need for an effective treatment for GA. In August of this year  a second product was approved for GA  IZERVAY™2(avacincaptad pegol intravitreal solution) from Iveric Bio  an Astellas company  with a similar profile to SYFOVE. Prior to the approval of IZERVAY  Iveric Bio  whose principal asset was IZERVAY  was acquired by Astellas for USD 5.9 billion  demonstrating the significant value assets for treating GA can potentially generate.Story continuesBoth SYFOVRE and IZERVAY target a single pathway  the complement pathway. However  the causes of GA are multifactorial and Oxurion has developed a disease specific target discovery platform enabling it to study the disease from different angles in a rapid and capital efficient manner. Using the platform  Oxurion has already identified potential novel pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AMD/GA disease that have the potential to provide better treatment options for GA patients that are not focused solely on the complement pathway.The next step for Oxurion is to seek to validate these targets in various in vitro and in vivo models that the preclinical team has developed over the past years and that are representative of the disease characteristics of AMD/GA (patient in a dish). Oxurion’s approach potentially differentiates it from other methods through its unbiased target discovery approach and its multitargeting drug format  which the Company considers to be necessary to improve efficacy compared to the standard of care for such a multi-factorial disease.The Company expects that  if successful  its lead generation work could allow Composition of Matter patents to be filed in 2024  which would be the next value inflection point  after which the Company estimates it would take around two years and a further investment of approximately EUR 20 million in working capital before initiating a proof of concept study.Had the Company not been capital constrained  it would have undertaken these efforts previously. Atlas has now committed to fund the Company’s running costs including the GA program at least through 2024  provided the modified liquidity and market capitalization conditions set forth below are met  and to consider means of further monetizing both the Oncurious and Oxurion assets (potentially including THR-687 and THR-149)  and in parallel to seek future corporate transactions or business combinations.To achieve these aims  the Company has agreed with the Chief Development Officer (CDO)  the newly promoted Chief Scientific Officer (CSO)  and the entire preclinical team to stay at the Company. The team consists of six world-class scientists with combined experience in researching retina diseases of more than 75 years  including 4 PhD’s/MDs. The team is led by Dr. Andy De Deene  CDO  who is a medical doctor with more than 15 years of retina drug development experience and led the development of Jetrea® which was approved in over 50 countries  and Philippe Barbeaux  CSO  a PhD with more than 15 years of preclinical experience in retina-related diseases. Andy and Philippe will both be members of the Executive Committee  together with the new acting CEO/CFO  Pascal Ghoson  who is a former M&A specialist at Rothschild bank and CFO of various listed companies on Euronext.Given that the Company will change its focus to preclinical development  the size of the Company will be reduced to approximately 10 persons  and the remainder of the Company’s personnel  including the current CEO/CFO Tom Graney  will participate in a voluntary redundancy program on terms that have been agreed  which will result in a cost saving of approximately 67% of its personnel cost going forward.Under the terms of the LOI  Atlas commits to pay EUR 500 000 to Kreos Capital VI (UK) Limited/Pontifax Medison Finance (Israel) L.P. and Pontifax Medison Finance (Cayman) L.P. (Kreos/Pontifax)  and Kreos/Pontifax have agreed to remove the freeze on the Company’s bank accounts up to the same amount to pay certain costs related to December 2023. In addition  Atlas has committed to finance the additional funds required to cover the one-off expenses related to implementation of the LOI  for a total amount of EUR 355 000 (“LOI costs”). Atlas has also committed to funding the preclinical program through 2024 in monthly tranches of EUR 300 000 to be paid monthly starting in January 2024 through December 2024 (“Running costs”)  provided that the conditions of the Atlas funding program  which are described below  are met (together the Running costs and the LOI costs are referred to as the “Working Capital costs”)  allowing for Oxurion to stay in going concern  but not to exceed the remaining amount under the Atlas funding program  which is EUR 8.5 million. Atlas will not receive any commission fee in the context of the LOI.The Working Capital costs will be funded through the issuance of mandatory convertible bonds after the date of the LOI under the terms of the existing Atlas funding program. Atlas has agreed to waive liquidity and market capitalization conditions of the convertible bonds to fund the LOI Costs and the convertible bonds issued to set-off the EUR 500 000 reimbursement of Kreos/Pontifax. Subsequent tranches are subject to facilitated liquidity and market capitalization conditions (market cap at EUR 500 000 and total trading value of last 22 days above EUR 200 000). Atlas currently holds 296 convertible bonds in a total amount of EUR 7.4 million.Atlas formally commits not to convert Convertible Bonds issued after the LOI to pay the Working Capital costs and the LOI costs (the “New Convertible Bonds”) and to only convert old convertible bonds (i.e. convertible bonds issued in accordance with the Subscription Agreement and outstanding on the date of the second amendment to the funding program (the ""Old Convertible Bonds"")) having a combined EUR value equivalent to the New Convertible Bonds issued after the date of the LOI until the earlier date between (i) 12 months from the date of the LOI  (ii) the announcement by the Company of a potential partnership or transaction involving a third party or any major scientific update  or (iii) when the last rolling 22 trading days total volume of shares traded on the market is valued above EUR 1 million  in which case Atlas will be entitled to convert and trade shares in excess of the amount of New Convertible Bonds  but agrees not trade more than 30% of the total daily volume traded. The Atlas funding program is described further below and in section 13 (pp. 46 – 50) of the Prospectus dated March 29  2023 (link)  the supplements dated June 13  2023 (link) August 22  2023 (link)  Section 1. (pp. 1 – 2) of the Third Supplement dated October 2  2023 (link) and November 15  2023 (link) (the “Prospectus”) and the Board reports dated March 7  2023 (link) and respectively October 2  2023 (link).Thomas Clay  Patrik De Haes and Tom Graney have stepped down from the Board as a condition of the LOI  and Charles Paris de Bollardière (former secretary of the Board of TotalEnergies)  James Hartmann (former auditor at the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission and Chief Compliance officer of various companies) have been co-opted as new independent directors and the new CEO/CFO  Pascal Ghoson  has been co-opted as a new executive director (the “New Board”). This press release is issued by the New Board.The primary driver underlying the Company’s communication last month that it was preparing to file for bankruptcy and that shareholders would likely not receive any value for their shares  was the right held by Kreos/Pontifax to enforce their security interest to freeze the Company’s liquid assets  which they did. That risk has been eliminated by Atlas successfully agreeing terms with Kreos/Pontifax to acquire their outstanding debt of around EUR 2.1 million for approximately EUR 1.6 million by entering into a binding agreement to purchase the debt along with assignment of the claim and related pledge  rights  interests  and security of Kreos/Pontifax  which shall be transferred to Atlas when Kreos/Pontifax is repaid  which is expected to occur on January 1  2024  and until then  Kreos/Pontifax has agreed not to enforce their security interest. This repayment from Atlas to Kreos/Pontifax will not be dilutive to the shareholders. A comparable second rank security package shall cover any future New Convertible Bonds' subscriptions. Oxurion shall immediately partly reimburse the debt transferred from Kreos/Pontifax to Atlas with its own financial means and funds provided via New Convertible Bonds  and reduce the debt and the related pledge to around EUR 0.5 million by mid-January 2024.The conversion of mandatory convertible bonds under the existing funding program will significantly dilute existing shareholders  and to limit the amount of the dilution  while at the same time avoiding bankruptcy  as described above  Atlas has formally committed to limit its conversions of convertible bonds as described above. Concerning the amount of the dilution from the shares converted for the convertible bonds  while it is difficult to predict  the attached Annex to this press release attempts to project the possible dilution at a hypothetical conversion price of EUR 0.000460 to EUR 0.000092. For instance  the conversion of the Working Capital costs of EUR 4 950 000  could  at a hypothetical conversion price of EUR 0.000460 to EUR 0.000092  lead to the issuance of 10 761 000 000 to 53 805 000 000 new shares (depending on the conversion price)  being a dilution of the voting rights of 75.51% to 93.91% and a financial dilution of 36.92% to 84.31% compared to the situation as of the date of this press release. Reference is made to the attached dilution table as Annex 1. In the event the total Working Capital costs would amount to the total remaining amount under the Atlas funding program  i.e. EUR 8.5 million  this could lead to the issuance of 18 479 000 000 to 92 392 000 000 new shares (depending on the conversion price)  being a dilution of the voting rights of 84.12% to 96.36% and a financial dilution of 41.12% to 86.51% compared to the situation as of the date of this press release. Were Atlas to convert all EUR 7.4m in convertible bonds that they currently hold  together with the entire EUR 8.5m remaining under the Atlas Funding Program  at the hypothetical conversion prices set out above  and maintain ownership of all shares issued upon conversion  which is not its intent  this would result in Atlas holding more than 90% of Oxurion’s shares. However  given that Atlas intends to sell its shares issued upon conversion  it is highly unlikely that it would cross the threshold of 30% of the voting rights of Oxurion.In view of the extent of the dilution  any prospect of recovery for existing shareholders as far as share value is concerned is remote.At the same time  Oxurion is in the process of negotiating a debt restructuring plan with Oxurion’s larger creditors  which seeks their agreement to a significant reduction of their debt  combined with potential conversion to equity  payment delays and maturity extensions. The Company’s current debts amount to approximately EUR 15 million. The Company’s largest creditors are Atlas  Kreos/Pontifax and Syneos Healthcare. It is uncertain whether the Debt Restructuring will be successful  but were that to be the case  it is expected that the repayments will be financed by the Company issuing additional New Convertible Bonds to Atlas and potential debt for equity swaps (the “Debt Repayment”). While the amount of the Debt Repayment is being negotiated  the total amount of the New Convertible Bonds to be issued for the Working Capital Costs  LOI Costs  plus the Debt Repayments  shall not exceed the remaining funding available under the Atlas funding program as of the date of the LOI  which is EUR 8.5 million. Reference is made to the dilution table in Annex 1.Based on the foregoing  the Board has determined that the bankruptcy conditions are not met and the Company therefore will not file for bankruptcy as long that continues to be the case.About OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is engaged in developing next-generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies for the treatment of retinal disease.

The operator is now facing more pressure to secure a key EU satellite broadband contract  which won’t be easy due to.. politics.OneWeb (Eutelsat OneWeb) currently has 634 of their small (c.150kg) first generation (GEN1) Low Earth Orbit (LEO) platforms in space – orbiting at an altitude of 1 200km above the Earth (588 of them for coverage and the rest for redundancy). The network was technically completed in March 2023 (here) and promises both ultrafast speeds and fast latency times.NOTE: ISP ISP BT is currently working with OneWeb on a UK rural broadband trial ( here and here ).Just to recap. Eutelsat formally completed the acquisition of OneWeb in September 2023. Under the agreement  Eutelsat will remain headquartered in Paris  while OneWeb will be a subsidiary operating commercially as Eutelsat OneWeb with its centre of operations remaining in London. Eutelsat currently remains listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange and has applied for standard listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).The merger was intended to help Eutelsat enter the new market for LEO based broadband satellites  which is an area that has thus far been dominated by Starlink. By comparison  OneWeb saw the deal as being a way of potentially helping them to fund and start delivering their next (second) generation of satellites in a couple of years’ time.The problem is that Eutelsat’s share price has lost about a quarter of its value in just the past three months  which according to the Telegraph (paywall) now values the UK government’s remaining stake in the French company via OneWeb at around €225m (£195m) – roughly less than half of what they originally invested several years ago. But as a spokesperson for the government said: “Share prices fluctuate in the short term but this was a long-term investment.”As usual  there are a number of reasons for Eutelsat’s dismal performance. Firstly  the company was already under pressure from Starlink  but the OneWeb deal could only ever help to mitigate that by so much (it’s a much smaller network) and investors were uneasy about the cost of the deal. OneWeb will also need billions more in the future to deploy its second generation of satellites  but high interest rates make that much more expensive.NOTE: OneWeb has plans to launch another 1 280 satellites in the future (funds allowing)  which are expected to reflect a GEN2 model that could sit in a higher Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) of 8 500km. The GEN2s are widely expected to have more data capacity  support for OneWeb has plans to launch another 1 280 satellites in the future (funds allowing)  which are expected to reflect a GEN2 model that could sit in a higher(MEO) of 8 500km. The GEN2s are widely expected to have more data capacity  support for 5G mobile and may  possibly  introduce enhanced navigation and positioning features.In addition  Eutelsat’s debt was recently (November 2023) downgraded by Fitch due to “significantly increased execution and free cash flow risks“. The satellite operator is still hoping to tackle some of this by bidding on the EU’s own LEO network project  which is intended to provide an alternative to dependence upon Elon Musk’s Starlink (SpaceX).The problem is that EU leaders are known to be wary of such a bid because the UK government still retains veto powers over certain business deals via a golden share  which is applicable to specific points relating to national security  IP and changes to the nature and scope of OneWeb’s business. For example  this means the government could veto a decision to shift OneWeb’s HQ out of the UK or any sale of business to a hostile state (any changes to key UK suppliers of the OneWeb network might similarly throw up some issues).The UK Government has also previously hinted that OneWeb’s future GEN2 satellites could introduce enhanced navigation and positioning features  which is something they’ve long perceived as necessary due to being unable to stay a member of the Galileo project – Europe’s Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). But it remains unclear whether OneWeb’s second generation satellites will actually deliver this  assuming they do eventually get off the ground.Suffice to say that 2024 is going to be a very interesting year  although a quick look at Eutelsat’s historical trends over the past 5 years does rather suggest that things have been going downward a lot more than upward.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.08,0.19,0.72,True,English,"['OneWeb Satellite Broadband Firm', 'UK Gov', 'Value', 'Stake', 'GEN1) Low Earth Orbit (LEO) platforms', 'small (c.150kg) first generation', 'key EU satellite broadband contract', 'free cash flow risks', 'higher Medium Earth Orbit', 'UK rural broadband trial', 'LEO based broadband satellites', 'Global Navigation Satellite System', 'Euronext Paris Stock Exchange', 'key UK suppliers', 'fast latency times', 'ISP ISP BT', 'London Stock Exchange', 'high interest rates', 'next (second) generation', 'LEO network project', 'European satellite operator', 'past three months', 'second generation satellites', 'tumbling share price', 'The UK Government', 'future GEN2 satellites', 'enhanced navigation', 'EU leaders', 'higher(MEO', 'Galileo project', 'past 5 years', 'GEN2 model', 'Share prices', 'golden share', 'Dec 27th', 'associated stake', 'ultrafast speeds', 'standard listing', 'new market', 'years’ time', 'a quarter', 'remaining stake', 'short term', 'long-term investment', 'dismal performance', 'smaller network', 'data capacity', '5G mobile', 'positioning features', 'Elon Musk', 'veto powers', 'specific points', 'national security', 'hostile state', 'interesting year', 'quick look', 'historical trends', 'French company', 'business deals', 'OneWeb network', 'OneWeb deal', 'Eutelsat OneWeb', '1,280 satellites', 'Wednesday', 'Score', 'value', 'pressure', 'politics', 'space', 'altitude', 'coverage', 'redundancy', 'March', 'NOTE', 'acquisition', 'September', 'agreement', 'subsidiary', 'centre', 'operations', 'LSE', 'merger', 'area', 'Starlink', 'comparison', 'way', 'couple', 'problem', 'Telegraph', 'paywall', 'less', 'half', 'spokesperson', 'number', 'reasons', 'investors', 'cost', 'billions', 'plans', 'funds', '500km', 'GEN2s', 'support', 'addition', 'debt', 'November', 'Fitch', 'execution', 'alternative', 'dependence', 'bid', 'IP', 'changes', 'nature', 'scope', 'example', 'decision', 'HQ', 'sale', 'issues', 'something', 'member', 'GNSS', 'ground', 'things']",2023-12-27,2023-12-28,ispreview.co.uk
