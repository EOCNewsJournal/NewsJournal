(CSE: UUSA) (OTCQB: UUSAF) (FSE: F2C) (the ""Company"" or ""Kraken"") is pleased to report that the Company has received approval to resume their Phase I drill program at the Harts Point Uranium Property (""Harts Point"" or the ""Property"") in Southern Utah.With a revised and approved exploration permit  the Company will drill the property from two pad locations over a 5 km strike length targeting the favorable uranium bearing Chinle Formation host rock where three historical oil and gas wells returned ""off-scale"" radioactivity. Upon favorable results  the Company intends to continue the drill program to further evaluate the mineralized trend.As a result of this development  management has made the strategic decision to reallocate resources from drilling at the Apex Uranium Property (""Apex"") to the resumption of drilling at Harts Point.CEO Matthew Schwab stated: ""We are excited to be resuming our Phase I drilling program at Harts Point in Utah and we believe the site to be extremely promising in the short-term. Regarding Apex  we anticipate resuming drilling there once the property is fully permitted  including the US Forest Service portions. While we are encouraged by the continued exploration at Apex  we believe that we can run our drill program more effectively and efficiently once we have the property fully permitted. As such  Harts Point will be our immediate focus moving into 2024.""Harts Point Property Highlights:World class uranium jurisdiction: located in the center of the Colorado Plateau  which has produced over 328 million (""M"") pounds (""lbs"") U 3 O 8 at 0.2 to 0.4% U 3 O 8 since the 1950s 1 .located in the center of the Colorado Plateau  which has produced since the 1950s .

Harts Point Anticline is Analogous to the Lisbon Valley Anticline: where the Lisbon Valley Uranium District hosted 17 large uranium mines which produced approximately 80M lbs U 3 O 8 at 0.34% U 3 O 8 from 1948 to 1988 2 . The dimensions of these tabular sandstone-hosted uranium deposits range from 2 to 13 meters (""m"") (7 to 43 feet) thick  100 to 3 048 m (328 to 10 000 feet) long  and 31 to 427 m (100 to 1 400 feet) wide 3 .where the Lisbon Valley Uranium District hosted from 1948 to 1988 . Significant Historic Uranium Production: Several historic mines located 11 km (7 miles) west of the Harts Point Property produced approximately 280 000 lbs U 3 O 8 at 0.3% U 3 O 8 from the favorable Chinle Formation host rock 4 . The Lisbon Valley Anticline is located 31 km (19 miles) to the east of the Harts Point Property produced approximately 80M lbs U 3 O 8 0.34% U 3 O 8 2 .Historic Exploration: Three wide-spaced historic oil and gas wells on the Property (Figure 1) along the east flank of the Harts Point Anticline show 'off-scale' radioactivity within the favorable Chinle Formation host rock. Drilled between 1953 and 1980  historic drill holes 43-037-10438  43-037-30109  and 43-037-30623 showed off-scale radioactivity readings between 2.1 to 3.7 m thickness (7 to 12 feet) from depths of 390 to 417 m (1 280 to 1 368 feet).(Figure 1) along the east flank of the Harts Point Anticline Excellent Infrastructure: located approximately 64 km (40 miles) north of the White Mesa uranium processing facility. There is also excellent access throughout the Property  which is situated 45 km (28 miles) from the town of Monticello  Utah.located approximatelyFigure 1 : Harts Point Property with Local Uranium OccurrencesTo view an enhanced version of this graphic  please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8684/192538_001cd4aee4937b5c_001full.jpgApex Drilling Summary:A total of 873.5 meters (""m"") were drilled over three holes during the recent drilling program at the Apex Uranium Property. None of the three drill holes intersected bedrock and all three drill holes were abandoned at roughly 300 m depth. Target depths for this program were based on a geophysical inversion of the VTEM data collected in 2022 where the depth to basement was indicated between 50 to 150 m depth in the areas of interest.The geophysical targets and strong radon anomalies west of the Apex Mine still hold strong technical and geological merits  but due to the variance in target depths the decision was made to pause drilling and reevaluate targeting on the property.Frankfurt Listing:The Company is pleased to announce the listing of its shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (""FSE"").

But if you see the post go-live volumes  they have been higher than this. So you have seen 20 094 crore in futures and 87 842 crore in options. So  overall there has been a growth in turnover  pre and post go-live ” he said.He said a few isolated issues faced during the transition have been promptly addressed  and efforts are ongoing to resolve any outstanding concerns.MCX successfully migrated to the Deutsche Börse's T7 platform in collaboration with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for backend support from banks.The MCX officially went live with the new Commodity Derivatives Platform on October 16  2023. The initial implementation date  set for October 3  was temporarily postponed by the capital market regulator  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)  due to technical issues and pending legal matters.Also ReadThe migration to the TCS-developed platform  initiated under a 2021 agreement  is a substantial move for MCX. The exchange had been operating on a platform provided by 63 Moons Technologies  with a contractual arrangement in place until the end of December.To ensure a smooth transition and minimize disruptions to trading operations  MCX had strategically planned to commence the migration process three months before the expiration of the agreement with 63 Moons. This approach allowed MCX to operate on both platforms simultaneously during the transitional period  gradually shifting entirely to the TCS platform ahead of the contract expiry with 63 Moons in December.For more details  watch the accompanying video,neutral,0.01,0.85,0.14,mixed,0.29,0.35,0.36,True,English,"['old contracts', 'new platform', 'MCX', 'new web-based commodity derivatives platform', 'new Commodity Derivatives Platform', 'The Multi Commodity Exchange', 'Deutsche Börse', 'Tata Consultancy Services', 'pending legal matters', 'capital market regulator', 'initial implementation date', 'T7 platform', 'TCS-developed platform', 'Share Market', 'Exchange Board', 'TCS platform', 'The MCX', 'old contracts', 'Business Development', 'volume boost', 'overall volume', 'isolated issues', 'outstanding concerns', 'backend support', 'technical issues', 'substantial move', 'contractual arrangement', 'trading operations', 'transitional period', 'accompanying video', 'Rishi Nathany', 'migration process', '63 Moons Technologies', 'smooth transition', 'MCX.', 'India', 'Head', 'Marketing', 'CNBC-TV18', 'NSE', 'software', 'enabler', 'transactions', 'FY23', 'futures', '354 crore', 'options', '81,220 crore', 'volumes', '20,094 crore', '87,842 crore', 'growth', 'turnover', 'efforts', 'collaboration', 'banks', 'October', 'Securities', 'SEBI', '2021 agreement', 'place', 'December', 'disruptions', 'expiration', 'approach', 'platforms', 'details']",2023-12-29,2023-12-29,cnbctv18.com

The alfapump received breakthrough device designation from the US FDA in 2019.Recurrent or refractory ascites is a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period. If approved by the FDA  the alfapump could become the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination.Timur Resch  Global Vice President QM/QA/RA at Sequana Medical  commented: “The submission of our Premarket Approval application to the FDA is the result of an enormous team effort and a clear demonstration of our intensive preparation to fulfil US regulatory requirements. We have great confidence in the strength of our PMA submission and look forward to work in close collaboration with the FDA to facilitate a seamless and thorough review process intended to bring our breakthrough device to the US market as soon as possible.”Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical  added: “This is a key milestone for the alfapump and underscores our commitment to improving treatment options for patients with recurrent or refractory liver ascites. This overlooked patient group is forecast to grow strongly due to NASH / MASH and today’s limited treatment options often lead to poor clinical outcomes  severely reduced quality of life  a substantial burden on their caregivers and high costs to payors. Data from our North American pivotal study demonstrate the potential for alfapump to transform the lives of these patients by virtually eliminating the need for paracentesis and delivering clinicially important improvements in quality of life. We anticipate FDA approval in the second half of 2024 and look forward to introducing the alfapump through our own specialy salesforce focused on US liver transplant centers.”The PMA filing is based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada with a total of 69 patients implanted with the alfapump. The primary effectiveness endpoints at six months post-implantation in the Pivotal Cohorti exceeded the predefined thresholds with statistical significance  and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectationsii. Data at 12 months post-implantation continued to show a strong and durable clinical profile  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis and delivering a clinically meaningful improvement in patients’ quality of lifeiii.Data from the patient preference study and a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELDiv registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures and that the safety profile of the alfapump is comparable to standard of care.The North American market of recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is forecast to grow 6-7% per year  from 78 000 patients in 2025  reaching a market opportunity for alfapump of over $2.5 billion by 2035  with NASH being the major driver of growthv. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579Strong and durable clinical alfapump profile demonstrated in pivotal POSEIDON studyPivotal Cohort patients from the POSEIDON study had a 100% median reduction in therapeutic paracentesis in the 4-6 month post-implant period vs the three month pre-implant period  and this was maintained in the 7-12 month post-implant period. These data show that the alfapump has a sustained effect on controlling ascites  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis.During the 0-6 month post-implant period  the alfapump was explanted in six Pivotal Cohort patients (three due to wound or skin erosion and three due to patient-reported discomfort of moderate severity) and in two Pivotal Cohort patients during the 7-12 month post-implant period (one due to a urinary tract infection and one due to wound dehiscence). The number of Major Adverse Events (MAEsvi) and serious infections were in line with expectations. Importantly  creatine and eGFRvii levels of alfapump-treated patients over 12-month follow-up indicated a stable renal function. Overall  these safety data indicate that the alfapump has a robust safety profile over long-term follow-up. In addition  a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELD registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that the safety profile of the alfapump is in line with expectations and comparable to standard paracentesis procedures.Patients from the POSEIDON study had a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life (assessed through the physical component score of SF36  a general health quality of life measure  and the Ascites Q score  a quality of life measure specific for patients with ascites) at 6 months post-implant vs three months pre-implant and maintained this at 12 months post-implant  despite disease progression.The overall trend in survivalviii in patients implanted with the alfapump in the POSEIDON study remained positive over a longer term  with a Kaplan-Meier estimate indicating over 70% survival probability at 12 and 18 months post-implant. This compares favourably with the published literature reporting a predicted survival probability for refractory ascites patients with a similar MELDix score and receiving paracentesis of approximately 17% at 12 months and 5% at 18 monthsx.Data from the POSEIDON study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.Outcome patient preference studyxiThe patient preference study was conducted by RTI Health Solutions using a discrete-choice experiment methodology to elicit patient preference for attributes of an implantable pump as a novel interventional treatment for ascites. In total  125 US patients with a comparable patient profile as the Pivotal Cohort in the POSEIDON study  completed the survey. Results indicate that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures  with reduction in paracentesis frequency and additional ascites good health days as important attributes. The study also indicated that the alfapump benefit-risk profile from the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort is superior to what patients require from a novel implantable pump.About recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosisRecurrent and refractory ascites is a key complication of liver cirrhosis  characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing many health issues and severely impacting their daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable  requiring patients to undergo regular paracentesis. Paracentesis is a painful and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period  with only short term benefit for the patients  requiring frequent hospitalizations and severely impacting their quality of life.The North American market for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is estimated at 78 000 patients in 2025  and this number is expected to grow at 6-7% per year  reaching over 170 000 patients in 2035 due to the strong growth of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) / metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company submitted a Premarket Approval (PMA) application to the US FDA in December 2023 having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis.Results of the Company’s RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR’s mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a DSR clinical study is ongoing  seeking to confirm the strong efficacy seen in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort have been successfully treated and the randomized cohort of up to a further 30 patients will start following DSMB approval  planned for Q1 2024.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Pursuant to these agreements  Atlas will continue to fund Oxurion under the existing EUR 20.8 million funding program with a focus on Oxurion’s preclinical programs and monetizing its other existing assets  potentially including both THR-149 and THR-687  while at the same time Oxurion is putting in place a debt restructuring plan with Oxurion’s creditors and seeking future corporate transactions or a business combination that would be complementary to debt restructuring  all of which remains uncertain.For the last five years  Oxurion’s preclinical program has been focused on developing innovative therapeutics to preserve the vision of elderly people suffering from Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) generally  and Geographic Atrophy (GA) specifically. GA is an advanced form of AMD and is the leading cause of blindness worldwide - GA is estimated to affect between 5-8 million people currently and is expected to increase at a rate of 7% annually.The market potential for GA is estimated at between USD 3-6 billion by 2028. Given this market potential  vast amounts of time and capital that have been invested to find an effective treatment for GA. Earlier this year the FDA approved the first medicine for the treatment of GA  SYFOVRE®1 (pegcetacoplan injection) from Apellis. SYFOVRE was shown in clinical trials to reduce the rate of GA lesion growth by no more than 36% with monthly IVT injections  with no significant improvement in vision  which leaves a tremendous unmet need for an effective treatment for GA. In August of this year  a second product was approved for GA  IZERVAY™2(avacincaptad pegol intravitreal solution) from Iveric Bio  an Astellas company  with a similar profile to SYFOVE. Prior to the approval of IZERVAY  Iveric Bio  whose principal asset was IZERVAY  was acquired by Astellas for USD 5.9 billion  demonstrating the significant value assets for treating GA can potentially generate.Both SYFOVRE and IZERVAY target a single pathway  the complement pathway. However  the causes of GA are multifactorial and Oxurion has developed a disease specific target discovery platform enabling it to study the disease from different angles in a rapid and capital efficient manner. Using the platform  Oxurion has already identified potential novel pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AMD/GA disease that have the potential to provide better treatment options for GA patients that are not focused solely on the complement pathway.The next step for Oxurion is to seek to validate these targets in various in vitro and in vivo models that the preclinical team has developed over the past years and that are representative of the disease characteristics of AMD/GA (patient in a dish). Oxurion’s approach potentially differentiates it from other methods through its unbiased target discovery approach and its multitargeting drug format  which the Company considers to be necessary to improve efficacy compared to the standard of care for such a multi-factorial disease.The Company expects that  if successful  its lead generation work could allow Composition of Matter patents to be filed in 2024  which would be the next value inflection point  after which the Company estimates it would take around two years and a further investment of approximately EUR 20 million in working capital before initiating a proof of concept study.Had the Company not been capital constrained  it would have undertaken these efforts previously. Atlas has now committed to fund the Company’s running costs including the GA program at least through 2024  provided the modified liquidity and market capitalization conditions set forth below are met  and to consider means of further monetizing both the Oncurious and Oxurion assets (potentially including THR-687 and THR-149)  and in parallel to seek future corporate transactions or business combinations.To achieve these aims  the Company has agreed with the Chief Development Officer (CDO)  the newly promoted Chief Scientific Officer (CSO)  and the entire preclinical team to stay at the Company. The team consists of six world-class scientists with combined experience in researching retina diseases of more than 75 years  including 4 PhD’s/MDs. The team is led by Dr. Andy De Deene  CDO  who is a medical doctor with more than 15 years of retina drug development experience and led the development of Jetrea® which was approved in over 50 countries  and Philippe Barbeaux  CSO  a PhD with more than 15 years of preclinical experience in retina-related diseases. Andy and Philippe will both be members of the Executive Committee  together with the new acting CEO/CFO  Pascal Ghoson  who is a former M&A specialist at Rothschild bank and CFO of various listed companies on Euronext.Given that the Company will change its focus to preclinical development  the size of the Company will be reduced to approximately 10 persons  and the remainder of the Company’s personnel  including the current CEO/CFO Tom Graney  will participate in a voluntary redundancy program on terms that have been agreed  which will result in a cost saving of approximately 67% of its personnel cost going forward.Under the terms of the LOI  Atlas commits to pay EUR 500 000 to Kreos Capital VI (UK) Limited/Pontifax Medison Finance (Israel) L.P. and Pontifax Medison Finance (Cayman) L.P. (Kreos/Pontifax)  and Kreos/Pontifax have agreed to remove the freeze on the Company’s bank accounts up to the same amount to pay certain costs related to December 2023. In addition  Atlas has committed to finance the additional funds required to cover the one-off expenses related to implementation of the LOI  for a total amount of EUR 355 000 (“LOI costs”). Atlas has also committed to funding the preclinical program through 2024 in monthly tranches of EUR 300 000 to be paid monthly starting in January 2024 through December 2024 (“Running costs”)  provided that the conditions of the Atlas funding program  which are described below  are met (together the Running costs and the LOI costs are referred to as the “Working Capital costs”)  allowing for Oxurion to stay in going concern  but not to exceed the remaining amount under the Atlas funding program  which is EUR 8.5 million. Atlas will not receive any commission fee in the context of the LOI.The Working Capital costs will be funded through the issuance of mandatory convertible bonds after the date of the LOI under the terms of the existing Atlas funding program. Atlas has agreed to waive liquidity and market capitalization conditions of the convertible bonds to fund the LOI Costs and the convertible bonds issued to set-off the EUR 500 000 reimbursement of Kreos/Pontifax. Subsequent tranches are subject to facilitated liquidity and market capitalization conditions (market cap at EUR 500 000 and total trading value of last 22 days above EUR 200 000). Atlas currently holds 296 convertible bonds in a total amount of EUR 7.4 million.Atlas formally commits not to convert Convertible Bonds issued after the LOI to pay the Working Capital costs and the LOI costs (the “New Convertible Bonds”) and to only convert old convertible bonds (i.e. convertible bonds issued in accordance with the Subscription Agreement and outstanding on the date of the second amendment to the funding program (the ""Old Convertible Bonds"")) having a combined EUR value equivalent to the New Convertible Bonds issued after the date of the LOI until the earlier date between (i) 12 months from the date of the LOI  (ii) the announcement by the Company of a potential partnership or transaction involving a third party or any major scientific update  or (iii) when the last rolling 22 trading days total volume of shares traded on the market is valued above EUR 1 million  in which case Atlas will be entitled to convert and trade shares in excess of the amount of New Convertible Bonds  but agrees not trade more than 30% of the total daily volume traded. The Atlas funding program is described further below and in section 13 (pp. 46 – 50) of the Prospectus dated March 29  2023 (link)  the supplements dated June 13  2023 (link) August 22  2023 (link)  Section 1. (pp. 1 – 2) of the Third Supplement dated October 2  2023 (link) and November 15  2023 (link) (the “Prospectus”) and the Board reports dated March 7  2023 (link) and respectively October 2  2023 (link).Thomas Clay  Patrik De Haes and Tom Graney have stepped down from the Board as a condition of the LOI  and Charles Paris de Bollardière (former secretary of the Board of TotalEnergies)  James Hartmann (former auditor at the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission and Chief Compliance officer of various companies) have been co-opted as new independent directors and the new CEO/CFO  Pascal Ghoson  has been co-opted as a new executive director (the “New Board”). This press release is issued by the New Board.The primary driver underlying the Company’s communication last month that it was preparing to file for bankruptcy and that shareholders would likely not receive any value for their shares  was the right held by Kreos/Pontifax to enforce their security interest to freeze the Company’s liquid assets  which they did. That risk has been eliminated by Atlas successfully agreeing terms with Kreos/Pontifax to acquire their outstanding debt of around EUR 2.1 million for approximately EUR 1.6 million by entering into a binding agreement to purchase the debt along with assignment of the claim and related pledge  rights  interests  and security of Kreos/Pontifax  which shall be transferred to Atlas when Kreos/Pontifax is repaid  which is expected to occur on January 1  2024  and until then  Kreos/Pontifax has agreed not to enforce their security interest. This repayment from Atlas to Kreos/Pontifax will not be dilutive to the shareholders. A comparable second rank security package shall cover any future New Convertible Bonds' subscriptions. Oxurion shall immediately partly reimburse the debt transferred from Kreos/Pontifax to Atlas with its own financial means and funds provided via New Convertible Bonds  and reduce the debt and the related pledge to around EUR 0.5 million by mid-January 2024.The conversion of mandatory convertible bonds under the existing funding program will significantly dilute existing shareholders  and to limit the amount of the dilution  while at the same time avoiding bankruptcy  as described above  Atlas has formally committed to limit its conversions of convertible bonds as described above. Concerning the amount of the dilution from the shares converted for the convertible bonds  while it is difficult to predict  the attached Annex to this press release attempts to project the possible dilution at a hypothetical conversion price of EUR 0.000460 to EUR 0.000092. For instance  the conversion of the Working Capital costs of EUR 4 950 000  could  at a hypothetical conversion price of EUR 0.000460 to EUR 0.000092  lead to the issuance of 10 761 000 000 to 53 805 000 000 new shares (depending on the conversion price)  being a dilution of the voting rights of 75.51% to 93.91% and a financial dilution of 36.92% to 84.31% compared to the situation as of the date of this press release. Reference is made to the attached dilution table as Annex 1. In the event the total Working Capital costs would amount to the total remaining amount under the Atlas funding program  i.e. EUR 8.5 million  this could lead to the issuance of 18 479 000 000 to 92 392 000 000 new shares (depending on the conversion price)  being a dilution of the voting rights of 84.12% to 96.36% and a financial dilution of 41.12% to 86.51% compared to the situation as of the date of this press release. Were Atlas to convert all EUR 7.4m in convertible bonds that they currently hold  together with the entire EUR 8.5m remaining under the Atlas Funding Program  at the hypothetical conversion prices set out above  and maintain ownership of all shares issued upon conversion  which is not its intent  this would result in Atlas holding more than 90% of Oxurion’s shares. However  given that Atlas intends to sell its shares issued upon conversion  it is highly unlikely that it would cross the threshold of 30% of the voting rights of Oxurion.In view of the extent of the dilution  any prospect of recovery for existing shareholders as far as share value is concerned is remote.At the same time  Oxurion is in the process of negotiating a debt restructuring plan with Oxurion’s larger creditors  which seeks their agreement to a significant reduction of their debt  combined with potential conversion to equity  payment delays and maturity extensions. The Company’s current debts amount to approximately EUR 15 million. The Company’s largest creditors are Atlas  Kreos/Pontifax and Syneos Healthcare. It is uncertain whether the Debt Restructuring will be successful  but were that to be the case  it is expected that the repayments will be financed by the Company issuing additional New Convertible Bonds to Atlas and potential debt for equity swaps (the “Debt Repayment”). While the amount of the Debt Repayment is being negotiated  the total amount of the New Convertible Bonds to be issued for the Working Capital Costs  LOI Costs  plus the Debt Repayments  shall not exceed the remaining funding available under the Atlas funding program as of the date of the LOI  which is EUR 8.5 million. Reference is made to the dilution table in Annex 1.Based on the foregoing  the Board has determined that the bankruptcy conditions are not met and the Company therefore will not file for bankruptcy as long that continues to be the case.About OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is engaged in developing next-generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies for the treatment of retinal disease.

This repayment from Atlas to Kreos/Pontifax will not be dilutive to the shareholders. A comparable second rank security package shall cover any future New Convertible Bonds' subscriptions. Oxurion shall immediately partly reimburse the debt transferred from Kreos/Pontifax to Atlas with its own financial means and funds provided via New Convertible Bonds  and reduce the debt and the related pledge to around EUR 0.5 million by mid-January 2024.The conversion of mandatory convertible bonds under the existing funding program will significantly dilute existing shareholders  and to limit the amount of the dilution  while at the same time avoiding bankruptcy  as described above  Atlas has formally committed to limit its conversions of convertible bonds as described above. Concerning the amount of the dilution from the shares converted for the convertible bonds  while it is difficult to predict  the attached Annex to this press release attempts to project the possible dilution at a hypothetical conversion price of EUR 0.000460 to EUR 0.000092. For instance  the conversion of the Working Capital costs of EUR 4 950 000  could  at a hypothetical conversion price of EUR 0.000460 to EUR 0.000092  lead to the issuance of 10 761 000 000 to 53 805 000 000 new shares (depending on the conversion price)  being a dilution of the voting rights of 75.51% to 93.91% and a financial dilution of 36.92% to 84.31% compared to the situation as of the date of this press release. Reference is made to the attached dilution table as Annex 1. In the event the total Working Capital costs would amount to the total remaining amount under the Atlas funding program  i.e. EUR 8.5 million  this could lead to the issuance of 18 479 000 000 to 92 392 000 000 new shares (depending on the conversion price)  being a dilution of the voting rights of 84.12% to 96.36% and a financial dilution of 41.12% to 86.51% compared to the situation as of the date of this press release. Were Atlas to convert all EUR 7.4m in convertible bonds that they currently hold  together with the entire EUR 8.5m remaining under the Atlas Funding Program  at the hypothetical conversion prices set out above  and maintain ownership of all shares issued upon conversion  which is not its intent  this would result in Atlas holding more than 90% of Oxurion’s shares. However  given that Atlas intends to sell its shares issued upon conversion  it is highly unlikely that it would cross the threshold of 30% of the voting rights of Oxurion.In view of the extent of the dilution  any prospect of recovery for existing shareholders as far as share value is concerned is remote.At the same time  Oxurion is in the process of negotiating a debt restructuring plan with Oxurion’s larger creditors  which seeks their agreement to a significant reduction of their debt  combined with potential conversion to equity  payment delays and maturity extensions. The Company’s current debts amount to approximately EUR 15 million. The Company’s largest creditors are Atlas  Kreos/Pontifax and Syneos Healthcare. It is uncertain whether the Debt Restructuring will be successful  but were that to be the case  it is expected that the repayments will be financed by the Company issuing additional New Convertible Bonds to Atlas and potential debt for equity swaps (the “Debt Repayment”). While the amount of the Debt Repayment is being negotiated  the total amount of the New Convertible Bonds to be issued for the Working Capital Costs  LOI Costs  plus the Debt Repayments  shall not exceed the remaining funding available under the Atlas funding program as of the date of the LOI  which is EUR 8.5 million. Reference is made to the dilution table in Annex 1.Based on the foregoing  the Board has determined that the bankruptcy conditions are not met and the Company therefore will not file for bankruptcy as long that continues to be the case.About OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is engaged in developing next-generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies for the treatment of retinal disease.
