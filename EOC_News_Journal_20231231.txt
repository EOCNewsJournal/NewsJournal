The Dutch chip companies achieved strong results despite the weak conditions in the chip market.,The microchip companies Besi and ASMI were the big winners on the Amsterdam stock market during the 2023 calendar year. The Dutch chip companies achieved strong results despite the weak conditions in the chip market.The sector also benefited from the optimism surrounding the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI applications  like the popular chatbot ChatGPT  will require more investment in high-quality chips.Besi increased in value by no less than 150 percent this year  making it by far the strongest gainer of the 25 largest tradable companies on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. The companies make up the AEX Index. ASMI followed Besi with an increase of 100 percent this year. Besi and ASMI both managed to reach new record heights this year.Philips was finally able to recover somewhat from the price losses of the last few years  and increased its share value by 50 percent in 2023. The healthcare technology company saw more than half of its value evaporate in 2022 due to problems with its ventilators and sleep apnea machines  making it the worst-performing stock in the AEX that year. In 2021  when the issues came to light  Philips had already lost almost a third of its value.Philips had to recall about 5.5 million sleep apnea devices because the foam used to dampen sound in the devices can crumble. Philips set aside 1 billion euros to recall the devices  which is separate from the legal costs of claims filed by patients. CEO Roy Jakobs explained this year that Philips will probably be working on the issue for another seven years.ASML  the biggest publicly traded company in the Netherlands  also had a promising 36 percent increase. The chip machine manufacturer remained at the center of geopolitical tensions between China and the United States this year. The Americans do not want advanced chip technology to be exported to China to prevent the Chinese from using the chips for military purposes. ASML is  therefore  not allowed to sell its new machines to China.Adyen was one of the biggest losers of the year in the AEX  falling by 9 percent. After disappointing results  the payment company's stock value was under enormous pressure last summer. However  the company restored confidence with an investor day in November  and a large part of the previous significant share value losses were reversed.Other losers in the AEX were insurer NN Group and food consortium Unilever  which both saw decreases of 8 percent.,positive,0.56,0.42,0.01,negative,0.03,0.21,0.76,True,English,"['big winners', 'stock market', 'Besi', 'ASMI', 'previous significant share value losses', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', 'biggest publicly traded company', '5.5 million sleep apnea devices', 'The Dutch chip companies', 'sleep apnea machines', 'popular chatbot ChatGPT', 'CEO Roy Jakobs', 'chip machine manufacturer', 'advanced chip technology', 'insurer NN Group', 'Amsterdam stock market', '25 largest tradable companies', 'new record heights', 'healthcare technology company', 'promising 36 percent increase', 'chip market', 'price losses', 'The Americans', 'new machines', 'biggest losers', 'performing stock', 'stock value', 'microchip companies', 'payment company', 'big winners', 'strong results', 'weak conditions', 'artificial intelligence', 'strongest gainer', '1 billion euros', 'legal costs', 'geopolitical tensions', 'United States', 'military purposes', 'disappointing results', 'enormous pressure', 'investor day', 'large part', 'Other losers', 'food consortium', '2023 calendar year', 'AI applications', 'high-quality chips', 'seven years', 'AEX Index', '150 percent', '100 percent', '9 percent', '8 percent', 'Besi', 'ASMI', 'sector', 'optimism', 'rise', 'investment', 'less', 'Philips', 'last', 'half', 'problems', 'ventilators', 'issues', 'light', 'third', 'foam', 'sound', 'claims', 'patients', 'ASML', 'Netherlands', 'center', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Adyen', 'confidence', 'November', 'Unilever', 'decreases']",2023-12-31,2023-12-31,nltimes.nl

March wheat on Paris-based Euronext was up 0.9% at 223.75 euros ($247.33) a metric ton by 1308 GMT.,PARIS: Euronext wheat edged up on Friday but was set for a sharp decline over the year after stiff export competition from the Black Sea region eased worries about war disruption to the grain trade. March wheat on Paris-based Euronext was up 0.9% at 223.75 euros ($247.33) a metric ton by 1308 GMT.The front-month position was consolidating after falling to 220.50 euros twice in the past week  a level not previously seen for the contract since December 2021.Over 2023  front-month prices are down nearly 28%  breaking a run of gains in the past three years. Supply fears due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  which propelled prices to record highs in 2022  have subsided this year as Russia maintained large exports while Ukraine established a new shipping channel to replace a UN-backed arrangement that Moscow withdrew from in July.A rally in the euro to a five-month high against the dollar this week has continued to curb the export competitiveness of European Union supplies.Egypt on Thursday cancelled an import tender following offers in which Black Sea origins remained cheaper than French supplies despite Russia’s apparent enforcement of an export price floor.“Russian traders were not troubled seriously by the Russian export price floor in Egypt’s tender  holding a price lead over most rivals except Ukraine  and with private sales offers of Russian wheat still way below levels seen in international tenders ” a German trader said. Expanding trade through Ukraine’s Black Sea corridor was adding to Black Sea competition  despite wartime risks illustrated by damage to a vessel that hit a mine this week.Ukraine in December has exported by sea its biggest monthly volumes of wheat and corn since March  LSEG shipping data showed  and traders said traffic increasingly included large vessels bound for Asia. “Wheat is being much more actively traded in Ukrainian seaports  especially feed wheat  and this is a factor the EU market will have to deal with more in the new year ” the trader said.Morocco  which has become the biggest export destination for EU wheat as Russia increased sales to Algeria  remains the focus for new EU sales for the rest of the season  traders said. Shipments to China were supporting French wheat exports  with LSEG and other shipping data showing seven vessels have departed this month with another three due to load.Deferred positions on Euronext have held up better this year  supported by early concerns about next year’s harvest following rain-hit planting in western Europe.
