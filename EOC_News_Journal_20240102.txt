34489,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/589874-russian-assets-frozen-west/,Frozen fortune: Where is Russia’s $300 billion?,Moscow has warned of a tit-for-tat response to the seizure of the country’s central bank assets by the West Read Full Article at RT.com,The sovereign funds have been seized by the West as part of Ukraine-related sanctionsNearly $300 billion worth of Russian forex reserves have been frozen by Western countries since March 2022. The EU has been looking into ways to legalize tapping profits from those funds  but Moscow has warned that any such move would constitute theft.Russian officials have repeatedly said the confiscation of state and private assets goes against all the principles of free markets. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has warned of “an absolutely symmetrical response ” noting that there are “sufficient assets” in ‘C-type’ accounts  specialized ruble-denominated bank accounts. Some of these include dividend reserve liabilities to counterparties from ‘unfriendly’ countries (those that support sanctions). Siluanov added that all of those assets are frozen  “the amount isn’t small ” and the proceeds from their use are significant.The finance minister was echoed by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov  who stated Russia would challenge any confiscation in the courts. The seizure of Russian assets by Western countries would be “illegal” and “extremely dangerous” for the global financial system and the world economy  he continued  adding that any such a move would amount to theft. “If something is confiscated from us  we will look at what we will confiscate. We will do this immediately ” the Kremlin spokesman warned.According to official estimates  the Russian central bank’s reserves decreased by 8.4% in 2022 after the assets were immobilized in G7 countries  the EU  and Australia. Notably  €210 billion ($232 billion) of Russia’s reserves are reportedly held in the EU. There is believed to be €191 billion in Belgium  €19 billion in France  and €7.8 billion in non-member Switzerland. The US has reportedly frozen around $5 billion of Russian state assets. The EU aims to mobilize €15 billion for Ukraine from the proceeds generated by frozen Russian assets  contingent on unanimous approval from all member states.In July  a major EU clearing house  Belgium-based Euroclear  revealed that of the €2.28 billion it earned in the first half of 2023  it accrued more than €1.7 billion in profit from frozen Russian assets. It’s estimated that Euroclear holds €196.6 billion worth of Russian funds  the vast majority of which is owned by the Bank of Russia. On top of that  around 5 million private Russian investors saw their assets blocked in the accounts of international financial institutions. The value of frozen securities in private investors’ portfolios amounted to $3.4 billion as of July last year.Western states have been mulling for months on how these funds could be confiscated and donated to Kiev  despite numerous warnings that such measures could jeopardize the credibility of the Western financial system and currencies. EU policymakers have been discussing the imposition of a windfall tax on profits generated from the immobilized funds  which are estimated to create some €3 billion in profits. According to Reuters  citing sources  the leaders of the G7 are expected to discuss a plan that would enable the seizure of frozen Russian assets when they meet in February.Meanwhile  some EU member states have been against the idea of using frozen Russian funds. France  Germany  and Italy remain “extremely cautious” about the idea  and some EU officials “fear possible retaliation” from Moscow if its money is seized  according to a recent report by the Financial Times. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also warned against the measure  insisting that using the funds could jeopardize the euro’s reputation.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.06,0.77,0.17,negative,0.02,0.29,0.69,True,English,"['Frozen fortune', 'Russia', 'major EU clearing house', 'specialized ruble-denominated bank accounts', '5 million private Russian investors', 'The European Central Bank', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'private investors’ portfolios', 'Russian central bank', 'dividend reserve liabilities', 'global financial system', 'international financial institutions', 'Western financial system', 'Russian forex reserves', 'frozen Russian assets', 'EU member states', 'frozen Russian funds', 'Russian state assets', 'private assets', 'Financial Times', 'Russian officials', 'Western states', 'C-type’ accounts', 'member Switzerland', 'The US', 'Western countries', '$300 billion worth', 'free markets', 'symmetrical response', 'unfriendly’ countries', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'official estimates', 'unanimous approval', 'first half', '€196.6 billion worth', 'vast majority', 'numerous warnings', 'windfall tax', 'possible retaliation', 'recent report', 'business section', 'sufficient assets', 'EU policymakers', 'EU officials', 'sovereign funds', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'world economy', 'G7 countries', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'part', 'March', 'ways', 'profits', 'Moscow', 'move', 'theft', 'confiscation', 'principles', 'amount', 'proceeds', 'courts', 'seizure', 'something', 'Australia', 'France', 'July', 'top', 'value', 'securities', 'year', 'months', 'Kiev', 'measures', 'credibility', 'currencies', 'imposition', 'Reuters', 'sources', 'leaders', 'plan', 'February', 'idea', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'money', 'ECB', 'reputation', 'stories']",2024-01-01,2024-01-02,rt.com
