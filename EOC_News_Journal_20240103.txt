34505,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.intellinews.com/bruegel-the-european-union-should-do-better-than-confiscate-russia-s-reserve-money-306134/,BRUEGEL: The European Union should do better than confiscate Russia’s reserve money,What to do with Russia’s foreign reserves  immobilised since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine  is primarily a matter of debate for the,What to do with Russia’s foreign reserves  immobilised since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine  is primarily a matter of debate for the European Union  where most of these reserves are held.The EU should keep giving Ukraine the financial support it needs for its defence and other government expenditure but  in the present circumstances  should not confiscate Russia’s reserve assets to finance its support to Ukraine  given the EU’s commitment to a rules-based international financial order. It could  however  offset some of the financial burden by appropriating the extraordinary income made on Russia’s cash balances by central security depositories such as Euroclear. The EU has a robust enough case that such income does not belong to Russia.At least €206bn of Russian reserve assets is held in the EU  representing more than three-quarters of a total estimated by the G7 Finance Ministers at $280bn (about €265bn)  which was immobilised in late February 2022. Of this  €180bn is held at Brussels-based Euroclear  plus possibly a few billion at Clearstream  its Luxembourg-based competitor.By contrast  Russian reserves immobilised in the United States  the amount of which has not been disclosed  are unlikely to exceed single-digit billion dollars  and those in Australia (which are included in the G7 tally) and Canada are probably even less. That would leave the remainder  perhaps €40bn to €50bn  in Japan  the United Kingdom and EU countries other than Belgium. Other countries including Switzerland and Singapore have immobilised their Russian reserves  but these are not counted in the G7 total.A European decisionThe collective decision to go ahead with immobilisation  taken shortly after the war started  was reportedly catalysed by Italy’s then-prime minister Mario Draghi. Similarly  the decisions on possible next steps  including the option to confiscate the immobilised reserves  will be made primarily by Europeans  because Europe is where the money is  even if decisions are co-ordinated within the G7.The debate about such next steps is plainly about resources for Ukraine  not those of Russia. This is because the immobilisation was successful  with no leakage back to Russia (and also a powerful deterrent for other jurisdictions that have reserve assets abroad and may be tempted to invade their neighbours). The G7 declaration states  credibly  that “Russia’s sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilised until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine.”Russia has ostensibly written off the immobilised assets  as illustrated by its cynical suggestion that the reserves should be contributed to the loss-and-damage fund discussed at the COP28 in Dubai. Moving from immobilisation to confiscation would not change the Putin regime’s financial equation  nor would it have any short-term impact on Russia’s economy. From that standpoint  there is no damage in prolonging the status quo. There is even value in keeping long-term options open.As for the Ukrainian government  its need for external finance has been covered in 2023  largely thanks to predictable and timely payments from the EU (in contrast to 2022  when the EU was shamefully late on delivering on its commitments).With Ukrainian GDP at about €200bn in 2021 before Russia’s full-scale invasion  it is improbable that such external financing needs should ever exceed annual amounts in the tens of billions  including capital expenditure for emergency repair of destroyed critical infrastructure. Given the invaluable contribution of Ukrainian defence to European security  for the EU to spend a few tens of percentage points of its own GDP (€16 trillion in 2022) on Kyiv's requirements is the ultimate policy no-brainer. Indeed  it is expected that the EU will confirm a large-scale support package early in 2024 .Against these realities  the reported eagerness of the US government to move from immobilisation to confiscation appears principally to reflect the Biden administration’s difficulty in securing congressional approval for US financial support to Ukraine. Facing US domestic deadlock  and given that its own vital interests at stake  the EU might usefully consider further increasing its own financial contribution to Ukraine’s defence. But that by no means implies that confiscation of the immobilised reserves has suddenly become a good idea.No good argumentThe argument against confiscation has not changed (eg Kirschenbaum and Véron  2022). As the EU is not at war with Russia  confiscation would be widely viewed as unlawful  or theft  in much of the world outside the G7  undermining the hitherto credible European claim to stand for the international rules-based order. Only a broad-based international court would have uncontested authority to deprive Russia of ownership of its reserves  and no corresponding judicial mechanism is available for that at present. Even though there are dissenting opinions among legal scholars (for example  Moiseienko  2023; Summers et al  2023; Tribe et al  2023) and grey zones abound in international law  the chances are that confiscation would breach international and EU principles on sovereign immunity and on the proportionate and reversible nature of countermeasures (of course  analysis on whether confiscation would be legal under US law  such as that by Tribe et al (2023) is mostly irrelevant to EU debate).Confiscation now would set a problematic precedent and incentivise global financial fragmentation. Trust in international monetary arrangements would be undermined to a considerably greater extent by confiscation than by the inherently reversible immobilisation  for which precedents exist. That would disincentivise several central banks from holding their reserve assets in euros. It would also deprive the EU of potential future leverage in some scenarios of negotiations to come  even though no such scenario is probable as long as Vladimir Putin remains in power. Furthermore  it could expose EU countries that perpetrated misdeeds in the past to more pressure from their own claimants. In short  the EU would lose stature and damage global public goods it otherwise cherishes  for the sake of gaining an amount of money that it can do without.Windfall incomeBy contrast  the EU’s idea of using the windfall income made by central security depositories (CSDs) on Russian cash blocked on their balance sheet does not entail similar downsides  because of specific contractual arrangements between European CSDs and their account holders  including the Bank of Russia. It is unclear if similar arrangements exist in other jurisdictions where Russian reserves are immobilised.These conditions make it explicit that the CSD does not remunerate cash balances  and therefore that the interest income it makes on them (eg by depositing them at a euro-area central bank) does not belong to the account holder. Normal account holders are incentivised not to keep any unremunerated cash balances at CSDs but  because the EU sanctions prevent the Bank of Russia from taking its money out  cash has accumulated as its securities held at Euroclear have come to maturity (Figure 1).The proposition that Russia has no claim on the CSDs’ income appears solid enough for action that does not violate international and EU law to be taken in the near term  even though it is likely to be tested in court  including outside the G7. Appropriating the CSDs’ windfall income and making it available to Ukraine would multiply the impact of the announcement already made by Belgium that it would earmark the corporate tax revenue it collects on Euroclear’s windfall income for support to Ukraine. The amount of several billion euros of annual income (at current rates) is not enough to meet all of Ukraine’s needs  but it is not negligible either. Its future size will of course depend on rate decisions made by the European Central Bank  and therefore cannot be predicted with certainty.In sum  the EU must keep giving Ukraine the money it needs to defend itself. Confiscating Russia’s reserves to do so would be a show of weakness in the present contest of willpower. The EU can afford to resist the temptation and keep to its current high ground.,negative,0.18,0.38,0.44,mixed,0.1,0.25,0.65,True,English,"['The European Union', 'reserve money', 'BRUEGEL', 'Russia', 'rules-based international financial order', 'international rules-based order', 'robust enough case', 'single-digit billion dollars', 'broad-based international court', 'corresponding judicial mechanism', 'US domestic deadlock', 'central security depositories', 'external financing needs', 'credible European claim', 'large-scale support package', 'A European decision', 'possible next steps', 'G7 Finance Ministers', 'The G7 declaration', 'US financial support', 'other government expenditure', 'Russian reserve assets', 'external finance', 'European security', 'US government', 'international law', 'European Union', 'financial burden', 'collective decision', 'financial equation', 'capital expenditure', 'financial contribution', 'Other countries', 'Ukrainian government', 'G7 tally', 'full-scale invasion', 'cash balances', 'late February', 'Luxembourg-based competitor', 'United States', 'United Kingdom', 'prime minister', 'Mario Draghi', 'powerful deterrent', 'sovereign assets', 'cynical suggestion', 'Putin regime', 'short-term impact', 'status quo', 'long-term options', 'timely payments', 'annual amounts', 'emergency repair', 'critical infrastructure', 'invaluable contribution', 'ultimate policy', 'Biden administration', 'congressional approval', 'vital interests', 'good idea', 'Véron', 'uncontested authority', 'dissenting opinions', 'legal scholars', 'grey zones', 'other jurisdictions', 'Russian reserves', 'G7 total', 'The EU', 'present circumstances', 'extraordinary income', 'Brussels-based Euroclear', 'Ukrainian GDP', 'good argument', 'foreign reserves', 'damage fund', 'Ukrainian defence', 'EU countries', 'G7.', 'Ukraine', 'matter', 'debate', 'commitment', 'three-quarters', 'Clearstream', 'contrast', 'Australia', 'Canada', 'remainder', 'Japan', 'Belgium', 'Switzerland', 'Singapore', 'immobilisation', 'war', 'Italy', 'decisions', 'Europeans', 'money', 'resources', 'leakage', 'neighbours', 'loss', 'COP28', 'Dubai', 'confiscation', 'economy', 'standpoint', 'value', 'predictable', 'tens', 'billions', 'percentage', 'points', 'Kyiv', 'requirements', 'brainer', 'realities', 'eagerness', 'difficulty', 'stake', 'means', 'Kirschenbaum', 'world', 'ownership', 'example', 'Moiseienko', 'Summers', 'Tribe', 'chanc']",2024-01-03,2024-01-03,intellinews.com

Shares of CNH are now solely listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).“The single listing on the NYSE is the latest step in our ongoing simplification journey  which accelerated in 2022 as we became an agriculture and construction equipment pureplay ” said Scott W. Wine  Chief Executive Officer. “Considering this delisting and other initiatives enacted over the past two years  CNH is fundamentally a different company: more customer focused  more efficient  and more profitable. With this renewed foundation  we are enthusiastic about our future.”As announced on February 2  2023  CNH’s decision to delist was taken following a careful review of the relative trading volumes on the two exchanges as well as the costs and administrative resources required to maintain the listing on Euronext Milan. The majority of CNH stock trading has progressively shifted to the NYSE  indicating that the Company’s business profile and investor base fit better with a single US listing.

(NYSE: CNHI) announces that it has completed the voluntary delisting of its shares from Euronext Milan. Shares of CNH are now solely listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).“The single listing on the NYSE is the latest step in our ongoing simplification journey  which accelerated in 2022 as we became an agriculture and construction equipment pureplay ” said Scott W. Wine  Chief Executive Officer. “Considering this delisting and other initiatives enacted over the past two years  CNH is fundamentally a different company: more customer focused  more efficient  and more profitable. With this renewed foundation  we are enthusiastic about our future.”As announced on February 2  2023  CNH’s decision to delist was taken following a careful review of the relative trading volumes on the two exchanges as well as the costs and administrative resources required to maintain the listing on Euronext Milan. The majority of CNH stock trading has progressively shifted to the NYSE  indicating that the Company’s business profile and investor base fit better with a single US listing. Concentrating trading in one market should allow for increased liquidity and investor focus  while further simplifying the company profile and compliance requirements.CNH’s Board of Directors and its Senior Leadership Team are grateful to Euronext Milan for having been our secondary listing venue for more than 10 years and are excited about the Company’s continued presence on the NYSE.Goldman Sachs & Co.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate. VGP operates a fully integrated business model with capabilities and longstanding expertise across the value chain.

A key part of these innovations will be how retail orders are executed in Europe  as a consolidated tape becomes a benchmark for retail investors for best execution. We expect to see innovation in dark trading  which has not had a shake-up for a while  as AI is embedded into order matching algorithms  resulting in better execution outcomes.If the current low-volume environment in Europe continues  tied to GDP and economic growth  we will see renewed effort from policy makers to address some of the structural problems in Europe. They will need to take the Capital Markets Union more seriously and remove the frictional cost of trading between countries. As the focus of regulation shifts from Brexit to competing and reducing fragmentation  we will see more constructive regulatory dialogue between the UK and EU  based on the recently signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on cooperation in financial regulation.Niels Brab  chief regulatory officer  Deutsche Börse GroupWith a new EU legislative period on the horizon  a decisive year lies ahead that will be full of opportunities to advance on key challenges. In light of geopolitical realities  sluggish economic growth  and constraint public finances  it will be particularly critical for the EU to ensure a new vision in regard to the Capital Markets Union. Despite decades of efforts  the EU’s capital markets remain underdeveloped  and their size does not correspond to the magnitude of the EU’s economy.A new vision should be paired with a profound reflection around the open strategic autonomy. We should learn from best practices and centrally embed them into our thinking. Establish an EU equity fund  revitalise our securitisation markets  boost our primary markets and IPO ecosystem  address fragmentation  tackle incentivisation elements like taxation – and ensure that citizens truly endorse our markets by guaranteeing a better participation.Michael Robertson  head of UK consulting  Delta CapitaIn 2024  the global capital markets landscape looks set for further transformational change. Against the backdrop of an uncertain macro-economic climate  we expect market disruption through convergent regulatory scrutiny  technology advancement and an ongoing focus on sustainability. Markets will be shaped by the impacts of a shortened settlement cycle. Whilst initial focus will be on T+1 in the US  governing authorities must weigh up the cost-benefit of an accelerated cycle whilst maintaining a stable  efficient  and competitive European capital market.Technology advancement continues at a pace. Decentralised finance (DeFi) and tokenisation represent a paradigm shift in financial services and there is widespread expectation that AI will bring improved capital efficiency and risk management. Regulation must establish a framework that encourages innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. Cyber security will remain a top priority to ensure the industry has defence mechanisms to safeguard sensitive data. ESG considerations will play an increasingly pivotal role.
