Upon FDA approval  healthcare professionals will be able to submit claims for the alfapump system  paving the way for broader adoption and supporting our commercial roll-out in the US.”Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical  added: “Today's announcement marks another important milestone in our US commercial strategy for the alfapump and follows the recent submission of our PMA application. We are stepping up preparations for the US commercial launch of this breakthrough therapy for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhoisis  a significant patient population that is growing at 6-7% annually due to NASH / MASHii. We believe that the alfapump will transform the treatment options for these patients  virtually eliminating the need for needle paracentesis  improving quality of life and delivering benefits to payors and healthcare systems.”Six new CPT III codes for the alfa pump systemIn the US  CPT codes are used by public and private health insurance programs and offer doctors and health care professionals a method to identify medical services and procedures for reimbursement. Category III CPT codes are temporary codes assigned to new and developing technologies  procedures and services. The six CPT III reimbursement codes will be available for use by healthcare professionals and payors as of July 1st  2024 for procedures related to the alfapump system  including implantation  revision  removal and programming of the pump system  replacement of the pump and the cathetersiii.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579About alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosisRecurrent or refractory ascites is a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period. If approved by the FDA  the alfapump could become the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination.The PMA application was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and was based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada with a total of 69 patients implanted with the alfapump. The primary effectiveness endpoints at six months post-implantation in the Pivotal Cohortiv exceeded the predefined thresholds with statistical significance  and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectationsv. Data at 12 months post-implantation continued to show a strong and durable clinical profile  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis and delivering a clinically meaningful improvement in patients’ quality of lifevi.Data from the patient preference study and a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELDvii registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures and that the safety profile of the alfapump is comparable to standard of care.The North American market of recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is forecast to grow 6-7% per year  from 78 000 patients in 2025  reaching a market opportunity for alfapump of over $2.5 billion by 2035  with NASH being the major driver of growthviii. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company submitted a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application to the US FDA in December 2023 having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis.Results of the Company’s RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR’s mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a DSR clinical study is ongoing  seeking to confirm the strong efficacy seen in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort have been successfully treated and the randomized cohort of up to a further 30 patients will start following DSMB approval  planned for Q1 2024.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Opening of a due diligence phase with Airbus for a potential sale of the entire BDS perimeter.Discussions with banks to maintain financing and obtain refinancings. Risk factor: should the outcome of these discussions prove uncertain  Atos does not rule out the use of available legal protection mechanisms to frame these discussions.During the first quarter of 2024  Atos will assess whether these measures are sufficient to cover financing maturities and cash requirements on a long-term basis.Reduction in the planned size of Eviden's capital increase  as a result of changing market conditions and reactions.Changes to the Group’s Board of Directors with the appointment of Françoise Mercadal-Delasales and Jean-Jacques Morin strengthening its skills in the strategic areas of finance and major transformation projects.Paris  France - January 3  2024 - Atos provides a Market Update today to inform its stakeholders of development in the ongoing business transformation and corresponding workstreams.The priority of the company’s management and Board of Directors is to pursue Atos’ corporate interests  and to preserve the interests of its stakeholders. To achieve these priorities  and in view of the company’s financial constraints  the Group is adjusting its strategy in order to:maintain an attractive business mix for employees  customers  creditors and shareholders  while ensuring the repayment and refinancing of its financial debts : the €1.5 billion term loan A  maturing in January 2025  subject to two extensions of 6 months each  available to Atos under standard conditions (notably no event of default and payment of an extension fee). The first 6-month extension will take effect on January 29  2024  €500 million bonds maturing in November 2024  €750 million bonds maturing in May 2025  €900 million revolving credit facility maturing in November 2025  €350 million bonds maturing in November 2028  and €800 million bonds maturing in November 2029.The company intends to cover its financial debt maturities by taking into account available cash at the end of 2023  the amount of which includes specific working capital actions  which due to their nature are not permanent and cannot be taken into account in addressing the reduction of debt.As indicated in the press release of November 28  2023  the company will need to take the following actions  either individually or in combination  in order to meet these financing maturities:obtain new bank financing access capital markets (debt and/or equity) implement a major asset disposal program  andcontinue specific actions to optimize its working capital  particularly at half-year and annual closings  including continued factoring.Sale of Tech FoundationsThe company confirms that exclusive negotiations with EPEI on the sale of Tech Foundations are continuing. Discussions continue around the price to be paid  the structure of the transaction and the transfer of a very large proportion of Tech Foundations liabilities. As with any negotiation  there is no certainty that these negotiations will result in an agreement.Regarding the planned capital increase for Eviden  changing market conditions and reactions require a reduction in its initially planned size. In addition  the company is examining with EPEI the legal and financial conditions under which EPEI could be released  in whole or in part  from its commitment to participate in the capital increase.Bank financingWith the view to avoid uncertainties about its long-term outlook  that is tied to the ongoing negotiations  the company will  in parallel to the additional asset disposal program described below  enter into discussions with the Group’s banks  taking into account the various scenarios currently under consideration  the implementation of which will require the commitment of these banks to maintain financings and provide refinancings.The objective is also to avoid a potential downgrade of the Group’s credit rating.Implementation of an additional asset disposal programAs there is no certainty whether an agreement with EPEI will be reached for the sale of Tech Foundations  and given the envisaged reduction in Eviden’s capital increase  the company is considering the disposal of other assets  well in excess of the €400 million mentioned in the press release of July 28  2023  in order to meet its financing maturities.The company’s management and the Board of Directors consider that among the various potential divestments  the sale of BDS would be a key factor  and would maintain the strategic interest of the remaining activities.In this respect  the company has received two letters indicating non-binding interest in its BDS business  one of which relates only to part of BDS’s perimeter. The company will open a due diligence phase with Airbus  whose indicative offer of an enterprise value of €1.5 to €1.8 billion relates to the entire BDS perimeter. Discussions with Airbus are currently at a preliminary stage and will progress  and the company will update the market on their outcome in due course.Furthermore  the company does not rule out the sale of additional assets  particularly if the transaction with EPEI does not go ahead.Risk factorsIn all these scenarios  the company’s management and the Board of Directors will endeavor to manage the significant risks involved. If necessary  should the outcome of discussions with all its banks prove uncertain  the company does not rule out the use of available legal protection mechanisms to frame discussions with its creditors. The options available to Atos should be assessed during the first quarter of 2024 to confirm that they will be sufficient to cover the Group's financing maturities and cash requirements on a long-term basis.Governance changes in the composition of the Board of DirectorsValérie Bernis  Aminata Niane  Vernon Sankey and René Proglio decided to resign from the Board of Directors.The Board of Directors has appointed Françoise Mercadal-Delasalles and Jean-Jacques Morin to replace them.

Opening of a due diligence phase with Airbus for a potential sale of the entire BDS perimeter.Discussions with banks to maintain financing and obtain refinancings. Risk factor: should the outcome of these discussions prove uncertain  Atos does not rule out the use of available legal protection mechanisms to frame these discussions.During the first quarter of 2024  Atos will assess whether these measures are sufficient to cover financing maturities and cash requirements on a long-term basis.Reduction in the planned size of Eviden's capital increase  as a result of changing market conditions and reactions.Changes to the Group's Board of Directors with the appointment of Françoise Mercadal-Delasales and Jean-Jacques Morin strengthening its skills in the strategic areas of finance and major transformation projects.Atos provides a Market Update today to inform its stakeholders of development in the ongoing business transformation and corresponding workstreams.The priority of the company's management and Board of Directors is to pursue Atos' corporate interests  and to preserve the interests of its stakeholders. To achieve these priorities  and in view of the company's financial constraints  the Group is adjusting its strategy in order to:maintain an attractive business mix for employees  customers  creditors and shareholders while ensuring the repayment and refinancing of its financial debts : the €1.5 billion term loan A  maturing in January 2025  subject to two extensions of 6 months each  available to Atos under standard conditions (notably no event of default and payment of an extension fee). The first 6-month extension will take effect on January 29  2024  €500 million bonds maturing in November 2024  €750 million bonds maturing in May 2025  €900 million revolving credit facility maturing in November 2025  €350 million bonds maturing in November 2028  and €800 million bonds maturing in November 2029.:The company intends to cover its financial debt maturities by taking into account available cash at the end of 2023  the amount of which includes specific working capital actions  which due to their nature are not permanent and cannot be taken into account in addressing the reduction of debt.As indicated in the press release of November 28  2023  the company will need to take the following actions  either individually or in combination  in order to meet these financing maturities:obtain new bank financing access capital markets (debt and/or equity) implement a major asset disposal program  andcontinue specific actions to optimize its working capital  particularly at half-year and annual closings  including continued factoring.Sale of Tech FoundationsThe company confirms that exclusive negotiations with EPEI on the sale of Tech Foundations are continuing. Discussions continue around the price to be paid  the structure of the transaction and the transfer of a very large proportion of Tech Foundations liabilities. As with any negotiation  there is no certainty that these negotiations will result in an agreement.Regarding the planned capital increase for Eviden  changing market conditions and reactions require a reduction in its initially planned size. In addition  the company is examining with EPEI the legal and financial conditions under which EPEI could be released  in whole or in part  from its commitment to participate in the capital increase.Bank financingWith the view to avoid uncertainties about its long-term outlook  that is tied to the ongoing negotiations  the company will  in parallel to the additional asset disposal program described below  enter into discussions with the Group's banks  taking into account the various scenarios currently under consideration  the implementation of which will require the commitment of these banks to maintain financings and provide refinancings.The objective is also to avoid a potential downgrade of the Group's credit rating.Implementation of an additional asset disposal programAs there is no certainty whether an agreement with EPEI will be reached for the sale of Tech Foundations  and given the envisaged reduction in Eviden's capital increase  the company is considering the disposal of other assets  well in excess of the €400 million mentioned in the press release of July 28  2023  in order to meet its financing maturities.The company's management and the Board of Directors consider that among the various potential divestments  the sale of BDS would be a key factor  and would maintain the strategic interest of the remaining activities.In this respect  the company has received two letters indicating non-binding interest in its BDS business  one of which relates only to part of BDS's perimeter. The company will open a due diligence phase with Airbus  whose indicative offer of an enterprise value of €1.5 to €1.8 billion relates to the entire BDS perimeter. Discussions with Airbus are currently at a preliminary stage and will progress  and the company will update the market on their outcome in due course.Furthermore  the company does not rule out the sale of additional assets  particularly if the transaction with EPEI does not go ahead.Risk factorsIn all these scenarios  the company's management and the Board of Directors will endeavor to manage the significant risks involved. If necessary  should the outcome of discussions with all its banks prove uncertain  the company does not rule out the use of available legal protection mechanisms to frame discussions with its creditors. The options available to Atos should be assessed during the first quarter of 2024 to confirm that they will be sufficient to cover the Group's financing maturities and cash requirements on a long-term basis.Governance changes in the composition of the Board of DirectorsValérie Bernis  Aminata Niane  Vernon Sankey and René Proglio decided to resign from the Board of Directors.The Board of Directors has appointed Françoise Mercadal-Delasalles and Jean-Jacques Morin to replace them.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB.

In addition  the 18-metre buses will be equipped with four doors and a battery pack surpassing 500 kWh. Notably  each bus will be equipped with a pantograph  setting them apart from any other Ebusco 3.0 bus. The buses are scheduled to commence service in 2025 and will operate in the Potsdam area.Made to move millions of passengers per yearViP manages a fleet of 59 buses and transports over 30 million passengers annually. Stadtwerke Potsdam and ViP have committed to a gradual reduction of the 5 000 tons of CO2 emissions resulting from bus transportation  with the goal of achieving emission-free operation by 2031. To accomplish this goal  the first step has been taken by placing this order of 23 Ebusco 3.0 buses.Ebusco and ViP have together shaped an infrastructure based on pantograph charging. Therefore  this will be the first time Ebusco will apply a pantograph to the 3.0 model. Although this is a debut for the Ebusco 3.0 model  the pantograph itself is a well-known concept that has already been successfully implemented on many Ebusco 2.2 models for several years.Patrick Oosterveld  Sales Director of Ebusco comments: ""Ebusco has consistently played an important role in facilitating the initial adoption of electric buses. We are thrilled to continue contributing our wealth of knowledge and experience  playing a significant part in the successful implementation of electric buses. Through collaborative efforts with ViP  we've devised a solution that seamlessly enables their transition to an all-electric operation  and we eagerly anticipate the positive impact of this transition.""Bettina Biffi and Uwe Loeschmann  Managing Directors of Verkehrsbetrieb Potsdam  comments: ""This first order represents a significant step on our way to an emission-free fleet. The order for 23 electric buses is our targeted step towards continuing to offer environmentally friendly public transport in Potsdam and keeping up with the latest technological developments.
