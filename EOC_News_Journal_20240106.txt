Taking into account this exchange ratio  as a result of the reverse split  the number of outstanding shares will be divided by two thousand (2 000). The par value of the Spineway share will be increased in proportion to the exchange ratio  rising from 0.002 euros to 4 euros.The purpose of this reverse stock split is to reduce the volatility of Spineway’s share price  promote its stabilization and thus better reflect the Group’s development prospects.This reverse stock split has no impact on the amount of share capital. Only the par value of the share and  in turn  the number of shares in circulation will be modified.The consolidation is therefore a purely technical adjustment  with no direct impact on the total value of the Spineway shares held by each shareholder. The ticker (ALSPW) will be unchanged. However  the ISIN code of the new SPINEWAY shares (post-reverse split) will become FR001400N2P2.Reverse split methodsThe terms and conditions of the reverse split were approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting of January 4  2024 and are set out in the reverse split notice to be published in the Bulletin des Annonces Légales Obligatoires (BALO) on January 10  2024.The main terms are as follows:Basis of reverse split : exchange of two thousand (2 000) existing shares with a par value of 0.002 euro for one (1) new share with a par value of 4.00 euros.: exchange of two thousand (2 000) existing shares with a par value of 0.002 euro for one (1) new share with a par value of 4.00 euros. Number of shares subject to the reverse split: all the shares comprising the capital of Spineway  i.e. 154 696 229 shares with a par value of 0.002 euro each.all the shares comprising the capital of Spineway  i.e. 154 696 229 shares with a par value of 0.002 euro each. Number of shares post-reverse split : 77 348 new shares with a par value of 4.00 euros each.It should be noted that Stéphane Le Roux  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and a shareholder of the Company  has waived the right to consolidate the necessary number of existing shares with a par value of 0.002 euros each to obtain a whole number of shares as a result of the application of the aforementioned exchange ratio (i.e. 229 shares to date).It is also specified that the number of shares subject to and resulting from the reverse split will be increased  where applicable  by the shares issued following the exercise of the rights of the beneficiaries of any securities giving access to the Company’s capital  or by the shares that may be issued from the date of the reverse split notice. In this case  the definitive number of shares subject to the reverse split and the definitive number of shares to be issued as a result of the reverse split will be determined by the Board of Directors  with the option of sub-delegation  before the start of the reverse split  and will be published by the Company.Start date of the reverse split : January 25  2024: Closing date of the reverse split : February 26  2024: Effective date of the reverse split : February 27  2024Each shareholder will be automatically allocated  by his or her financial intermediary  one (1) new share for two thousand (2 000) existing shares held. Shareholders holding a number of shares multiple of two thousand (2 000) will therefore not need to take any action.Shareholders who do not hold a number of existing shares corresponding to a whole number of new shares must personally purchase or sell the fractional shares between January 25  2024 and February 26  2024 inclusive  in order to obtain a number of shares multiple of two thousand (2 000).After this period  the new shares which could not be allocated individually and corresponding to fractional rights will be sold on the stock market by the account holder within 30 days from February 27  2024  in accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 228-6-1 and R. 228-12 of the French Commercial Code and with market practice. The proceeds from the sale will be allocated in proportion to the fractional rights among the shareholders who were unable to obtain a number of shares in multiples of two thousand (2 000) during the reverse split period.At the end of the reverse split period  the existing shares not presented for the reverse split will be delisted and will lose their voting and dividend rights.Indicative reverse split timetableShare exchange period January 25  2024 Start of exchange operations February 26  2024 End of exchange operations Reverse split operations February 26  2024 Last listing of the existing shares on Euronext Growth (ISIN code: FR001400BVK2) February 27  2024 First listing of the new shares on Euronext Growth (ISIN code: FR001400N2P2) February 29  2024 Allocation of the new shares Management of fractional shares February 27  2024 Start of compensation of fractional shares by financial intermediaries March 28  2024 Deadline for the compensation of fractional shares by financial intermediariesNext events : January 25  2024 - 2023 revenueSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE PEA-PME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

Anaïs Dessales-Quentin  Novotel Brand Marketing Director Europe & North AfricaDream DestinationsWhen asked about the preferred destination for their next trip in 2024  it turns out the topic could cause some family debate. Kids would like to travel further afield to America and Australia next year  but parents would prefer to stay closer to home in the UK and Spain.For both kids and parents  who were surveyed independently of each other  destinations in Europe such as Spain and Greece are a popular holiday hotspots. Spain tops the parents’ list  (28%)  followed by the UK (26%) and Greece (19%). Kids’ top destinations included USA (34%)  followed by Spain (26%) and UK (14%).I make my world as a I like ItOnce the decision on the holiday destination has been made  it is all about defining the perfect stay for the full family. Nearly two thirds of the parents surveyed prefer to sleep comfortably in a hotel or a resort (60%). 10% would opt for an apartment  while just 8% of parents want to camp or stay with relatives and friends (5%). Here too  parents and children are surprisingly in agreement  with a good half (54%) of polled kids also opting for a hotel  and only 10% preferring an apartment.I pack my suitcase and take...British kids would prefer to travel to the seaside  visit a theme park or go on a city break. When it comes to parents  what makes an ideal holiday getaway is the proximity to the beach  a swimming pool  as well as connecting hotel rooms with enough space for the whole family. It is no surprise that kids would also like to enjoy play areas (38%) and children's clubs (13%) as part of their trip .Travel CompanionsWhen it comes to choosing their holiday companions  parents are at the top of the kids’ list (67%)  followed by their siblings (38%) and their best friends (35%). Grandma and grandpaare also welcome holiday buddies (16%). Ten percent would like to travel in a larger group and with other family friends  and 16% would like to bring their pets  the latter being possible in all Novotel hotels.Stress already in childhood?98% of the children aged 6-16 rated holidays as important. Surprisingly  37% of them cited the need to recover from the stress of school as a reason for taking a holiday. Nearly a quarter want to sleep in during their holiday and 19% want to find time for new and old hobbies. But there is also positive news: 80% of children see holidays as an opportunity to spend quality time with the family. The parents surveyed also see holidays as an ideal opportunity to spend time together (77%)  create memories (71%)  but also relax (58%) and forget their everyday worries (28%).Hearing that even children feel they need a break from the stress of school is a wake-up call. Our commitment to families is incredibly important and this is why we offer them preferential offers on hotel bookings  kid friendly spaces  child- friendly menus and even little surprises at check-in. Through Novotel's partnership with CALM - the world's leading mental health app  families can also access customised content like sleep stories or relaxation exercises to make their hotel stay as chilled as possible. This is another way to support families and children in enjoying much-needed relaxation and quality time when staying at our hotels  says Anaïs Dessales-Quentin.Favourite holiday activitiesAccording to the survey  kids also have a clear idea on how to fill their holidays. Visiting water and theme parks and joining water sports activities are very popular  34% want to make new friends and 19% want to spend time in children's clubs. 14% would prefer to bury their nose in a book. Food also goes down well with youngsters as well as adults: 43% of kids want to indulge in lots of delicious food  preferably with lots of ice cream  as 43% want to eat as much of it as possible. Culinary delights are even more important for parents with 51% of polled adults looking forward to tasting delicious food while on holiday.Holiday planning made easyFamilies who are already planning their holidays for 2024 can travel to over 300 Novotel hotelsacross Europe  from beach resorts to city hotels.

34698,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/who-is-bill-ackman-the-hedge-funder-who-used-corporate-raiding-tactics-to-push-out-harvards-president-4f548027,Who is Bill Ackman  the hedge-fund billionaire who used corporate-raider tactics to push out Harvard’s president?,The Harvard grad and donor used well-honed activist-investor moves to get what he wanted at the nation’s premier Ivy League school,Bill Ackman’s calls for the removal of Harvard University President Claudine Gay were ripped straight out of a corporate raider’s playbook.It was a natural approach for the billionaire hedge-fund manager who made his name as an aggressive activist investor. For decades  he amassed his fortune by investing in undervalued companies  demanding change and pursuing very public pressure campaigns — often moving to oust a company’s management or board of directors.But in the case of Harvard  Ackman used posts on X  the social-media platform formerly known as Twitter  rather than filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission  to make his case.Ackman’s bare-knuckles boardroom tactics in the Gay matter have attracted criticism. The NAACP accused him of racism for going after the first Black president of Americas’ oldest university. Others have charged that he rode an ideologically driven push from the political right against diversity  equity and inclusion measures in academia to get what he wanted.On Thursday  the Rev. Al Sharpton led a protest outside the offices of Ackman’s fund  Pershing Square Capital Management.Ackman has denied being driven by racism in his campaign against Gay  countering that efforts to bring more people of color into positions of power  part of the framework known as DEI  are themselves racist because  in his view  they discriminate against white people. Proponents of DEI initiatives say they boost underrepresented groups’ presence in the workplace  create a fairer playing field and foster greater belonging  in addition to being a smart business move.“DEI is racist because reverse racism is racism  even if it is against white people ” Ackman wrote in a lengthy X post following Gay’s resignation earlier this week. “Racism against white people has become considered acceptable by many not to be racism  or alternatively  it is deemed acceptable racism.”A spokesman for Ackman said his comments on X speak for themselves.The Elvis of investingAckman made his name through an aggressive approach to investments  building his firm into one of the highest-profile hedge funds in the country  with $18 billion in assets under management. His personal fortune is estimated to be around $4 billion  according to Forbes.His model has been to focus on a small handful of stock investments  take counterintuitive bets and then make a lot of noise  often putting himself at the center of attention. Among the investor class  he has developed a kind of cult of personality. His research on corporate situations can often be sharp and exhaustive  but sometimes his activist campaigns to shake up corporate boardrooms turn into circuses. He has been called the Elvis of investing.In some years  Ackman’s fund has outperformed  by huge numbers  many of its rivals and the stock market broadly — for example  making more than $2 billion in profit by shorting the market ahead of the pandemic. His investment in the real-estate investment trust General Growth Properties  in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis  turned into a $3.7 billion profit for his fund. His Pershing Square Holdings returned 26.7% net of fees in 2023  edging out the U.S. stock market  as gauged by the S&P 500 SPX.Hedge-fund managers like Ackman make money by collecting performance fees  usually 20% of the annual profits generated by investments made in the market. They often also have a significant amount of their own net worth invested in their funds.Ackman’s brash approach has rubbed many people the wrong way. A decade ago  he lost a fight over a high-profile $1 billion short position he took against the nutrition company Herbalife HLF  -3.98%   which he accused of operating as a pyramid scheme  bringing him head-to-head with famed corporate raider Carl Icahn. Ackman lost big money on Herbalife and disastrous activist positions in J.C. Penney and Valeant Pharmaceuticals .His hedge fund may have averted disaster by raising $2.7 billion of permanent investing capital in an initial public offering of Pershing Square Holdings NL:PSH PSHZF that Ackman conducted on the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange. When investors in Ackman’s hedge fund started pulling their money out amid the Herbalife  Valeant and J.C. Penney losses  Ackman knew the money he had raised in Amsterdam in 2014 was secure.It wasn’t the first time Ackman had to deal with a serious threat to his business. He shut his first hedge fund  Gotham Partners  in 2002  after making some bad bets on golf courses. He launched Pershing Square Capital Management two years later.Following the bruising Herbalife period  Ackman said he was taking a new  lower-key approach to investing  after which Pershing Square had some of its strongest years. His current portfolio includes shares in the likes of Google GOOG  -0.47% GOOGL  -0.48%   Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG  -0.35% and Lowe’s Cos. LOW  +0.61% . Ackman is not publicly demanding anything from the people running these companies.But old habits die hard.Harvard ousterA graduate of both Harvard and its graduate business school  Ackman has long been a substantial donor to the school. He has said over the years that he has frequently offered advice on how the university should be run and how to handle its enormous endowment  but that he has often been ignored.On X  Ackman said he initially supported Gay’s appointment to Harvard’s presidency in late 2022. But after pro-Palestinian protests on Harvard’s campus following the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas in Israel that left more than 1 200 Israelis dead  Ackman said  he felt Gay didn’t do enough to make Jewish students feel safe.After a highly criticized appearance before Congress  in which Gay answered questions about whether calling for genocide against Jews was a violation of Harvard’s policies by saying it depended on the context  Ackman more vocally called for her ouster. (Gay said in a New York Times op-ed Wednesday that she had fallen into “a well-laid trap” at the congressional hearing.)Gay ultimately stepped down on Tuesday  following investigations by conservative groups and media outlets into her academic work that turned up alleged instances of plagiarism.Now  in keeping with the corporate-raider playbook  Ackman says Harvard’s board of trustees should also step down  and its DEI office should be disbanded.He is also turning his attention to Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sally Kornbluth  the only university president who testified in the congressional antisemitism hearing who has retained her job.Meanwhile  Business Insider has published a report accusing Ackman’s wife  former MIT professor Neri Oxman  of plagiarism. Oxman acknowledged on X that  in her 330-page Ph.D. dissertation  she did not properly place language in four paragraphs in quotation marks and did not properly provide a citation in another sentence  saying she regretted the errors.Opinion: Hey  billionaires  stop giving money to Harvard,neutral,0.04,0.59,0.37,mixed,0.05,0.26,0.69,True,English,"['Bill Ackman', 'hedge-fund billionaire', 'corporate-raider tactics', 'Harvard', 'president', 'Harvard University President Claudine Gay', 'Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG', 'high-profile $1 billion short position', 'J.C.
