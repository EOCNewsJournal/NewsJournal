And he has been with the company even longer  shaping it into a significant industry heavyweight with an impressive M&A track record.,Deutsche Telekom was honored with the Corporate Finance Award (CFA) by Börsen-Zeitung for this accomplishment  marking the first time the company received such recognition. The company was the first to have received this award twice  and the CEO can proudly claim credit for this achievement. The jury further honored another mega-deal by Deutsche Telekom in the US. One that  this time  was actually successful. In 2021  after years of tough negotiations  the company successfully completed the acquisition of Sprint by T-Mobile US. Today  it holds the majority in the largest telecom company in the world by market capitalization  in the largest and most innovative market in the world. This gives Deutsche Telekom a growth and earnings driver that is lacking for all other European heavyweights in the industry. Under Höttges' leadership  the company's share has gained around 80% in value  while the Stoxx Telecommunications Europe has fallen by 35%.,neutral,0.02,0.88,0.1,positive,0.9,0.08,0.02,True,English,"['Telekom-CEO Tim Höttges', 'mindset', 'other European heavyweights', ""Höttges' leadership"", 'Stoxx Telecommunications Europe', 'Corporate Finance Award', 'largest telecom company', 'Deutsche Telekom', 'Börsen-Zeitung', 'first time', 'tough negotiations', 'market capitalization', 'innovative market', 'earnings driver', 'T-Mobile US', 'CFA', 'accomplishment', 'recognition', 'CEO', 'credit', 'achievement', 'jury', 'mega-deal', 'years', 'acquisition', 'Sprint', 'majority', 'world', 'growth', 'industry', 'share', 'value']",2024-01-08,2024-01-08,boersen-zeitung.de
