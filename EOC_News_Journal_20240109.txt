Meanwhile  the executive boards of Dax companies still look the same: predominantly old and male.,"Overall  despite all the challenges in 2023  there were only four changes at the helm of a Dax company. MTU CEO Lars Wagner and Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden took over in January. In May  Tobias Meyer succeeded the longtime CEO of Deutsche Post  Frank Appel. And in June  Bill Anderson replaced the unsuccessful Bayer CEO Werner Baumann. In April of this year  Markus Kamieth will take over the reins from Martin Brudermüller at BASF. He prevailed in the internal competition against the female Chief Technology Officer Melanie Maas-Brunner. A new opportunity to break the phalanx of older men arises at Deutsche Börse. The contract of CEO Theodor Weimer expires at the end of 2024. ""We have initiated a process to search for a successor "" said Chairman of the Supervisory Board Martin Jetter in September. Perhaps the stock exchange will take a cue from its US counterpart. The New York Stock Exchange had been led by Stacey Cunningham  born in 1974  from 2018 to 2022.

The Company achieved record numbers in leading metrics including increasing the RUCONEST® physician prescriber base by 13% during the year  in many cases adding previously unknown HAE prescribers.Joenja® (leniolisib) for APDSFor the full year 2023  we expect Joenja® revenues of approximately US$18 million driven by the continued increase during the fourth quarter in patients on paid therapy. First commercial shipments of Joenja® to patients took place in April 2023.As of December 31  2023 we have 92 APDS patients enrolled in the U.S.  of which 81 patients are on paid therapy.Our U.S. and global APDS patient finding efforts progressed during the year. As of December 31  2023  Pharming has identified over 840 diagnosed APDS patients in global markets targeted for commercialization  including over 200 patients in the United States.In addition  we have identified more than 1 100 patients in the U.S. with a number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in the PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes and are setting up validation studies with various laboratories to confirm which of these variants should be classified as APDS. As results become available  patients with validated variants could be diagnosed with APDS and be eligible for Joenja® treatment. Completion of these studies is expected during 4Q 2024.Overall cash and marketable securitiesPreliminary  unaudited cash and cash equivalents  together with restricted cash and marketable securities  are expected to total US$215.0 million at the end of 2023  compared to US$199.2 million at the end of the third quarter 2023 and US$208.7 million at the end of 2022.*Updated guidance based on preliminary selected financial results that are unaudited and subject to adjustment. Pharming expects to issue full financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 in March 2024.

Based on promising data obtained in the Phase I[*] trial ( NCT04183166 )   Transgene and NEC are preparing a randomized Phase I/II extension of this trial slated to start in 2024. This new trial builds on compelling first signs of efficacy and induction of specific T-cell responses with the aim of generating a comprehensive set of immunological and clinical data to further demonstrate the potential of TG4050.Transgene and NEC expect to present additional immunological and clinical data from the Phase I trial at a scientific conference in the first half of 2024.TG4050 is based on Transgene’s viral vector based myvac® platform and powered by NEC’s cutting-edge AI capabilities for the identification and prediction of the most immunogenic neoantigens.Alessandro Riva  Chairman and CEO of Transgene  commented: “We are pleased to announce the extension of our agreement with NEC  which marks a significant milestone in our collaboration. We are looking forward to continuing to treat patients in our clinical studies with our individualized cancer vaccine TG4050. The compelling initial Phase I data presented with NEC at ASCO 2023 showed that all evaluable patients treated with TG4050 monotherapy developed a specific immune response and remained disease-free.Our joint clinical development plan builds on these promising data in a setting where there is no approved treatment to prevent patient relapse after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. We believe that TG4050  by combining a powerful and immunogenic viral vector with an extremely sophisticated neoantigen selection tool  has the potential to address major medical needs in the adjuvant treatment of solid tumors.”Masamitsu Kitase  Corporate SVP  Head of Healthcare and Life Sciences Division  NEC Corporation  commented: “Transgene has been our trusted partner in developing our joint neoantigen asset TG4050. I am excited that the positive results from the Phase I study have encouraged us to further collaborate on this very promising asset for treating head and neck cancers.

The CBs will be issued and subscribed for in a maximum of four tranches. A first tranche of 30 CBs with an aggregate principal amount of EUR 300 000 will be subscribed for (and payment instructed) by GTO 15 today. The issue and subscription of the remaining three tranches  each with a principal amount of EUR 300 000  can be requested at BioSenic’s sole discretion over a six-month period beginning on the signing date of the subscription agreement  subject to customary conditions to be met (including (i) the possibility to immediately list any new shares resulting from the conversion of the CBs and (ii) with respect only to the fourth and final tranche  that the average daily value of the company's shares over the trailing 20 trading days – trimmed for 10% of the outliers – being higher than EUR 15 000). More precisely  BioSenic shall be entitled to require the investor – without the investor’s further consent but subject in each case to certain conditions precedent being met– to subscribe for the second tranche on 26 January 2024 and thereafter following a cool-down period of at least twenty 20 trading days following the closing date of the previous tranche. GTO 15 has the right to request the issuance of one tranche.The CBs  denominated EUR 10 000 each  will be in the form of unsecured  subordinated  registered bonds. The CBs will not bear any coupon and have a maturity date of five years after issuance  which may be extended by up to a year if the automatic conversion of the CBs upon the maturity date would otherwise result in GTO 15 holding more than 24.9% of the company's voting shares. The CBs are convertible into ordinary shares of BioSenic. The conversion price will be equal to 95% of the lowest daily VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price) of the ordinary shares of BioSenic observed during the pricing period of ten consecutive trading days expiring on the trading day immediately preceding the date of CB holder’s request of conversion  it being agreed that any trading day where the CB holder participates in more than 25% of the daily trading volume will be excluded from the 10-day pricing period.The proceeds of the financing will essentially contribute to continuing to advance the clinical development of BioSenic’s lead asset  its ATO product  in the treatment of chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD). BioSenic has now entered the final phase of its reorganization  following the reverse merger of Bone Therapeutics SA with Medsenic SAS in October 2022. Efforts are still ongoing to precisely evaluate the opportunities offered by some of the past achievements of the company regarding its cell repair platform and its program on osteoarthritis.Prof. François Rieger  BioSenic CEO and President of the Board  declares: “This contract allows us not only to maintain but immediately to increase our efforts in the early months of 2024. It will contribute to gather all necessary elements to both start our Phase 3 international trial on chronic GvHD with our oral form of ATO and find the best conditions to offer to partnership some of the present assets of the company  mainly related to our cell repair platform and osteoarthritis viscosupplement.”About ABO SecuritiesAlpha Blue Ocean (ABO) is a young and dynamic family office whose vocation is to revolutionize the financial industry by offering alternative solutions in constant innovation. ABO implements a direct  rational and efficient approach  offering financing solutions in line with the specific constraints of its clients.About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in immune and autoimmune diseases. Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning and key strengths to develop  separately and in combination  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com .About BioSenic technology platformsThe ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). BioSenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol. ALLOB  an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. After phase 2 clinical results with contradictory conclusions  BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (between early or late treatment).The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ● ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

It is with this commitment in mind that we submitted our sBLA for VYVGART Hytrulo in CIDP and  if approved  expect to launch in the U.S. in mid-2024. We will continue to be aggressive in advancing our pipeline this year and expect to report efgartigimod data from six Phase 2 studies in 2024  and to further develop empasiprubart in MMN. Through sustained investment in our IIP  we expect to see repeat value creation  and plan to submit four new INDs by the end of 2025.”“Two years ago  argenx’s key goal was to launch efgartigimod in the U.S. Today  we have built a formidable global commercial organization with product approvals in over 30 countries worldwide and a vibrant pipeline of promising new therapeutics to address immune-mediated diseases. We have forged important partnerships that support our mission to advance the human understanding of immunology to best benefit patients. argenx is well positioned for sustained growth throughout 2024 and well into the future.”2024 Strategic Prioritiesargenx will focus on three strategic priorities in 2024 to drive sustainable long-term growth  including:Reach more patients with VYVGART by building upon its strong commercial foundation to address ongoing unmet patient need  broaden the MG opportunity  and expand into CIDPby building upon its strong commercial foundation to address ongoing unmet patient need  broaden the MG opportunity  and expand into CIDP Advance its extensive pipeline through new data readouts  creating multiple opportunities to demonstrate transformative clinical benefitcreating multiple opportunities to demonstrate transformative clinical benefit Leverage its repeatable innovation engine  driving pipeline growth through its Immunology Innovation ProgramReach More Patients with VYVGARTVYVGART (efgartigimod alfa fcab) is a first-in-class antibody fragment targeting the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and is now approved in more than 30 countries globally. VYVGART subcutaneous (SC) (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) is approved in the U.S. (as VYVGART Hytrulo) and Europe  making VYVGART the only gMG treatment available as both an IV and simple SC injection. argenx is planning to reach more patients commercially in 2024 through its multi-dimensional expansion efforts. argenx will work to reach patients earlier in the MG treatment paradigm and improve the lives of new MG patient populations through additional global regulatory approvals  and the expansion of uses to treat additional autoimmune indications.Regulatory approval decisions of VYVGART for gMG expected in Switzerland  Australia  Saudi Arabia and South Korea by end of 2024Through strategic collaboration with Zai Lab  VYVGART to be included on China’s 2023 National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL)  starting in January 2024Decision on approval of VYVGART SC for gMG in Japan expected in first quarter of 2024 and in China through Zai Lab by end of 2024Decision on approval of VYVGART for primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Japan expected in first quarter of 2024Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) submitted to FDA for VYVGART Hytrulo for CIDP with priority review voucher (PRV); if approved  launch expected mid-2024Regulatory submissions of VYVGART SC for CIDP in Japan  Europe  China and Canada expected in 2024Registrational studies to expand VYVGART label into broader MG populations  including in seronegative patients  to start in 2024Update on pre-filled syringe development expected in first half of 2024; ongoing studies to support potential approval in gMG and CIDP in 2024Advance Current Pipeline through Upcoming Data Readoutsargenx continues to demonstrate breadth and depth within its immunology pipeline and is advancing multiple pipeline-in-a-product candidates. With efgartigimod  argenx is solidifying its leadership in FcRn and is on track to be approved or in development in 15 autoimmune indications by 2025. Beyond efgartigimod  argenx is advancing its earlier stage pipeline programs  including empasiprubart (C2 inhibitor) with Phase 2 studies ongoing in multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN)  delayed graft function and dermatomyositis (DM). In addition  ARGX-119  a muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) agonist  will initiate Phase 1b/2a studies in congenital myasthenic syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 2024.Today  argenx reported positive clinical data from the first cohort of the Phase 2 ARDA study of empasiprubart  establishing proof-of-concept in MMN. After confirming IVIg dependence  27 patients were withdrawn from IVIg treatment and randomized 2:1 to either empasiprubart or placebo for 16 weeks. Patients were monitored for clinical deterioration that required IVIg retreatment  which was the main efficacy endpoint of the study.Empasiprubart demonstrated a 91% reduction in the need for IVIg rescue compared to placebo [HR: 0.09 95% CI (0.02; 0.044)]According to the Patient Global Impression of Change scale  94% (17/18) of empasiprubart-treated patients rated their condition as improved since study start  including 55% (10/18) who were much or very much improved. Of placebo patients  89% (8/9) worsened or had no change.Empasiprubart demonstrated improvement on all six efficacy measurements compared to baselineSafety and tolerability profile were consistent with Phase 1 resultsCohort 2 is ongoing to determine dose response ahead of a Phase 3 study startargenx is on track to report topline data from five additional proof-of-concept studies in 2024  including:Phase 2 RHO study evaluating efgartigimod in primary Sjogren’s syndrome expected in first half of 2024Phase 2 ALPHA study evaluating efgartigimod in post-COVID-19 postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PC-POTS) expected in first half of 2024Seamless Phase 2/3 ALKIVIA study evaluating efgartigimod across three myositis subsets (immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM)  antisynthetase syndrome (ASyS)  and DM) expected in the second half of 2024Leverage Repeatable Innovation Playbook to Drive Long-Term Pipeline Growthargenx continues to invest in its discovery engine  the Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  to drive long-term sustainable pipeline growth. Through the IIP  four new pipeline candidates have been nominated  including: ARGX-213 targeting FcRn and further solidifying argenx’s leadership in this new class of medicine; ARGX-121 and ARGX-220  which are first-in-class targets broadening argenx’s focus across the immune system; and ARGX-109  targeting IL-6  which plays an important role in inflammation. Preclinical work is ongoing in each candidate and argenx is on track to file four investigational new drug (IND) applications by the end of 2025.Preliminary* Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Financial ResultsToday  argenx also announced preliminary* global net VYVGART revenues for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 of approximately $374 million and $1.2 billion  respectively.As of December 31  2023  argenx had approximately $3.2 billion in cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets*. Based on its current operating plans  argenx expects its combined R&D and SG&A expenses in 2024 to be less than $2 billion. The projected 2024 cash burn will be approximately $500 million. argenx expects its existing cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets  together with anticipated future product revenues  to fund the Company to profitability.* - The preliminary selected financial results are unaudited  subject to adjustment  and provided as an approximation in advance of the Company’s announcement of complete financial results in February 2024.42nd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference Presentation and WebcastMr. Van Hauwermeiren will highlight these updates in a corporate presentation at the 42nd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference today  Monday  January 8  2024  at 9:00 a.m. PT. The live webcast of the presentation may be accessed under Investors on the argenx website. A replay will be available for 30 days following the presentation.Phase 2 ARDA Study DesignThe Phase 2 ARDA study is a randomized  double-blinded  placebo-controlled multicenter study to evaluate the safety and tolerability  efficacy  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  and immunogenicity of two dose regimens of empasiprubart in adults with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). The study consists of an IVIg dependency and monitoring period and two 16-week treatment cohorts of 24 MMN patients receiving empasiprubart or placebo in a 2x1 randomization. The dosing for Cohort 2 was established after a planned interim analysis of the first nine patients to complete the 16-week treatment period from Cohort 1. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability. Additional endpoints include time to IVIg retreatment  biomarker analyses of C2 levels  and changes in measurements on key functional scores (modified medical research council (mMRC)-10 sum score  grip strength  MMN-RODS) as well as several patient-reported quality of life outcome measures (fatigue severity score (FSS)  chronic acquired polyneuropathy patient-reported index (CAP-PRI)  and values of the patient global impression change (PGIC) scale).About Multifocal Motor NeuropathyMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare  chronic autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. The disease is characterized by slowly progressive  asymmetric muscle weakness mainly of the hands  forearms and lower legs. MMN is often associated with anti-GM1 IgM autoimmunity  leading to activation of the classical complement pathway  driving subsequent axon damage. High-dose IVIg is the only approved treatment for MMN and patients typically experience disease progression despite therapy  indicating an unmet need for efficacious and better tolerated therapeutic options.About EmpasiprubartEmpasiprubart (ARGX-117) is a first-in-class humanized sweeping antibody that binds specifically to C2 thereby blocking both the classical and lectin pathways of the complement cascade. By blocking upstream complement activity  empasiprubart has the potential to reduce tissue inflammation representing a broad pipeline opportunity across multiple severe autoimmune indications. In addition to multifocal motor neuropathy  argenx is evaluating empasiprubart in delayed graft function following kidney transplant and dermatomyositis.About VYVGART and VYVGART SCVYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker globally for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).VYVGART SC is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. It is marketed as VYVGART Hytrulo in the U.S. and VYVGART SC in Europe  and may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker  globally in the U.S.  Japan  Israel  the EU  the UK  China and Canada. The Company is evaluating efgartigimod in multiple serious autoimmune diseases and advancing several earlier stage experimental medicines within its therapeutic franchises.

We have forged important partnerships that support our mission to advance the human understanding of immunology to best benefit patients. argenx is well positioned for sustained growth throughout 2024 and well into the future.”2024 Strategic Prioritiesargenx will focus on three strategic priorities in 2024 to drive sustainable long-term growth  including:Reach more patients with VYVGART by building upon its strong commercial foundation to address ongoing unmet patient need  broaden the MG opportunity  and expand into CIDPby building upon its strong commercial foundation to address ongoing unmet patient need  broaden the MG opportunity  and expand into CIDP Advance its extensive pipeline through new data readouts  creating multiple opportunities to demonstrate transformative clinical benefitcreating multiple opportunities to demonstrate transformative clinical benefit Leverage its repeatable innovation engine  driving pipeline growth through its Immunology Innovation ProgramReach More Patients with VYVGARTVYVGART (efgartigimod alfa fcab) is a first-in-class antibody fragment targeting the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and is now approved in more than 30 countries globally. VYVGART subcutaneous (SC) (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) is approved in the U.S. (as VYVGART Hytrulo) and Europe  making VYVGART the only gMG treatment available as both an IV and simple SC injection. argenx is planning to reach more patients commercially in 2024 through its multi-dimensional expansion efforts. argenx will work to reach patients earlier in the MG treatment paradigm and improve the lives of new MG patient populations through additional global regulatory approvals  and the expansion of uses to treat additional autoimmune indications.Regulatory approval decisions of VYVGART for gMG expected in Switzerland  Australia  Saudi Arabia and South Korea by end of 2024Through strategic collaboration with Zai Lab  VYVGART to be included on China’s 2023 National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL)  starting in January 2024Decision on approval of VYVGART SC for gMG in Japan expected in first quarter of 2024 and in China through Zai Lab by end of 2024Decision on approval of VYVGART for primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Japan expected in first quarter of 2024Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) submitted to FDA for VYVGART Hytrulo for CIDP with priority review voucher (PRV); if approved  launch expected mid-2024Regulatory submissions of VYVGART SC for CIDP in Japan  Europe  China and Canada expected in 2024Registrational studies to expand VYVGART label into broader MG populations  including in seronegative patients  to start in 2024Update on pre-filled syringe development expected in first half of 2024; ongoing studies to support potential approval in gMG and CIDP in 2024Advance Current Pipeline through Upcoming Data Readoutsargenx continues to demonstrate breadth and depth within its immunology pipeline and is advancing multiple pipeline-in-a-product candidates. With efgartigimod  argenx is solidifying its leadership in FcRn and is on track to be approved or in development in 15 autoimmune indications by 2025. Beyond efgartigimod  argenx is advancing its earlier stage pipeline programs  including empasiprubart (C2 inhibitor) with Phase 2 studies ongoing in multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN)  delayed graft function and dermatomyositis (DM). In addition  ARGX-119  a muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) agonist  will initiate Phase 1b/2a studies in congenital myasthenic syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 2024.Today  argenx reported positive clinical data from the first cohort of the Phase 2 ARDA study of empasiprubart  establishing proof-of-concept in MMN. After confirming IVIg dependence  27 patients were withdrawn from IVIg treatment and randomized 2:1 to either empasiprubart or placebo for 16 weeks. Patients were monitored for clinical deterioration that required IVIg retreatment  which was the main efficacy endpoint of the study.Empasiprubart demonstrated a 91% reduction in the need for IVIg rescue compared to placebo [HR: 0.09 95% CI (0.02; 0.044)]According to the Patient Global Impression of Change scale  94% (17/18) of empasiprubart-treated patients rated their condition as improved since study start  including 55% (10/18) who were much or very much improved. Of placebo patients  89% (8/9) worsened or had no change.Empasiprubart demonstrated improvement on all six efficacy measurements compared to baselineSafety and tolerability profile were consistent with Phase 1 resultsCohort 2 is ongoing to determine dose response ahead of a Phase 3 study startargenx is on track to report topline data from five additional proof-of-concept studies in 2024  including:Phase 2 RHO study evaluating efgartigimod in primary Sjogren’s syndrome expected in first half of 2024Phase 2 ALPHA study evaluating efgartigimod in post-COVID-19 postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PC-POTS) expected in first half of 2024Seamless Phase 2/3 ALKIVIA study evaluating efgartigimod across three myositis subsets (immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM)  antisynthetase syndrome (ASyS)  and DM) expected in the second half of 2024Leverage Repeatable Innovation Playbook to Drive Long-Term Pipeline Growthargenx continues to invest in its discovery engine  the Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  to drive long-term sustainable pipeline growth. Through the IIP  four new pipeline candidates have been nominated  including: ARGX-213 targeting FcRn and further solidifying argenx’s leadership in this new class of medicine; ARGX-121 and ARGX-220  which are first-in-class targets broadening argenx’s focus across the immune system; and ARGX-109  targeting IL-6  which plays an important role in inflammation. Preclinical work is ongoing in each candidate and argenx is on track to file four investigational new drug (IND) applications by the end of 2025.Preliminary* Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Financial ResultsToday  argenx also announced preliminary* global net VYVGART revenues for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 of approximately $374 million and $1.2 billion  respectively.As of December 31  2023  argenx had approximately $3.2 billion in cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets*. Based on its current operating plans  argenx expects its combined R&D and SG&A expenses in 2024 to be less than $2 billion. The projected 2024 cash burn will be approximately $500 million. argenx expects its existing cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets  together with anticipated future product revenues  to fund the Company to profitability.* - The preliminary selected financial results are unaudited  subject to adjustment  and provided as an approximation in advance of the Company’s announcement of complete financial results in February 2024.42nd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference Presentation and WebcastMr. Van Hauwermeiren will highlight these updates in a corporate presentation at the 42nd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference today  Monday  January 8  2024  at 9:00 a.m. PT. The live webcast of the presentation may be accessed under Investors on the argenx website. A replay will be available for 30 days following the presentation.Phase 2 ARDA Study DesignThe Phase 2 ARDA study is a randomized  double-blinded  placebo-controlled multicenter study to evaluate the safety and tolerability  efficacy  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  and immunogenicity of two dose regimens of empasiprubart in adults with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). The study consists of an IVIg dependency and monitoring period and two 16-week treatment cohorts of 24 MMN patients receiving empasiprubart or placebo in a 2x1 randomization. The dosing for Cohort 2 was established after a planned interim analysis of the first nine patients to complete the 16-week treatment period from Cohort 1. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability. Additional endpoints include time to IVIg retreatment  biomarker analyses of C2 levels  and changes in measurements on key functional scores (modified medical research council (mMRC)-10 sum score  grip strength  MMN-RODS) as well as several patient-reported quality of life outcome measures (fatigue severity score (FSS)  chronic acquired polyneuropathy patient-reported index (CAP-PRI)  and values of the patient global impression change (PGIC) scale).About Multifocal Motor NeuropathyMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare  chronic autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. The disease is characterized by slowly progressive  asymmetric muscle weakness mainly of the hands  forearms and lower legs. MMN is often associated with anti-GM1 IgM autoimmunity  leading to activation of the classical complement pathway  driving subsequent axon damage. High-dose IVIg is the only approved treatment for MMN and patients typically experience disease progression despite therapy  indicating an unmet need for efficacious and better tolerated therapeutic options.About EmpasiprubartEmpasiprubart (ARGX-117) is a first-in-class humanized sweeping antibody that binds specifically to C2 thereby blocking both the classical and lectin pathways of the complement cascade. By blocking upstream complement activity  empasiprubart has the potential to reduce tissue inflammation representing a broad pipeline opportunity across multiple severe autoimmune indications. In addition to multifocal motor neuropathy  argenx is evaluating empasiprubart in delayed graft function following kidney transplant and dermatomyositis.About VYVGART and VYVGART SCVYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker globally for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).VYVGART SC is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. It is marketed as VYVGART Hytrulo in the U.S. and VYVGART SC in Europe  and may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker  globally in the U.S.  Japan  Israel  the EU  the UK  China and Canada. The Company is evaluating efgartigimod in multiple serious autoimmune diseases and advancing several earlier stage experimental medicines within its therapeutic franchises.

Based on promising data obtained in this Phase I* trial (new windowNCT04183166)  Transgene and NEC are preparing a randomized Phase I/II extension of this trial slated to start in 2024. This new trial builds on compelling first signs of efficacy and induction of specific T-cell responses with the aim of generating a comprehensive set of immunological and clinical data to further demonstrate the potential of TG4050.Transgene and NEC expect to present additional immunological and clinical data from the Phase I trial at a scientific conference in the first half of 2024.TG4050 is based on Transgene’s viral vector based myvac® platform and powered by NEC’s cutting-edge AI capabilities for the identification and prediction of the most immunogenic neoantigens.Alessandro Riva  Chairman and CEO of Transgene  commented: ""We are pleased to announce the extension of our agreement with NEC  which marks a significant milestone in our collaboration. We are looking forward to continuing to treat patients with our individualized cancer vaccine TG4050. The compelling initial Phase I data presented with NEC at ASCO 2023 showed that all evaluable patients treated with TG4050 monotherapy developed a specific immune response and remained disease-free.""Our joint clinical development plan builds on these promising data in a setting where there is no approved treatment to prevent patient relapse after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. We believe that TG4050  by combining a powerful and immunogenic viral vector with an extremely sophisticated neoantigen selection tool  has the potential to address major medical needs in the adjuvant treatment of solid tumors.""Masamitsu Kitase  Corporate SVP  Head of Healthcare and Life Sciences Division  NEC Corporation  commented: ""Transgene has been our trusted partner in developing our joint neoantigen asset TG4050. I am excited that the positive results from the Phase I study have encouraged us to further collaborate on this very promising asset for treating head and neck cancers.

This virus-based therapeutic vaccine encodes neoantigens (patient-specific mutations) identified and selected by NEC’s Neoantigen Prediction System. The prediction system is based on more than two decades of expertise in AI and has been trained on proprietary data allowing it to accurately prioritize and select the most immunogenic sequences.TG4050 is designed to stimulate the immune system of patients in order to induce a T-cell response that is able to recognize and destroy tumor cells based on their own neoantigens. This individualized immunotherapy is developed and produced for each patient.About the clinical trialTG4050 is being evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial for patients with HPV-negative head and neck cancers (new windowNCT04183166). An individualized treatment is created for each patient after they complete surgery and while they receive adjuvant therapy. Half of the participants received their vaccine immediately after completing adjuvant treatment. The other half were given TG4050 as an additional treatment at the time of recurrence of the disease as an additional treatment to standard of care (SoC). This randomized study is evaluating the treatment benefits of TG4050 in patients who are at risk of relapse. Thirty-two patients have been included in this trial under way in France  the UK  and the USA. The principal investigator of the trial is Prof. Christian Ottensmeier  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncologist at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre and Professor of Immuno-Oncology at the University of Liverpool. In France  the clinical trial is conducted at Institut Curie by Prof. Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  Head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i)  and at the IUCT-Oncopole  Toulouse by Prof. Jean-Pierre Delord  MD  PhD. In the USA  the trial is being led by Yujie Zhao  MD  PhD  at the Mayo Clinic. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility  and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.
