Even before Britain…,"* Nasdaq Europe to expand IRS clearing* Exchange technically ready to launch in coming months* Nasdaq targets users of euro IRS in the NordicsLONDON  Jan 9 (Reuters) - Nasdaq Europe has said it will expand derivatives clearing to include euro interest rate swaps (IRS) in the coming months  in the latest move by European Union market operators to pull business from London following Brexit.Even before Britain left the EU in 2020  London had long irked Brussels with its dominance of clearing in IRS  contracts widely used by companies to hedge against adverse moves in borrowing costs.Clearing is a critical part of financial markets' plumbing  ensuring a transaction is completed even if one side goes bust.London's dominance in clearing has helped it remain a major global financial centre by building up a deep pool of liquidity. Britain is trying to make its financial sector more globally competitive  after it was largely severed from the EU due to Brexit.An EU law now being finalised will require banks in the bloc to have an ""active account"" at EU-based clearers for euro denominated IRS transactions  to reduce reliance on the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG)  and to give EU regulators direct oversight of transactions linked to the bloc.EU permission for banks in the bloc to continue using London for clearing derivatives is also due to expire in June 2025  piling further pressure to shift business across the Channel.Nasdaq Clearing has begun talking to clients about launching clearing in euros  and Danish and Norwegian crown IRS to take on LSEG by offering multi-currency clearing  said Chief Executive Patrik Lohr.""From a technical perspective we're ready "" Lohr told Reuters.EXPANDED NORDIC PRODUCT RANGENasdaq already clears IRS in Swedish crowns and expanding to other currencies will allow customers to net more positions within a single clearer to save on collateral.""With this we have a more complete offering for the Nordic clients "" Lohr said.Nasdaq Europe  part of the U.S. Nasdaq exchange and operator of seven European stock exchanges in the Nordic and Baltic countries  says it has just under 10% market share in clearing Swedish crown IRS.LSEG  which had no comment on Nasdaq's plans  dominates clearing in IRS trades in Nordic currencies  though they are only a small portion of its daily overall business  which totalled $7.3 trillion on Monday  including $2.83 trillion in euro IRS.On the same day  LSEG cleared $30.50 billion in Swedish crown IRS  $1.39 billion in Danish crown IRS  and $8.22 billion in Norwegian crown IRS.Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt and Swiss SIX Group's Madrid Exchange are already vying to replace LSEG for clearing euro IRS traded between EU counterparties.Nasdaq  however  is targeting users of euro IRS in the Nordics  rather than across the bloc.Since Brexit  existing Nasdaq clearing members have already begun shifting some business from London to Stockholm  with new members expected to join them this year  Lohr said.The EU is finalising new rules for active accounts  though without hard minimum clearing volumes initially  giving time for the market to adjust.Lohr said policymakers won't be satisfied with only a small portion of business shifting from London to clearers in the EU.""I think this is the first step "" Lohr said.($1 = 0.9148 euros) ($1 = 10.2504 Swedish crowns) (Reporting by Huw Jones Editing by Tommy Reggiori Wilkes and Sharon Singleton)",neutral,0.04,0.94,0.02,mixed,0.11,0.3,0.59,True,English,"['Nasdaq Europe', 'Brexit London', 'derivatives', 'post', 'seven European stock exchanges', 'major global financial centre', 'euro interest rate swaps', 'European Union market operators', 'EXPANDED NORDIC PRODUCT RANGE', 'hard minimum clearing volumes', 'Chief Executive Patrik Lohr', 'U.S. Nasdaq exchange', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'euro denominated IRS transactions', 'existing Nasdaq clearing members', 'Swiss SIX Group', ""financial markets' plumbing"", 'Tommy Reggiori Wilkes', 'Norwegian crown IRS', 'Swedish crown IRS', 'daily overall business', 'Danish crown IRS', 'financial sector', 'new members', 'euro IRS', 'Madrid Exchange', 'Swedish crowns', '10% market share', 'IRS trades', 'Nordic currencies', 'IRS clearing', 'Nasdaq Europe', 'coming months', 'latest move', 'adverse moves', 'borrowing costs', 'one side', 'deep pool', 'active account', 'direct oversight', 'technical perspective', 'other currencies', 'single clearer', 'complete offering', 'Baltic countries', 'small portion', 'same day', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'new rules', 'first step', 'Huw Jones', 'Sharon Singleton', 'multi-currency clearing', 'Nordic clients', 'EU law', 'EU regulators', 'EU permission', 'EU counterparties', 'The EU', 'critical part', 'EU-based clearers', 'users', 'Nordics', 'Reuters', 'derivatives', 'Brexit', 'Britain', 'Brussels', 'dominance', 'contracts', 'companies', 'liquidity', 'banks', 'bloc', 'reliance', 'LSEG', 'June', 'pressure', 'Channel', 'euros', 'customers', 'positions', 'collateral', 'comment', 'plans', 'Monday', 'Frankfurt', 'Stockholm', 'time', 'policymakers']",2024-01-09,2024-01-10,marketscreener.com

The new platform uses the QNX® Hypervisor in the cloud from BlackBerry  which is now on early access release via AWS Marketplace within the QNX Accelerate portfolio of cloud-based tools. Stellantis can now create realistic virtual versions of car controls and systems  making them behave just like they would in a real car  but without needing to change the main software that runs them  taking what used to take months to be achieved down to 24 hours in some cases.Accessing QNX Hypervisor via AWS Marketplace enables Stellantis to include a virtual cockpit high-performance computing (HPC) simulation into a cloud environment. This industry-first platform for mixed-criticality and multi-OS embedded application development includes QNX Hypervisor Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and industry-standard hardware interfaces as defined in the VirtIO standard Trout v1.2. With tools such as virtualization of graphics  audio  and touchscreen/mouse/keyboard inputs  the solution offers little to no difference between running QNX Hypervisor-based systems in the cloud versus on real hardware.Software is a key building block for Stellantis to deliver clean  safe and affordable mobility  as outlined in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  and the driving force behind the AI-powered STLA Brain  STLA SmartCockpit and STLA AutoDrive technology platforms. In 2022  Stellantis selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms and the companies began work on Stellantis’ purpose-built  in-house VEW.Taking a software-driven approach and deploying the QNX Hypervisor in the cloud  Stellantis can accelerate customer feedback sessions  and with minimal effort  replicate the cockpit experience of a particular brand and vehicle  and make changes in real time to optimize the experience for the driver. This real-time feedback  underpinned by low-latency access to the cloud  allows Stellantis to solicit valuable feedback from its customer and developer base to build future infotainment features and applications.“Software is becoming increasingly crucial in vehicles  leading us to innovate in how we develop and validate it ” said Yves Bonnefont  Chief Software Officer at Stellantis. “With our virtual cockpit  we’re revolutionizing not just our approach  but also that of our suppliers and partners in the industry. Essentially  we’re able to get closer to our customer’s needs through this technology with faster development cycles  faster feedback loops  and quicker delivery of the technology they use and love. It’s a leap towards customer-first innovation and efficiency in the automotive world.”“We’re delighted to introduce early access availability of our trusted QNX Hypervisor platform in the cloud  leveraging the vendor and platform-neutral VirtIO standard that QNX has long-supported for its importance in creating a true-to-life virtual development environment for embedded software ” said Mattias Eriksson  President  BlackBerry IoT. “Working with Stellantis to launch the world’s first commercial hypervisor in the AWS cloud helps to reduce complexity  accelerate innovation and cut costs on in-car software development throughout the entire product lifecycle.”“Software virtualization and abstraction in the cloud is vital to accelerating development and maintaining feature delivery on-pace with consumer demand ” said Wendy Bauer  Vice President and General Manager  Automotive and Manufacturing  AWS. “With BlackBerry’s QNX Hypervisor on AWS Marketplace  Stellantis can easily harness the power of the cloud to reimagine research and development processes  architect more insightful ways to solicit and integrate feedback  and deliver functions faster than before that delight drivers and further the industry.”Standard VirtIO interfaces are also used by a suite of automotive partners to scale their offerings across OEMs and enable plug-and-play across the OEM landscape. Recognizing the benefits  AWS fully supports the VirtIO industry standard for cloud simulation of cockpit HPCs.BlackBerry QNX launched QNX Accelerate in January 2023 with its portfolio initially featuring QNX® Neutrino® RTOS 7.1 and the QNX® OS for Safety 2.2.3  each provided as Amazon Machine Images allowing QNX customers to run a QNX OS natively on AWS cloud hardware. The early access release of QNX Hypervisor in the cloud is available now and general availability will be announced later in 2024.A non-branded demonstration of the technology is available at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) from January 9 – 12  2024  at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Vente-unique.com  an expert in online sales of furniture and home furnishings in Europe  announces its unaudited results for the 2022-2023 financial year (period from 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023)[1].

The annual financial report will be published on 30 January 2024  once the audit procedures have been completed.Vente-unique.com SA Vente-unique.com SA Vente-unique.comGroup IFRS (€m) 2021-2022 2022-2023 2022-2023 Revenues 143.4 155.5 162.3 Gross margin 75.9 84.5 91.3 % of revenues 53.0% 54.4% 56.2% Adjusted EBITDA[2] 8.4 11.5 17.3 % of revenues 5.8% 7.4% 10.7% Underlying EBIT 4.8 9.6 10.6 % of revenues 3.3% 6.2% 6.5% EBIT 4.4 9.5 10.4 Net financial income/(expense) (0.2) (0.1) (0.8) Income tax (1.4) (2.4) (2.5) Net income 2.7 7.0 7.1Vente-Unique.com CEO Sacha Vigna said: The 2023 financial year will see the resumption of our historic pace of growth and the achievement of new record highs. At a time when some players in our sector are running out of steam  or even disappearing  we are continuing our efforts to constantly improve the customer experience and thus strengthen the foundations for sustainable  profitable growth. In this respect  our customer service has once again demonstrated the full extent of its expertise  and has received three remarkable awards in France  Spain and Germany. Our marketplace in France continues to gain momentum  and we have successfully launched its roll-out in other European countries where we already have a presence. It provides an increasingly rich offering of multiple sources of revenue and profit. As a result  we can look forward confidently to the 2023-2024 financial year  with the ambition of further solid and profitable growth  following an already very buoyant first quarter.Solid growth in gross merchandise volume and consolidated revenuesTotal annual gross merchandise volume exceeds the symbolic €200m mark for the first time (€201.7m  up 18.2%). This demonstrates the growing power of the marketplace  with steady month-on-month growth in the countries where it was deployed during the year.Buoyed throughout the year by a strong sales momentum and the best 4th quarter in its history (+20.4%)  the Vente-Unique.com Group posted consolidated revenues of € 162.3 million  up 13.1% year-on-year. The Group's e-commerce business (including e-commerce activity and commissions generated by the marketplace) came to €155.5 million (+8.4%).In a difficult environment  Vente-Unique.com has been able to capitalise on the digital transformation of the furniture and home decoration market  offering its customers a wide range of products (directly or via its marketplace) at the best prices  available quickly and with a premium customer experience.17th consecutive profitable yearThanks to excellent supplier sourcing and the agility of the Group's sales policy  Vente-Unique.com managed to significantly improve its gross margin rate over the year  to 56.2%  and is close to the level for the 2020-2021 financial year.The Group's adjusted EBITDA came to €17.3m  or 10.7% of revenues. The optimisation of delivery and logistics expenditure  thanks to the integration of expertise  has enabled us to increase marketing intensity in a controlled manner and to invest in talent and structure to prepare for future growth. The inclusion of the Logistics division in the Group's scope of consolidation had a positive impact of +3.2 points on the adjusted EBITDA margin (of which 2.4 points related to the restatement of rents for the Amblainville site in application of IFRS 16).Depreciation  amortisation and provisions totalled €5.4m (up €3.4m on 2021-2022)  reflecting the inclusion of logistics activities in the Group's scope of consolidation. Profit from recurring operations was €10.6m  or 6.5% of consolidated revenues. After taking into account other expenses and a tax charge of €2.5m  annual net profit came to €7.1m  up sharply on 2021-2022 (+€4.4m).This is Vente-unique.com's 17th consecutive year of profitability.Strong cash generation over the yearWith a solid cash position of € 19.0 million at the start of the year  Vente-Unique.com generated gross operating cash flow of € 14.8 million.This cash surplus  combined with the optimisation of inventory levels (-€3m) and a model requiring little recurring investment  enabled the company to cover the purchase of Distri Service's assets (€2.8m) as well as the policy of returning cash to shareholders (€4.8m in dividends paid in December 2022 and May 2023) without impacting its financial leeway.Closing cash and cash equivalents reached a record level of €27.7m  including €1.1m of treasury shares bought back during the year for allocation to beneficiaries of existing bonus share plans.Numerous growth drivers for the coming yearVente-Unique.com intends to consolidate its status as a trusted player in the online furniture and home furnishings market by further enhancing the customer experience. The Group intends to work on enriching the customer experience  through the richness of the offering  the quality of the services available and the loyalty programme. This customer-focused approach is part of Vente-Unique.com's DNA and is made possible by the in-house management of various skills  particularly customer service and logistics.The coming financial year will be marked by the continued roll-out of the marketplace in Europe to new markets in the first half of 2024 (Netherlands  Portugal). At the heart of the Group's medium-term objectives  the development of the marketplace will be accompanied by new sources of direct revenue (commission deducted from seller sales  logistics services and advertising revenue) and indirect revenue (encouraging transformation  cross-purchasing and re-purchasing).Following the liquidation of Habitat Design International at the end of December 2023  the Group will absorb the loss of the logistics business carried out on behalf of the company  which is not making a significant contribution (€0.3m of operating income for €6.6m of revenues in 2022-2023)  by winning new customers for its logistics business and its own needs linked to its growing e-commerce business.The Vente-Unique.com Group is therefore approaching the current financial year with confidence  buoyed by a 1st quarter of the 2023/2024 financial year that is expected to show double-digit growth.Next publication: Q1 2023-2024 revenues  8 February 2024For more information: bourse.vente-unique.comAbout Vente-unique.comCreated in 2006  Vente-unique.com (Euronext Growth - ALVU)  a subsidiary of the CAFOM Group (Euronext - CAFO)  is an expert in online revenues of furniture and home furnishings in Europe.

BOOSHEAT is proud to announce the finalization of the theoretical development stage of the hybrid compressor  and the arrival of the first 1/1-scale prototype.Assembly of the thermal compressor and the volumetric compressor constituting the hybrid compressor was carried out in BOOSTHEAT's workshops  confirming that the company has all the expertise and equipment required following its strategic refocusing.The prototype is ready for the first functional tests  and 2024 can begin with the first performance tests in the specially equipped BOOSTHEAT laboratory.I PERFORMANCE TESTINGIn the coming weeks  performance tests will validate the 3 operating modes of the hybrid compressor  confirming the theoretical potential of this patented compressor[2] :The possibility of flexible and smart combination of the 2 primary energies (gas and electricity) according to various criteria chosen by the customer (energy cost / availability / etc.); Heat or cooling production  which can be coupled with modulating electricity production (micro-cogeneration application); The use of a ""booster"" effect combining the two primary energy sources simultaneously to increase the levels of heat or cold produced by the hybrid system.As these tests are carried out  the Company will report on each operating mode and its performance.I TOWARDS THE DEMONSTRATORAll these steps are major advances and open the way for commercial developments for innovative  high-performance industrial applications.In this respect  as announced in its roadmap  BOOSTHEAT is determined to stay one step ahead of the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050  by working on new primary energies such as biogas  biomethane and hydrogen. One of the developments being explored concerns the area of production of biomethane and biogas using methanization technology.In a traditional anaerobic digestion plant  25% of the biogas produced is burned to generate heat and keep the process warm. BOOSTHEAT technology is far more efficient than traditional heat production methods (boilers  cogeneration)  enabling less biogas to be consumed during the anaerobic digestion process  and thus increasing the quantity of biogas that can be recovered. It also helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using biogas  combustible produced by the biological methanization process.* * *Find out more about BOOSTHEAT atwww.boostheat-group.comABOUT BOOSTHEATFounded in 2011  BOOSTHEAT is a player in the energy efficiency sector. The company's mission is to accelerate the energy transition by integrating its technology into energy-intensive applications.

Its adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $5 million  generated from around 1 700 customers in 20 countries  including major fashion labels.Under the terms of the deal  Lectra will acquire the remaining capital and voting rights in five stages between 2025 and 2030  with the total acquisition price slated to fall between $200 million and $240 million euros  based on an expected double-digit growth in the next five years.It will also see Launchmetrics shareholder Bpifrance  which led the 2018 funding round  sell part of its shares.

We are truly thankful for the support provided by the EIB.""As previously announced  the Finance Contract provides funding in two tranches of €25 million  each subject to the completion of certain conditions precedent.After the drawdown of the first tranche in December 20222  the Company was eligible to access the second tranche of €25 million if it met certain conditions precedent described below. Following the achievement of those conditions  the Company decided to draw on the second tranche to reinforce its financial position. The Company intends to use the proceeds to fund part of its pivotal NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in patients with NASH and estimates that  including this second tranche of €25 million of the EIB loan  its cash  cash equivalents and deposits would allow the Company to fund its operations as currently planned until the beginning of the third quarter of 20241.This second tranche carries a 7% interest capitalized annually  has a maturity of 3 years from the disbursement date and a repayment in fine. As a result  the Company expects to repay this tranche in early 20273  after the anticipated publication of the results of the NATiV3 Phase III trial evaluating lanifibranor in patients with NASH which is expected to take place in the first half of 2026. The disbursement of this second tranche was subject to  among other conditions  (i) the full drawdown of the first tranche  (ii) the receipt by the Company from the date of the Finance Contract of an aggregate amount of at least €70 million (inclusive of the €18 million that were a condition for the disbursement of the first tranche)  paid either in exchange for shares of the Company  or through upfront or milestone payments  (iii) an out-licensing  partnership or royalty transaction with an upfront payment of at least €10 million  (iv) operational criteria based on patient enrollment and number of sites activated in the Company's NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in patients with NASH and (v) the Company issuing warrants to EIB in accordance with the terms and conditions of the warrant agreement entered into on July 1  2022.On January 4  2024  the Company issued 3 144 654 warrants to EIB  in accordance with the terms of the 6th resolution of the combined general meeting of shareholders of January 25  2023  and Article L.225-138 of the French Commercial Code  as a condition to the drawdown of the second tranche. This represents approximately 6.08% of the Company's current outstanding share capital4.The exercise price of the warrants issued in connection with the second tranche is equal to €3.95 and corresponds to 95% of the volume-weighted average price of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris during the last trading session preceding the decision to issue the warrants (i.e. January 3  2024).Pursuant to the previously disclosed warrant agreement  the warrants have a maturity of twelve years and shall be exercisable following the earliest to occur of (i) the maturity date of the first tranche (i.e. on December 8  2026)  (ii) a change of control event  (iii) an event of default under the Finance Contract  or (iv) a repayment demand by EIB under the Finance Contract. The warrants will automatically be deemed null and void if not exercised within the twelve-year period.EIB has a put option which may require the Company to repurchase all or part of the unexercised warrants then exercisable at their intrinsic value (subject to a cap equal to the amount drawn under the Finance Contract) under certain circumstances (for example  in the event of a change of control of the Company or on the maturity date of the first tranche or in the event of default). The Company (or a substitute third party) has a call option to require EIB to sell all shares and other securities of the Company in certain circumstances  including the warrants  to the Company  subject to certain terms and conditions. In addition  the Company has a right of first refusal to buy-back all warrants offered for sale to a third party  subject to certain terms and conditions.On the basis of the 3 144 654 new shares of the Company issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the drawdown of the second tranche at an exercise price of €3.95 per new share  the Company could potentially receive gross proceeds of up to €12 421 383. There is no assurance that EIB will exercise any or all of the warrants or that the Company will receive any proceeds from the exercise of the warrants.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs.

The disbursement of this second tranche was subject to  among other conditions  (i) the full drawdown of the first tranche  (ii) the receipt by the Company from the date of the Finance Contract of an aggregate amount of at least €70 million (inclusive of the €18 million that were a condition for the disbursement of the first tranche)  paid either in exchange for shares of the Company  or through upfront or milestone payments  (iii) an out-licensing  partnership or royalty transaction with an upfront payment of at least €10 million  (iv) operational criteria based on patient enrollment and number of sites activated in the Company’s NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in patients with NASH and (v) the Company issuing warrants to EIB in accordance with the terms and conditions of the warrant agreement entered into on July 1  2022.On January 4  2024  the Company issued 3 144 654 warrants to EIB  in accordance with the terms of the 6th resolution of the combined general meeting of shareholders of January 25  2023  and Article L.225-138 of the French Commercial Code  as a condition to the drawdown of the second tranche. This represents approximately 6.08% of the Company's current outstanding share capital4.The exercise price of the warrants issued in connection with the second tranche is equal to €3.95 and corresponds to 95% of the volume-weighted average price of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris during the last trading session preceding the decision to issue the warrants (i.e. January 3  2024).Pursuant to the previously disclosed warrant agreement  the warrants have a maturity of twelve years and shall be exercisable following the earliest to occur of (i) the maturity date of the first tranche (i.e. on December 8  2026)  (ii) a change of control event  (iii) an event of default under the Finance Contract  or (iv) a repayment demand by EIB under the Finance Contract. The warrants will automatically be deemed null and void if not exercised within the twelve-year period.EIB has a put option which may require the Company to repurchase all or part of the unexercised warrants then exercisable at their intrinsic value (subject to a cap equal to the amount drawn under the Finance Contract) under certain circumstances (for example  in the event of a change of control of the Company or on the maturity date of the first tranche or in the event of default). The Company (or a substitute third party) has a call option to require EIB to sell all shares and other securities of the Company in certain circumstances  including the warrants  to the Company  subject to certain terms and conditions. In addition  the Company has a right of first refusal to buy-back all warrants offered for sale to a third party  subject to certain terms and conditions.On the basis of the 3 144 654 new shares of the Company issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the drawdown of the second tranche at an exercise price of €3.95 per new share  the Company could potentially receive gross proceeds of up to €12 421 383. There is no assurance that EIB will exercise any or all of the warrants or that the Company will receive any proceeds from the exercise of the warrants.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs.
