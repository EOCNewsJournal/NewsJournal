The bearer shares with the old ISIN DE000A2G8XP9 are to be traded for the last time today  January 10  2024 (record date). Trading in the registered shares with the new ISIN DE000A3EX2X7 will then begin on January 11  2024 (payment date). For this purpose  the holdings of no-par value bearer shares of aifinyo AG held in custody at credit institutions will be automatically converted into no-par value registered shares of the B2B fintech at a ratio of 1:1.The amendment to the Articles of Association resolved by the Annual General Meeting was entered in the company's commercial register at the Berlin Charlottenburg Local Court on July 28  2023. The share capital of aifinyo AG in the amount of EUR 4 048 670 is thus divided into 4 048 670 no-par value registered shares with a notional interest in the share capital of EUR 1.00. The company expects the conversion of the share class in conjunction with an electronic share register to result in more effective and targeted communication with its shareholders.The conversion to registered shares requires the maintenance of a share register in which the shareholders are entered. In the case of natural persons  the surname and first name as well as the residential address  date of birth  an electronic address and the number of shares held are recorded. In the case of legal entities  the company name and registered office  the business address and the number of shares held are entered in the share register. Only those persons who are entered as shareholders in the company's share register are deemed to be shareholders vis-à-vis the company and are entitled to participate in the Annual General Meeting and exercise their voting rights.The legal status of the shareholders entered in the share register will not be affected by the conversion of the no-par value bearer shares into registered shares. Their participation in the company remains unchanged  as do the rights associated with their shares. The shareholders' right to sell their shares is also not restricted or made more difficult  as the transfer of registered shares does not require the company's consent.The share capital of aifinyo AG  divided into no-par value registered shares  is securitized in a global certificate deposited with Clearstream Banking AG  Frankfurt am Main.

34837,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://delano.lu/article/luxembourg-fund-data-leader-ce,Luxembourg fund data leader celebrates 30 years,On 12 November 1993 in New York City  American rock band Nirvana stepped into the Sony Music Studios as Kurt Cobain and his band started rehearsing for their upcoming MTV Unplugged performance  a recording which would become one of the greatest live albums of all time.,“We started as a newspaper ad publisher ” explains Enrique Sacau  CEO of Kneip. “At the time  our founder Bob Kneip had identified two areas where financial market participants faced critical needs: the legal obligation to communicate about instruments domiciled in Luxembourg and those distributed in the whole world  and the need for teams and clients to receive training and information via overhead transparency.”Turning challenge into opportunityThe company initially focused on producing annual reports and legal notices  but it soon expanded its range of services to include the production of biannual reports in multiple languages and presentation materials. As the business grew and prospered  the company faced a challenge with the advent of the digital revolution because until then most material was paper-based. “We had to adapt and use technology to make clients’ communication more effective  consistent  and relevant ” Sacau says.The company faced another major challenge with the financial crisis of 2008 and the increase in regulatory reporting and transparency requirements that followed – a challenge that ended up being an opportunity for the company to better support clients. Since then  understanding the ever-changing regulatory landscape has posed plenty of obstacles for asset managers  one that Kneip helps them to navigate.It is in crises that we need to be closest to our customers to help them meet their challenges. Enrique Sacau   CEO   KneipKeeping abreast of regulation and ensuring data qualityThe company is independent and acts as a channel for clients to address general regulatory questions to EU regulators while maintaining industry focus. With Kneip  financial institutions can ensure compliance across MiFID  PRIIPs  AIFMD and UCITS regulations. Sacau explains: “Kneip works directly with regulators and industry bodies to anticipate regulations and understand their impact on our clients so they always stay ahead of the curve.”Alongside assisting with regulatory compliance  Kneip also helps to ensure the quality of data published by financial institutions  data that is critical to success in fund distribution. The company’s internal research shows that nearly four out of 10 data points suffer from inconsistency – which obviously poses operational and compliance risk.Acquisition by part of Deutsche Börse GroupOne of the company’s most notable developments in its history took place in 2022 when it was acquired by part of Deutsche Börse Group to create a leading fund data hub based in Luxembourg. “When we joined Deutsche Börse Group  we accelerated our investment in our teams and in Kneip’s growth  allowing us to unlock the full potential of the Clearstream Fund Services ecosystem for investment fund solutions. We can now deliver more value and place our clients on the best path for success ” Sacau says.We guarantee the highest data consistency on the market  which means lower risk of inaccurate data and increased exposure to potential investors. Enrique Sacau   CEO   KneipHelping to shape the futureKneip sees itself as continuing to guide the industry toward better handling of data  particularly in relation to regulatory changes. Sacau says the five crucial steps are consolidating all necessary data in one place  inputting all data at once  sourcing all outputs from one location  ensuring data consistency  and validating all data.“For as long as Kneip has existed  every player in the fund industry has dreamt of having a true transparent golden source of data for its business ” says Sacau  adding that emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain have a role to play in managing data but need solid governance. He says that with Kneip  clients’ data can be reused  disseminated  turned into regulatory outputs  and be accessed and consulted in real time  transparently  by anyone on the team that has fed Kneip that data.“For 30 years  this has been the dream of our industry  and Kneip has made it happen ” Sacau says.To find out more  visit our website,neutral,0.33,0.66,0.01,mixed,0.45,0.28,0.27,True,English,"['Luxembourg fund data leader', '30 years', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'true transparent golden source', 'Clearstream Fund Services ecosystem', 'leading fund data hub', 'newspaper ad publisher', 'five crucial steps', 'changing regulatory landscape', 'general regulatory questions', 'investment fund solutions', 'financial market participants', 'highest data consistency', 'fund distribution', 'fund industry', 'regulatory reporting', 'regulatory changes', 'financial crisis', 'financial institutions', 'two areas', 'critical needs', 'legal obligation', 'overhead transparency', 'annual reports', 'legal notices', 'multiple languages', 'presentation materials', 'digital revolution', 'most material', 'transparency requirements', 'asset managers', 'regulatory compliance', 'internal research', 'notable developments', 'full potential', 'best path', 'lower risk', 'potential investors', 'one location', 'emerging technologies', 'solid governance', 'regulatory outputs', '10 data points', 'inaccurate data', 'necessary data', 'compliance risk', 'industry focus', 'industry bodies', 'EU regulators', 'UCITS regulations', 'one place', 'real time', 'Enrique Sacau', 'clients’ communication', 'major challenge', 'data quality', 'Bob Kneip', 'clients’ data', 'CEO', 'founder', 'instruments', 'Luxembourg', 'world', 'teams', 'training', 'information', 'opportunity', 'company', 'range', 'production', 'business', 'advent', 'technology', 'increase', 'plenty', 'obstacles', 'crises', 'customers', 'challenges', 'channel', 'MiFID', 'PRIIPs', 'AIFMD', 'impact', 'curve', 'success', 'four', 'inconsistency', 'operational', 'Acquisition', 'history', 'growth', 'value', 'exposure', 'future', 'handling', 'relation', 'player', 'blockchain', 'role', '30 years', 'dream', 'website']",2024-01-11,2024-01-11,delano.lu

Sequentially  Q4 sales were up +9% compared with Q3 2023  which was the lowest point of the year.At the end of the year  Ekinops continued to suffer from a deteriorated market environment  marked by the macroeconomic slowdown and a drop in demand  penalizing sales of Access equipment. Driven by numerous commercial successes and new customer wins  the Optical Transport business line  on the other hand  posted strong growth (+27% over the year)  underpinned by operators' bandwidth requirements.Ekinops' consolidated FY 2023 revenue came to 129.1m€  up +1% Y-o-Y. At constant exchange rates  annual revenue was up +2%.+27% growth in Optical Transport revenue in 2023  -15% decline in AccessAs in2022  sales of Optical Transport solutions continued their strong growth trajectory  marking a further jump of +27% in FY 2023  particularly in France and EMEA (Europe - excluding France - Middle East and Africa)  thanks to the success of WDM solutions and new customer wins  notably in Eastern Europe.In Optical Transport  which exceeded its annual sales target  2023 was marked by a number of commercial successes in both the US and Europe  including a multi-year contract with German operator Deutsche Glasfaser at the end of the year to modernize and unify their optical transport network infrastructure using the Ekinops360 platform.Meanwhile  Access solutions sales fell by -15% over the year  including -25% in H2 alone. Beyond a challenging comparison basis (+20% in FY 2022)  business was penalized by (i) a slowdown in demand and increased caution among clients in implementing their investments  (ii) a high level of equipment inventories among major operators  and (iii) more difficult and costly access to financing sources for operators.Share of Software & Services at 17% of FY 2023 revenue  up +12%The contribution of Software & Services continued to increase  to stand at 17% of Group's FY 2023 revenue  compared with 15% a year earlier. In H2 2023  the share of Software & Services reached 20% of Group's revenue for the first time.Over the full year  revenue generated by Software & Services rose by +12%  driven by sales of network virtualization solutions  SD-WAN solutions and services.International sales up +8%  with double-digit growth in EMEA and North AmericaEkinops posted +8% growth in FY 2023 international sales  whereas revenue in France was down -11%. The share of business generated internationally totaled 68% in FY 2023 (vs. 64% in 2022).In North America  full-year revenue amounted to 31.7m€  up +6% Y-o-Y  despite a particularly demanding comparison basis (reminder: +56% in 2022). In US dollar  full-year growth stood at +10%. The region represented 25% of the Group's revenue in FY 2023 (vs. 23% a year earlier and 18% in 2021).The EMEA region recorded revenue of 53.4€m in 2023  a robust increase of +23% versus the previous year. This sharp growth was primarily driven by the surge in sales of Optical Transport solutions in the region  and especially in Germany and Eastern Europe. Ekinops generated 41% of its revenue in EMEA in 2023 (vs. 34% in 2022).Asia-Pacific  which now accounts for only 2% of Group revenue generated with just a few clients  was down -63% over the year (vs. growth of 38% in 2022).In its domestic market  sales were down -11% compared with 2022. Sales of Access equipment  the Group's core business in France  fell by -18% over the year  mainly due to the economic slowdown and high inventory levels at major operator customers. Momentum was nevertheless still strong in Optical Transport with a leap of +57% in sales over the year. Ekinops generated 32% of its sales volume in France in 2023 (vs. 36% in 2022).Confirmation of 2023 EBITDA margin target of between 13% and 17%H2 2023 was harshly affected by adverse market conditions in the Access activity  against a backdrop of economic slowdown and a high level of stocks at operators.For FY 2023  Ekinops confirms its EBITDA margin target of between 13% and 17%.Didier Brédy  Chairman and CEO of Ekinops  said:""Changes in the economic climate during 2023  affecting company investment policies and health  penalized our Access business in the second half of the year. In contrast  we significantly outperformed the Optical Transport market  both in Europe and the United States.After the low point of Q3  our aim is to generate a higher level of revenue in H1 2024 than that of H2 2023. FY 2024 revenue should be driven by a rebound in Access equipment sales as the economy recovers  and by the launch of a major new optical transport product over the summer.In terms of acquisitions  Ekinops' management remains fully mobilized  and we aim to complete one or more transactions over the coming months  while favoring non-dilutive financing.""Full 2024 financial calendar can be found here.All press releases are published after Euronext Paris market close.All press releases are published after the close of trading on Euronext Paris.EKINOPS ContactDidier BrédyChairman and CEOcontact@ekinops.comInvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92momnes@actus.frPressAmaury DugastPress relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 74adugast@actus.frLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/814911/4488743/Ekinops_Logo.jpgView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ekinops-2023-revenue-129-1-million-up-1-302031712.htmlSOURCE Ekinops",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.12,0.19,0.69,True,English,"[""Ekinops' 2023 revenue"", 'January', '01:19', 'optical transport network infrastructure', 'major new optical tr', 'Optical Transport business line', 'new customer wins', 'network virtualization solutions', 'constant exchange rates', 'challenging comparison basis', 'demanding comparison basis', '2023 EBITDA margin target', 'Didier Brédy', 'company investment policies', 'Optical Transport solutions', 'Optical Transport market', 'major operator customers', 'adverse market conditions', 'high inventory levels', 'numerous commercial successes', 'Optical Transport revenue', ""operators' bandwidth requirements"", 'strong growth trajectory', 'annual sales target', 'Sequential revenue growth', 'Access solutions sales', 'The EMEA region', 'Access equipment sales', 'FY 2023 international sales', 'major operators', 'telecommunication solutions', 'WDM solutions', 'SD-WAN solutions', 'market environment', 'German operator', 'domestic market', 'high level', 'equipment inventories', 'annual revenue', 'costly access', 'Access activity', 'Access business', 'leading supplier', 'audited data', 'quarterly decline', 'lowest point', 'other hand', 'Middle East', 'multi-year contract', 'Deutsche Glasfaser', 'Ekinops360 platform', 'financing sources', 'first time', 'North America', 'robust increase', 'core business', 'economic climate', 'second half', 'United States', 'low point', 'higher level', 'double-digit growth', 'full-year growth', 'sharp growth', 'telecom operators', 'sales volume', 'macroeconomic slowdown', 'consolidated revenue', '12-month revenue', 'full-year revenue', 'Euronext Paris', 'US dollar', 'Q4 sales', 'Q4 2023 revenue', 'Eastern Europe', 'FY 2023 revenue', 'FY 2024 revenue', '2023 financial year', 'full year', 'previous year', 'Group revenue', '+27% growth', '+8% growth', 'FY 2022', 'Jan.', 'PRNewswire', 'enterprises', 'December', 'IFRS', 'Q3', 'end', 'deteriorated', 'drop', 'jump', 'France', 'Africa', 'number', 'H2', 'caution', 'clients', 'investments', 'difficult', 'Share', 'Software', 'Services', 'contribution', 'surge', 'Germany', 'Asia-Pacific', 'Momentum', 'leap', 'Confirmation', 'stocks', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'Changes', 'health', 'contrast', 'aim', 'H1', 'rebound', 'economy', 'launch']",2024-01-10,2024-01-11,marketscreener.com

The Company reported positive pivotal Phase 3 data in adolescents two months ago confirming the immunogenicity and safety profile observed in adults1.There is currently no approved chikungunya vaccine for children and Valneva’s vaccine IXCHIQ® is currently the only licensed chikungunya vaccine2 to address this unmet medical need in adults aged 18 years and older who are at increased risk of exposure to the virus. Once available  the Phase 2 pediatric data are intended to support a Phase 3 pivotal study in children with the objective to extend the label in this age group following initial regulatory approvals in adults and possibly in adolescents.The multicenter  prospective  randomized  observer-blinded  Phase 2 clinical trial is planned to enroll approximately 300 healthy children one to eleven years of age at three trial sites in the Dominican Republic and Honduras. Following a safety run-in phase  participants will be randomized to receive either a full dose formulation of the vaccine (120 participants)  a half dose formulation (120 participants) or a control vaccine (60 participants).Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “This pediatric trial is extremely important. Given the significant threat that chikungunya poses to individuals living in or traveling to endemic areas  it is crucial to make the vaccine accessible to all age groups. By doing so  we can broaden the protection against and reduce the impact of this debilitating disease.”Valneva was granted approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its chikungunya vaccine IXCHIQ® in November 20233. Three marketing applications are currently under review by the European Medicines Agency  Health Canada and the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa) with potential approvals in 2024.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite4. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20325. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries6. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas7 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Before IXCHIQ®  there were no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.To make the vaccine more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15538. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20199  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About IXCHIQ®In the U.S.  IXCHIQ® is a live-attenuated vaccine indicated for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. As for all products approved under FDA’s accelerated approval pathway  continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.Please click here for full Prescribing Information for IXCHIQ®.About Phase 2 Trial VLA1553-221VLA1553-221 is a multi-center  randomized  observer-blinded  dose response Phase 2 clinical trial in approximately 300 healthy children aged one to eleven years. The trial will be performed at three trial sites in the Dominican Republic and potentially Honduras. The primary and secondary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two different dose levels of Valneva’s single-shot chikungunya vaccine. Additional information  including a detailed description of the trial design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT06106581).About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

The disbursement of the second tranche is expected to occur on or about January 18  2024. On January 4  2024  and in accordance with the Finance Contract  the Company issued 3 144 654 warrants to EIB.Jean Volatier  Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Inventiva  stated: “The drawdown of this second tranche of €25 million was triggered by the accomplishment of key milestones by Inventiva  and allows us to further finance our pivotal Phase III clinical trial evaluating our lead compound  lanifibranor  in NASH. Inventiva is a leader in drug development for the treatment of NASH and the financial support provided by the EIB through a facility loan totaling €50 million is a testament to the important work of Inventiva in the field. We are truly thankful for the support provided by the EIB.”As previously announced  the Finance Contract provides funding in two tranches of €25 million  each subject to the completion of certain conditions precedent.After the drawdown of the first tranche in December 20222  the Company was eligible to access the second tranche of €25 million if it met certain conditions precedent described below. Following the achievement of those conditions  the Company decided to draw on the second tranche to reinforce its financial position. The Company intends to use the proceeds to fund part of its pivotal NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in patients with NASH and estimates that  including this second tranche of €25 million of the EIB loan  its cash  cash equivalents and deposits would allow the Company to fund its operations as currently planned until the beginning of the third quarter of 20241.This second tranche carries a 7% interest capitalized annually  has a maturity of 3 years from the disbursement date and a repayment in fine. As a result  the Company expects to repay this tranche in early 20273  after the anticipated publication of the results of the NATiV3 Phase III trial evaluating lanifibranor in patients with NASH which is expected to take place in the first half of 2026. The disbursement of this second tranche was subject to  among other conditions  (i) the full drawdown of the first tranche  (ii) the receipt by the Company from the date of the Finance Contract of an aggregate amount of at least €70 million (inclusive of the €18 million that were a condition for the disbursement of the first tranche)  paid either in exchange for shares of the Company  or through upfront or milestone payments  (iii) an out-licensing  partnership or royalty transaction with an upfront payment of at least €10 million  (iv) operational criteria based on patient enrollment and number of sites activated in the Company’s NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in patients with NASH and (v) the Company issuing warrants to EIB in accordance with the terms and conditions of the warrant agreement entered into on July 1  2022.On January 4  2024  the Company issued 3 144 654 warrants to EIB  in accordance with the terms of the 6th resolution of the combined general meeting of shareholders of January 25  2023  and Article L.225-138 of the French Commercial Code  as a condition to the drawdown of the second tranche. This represents approximately 6.08% of the Company's current outstanding share capital4.The exercise price of the warrants issued in connection with the second tranche is equal to €3.95 and corresponds to 95% of the volume-weighted average price of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris during the last trading session preceding the decision to issue the warrants (i.e. January 3  2024).Pursuant to the previously disclosed warrant agreement  the warrants have a maturity of twelve years and shall be exercisable following the earliest to occur of (i) the maturity date of the first tranche (i.e. on December 8  2026)  (ii) a change of control event  (iii) an event of default under the Finance Contract  or (iv) a repayment demand by EIB under the Finance Contract. The warrants will automatically be deemed null and void if not exercised within the twelve-year period.EIB has a put option which may require the Company to repurchase all or part of the unexercised warrants then exercisable at their intrinsic value (subject to a cap equal to the amount drawn under the Finance Contract) under certain circumstances (for example  in the event of a change of control of the Company or on the maturity date of the first tranche or in the event of default). The Company (or a substitute third party) has a call option to require EIB to sell all shares and other securities of the Company in certain circumstances  including the warrants  to the Company  subject to certain terms and conditions. In addition  the Company has a right of first refusal to buy-back all warrants offered for sale to a third party  subject to certain terms and conditions.On the basis of the 3 144 654 new shares of the Company issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the drawdown of the second tranche at an exercise price of €3.95 per new share  the Company could potentially receive gross proceeds of up to €12 421 383. There is no assurance that EIB will exercise any or all of the warrants or that the Company will receive any proceeds from the exercise of the warrants.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs.

The allocation of LeasePlan’s purchase price to...,Ayvens progressed further in the integration of LeasePlan  which is proceeding according to plan.The allocation of LeasePlan’s purchase price to acquired assets and assumed liabilities as at the date of acquisition closing (22 May 2023)1 led Ayvens to revise upwards the value of LeasePlan’s net assets by c. EUR 230 million  as a result of the assessment of LeasePlan’s assets and liabilities at fair value2:Lease assets: c. EUR +380 million;Customer relationship: c. EUR +150 million 3 ;; Software: c. EUR -200 million;Other assets and liabilities: c. EUR -100 million.Subject to any final Purchase Price Allocation and/or acquisition price adjustment within one year from closing4  the goodwill recognized on the acquisition is reduced by c. EUR 220 million to c. EUR 1 390 million. This has a positive impact on the CET1 capital of c. EUR 220 million  in line with previous indications.Without pre-empting any potential impact from the accounting closure of its full year 2023 financial results  Ayvens expects its Q4 and full year 2023 results  whose release is planned for 8 February 2024  to be negatively impacted by:Purchase Price Allocation: c. EUR -45 to -65 million (pre-tax) 5   primarily due to higher rental fleet depreciation as a result of the lease assets’ upwards valuation  whose impact is partially offset by lower software amortization and the recognition of LeasePlan’s actual Used Car Sales results 6 ;  primarily due to higher rental fleet depreciation as a result of the lease assets’ upwards valuation  whose impact is partially offset by lower software amortization and the recognition of LeasePlan’s actual Used Car Sales results ; Accounting Marked-to-Market of derivatives: c. EUR -150 million impact on Leasing contract margin in Q4 2023  as a result of the recent decline in interest rates. While the stock of MtM of the hedging derivatives portfolio was reduced to c. EUR +65 million as at 31 December 2023 (from EUR +216 million as at 30 September 2023)  potential changes in interest and foreign exchange rates could lead to some volatility on revenues over the coming quarters.About Ayvens Ayvens is the leading global sustainable mobility player committed to making life flow better.

EUR 230 million  as a result of the assessment of LeasePlan’s assets and liabilities at fair value2:Lease assets: c. EUR +380 million;Customer relationship: c. EUR +150 million 3 ;; Software: c. EUR -200 million;Other assets and liabilities: c. EUR -100 million.Subject to any final Purchase Price Allocation and/or acquisition price adjustment within one year from closing4  the goodwill recognized on the acquisition is reduced by c. EUR 220 million to c. EUR 1 390 million. This has a positive impact on the CET1 capital of c. EUR 220 million  in line with previous indications.Without pre-empting any potential impact from the accounting closure of its full year 2023 financial results  Ayvens expects its Q4 and full year 2023 results  whose release is planned for 8 February 2024  to be negatively impacted by:Purchase Price Allocation: c. EUR -45 to -65 million (pre-tax) 5   primarily due to higher rental fleet depreciation as a result of the lease assets’ upwards valuation  whose impact is partially offset by lower software amortization and the recognition of LeasePlan’s actual Used Car Sales results 6 ;  primarily due to higher rental fleet depreciation as a result of the lease assets’ upwards valuation  whose impact is partially offset by lower software amortization and the recognition of LeasePlan’s actual Used Car Sales results ; Accounting Marked-to-Market of derivatives: c. EUR -150 million impact on Leasing contract margin in Q4 2023  as a result of the recent decline in interest rates. While the stock of MtM of the hedging derivatives portfolio was reduced to c. EUR +65 million as at 31 December 2023 (from EUR +216 million as at 30 September 2023)  potential changes in interest and foreign exchange rates could lead to some volatility on revenues over the coming quarters.About Ayvens Ayvens is the leading global sustainable mobility player committed to making life flow better.

It enables researchers to get deeper and more human insights than ever before. Using innovative in-house algorithms  proprietary AI and advanced prompt engineering techniques for ChatGPT  BARI was already able to deliver precise summaries and analysis of large amounts of data. Now BARI has become even more powerful.New feature: Professional automated moderationBARI has been levelled up with professional moderation skills: BARI adapts perfectly to the participants’ responses in terms of content  writing style and length. The questions and follow-up questions asked are always relevant to the qualitative project and go far beyond a simple “tell us more”. In real-time  BARI analyses the participant’s first answer and picks up the relevant part to ask for more details. This leads to even more detailed and relevant verbatims. Acting as a tireless assistant  BARI supports researchers 24/7 with consistently professional and equal-to-human moderation skills.BARI can be tailored to the needs of the individual project: researchers can choose between a completely automatic or a semi-automatic moderation  which allows the researcher to validate the proposed question before sending it. This can also be changed in the course of a project  for example  by switching to automatic moderation during non-business hours. The level of intensity can also be adapted to define the number of follow-up questions BARI will ask.BARI is professional  flexible and always available.Marc Bidou  CEO and founder of Bilendi  states:“Our AI  BARI  has become a key feature of Bilendi Discuss. BARI has been developed to make the work of researchers easier  acting as a real assistant to them. First by providing reliable summaries and analysis and now also by autonomously moderating qualitative projects. For us  reliable  professional and comprehensive results are always the essential principles when developing new AI-features – and there are more to come.”Next publication: 2023 revenues  February 27  2024 (after market close)About BilendiAt a time when the volume  variety and speed of data transmitted and exchanged are increasing exponentially  Bilendi provides an innovative technological response to data collection  management and enhancement.

BioSenic wishes her all due success in her new commitments in our company.About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in immune and autoimmune diseases. Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning and key strengths to develop  separately and in combination  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platforms1) The ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). BioSenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol.2) ALLOB  an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. After phase 2 clinical results with contradictory conclusions  BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (between early or late treatment).The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ● ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol. ALLOB  an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. After phase 2 clinical results with contradictory conclusions  BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (between early or late treatment).The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ● ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

The disbursement of the second tranche is expected to occur on or about January 18  2024. On January 4  2024  and in accordance with the Finance Contract  the Company issued 3 144 654 warrants to EIB.Jean Volatier  Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Inventiva  stated: “The drawdown of this second tranche of €25 million was triggered by the accomplishment of key milestones by Inventiva  and allows us to further finance our pivotal Phase III clinical trial evaluating our lead compound  lanifibranor  in NASH. Inventiva is a leader in drug development for the treatment of NASH and the financial support provided by the EIB through a facility loan totaling €50 million is a testament to the important work of Inventiva in the field. We are truly thankful for the support provided by the EIB.”As previously announced  the Finance Contract provides funding in two tranches of €25 million  each subject to the completion of certain conditions precedent.After the drawdown of the first tranche in December 20222  the Company was eligible to access the second tranche of €25 million if it met certain conditions precedent described below. Following the achievement of those conditions  the Company decided to draw on the second tranche to reinforce its financial position. The Company intends to use the proceeds to fund part of its pivotal NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in patients with NASH and estimates that  including this second tranche of €25 million of the EIB loan  its cash  cash equivalents and deposits would allow the Company to fund its operations as currently planned until the beginning of the third quarter of 20241.This second tranche carries a 7% interest capitalized annually  has a maturity of 3 years from the disbursement date and a repayment in fine. As a result  the Company expects to repay this tranche in early 20273  after the anticipated publication of the results of the NATiV3 Phase III trial evaluating lanifibranor in patients with NASH which is expected to take place in the first half of 2026. The disbursement of this second tranche was subject to  among other conditions  (i) the full drawdown of the first tranche  (ii) the receipt by the Company from the date of the Finance Contract of an aggregate amount of at least €70 million (inclusive of the €18 million that were a condition for the disbursement of the first tranche)  paid either in exchange for shares of the Company  or through upfront or milestone payments  (iii) an out-licensing  partnership or royalty transaction with an upfront payment of at least €10 million  (iv) operational criteria based on patient enrollment and number of sites activated in the Company’s NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in patients with NASH and (v) the Company issuing warrants to EIB in accordance with the terms and conditions of the warrant agreement entered into on July 1  2022.On January 4  2024  the Company issued 3 144 654 warrants to EIB  in accordance with the terms of the 6th resolution of the combined general meeting of shareholders of January 25  2023  and Article L.225-138 of the French Commercial Code  as a condition to the drawdown of the second tranche. This represents approximately 6.08% of the Company's current outstanding share capital4.The exercise price of the warrants issued in connection with the second tranche is equal to €3.95 and corresponds to 95% of the volume-weighted average price of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris during the last trading session preceding the decision to issue the warrants (i.e. January 3  2024).Pursuant to the previously disclosed warrant agreement  the warrants have a maturity of twelve years and shall be exercisable following the earliest to occur of (i) the maturity date of the first tranche (i.e. on December 8  2026)  (ii) a change of control event  (iii) an event of default under the Finance Contract  or (iv) a repayment demand by EIB under the Finance Contract. The warrants will automatically be deemed null and void if not exercised within the twelve-year period.EIB has a put option which may require the Company to repurchase all or part of the unexercised warrants then exercisable at their intrinsic value (subject to a cap equal to the amount drawn under the Finance Contract) under certain circumstances (for example  in the event of a change of control of the Company or on the maturity date of the first tranche or in the event of default). The Company (or a substitute third party) has a call option to require EIB to sell all shares and other securities of the Company in certain circumstances  including the warrants  to the Company  subject to certain terms and conditions. In addition  the Company has a right of first refusal to buy-back all warrants offered for sale to a third party  subject to certain terms and conditions.On the basis of the 3 144 654 new shares of the Company issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the drawdown of the second tranche at an exercise price of €3.95 per new share  the Company could potentially receive gross proceeds of up to €12 421 383. There is no assurance that EIB will exercise any or all of the warrants or that the Company will receive any proceeds from the exercise of the warrants.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs.

The Company reported positive pivotal Phase 3 data in adolescents two months ago confirming the immunogenicity and safety profile observed in adults1.There is currently no approved chikungunya vaccine for children and Valneva’s vaccine IXCHIQ® is currently the only licensed chikungunya vaccine2 to address this unmet medical need in adults aged 18 years and older who are at increased risk of exposure to the virus. Once available  the Phase 2 pediatric data are intended to support a Phase 3 pivotal study in children with the objective to extend the label in this age group following initial regulatory approvals in adults and possibly in adolescents.The multicenter  prospective  randomized  observer-blinded  Phase 2 clinical trial is planned to enroll approximately 300 healthy children one to eleven years of age at three trial sites in the Dominican Republic and Honduras. Following a safety run-in phase  participants will be randomized to receive either a full dose formulation of the vaccine (120 participants)  a half dose formulation (120 participants) or a control vaccine (60 participants).Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “This pediatric trial is extremely important. Given the significant threat that chikungunya poses to individuals living in or traveling to endemic areas  it is crucial to make the vaccine accessible to all age groups. By doing so  we can broaden the protection against and reduce the impact of this debilitating disease.”Valneva was granted approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its chikungunya vaccine IXCHIQ® in November 20233. Three marketing applications are currently under review by the European Medicines Agency  Health Canada and the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa) with potential approvals in 2024.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite4. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20325. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries6. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas7 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Before IXCHIQ®  there were no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.To make the vaccine more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15538. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20199  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About IXCHIQ®In the U.S.  IXCHIQ® is a live-attenuated vaccine indicated for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. As for all products approved under FDA’s accelerated approval pathway  continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.Please click here for full Prescribing Information for IXCHIQ®.About Phase 2 Trial VLA1553-221VLA1553-221 is a multi-center  randomized  observer-blinded  dose response Phase 2 clinical trial in approximately 300 healthy children aged one to eleven years. The trial will be performed at three trial sites in the Dominican Republic and potentially Honduras. The primary and secondary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two different dose levels of Valneva’s single-shot chikungunya vaccine. Additional information  including a detailed description of the trial design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT06106581).About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.
