From the series Still Life. Copyright Valérie Belin. Courtesy Galerie Nathalie Obadia Paris/BrusselsThe work of the acclaimed French photographer Valérie Belin is intriguingly positioned at the intersection of art and photography. Over the course of her career her image making has attracted significant international recognition. She is represented in many important private and public collections around the world. In 2015 she became the first woman to win the Prix Pictet. Her winning series ‘Still Life’ typifies her approach featuring arrangements of cheap consumer items in elaborate compositions that echo classical vanitas and memento mori paintings. At this point in our own development  Valérie’s brilliant playful mix of art and photography makes her the ideal Master of Photography. Silent Stories’ presents three decades of Belin’s works  reflecting an iconography that is deliberately silent through images that — in the words of their creator — ”are neither narrative nor documentary and tell no particular stories  but are designed to be seen as the mirror of fictions without words.

From the series Painted Ladies. Copyright Valérie Belin. Courtesy Galerie Nathalie Obadia Paris/BrusselsOne of France’s most popular and acclaimed photographers  Valérie Belin (b. 1964) investigates the tension between the superficial appearance of things and their true nature  between reality and artificiality. Often using the human body as a vessel for abstraction and projected meaning  she has photographed live models and mannequins  masks and card sharks  dancers and bodybuilders  questioning the construction and fetishization of mainstream beauty ideals and enduring gender constructs.On receiving the accolade  Belin stated:I am deeply honoured to have been chosen to showcase my work as the 2024 Master of Photography. For me  this award represents the recognition of 30 years’ work and will be an opportunity to show the Photo London audience the vitality of contemporary photography by women.Charles Nègre  Street Vendor  c.1852. Courtesy of Robert Hershkowitz Ltd.The Fair extends its celebration of French photography with ‘The Magic Art of French Calotype. Paper Negative Photography 1846–1860’  curated by Robert Hershkowitz. Its title references Francis Wey’s pronouncement in 1851 that “Photography has attained a magic feeling that neither painting nor drawing could have reached.”Hershkowitz explains the appeal of these early images:When the pursuit and acquisition of fine photographs became the common passion of a very mixed group of art savvy individuals and American and Canadian museums in the late 1970s  early French paper negative photography was considered the most desirable  the images the most intriguing intellectually  the prints the most delectable. This exhibition introduces this body of photographic work to a British audience; it is almost non-existent in British institutions with perhaps a few dozen examples buried among hundreds of thousands of British ones  and these never exhibited.A third exhibition will be presented by the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation marking the 25th anniversary of its collection — one of the most renowned international collections of contemporary photography  which comprises more than 2 300 works by 160 artists from 35 countries.Curated by Anne-Marie Beckmann  Director of the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation  and Renée Mussai  London-based independent curator and scholar  and member of the Foundation’s Advisory Board  ‘See/Change — Art Collection Deutsche Börse @25’ showcases current artistic positions and recent acquisitions centred around the theme of human condition.Sim Chi Yin  Shifting Sands #25  2017. © Sim Chi Yin.

This is a significant step for Kalray from a technological viewpoint and in terms of demonstrating the capability to support large contracts with potential to generate tens of millions of euros annually. We are now entering the operational phase of our engagement with a first order already signed for several hundred cards this year. This new milestone is the result of outstanding work from our teams  who I'd like to thank for all their efforts.""KALRAY CONFIRMS THE RELEVANCE OF ITS TECHNOLOGY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS LATEST GENERATION OF CARDSThe contract signed in November 2022[2] with a major US player in the industry covers the development and supply of acceleration cards based on new generation Kalray DPU processors  on which the customer will build its next generation of products and services.The key criterion in the customer's choice was the ability of Kalray's technology and its offering of acceleration cards to process data with the best performance/price and performance/consumption ratios.The first stage covered manufacturing a very high-performance accelerator card including four Kalray MPPA® CoolidgeTM2 processors  and its qualification in terms of performance  robustness and cost. The tests carried out during the qualification phase confirmed that Kalray's solution was a factor of 3 to 5 times better than the competition  representing potential savings for the customer of several hundred million dollars over the life of the project.In addition to this cost/performance advantage  Kalray's solutions have the ability to combine artificial intelligence with a wide variety of data processing  which traditional alternatives such as GPUs or FPGAs can hardly support.This first stage was validated by the customer  on schedule  and represents sales of $1 million for Kalray in 2023.LAUNCH OF THE PRE-SERIES PHASE  WITH THE FIRST ORDER ALREADY SIGNEDWith this first major milestone crossed  the client is now launching its second stage of pre-series production of its next-generation product  which will result in initial orders of several hundred cards for Kalray.Kalray has already received a first order in late 2023 of more than $1 million for the manufacture of several hundred cards.The third step will be volume production  which should represent orders of several thousand cards per year  over a period of at least five years  which should be starting in 2025.Kalray relies on the flexibility of its ""fabless"" model with industrial partners such as TSMC  the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer  or major card manufacturers to manufacture its hardware solutions. As such  no additional investment is required for Kalray to ramp up production capacities  which can already support several hundred cards per month and will rise to several thousand by the end of the year.This milestone demonstrates Kalray's shift of scale and ability to supply high-performance solutions to major players looking for a single technology for very large-scale projects. It also confirms the success of Kalray's first ""jumbo contract""  with potential future revenue of several tens of millions of euros a year.ABOUT KALRAYKalray (Euronext Growth Paris: ALKAL) is a leading provider of hardware and software technologies and solutions for high-performance  data centric computing markets  from cloud to edge.

This falls short of our expectations due to wait-and-see attitudes of select customers and the postponement of a large order with one of our biggest customers. That said  Kalray's 2023 performance confirms the company's solid progression and continued growth initiated two years ago.A notable highlight of 2023 was the successful completion of the qualification phase of our new AI-dedicated board in the scope of our ""Jumbo contract""  which is on schedule. We are now entering the operational phase with this customer  having already received an initial order for several hundred cards at the end of 2023.The progression of this “Jumbo contract” confirms the change of scale undertaken by the company  which in turn validates our ability to deliver complex projects on time  and our capacity to enter into – and manage – large-scale contracts. It also validates the relevance of our technology and offering in general.We look ahead to 2024 with confidence about achieving continued robust growth  driven by the gradual ramp-up of our strategic partnerships  in particular with Dell and JB&A  and the launch of new products designed to serve the increasing demand for AI and data intensive processing.”2023 REVENUE OF €25.8 MILLION  UP 57%At the close of FY 2023  Kalray posted consolidated revenue[1] of €25.8 million  versus €16.4 million[2] at the close of FY2022  representing robust growth of 57%  mainly driven by the storage market.The 2023 revenue breakdown is similar to that of 2022: 67% in software (primarily software and including support and related services)  and 33% in hardware (including acceleration cards and complete storage hardware solutions). Revenue is split evenly between Europe (including the UK) and the United States.A SIGNIFICANT ORDER FOR €3 MILLION POSTPONED IN JANUARYThe Group was unable to reach its revenue target of €30 million  set last September  mainly due to the postponement of a major order (for around €3 million) in the media and entertainment sector. This sector was largely disrupted throughout the year by ongoing negotiations between actors and studios  slowing down investment decisions in this industry.Initially scheduled for the end of 2023  this major order is now expected for January of this year. It follows on from a contract signed at the beginning of the year  which has already generated an initial order worth several million euros booked in the first half of 2023  illustrating recognition of the quality of Kalray's technological solutions for intensive data storage and processing  and the Group's ability to negotiate major contracts.As a result  the initial target of break-even EBITDA in 2023 could not be achieved. That said  Kalray expects a significant improvement in its EBITDA for the most recent fiscal year  where losses are expected to be halved in 2023 vs 2022 (2022 EBITDA came in at -€2.7 million).SUCCESSFUL QUALIFICATION PHASE FOR JUMBO CONTRACT - LAUNCH OF PRE-PRODUCTION PHASE AND FIRST ORDER WORTH $1+ MILLION RECEIVED AT END OF 2023As announced today  the qualification of its high-performance card prototype including 4 MPPA® DPU Coolidge™2 processors in the scope of the ""Jumbo contract""[3] has been validated by the customer.This milestone with a global high-tech customer attests to the quality and performance of Kalray's accelerator cards  capable of processing customer data with the best performance/price and performance/consumption ratio.Tests carried out during the qualification phase confirmed the gains of Kalray's solution (by a factor of 3 to 5) over the competition  representing potential savings for the customer of several hundred million dollars during the project's lifetime. Added to this price/performance advantage is the ability of Kalray's solutions to combine artificial intelligence with a broad spectrum of data processing  which traditional alternatives such as traditional GPUs or FPGAs find difficult to support.Now that this significant milestone has been achieved  Kalray is entering the operational phase of the contract with the launch of pre-series production for its customer  which will result in initial orders of several hundred cards. A first order was already received at the end of 2023 for $1+ million corresponding to the production of several hundred cards.The next phase of the contract is volume production  which could represent future orders for several thousand cards a year  i.e. annual revenues of several tens of millions of euros  over a period of at least 5 years  starting in 2025.ROBUST GROWTH EXPECTED IN 2024 WITH THE LAUNCH OF NEW PRODUCTS  THE RAMP-UP OF STRATEGIC DISTRIBUTION AND RESALE AGREEMENTS  AND A PROMISING MARKETKalray expects to achieve strong growth in 2024  similar to 2023. Kalray recently announced a distribution and resale partnership with JB&A  a leading distributor of technology solutions in North America (see press release dated November 27  2023). With this agreement  Kalray intends to step up the commercial deployment of its offerings in the United States. This agreement complements that signed with Dell Technologies  which is expected to gain traction in 2024.In 2024  Kalray intends to push two new products into the market:A new fast storage solution called NG-Box based on Kalray's data processing unit (DPU) integrated into the Dell PowerEdge R750 rack server  dedicated to intensive storage  in particular for the AI and data intensive processing market  and;A new TC4 card  which incorporates 4 of Kalray's latest-generation processors (CoolidgeTM2)  offering an alternative to GPU cards and validated in the scope of the ""Jumbo contract"" and whose availability will be extended to other customers in the first half of 2024.In view of the current sales pipeline  clearly ahead versus the same period last year  and the gradual ramp-up of its partnerships and new products  Kalray is confident about achieving sales growth in 2024 comparable to that of 2023 and in line with the momentum anticipated by analyst consensus.ABOUT KALRAYKalray (Euronext Growth Paris: ALKAL) is a leading provider of hardware and software technologies and solutions for high-performance  data-centric computing markets  from Cloud to Edge.

Last night  the US SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs  which feels like a big moment for the cryptocurrency industry. But what does this mean for ETFs  and what does this mean for UK and European investors?With me today is Monika Calay  Director of passive strategies research at Morningstar. Monica  thank you for being here. This feels like a big moment  like I said  but what is really the difference between this new spot Bitcoin ETF and the exchange traded products within crypto that already exist?Monika Calay: Sure. So the primary difference between a spot ETF and other crypto ETFs lies in the assets they hold and how they attract their value. A spot ETF like the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETF primarily holds the actual cryptocurrency itself  such as Bitcoin  it physically owns and stores Bitcoin  and the ETF’s value is directly tied to the real-time market price of Bitcoin. So when you invest in a spot ETF  you're essentially owning a share of the cryptocurrency itself  and its performance closely mirrors the price movement of that cryptocurrency minus fees and trading costs. But this is not the only way investors can access exposure to the cryptocurrency market. For example  some crypto ETFs may invest in cryptocurrency-related products such as futures  contracts  options  or even shares of companies related to the cryptocurrency industry. But compared to these structures  spot Bitcoin ETFs are an immediate improvement in purity of Bitcoin exposure.SK: So this story recently  it's been largely a regulatory one. So it's now been approved in the US  but what does it kind of look like in the UK and in Europe more widely. Is this something you think the regulators here are going to follow?MC: Well  Europe has taken a significant lead in the crypto ETP market in countries like Switzerland  Germany and France  where regulatory frameworks have paved the way for crypto adoption. In fact  just last year  we witnessed the debut of the first EU spot Bitcoin ETF  the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF  which listed on the Euronext Stock Exchange in Amsterdam. But it's important to know that regulatory approaches can vary across different European regions. In the UK for instance  the FCA implemented comprehensive regulations classifying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as  so to speak  restricted mass market investments. So these regulations include restrictions on offering derivatives or exchange traded products tied to specific crypto assets to retail consumers. So while Europe is leading the way  the potential adoption of similar measures by the UK and other European nations remains a topic of interest and I think monitoring how these regions navigate the crypto investment landscape will be interesting in the following year.SK: Who are these products really aimed at then – and for investors in in Europe  what sort of ETP should they be looking for?MC: Investors eyeing crypto ETPs should be aware that crypto markets are known for their volatility. Our research has shown that crypto ETPs may not provide protection against equity market downturns and they're not reliable hedges against inflation. As always  we encourage our clients to exercise due diligence and to carefully evaluate the suitability of crypto ETPs within their investment portfolios. Caution and a clear understanding of risks are key.SK: Thank you very much for joining today  Monika. For Morningstar. I'm Sunniva Kolostyak.What is the difference between ETFs and ETPs?
