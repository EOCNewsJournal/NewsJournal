Resolution on approval of the board’s resolution on a directed issue of units from the 12 January 2024 Resolution to authorise the board of directors to make minor adjustments of the resolutions Closure of the meetingPROPOSED RESOLUTIONSItem 2 – Election of the chairman of the meetingThe nomination committee proposes that lawyer Mark Falkner  Eversheds Sutherland Advokatbyrå AB  is elected as chairman at the meeting.Item 7 – Resolution on a) the number of members of the board of directors  b) election of a member of the board of directors  and c) determination of the remuneration to a member of the board of directors.The nomination committee proposes that the board of directors shall be expanded and consist of seven members without deputies and that Mats Fägerhag is elected as a new board member of the Company for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting. Furthermore  the nomination committee proposes that Mats Fägerhag shall receive a remuneration corresponding to the remuneration that the annual general meeting 2023 resolved would be paid to board members who are not employed by the Company  calculated pro rata for the period Mats Fägerhag is a board member of the Company until the end of the next annual general meeting.Mats Fägerhag brings automotive industry expertise to the board and will also from time to time work operationally in the company on specific issues.Mats was born in 1961 and holds a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Lund University.Mats has more than 35 years of experience from the automotive industry and has held leading positions within Saab Automobile  General Motors Europe  Volvo Cars  and Geely Automotive. For ten years  he has been the CEO of the Geely company CEVT  which  among other things  has developed platforms for Volvo Cars  Polestar  Lynck&Co  and Geely Automotive as well as autonomous vehicles for Alphabet-owned (""Google"") Waymo.Mats is currently also chairman of the board of Aliaro AB  and a board member of Systemite AB  CarlixKlippan AB  MedicSolution AB and Chalmers Industri Teknik. Mats also works through his own company as an advisor to various companies.Mats is independent in relation to the Company  its management and the Company's major shareholders.Item 8 – Resolution on approval of the board’s resolution on a directed issue of units from 12 January 2024The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve the board’s resolution on a directed issue of not more than 16 071 428 units  consisting of shares of series B and warrants of series TO8. The resolution shall otherwise be governed by the following terms and conditions.The new shares and warrants shall be issued in units. Each unit shall contain two (2) shares of series B and one (1) warrant of series TO8. The Company’s share capital may be increased by a maximum of SEK 321 428.56 through the issue of not more than 32 142 856 shares. Not more than 16 071 428 warrants of series TO8 shall be issued entailing an increase in the share capital at the utilisation of no more than SEK 160 714.28. The right to subscribe for units shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  belong to the shareholder Maida Vale Capital. The right to subscribe for units shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  belong to the shareholder Maida Vale Capital. Prior to the Directed Issue  the board of directors has considered the possibility of raising capital through a cash rights issue but has concluded that a rights issue  in comparison to the Directed Issue  (i) would be significantly more time-consuming and entail significantly higher costs and increased exposure to potential market volatility compared to a directed issue  (ii) would probably not be subscribed to the required extent  given the current climate on the stock market  without underwriting commitments being procured in order to ensure that the Company is provided with sufficient capital  which in turn risks incurring additional costs and/or further dilution depending on the type of consideration paid for such underwriting  (iii) would entail an uncertainty in relation to the size of the capital that the Company may receive from the Company's existing shareholders and (iv) would probably need to be made at a lower subscription price in view of the discount levels that have occurred on the stock market recently. Other alternatives  including the raising of a long-term loan  have also been considered but have either been deemed to entail too high costs or not to generate sufficient working capital and thus not to be in the interest of the Company or the shareholders. The directed share issue further entails that i) the Company's shareholder base is broadened with new investors with an interest in the Company and its development and ii) the Company's ownership base is strengthened by a number of existing owners investing further in the Company. In the board's opinion  the above provides a strengthened ownership picture. An increased ownership for certain existing shareholders with great commitment to the Company and its future development creates  in the board's opinion  conditions for stability and security for both the Company and other shareholders. Against this background  the board of directors has made the assessment that a directed new share issue on the proposed terms is the most favourable for the Company and its shareholders  especially since the Company is in need of immediate financing. The subscription price per unit amounts to SEK 0.14  meaning a subscription price per share of SEK 0.07. The subscription price in the Directed Issue has been determined after negotiations with the subscribers and corresponds to a discount of approximately 9.23 per cent in relation to the volume-weighted average price of the Company's share on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market during the period 27 December 2023 up to and including 10 January 2024 and is deemed by the board of directors to be on market terms. The premium shall be added to the free premium fund. Subscription shall be made on a separate subscription list on the date of the resolution. However  the Board of Directors is entitled to postpone the final date for subscription. Payment shall be made within seven banking days from the date of subscription. However  the board is entitled to postpone the final date for payment. Subscription can only be made in units and thus not of shares and warrants separately. Allotment may only be made in units. However  after completion of the issue  the shares and warrants will be separated. Each warrant of series TO8 entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share at a subscription price of SEK 0.14. Subscription for shares through the exercise of the warrants of series TO8 may be made during the period from 18 November 2024 up to and including 29 November 2024. The excess price of new subscriptions for shares through the exercise of the warrants shall be added to the free share premium fund. The warrants are subject to additional terms and conditions as set out in a separate appendix  including customary conversion terms. The new shares entitle the holder to a dividend as from the date on which the shares are entered in the share register. The board of directors or the person appointed by the board of directors is authorised to make the minor adjustments required for the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.A valid resolution under the proposal in this item 8 requires that the proposal is supported by shareholders holding at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Item 9 – Resolution to authorise the board of directors to make minor adjustments to the resolutions adopted by the Annual General MeetingThe board of directors proposes that the general meeting authorises the board of directors  the managing director or the person otherwise appointed by the board of directors or the managing director  to make such minor adjustments and clarifications of the resolutions adopted at the general meeting to the extent required for registration of the resolutions.OTHER INFORMATIONDocuments and informationThe notice  a form of power of attorney  and documents according to the Swedish Companies Act will be available at the Company’s office for at least two weeks before the general meeting and will be sent free of charge to shareholders who so request and provide their postal address. The documents will also be published on the Company's website  www.terranet.se  no later than the same day.Shareholders have the right under Chapter 7  Section 32 of the Companies Act to request information from the board of directors and the chief executive officer regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda.

It includes reaching a 100% passenger car battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales mix in Europe and 50% passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the United States by 2030. To achieve these sales targets  Stellantis is securing approximately 400 GWh of battery capacity. Stellantis is on track to become a carbon net zero corporation by 2038  all scopes included  with single-digit percentage compensation of remaining emissions.Supporting that ambition  Stellantis has secured supplies of EV raw materials through 2027 by signing key agreements around the world. Stellantis is also investing in the development of alternative technologies for energy storage  including solid-state batteries with Factorial Energy  lithium-sulfur chemistry with Lyten Inc. and sodium-ion with Tiamat.Tiamat is a spin-off of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and is leveraging its best-in-class innovations. The company will use proceeds from the fundraising round that includes Stellantis Ventures to launch construction of a sodium-ion battery plant in France for power tools and stationary storage applications first  and then targeting to scale-up production of second-generation products for BEV applications.# # #About Stellantis VenturesEstablished with an initial investment of €300 million  Stellantis Ventures is the first Stellantis corporate venture fund.

Those institutions with multiple-state regulatory exposure may have an even harder time keeping track of what needs to be done for each state-level jurisdiction. According to Wolters Kluwer regulatory experts Elaine Duffus  Senior Specialized Consultant  Compliance Solutions  and Kris Stewart  Senior Director  Specialized Consulting  there are four  state-level pain points that make compliance more difficult: information overload  increased regulation enforcement  compliance costs  and partially automated compliance systems.“It is essential to maintain full compliance with a growing volume of new rules and provide proactive guidance on those that may impact core business operations. In this context  effective obligation management becomes a mission-critical process  ensuring that rule identification  compliance requirements and operationalization occur effectively and systematically ” write Duffus and Stewart in an article for The Journal of Financial Compliance  “Simplifying US state-level obligations to help achieve compliance certainty.”With this level of complexity  regulatory technology can be a particularly helpful tool to address all four pain points.“As compliance burdens increase  cutting-edge technologies  such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-enabled solutions  can drive better insights and outcomes ” Duffus and Stewart argue. “Technology also permits financial institutions to deploy human resources more strategically. However  there are two critical things to remember about technology. One  it cannot involve a ‘black box’. A financial institution must be able to understand and explain how the technology they rely on works to regulators  auditors and others.”Second  Duffus and Stewart warn about the need for human checks and balances when using a technology that is based on AI. “Technologies such as AI cannot  by themselves  deliver an effective regulatory change management approach. By employing a combination of technology and regulatory experts who can validate the technology output  that is  an expert-augmented intelligence approach  a financial institution will have a complete and accurate picture across the entire enterprise.”“The reality is that technology accelerates time to value ” they write. “Machine-aided approaches enable complete rule book coverage and pre-emption guidance.
