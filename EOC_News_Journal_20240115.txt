This new European patent provides intellectual property protection for masitinib in this indication until October 2036.The same medical use patent strategy had been successfully pursued in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  with patent granted worldwide until 2037  and is being pursued in other indications such as multiple sclerosis  Alzheimer’s disease for protection until 2041  and in prostate cancer until 2042.MastocytosisMasitinib is positioned as a treatment of severely symptomatic systemic mastocytosis patients  including the subvariants of indolent and smoldering systemic mastocytosis  who are unresponsive to optimal symptomatic treatment.The Notice of Allowance (NOA) means that the European Patent Office intends to grant the patent application  EP3359195A1  after the completion of certain formal procedural steps. Once granted  the patent can be kept in force until October 2036. A European NOA is issued after an examiner determines that a patent application satisfies all requirements for patentability under the European Patent Convention.More specifically  this patent provides protection of masitinib and related compounds for treatment of systemic mastocytosis in a patient population presenting with at least two severe mast cell mediator release associated symptoms  selected from pruritus  flushes or depression (Hamilton rating scale). This patient population is consistent with results from masitinib study AB06006 [1] and also the on-going clinical development program of masitinib in severe systemic mastocytosis.“This is good news because it proves once again that the masitinib platform is protected for a period of between 12 to 17 years depending on the indication  providing enough time to complete the program until registration and to maximize revenues during the commercialization phase”  said Alain Moussy  CEO of AB Science.Masitinib has previously been granted orphan drug status in mastocytosis by the FDA and the EMA.Other indicationsThe same medical use patent strategy had been successfully pursued in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)  with a patent relating to with the treatment of ALS with masitinib having been granted in 14 regions to date: namely  Europe (patent EP 3240538)  USA (US 10092564)  Canada (CA 3018635)  China (ZL201780019760.9)  South Korea (KR 10-2293847)  Japan (JP 7250312B2)  Israel (IL 261856)  Australia (AU M53001274)  Eurasia (EA 201800499)  Mexico (MX 390495)  Singapore (SG 11201808106Y)  New Zealand (NZ 745778)  South Africa (ZA 2018/05810)  and Hong Kong (HK1261581)  protecting masitinib until 2037.Based on the same rationale  medical use patents have been filed for treating progressive forms of multiple sclerosis  Alzheimer’s disease  and prostate cancer with masitinib  which if granted  would protect the use of masitinib in these indications until 2041 (multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease) and 2042 (prostate cancer).Reference[1] Lortholary O  Chandesris MO  Bulai Livideanu C  et al. Masitinib for treatment of severely symptomatic indolent systemic mastocytosis: a randomised  placebo-controlled  phase 3 study. Lancet. 2017;389(10069):612-620.About Indolent Systemic MastocytosisIndolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) is a hematological disease characterized by an abnormal number and activation of mast cells in the bone marrow and other organs. The disease if characterized by multiple symptoms that are disabling and can in some cases be life-threatening. Symptoms associated ISM are predominantly associated with neurological disorders (depression  fatigue  cognitive impairment  headache)  skin disorders (pruritus  skin lesions)  flushing and gastro-intestinal disorders. ISM affects approximately 40 000 people in Europe and 25 000 in the USA. There is currently a high unmet medical need in this population.About masitinibMasitinib is a orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets mast cells and macrophages  important cells for immunity  through inhibiting a limited number of kinases. Based on its unique mechanism of action  masitinib can be developed in a large number of conditions in oncology  in inflammatory diseases  and in certain diseases of the central nervous system. In oncology due to its immunotherapy effect  masitinib can have an effect on survival  alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Through its activity on mast cells and microglia and consequently the inhibition of the activation of the inflammatory process  masitinib can have an effect on the symptoms associated with some inflammatory and central nervous system diseases and the degeneration of these diseases.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company submitted a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application to the US FDA in December 2023 having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a DSR clinical study is ongoing  seeking to confirm the strong efficacy seen in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort have been successfully treated and the randomized cohort of up to a further 30 patients will start following DSMB approval  planned for Q1 2024.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Forward-looking statementsThis press release may contain predictions  estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking statements.Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.
