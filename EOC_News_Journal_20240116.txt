34988,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/1/16/it-is-time-to-use-russias-frozen-assets-to-help-ukraine,It is time to use Russia’s frozen assets to help Ukraine,And as Europe and the United States both face crucial elections in 2024 that are likely to see calls to further diminish the cost to taxpayers for aiding Ukraine  harnessing Russia’s frozen funds appears not only an increasingly attractive solution but a necessary one if Western support for Kyiv is to be ensured in the years to come.,An estimated $350bn in Russian government assets have been frozen in Western accounts since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24  2022. These are not idle funds. In 2023  Belgium-based financial services company Euroclear  whose settling and clearance role mean that it holds 197 billion euros ($214bn) in such assets  reported that they produced at least 3 billion euros ($3.26bn) from interest.Given that the sanctions on the Kremlin remain firmly in place and Putin has shown no willingness to negotiate on his demand to annex one-quarter of Ukraine’s territory or to cease his attacks  how these assets can be harnessed to push for an end to the war or help Ukraine resist has become a key question for Kyiv’s Western allies.British Foreign Secretary David Cameron publicly opened the doors to the idea last December by stating: “Instead of just freezing that money  let’s take that money  [and] spend it on rebuilding Ukraine.” Meanwhile  Washington has privately circulated a plan to seize at least some of the assets although the administration of US President Joe Biden dithered on previous European proposals for such measures in 2022.But action speaks louder than words. The only material step taken thus far is one by Belgium  which is setting aside tax earnings thrown off by the frozen funds to aid Kyiv. Yet dangerous and deadly delays resulting from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Republican hardliners in the US Congress blocking direct financial and material aid have made the question all the more urgent.Washington and Brussels are ultimately likely to find additional funds for Kyiv  but both have already hinted that aid will be diminished compared to what Kyiv received in the past  even as Russia’s military spending grows by leaps and bounds. It is estimated that the Kremlin has budgeted some $140bn – or seven percent of Russia’s gross domestic product – for its military in 2024.And as Europe and the United States both face crucial elections in 2024 that are likely to see calls to further diminish the cost to taxpayers for aiding Ukraine  harnessing Russia’s frozen funds appears not only an increasingly attractive solution but a necessary one if Western support for Kyiv is to be ensured in the years to come.But the process of actually doing so has raised considerable debate among policymakers  historians  diplomats  academics  and international lawyers.As with the West’s initial sanctions response to Russia’s full-scale invasion  the term “unprecedented” has been thrown out quite a lot.Many opponents of seizing Russia’s frozen funds warn that the backlash for the West could be severe because it would establish a precedent for states to openly seize assets of other countries in response to their foreign policy decision-making. Ultimately they fear that this will cause third countries to potentially threaten the same against the West and that doing so will undermine the so-called “global rules-based order”.Others caution that it will accelerate the shift of countries away from the US dollar  which is what grants the US sanctions their extraterritorial reach by threatening access to the core trading instrument of global finance and trade  a cost far greater than aiding Russia  even for its allies and partners except those under sanctions themselves. This is why powers such as China and India are hesitant to openly aid Moscow  and only its fellow sanctions-stricken sovereigns like North Korea  Iran  and Syria do so openly.Those calling for hesitancy point to the expansion of the so-called BRICS alliance – which Putin has openly said should lead the way on finding an alternative to the dollar. But although Egypt  Ethiopia  Iran  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are now nominal members of the bloc  affiliated BRICS institutions remain largely toothless.Even the New Development Bank that is the most solid institutional creation of the founding BRICS members – Brazil  Russia  India  China  and South Africa – remains relatively small. It had just $26bn in assets at the end of 2022  and has suspended giving out new loans to Russia.BRICS members were not only too divided to take up the Russian suggestion of discussing a new currency at their South African summit last year  their fear of losing access to US dollars was so great they agreed Putin was to refrain from attending the meeting.The argument that seizing Russia’s assets risks accelerating de-dollarisation is sophomoric. It fails to consider the fundamental flaw at the heart of a structure like BRICS  or any other hypothetical political-economic tie-up of non-Western countries.For the major BRICS members not only have disparate and often competing geopolitical interests – which they may occasionally leave aside to ally around pushing back on US hegemony – but they also run substantial trade surpluses  i.e. they export more than they import.Thus  their borrowing needs are secondary to their need to find a safe haven for the earnings they gain from selling goods to the rest of the world  whether it be manufactured goods in India or China’s case or commodities in Russia and Brazil’s. It is not that the US dollar and all of Washington’s laws and regulations that come along with holding it is their ideal instrument for banking these earnings.But they need deficit markets like the US’s that import such capital to put their earnings to use. And unlike their own currencies  they want currencies that lack capital controls to ensure these funds can be moved abroad. The only real alternative to the US dollar – because it also lacks capital controls and is the currency of another large deficit market – is the euro.If the US and Europe do proceed as they should and seize Russia’s funds  it may increase some other countries’ desire to move away from the dollar  but it will not erase the structural challenges to doing so.The second reason for Western skittishness comes from the fact that they prefer to talk about operating in a “rules-based system” and to paint Putin and his ilk as the greatest threat to that system. Arguments that seizing Russia’s assets violates a principle of sovereign immunity or does not comport with principles or international law are baseless. The move is after all a response to Russia’s own violation of these principles and is only being held to account for its action.The idea that the international order is based on a series of rules or laws is fallacious. After all  even if there was the will  no other country had the ability to hold Washington to account for its 2003 invasion of Iraq and the devastating aftermath thereof. A precedent that would have raised the cost of doing so would be no bad thing.Solidifying the principle that unilateral aggression or annexation of territory should cause a sovereign’s position under international law to be weakened is precisely the kind of thing that a just rules-based order should seek to implement. If the West’s use of its financial might must make it right  so be it.Time is of the essence as Russia has substantially increased its missile and drone attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks and Putin seeks to further deter Western support for Kyiv. Seizing Russia’s frozen assets is not just the most effective way to ensure that Ukraine can continue to resist Putin’s onslaught  but it can also dissuade future such aggression by any power.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.,positive,0.63,0.36,0.01,negative,0.06,0.23,0.71,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'time', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'British Foreign Secretary David Cameron', 'Belgium-based financial services company', 'other hypothetical political-economic tie-up', 'US President Joe Biden', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'foreign policy decision-making', 'previous European proposals', 'gross domestic product', 'core trading instrument', 'fellow sanctions-stricken sovereigns', 'solid institutional creation', 'competing geopolitical interests', 'global rules-based order', 'United Arab Emirates', 'South African summit', 'New Development Bank', 'substantial trade surpluses', 'founding BRICS members', 'major BRICS members', 'Russian government assets', 'initial sanctions response', 'direct financial', 'Russian suggestion', 'other countries', 'global finance', 'nominal members', 'US Congress', 'new loans', 'new currency', 'US dollars', 'US hegemony', 'BRICS alliance', 'BRICS institutions', 'US sanctions', 'Western accounts', 'full-scale invasion', 'clearance role', '197 billion euros', '3 billion euros', 'material step', 'deadly delays', 'Republican hardliners', 'seven percent', 'United States', 'crucial elections', 'attractive solution', 'Western support', 'considerable debate', 'international lawyers', 'Many opponents', 'extraterritorial reach', 'North Korea', 'Saudi Arabia', 'fundamental flaw', 'borrowing needs', 'safe haven', 'idle funds', 'additional funds', 'frozen funds', 'third countries', 'Western countries', 'key question', 'Western allies', 'tax earnings', 'material aid', 'military spending', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'Euroclear', 'settling', 'Kremlin', 'place', 'willingness', 'demand', 'one-quarter', 'territory', 'attacks', 'war', 'Kyiv', 'doors', 'idea', 'money', 'Washington', 'plan', 'administration', 'measures', 'action', 'words', 'dangerous', 'Brussels', 'past', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'calls', 'cost', 'taxpayers', 'years', 'process', 'policymakers', 'historians', 'diplomats', 'academics', 'term', 'lot', 'backlash', 'precedent', 'Others', 'shift', 'access', 'partners', 'powers', 'China', 'India', 'Moscow', 'Iran', 'Syria', 'hesitancy', 'expansion', 'way', 'alternative', 'Egypt', 'Ethiopia', 'bloc', 'Brazil', 'fear', 'meeting', 'argument', 'de-dollarisation', 'heart', 'structure', 'disparate', 'ally', 'goods', 'world']",2024-01-16,2024-01-16,aljazeera.com

The company  which celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2023  also reported a substantial increase in sales in the fourth quarter of 2023  with 11 of the 17 implants for the year occurring in that period  resulting in a turnover of €2.8 million.The Aeson® heart represents a breakthrough in the treatment of advanced biventricular heart failure  offering a therapeutic alternative to heart transplants. The device is unique in its ability to adapt blood flow in real time to the patient's needs  without the risk of rejection or a heavy drug regimen.Throughout 2023  CARMAT expanded its commercial reach  training 41 hospitals across 12 countries to perform Aeson® implants. The company's manufacturing capacity has also increased  with the potential to produce up to 500 artificial hearts annually  starting early 2024. This expansion corresponds to a projected annual sales potential of around €100 million.CARMAT's Aeson® has been supported by leading cardiologists in Europe and the United States and is becoming a reference solution for patients eligible for transplantation. The company has enhanced the device's safety profile with software improvements that automatically correct potential malfunctions  ensuring uninterrupted patient support.Looking forward to 2024  CARMAT anticipates sales between €14 million and €20 million  with plans to train approximately fifty hospitals for commercial implants by year-end. The company also aims to carry out around thirty implants as part of the EFICAS study in France and reduce its cash burn by about 20% compared to 2023.CARMAT's long-term ambition is to make Aeson® a ""destination therapy"" device  a long-term support solution for patients not eligible for heart transplants. The company believes that Aeson® is the only existing device with the potential to fulfill this role due to its biocompatibility and safety profile.To support its objectives  CARMAT will soon launch a capital increase to extend its cash runway beyond the end of January 2024 and partially finance its needs for the upcoming 12 months  estimated to require a minimum of €50 million.This news is based on a press release statement from CARMAT  detailing the company's achievements and forward-looking plans.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

This new European patent provides intellectual property protection for masitinib in this indication until October 2036.The same medical use patent strategy had been successfully pursued in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  with patent granted worldwide until 2037  and is being pursued in other indications such as multiple sclerosis  Alzheimer’s disease for protection until 2041  and in prostate cancer until 2042.MastocytosisMasitinib is positioned as a treatment of severely symptomatic systemic mastocytosis patients  including the subvariants of indolent and smoldering systemic mastocytosis  who are unresponsive to optimal symptomatic treatment.The Notice of Allowance (NOA) means that the European Patent Office intends to grant the patent application  EP3359195A1  after the completion of certain formal procedural steps. Once granted  the patent can be kept in force until October 2036. A European NOA is issued after an examiner determines that a patent application satisfies all requirements for patentability under the European Patent Convention.More specifically  this patent provides protection of masitinib and related compounds for treatment of systemic mastocytosis in a patient population presenting with at least two severe mast cell mediator release associated symptoms  selected from pruritus  flushes or depression (Hamilton rating scale). This patient population is consistent with results from masitinib study AB06006 [1] and also the on-going clinical development program of masitinib in severe systemic mastocytosis.“This is good news because it proves once again that the masitinib platform is protected for a period of between 12 to 17 years depending on the indication  providing enough time to complete the program until registration and to maximize revenues during the commercialization phase”  said Alain Moussy  CEO of AB Science.Masitinib has previously been granted orphan drug status in mastocytosis by the FDA and the EMA.Other indicationsThe same medical use patent strategy had been successfully pursued in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)  with a patent relating to with the treatment of ALS with masitinib having been granted in 14 regions to date: namely  Europe (patent EP 3240538)  USA (US 10092564)  Canada (CA 3018635)  China (ZL201780019760.9)  South Korea (KR 10-2293847)  Japan (JP 7250312B2)  Israel (IL 261856)  Australia (AU M53001274)  Eurasia (EA 201800499)  Mexico (MX 390495)  Singapore (SG 11201808106Y)  New Zealand (NZ 745778)  South Africa (ZA 2018/05810)  and Hong Kong (HK1261581)  protecting masitinib until 2037.Based on the same rationale  medical use patents have been filed for treating progressive forms of multiple sclerosis  Alzheimer’s disease  and prostate cancer with masitinib  which if granted  would protect the use of masitinib in these indications until 2041 (multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease) and 2042 (prostate cancer).Reference[1] Lortholary O  Chandesris MO  Bulai Livideanu C  et al. Masitinib for treatment of severely symptomatic indolent systemic mastocytosis: a randomised  placebo-controlled  phase 3 study. Lancet. 2017;389(10069):612-620.About Indolent Systemic MastocytosisIndolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) is a hematological disease characterized by an abnormal number and activation of mast cells in the bone marrow and other organs. The disease if characterized by multiple symptoms that are disabling and can in some cases be life-threatening. Symptoms associated ISM are predominantly associated with neurological disorders (depression  fatigue  cognitive impairment  headache)  skin disorders (pruritus  skin lesions)  flushing and gastro-intestinal disorders. ISM affects approximately 40 000 people in Europe and 25 000 in the USA. There is currently a high unmet medical need in this population.About masitinibMasitinib is a orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets mast cells and macrophages  important cells for immunity  through inhibiting a limited number of kinases. Based on its unique mechanism of action  masitinib can be developed in a large number of conditions in oncology  in inflammatory diseases  and in certain diseases of the central nervous system. In oncology due to its immunotherapy effect  masitinib can have an effect on survival  alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Through its activity on mast cells and microglia and consequently the inhibition of the activation of the inflammatory process  masitinib can have an effect on the symptoms associated with some inflammatory and central nervous system diseases and the degeneration of these diseases.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells. Our programs target only diseases with high unmet medical needs  often lethal with short term survival or rare or refractory to previous line of treatment.AB Science has developed a proprietary portfolio of molecules and the Company’s lead compound  masitinib  has already been registered for veterinary medicine and is developed in human medicine in oncology  neurological diseases  inflammatory diseases and viral diseases.

Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning and key strengths to develop  separately and in combination  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platforms1) The ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). BioSenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol.2) ALLOB  an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. After phase 2 clinical results with contradictory conclusions  BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (between early or late treatment).The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ● ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning and key strengths to develop  separately and in combination  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platforms1) The ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). BioSenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol.2) ALLOB  an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. After phase 2 clinical results with contradictory conclusions  BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (between early or late treatment).The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ● ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

In particular  the binding term sheet for the indication chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD) license now provides for a royalty payment of 2% on worldwide sales  which simplifies the conditions for offering sublicenses to new external partners. In addition  under the license agreement  Phebra PTY Ltd. agrees that Medsenic SAS will have exclusive worldwide territorial rights for the use of OATO in GvHD.Regarding the MDA  Phebra PTY Ltd. agrees that the net profit allocation as stated in the initial MDA will be deleted for the sales revenues and profits generated from the sale of product  restricted to the indication cGvHD. Phebra PTY Ltd. also agrees to cover the costs of maintaining and updating the drug substance file to comply with the rules of all active territories; of controlling the compliance with various regulators on ongoing supplier approval and compliance to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) requirements; of updating the drug master file of OATO; of managing the Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO) and supply chain from the active pharmaceutical ingredient to the clinical release of the product and of covering the regulatory and quality and GMP expenses. To take into account these costs for Phebra PTY Ltd.  the cost-of-goods for the Medsenic final clinical OATO product will be increased by a mark-up of 20%.In addition  Medsenic will have the right to establish an Australian entity to use the OATO patents for cGvHD indication. The Australian entity will not commercially compete with Phebra PTY Ltd.  particularly in the field of APL (acute promyelocytic leukemia) cancer treatment  by having Medsenic's GvHD treatment produced in product-specific packaging.Prof. François Rieger  President of the Board and CEO of the BioSenic Group  said: ”Our collaboration and partnership with Phebra PTY Ltd. – a long term minority shareholder in our group – leads us now to an agreement on our licensing and commercialization of the oral formulation of our lead product  ATO  much in favor of a smooth development and increased interest of new investors to help make our lead project a success. Our goal is to provide patients with Graft versus Host Disease with a critical therapeutic solution to treat and control  if not cure  this terrible  unmet medical need that occurs after the transplantation of a foreign  functional immune system following the elimination of cancer blood cells. The radical improvement in the commercial agreement between Phebra PTY Ltd. and Medsenic should facilitate our task of implementing all the necessary funding for the few years of the cGvHD Phase 3 trial. It is clear to BioSenic that a successful cGvHD development program is key to the company's success  although parallel efforts to develop new indications/therapeutic applications for innovative formulations of ATO  as well as optimizing/licensing other earlier technologies  essentially related to the cell repair platform using GMP mesenchymal stem cells  may add significant value.About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in immune and autoimmune diseases.

In particular  the binding term sheet for the indication chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD) license now provides for a royalty payment of 2% on worldwide sales  which simplifies the conditions for offering sublicenses to new external partners. In addition  under the license agreement  Phebra PTY Ltd. agrees that Medsenic SAS will have exclusive worldwide territorial rights for the use of OATO in GvHD.Regarding the MDA  Phebra PTY Ltd. agrees that the net profit allocation as stated in the initial MDA will be deleted for the sales revenues and profits generated from the sale of product  restricted to the indication cGvHD. Phebra PTY Ltd. also agrees to cover the costs of maintaining and updating the drug substance file to comply with the rules of all active territories; of controlling the compliance with various regulators on ongoing supplier approval and compliance to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) requirements; of updating the drug master file of OATO; of managing the Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO) and supply chain from the active pharmaceutical ingredient to the clinical release of the product and of covering the regulatory and quality and GMP expenses. To take into account these costs for Phebra PTY Ltd.  the cost-of-goods for the Medsenic final clinical OATO product will be increased by a mark-up of 20%.In addition  Medsenic will have the right to establish an Australian entity to use the OATO patents for cGvHD indication. The Australian entity will not commercially compete with Phebra PTY Ltd.  particularly in the field of APL (acute promyelocytic leukemia) cancer treatment  by having Medsenic's GvHD treatment produced in product-specific packaging.Prof. François Rieger  President of the Board and CEO of the BioSenic Group  said: ”Our collaboration and partnership with Phebra PTY Ltd. – a long term minority shareholder in our group – leads us now to an agreement on our licensing and commercialization of the oral formulation of our lead product  ATO  much in favor of a smooth development and increased interest of new investors to help make our lead project a success. Our goal is to provide patients with Graft versus Host Disease with a critical therapeutic solution to treat and control  if not cure  this terrible  unmet medical need that occurs after the transplantation of a foreign  functional immune system following the elimination of cancer blood cells. The radical improvement in the commercial agreement between Phebra PTY Ltd. and Medsenic should facilitate our task of implementing all the necessary funding for the few years of the cGvHD Phase 3 trial. It is clear to BioSenic that a successful cGvHD development program is key to the company's success  although parallel efforts to develop new indications/therapeutic applications for innovative formulations of ATO  as well as optimizing/licensing other earlier technologies  essentially related to the cell repair platform using GMP mesenchymal stem cells  may add significant value.About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in immune and autoimmune diseases. Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning and key strengths to develop  separately and in combination  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platforms1) The ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). BioSenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol.2) ALLOB  an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals.

The client is an Australian-based player specializing in maritime data collection that operates several vessels in different continents. After a first order for a DriX drone in the 1st half of 2023  it is now equipping itself with a second DriX in order to multiply the operational capabilities of its vessels.This sale once again illustrates the structural trend for the adoption of drones to carry out missions in addition to or as a replacement for ships. The customer explains that ""autonomous surface drones offer the possibility of providing large amounts of data with low HSE risk at a potentially lower price than traditional operations. At a minimum  they should serve as a force multiplier for conventional survey operations. »This use of the DriX drone was recently highlighted by another client  one of the world leaders  which shared the results of a multi-drone operation off the coast of Australia: link to the video. During this 28-day and 18 000 km mission  the two deployed DriX drones collected 58% of the data for only 4% of the CO2 emissions. Without the use of these two surface drones  the mission would have lasted 73 days instead of 28 and would have emitted 150% more CO2 emissions  with a significantly higher operating cost.About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is the new name of the Gorgé Group  adopted after the transformation of the group at the end of 2022  now focused on the activities of its subsidiary Exail.

It enables us to accelerate our growth strategy 'EXPECT BETTER'  after already achieving global revenue growth of almost 20 percent in the first nine months of 2023.""AMSTERDAM & PULLACH  January 16  2024 - Premium mobility service provider SIXT and Stellantis  one of the world's leading automakers  announce they have come to a multi-billion euro agreement under which SIXT could buy up to 250 000 vehicles for its rental fleet in its corporate countries across Europe and North America over the next three years. First significant delivery volumes will take place as early as the first quarter of 2024 and will continue throughout the year.SIXT rental customers will benefit from an attractive choice of vehicles of Stellantis award-winning brands including Alfa Romeo  Chrysler  Citroën  Dodge  DS Automobiles  Fiat  Jeep ®   Lancia  Opel  Peugeot  Ram  Vauxhall and Maserati. The deliveries to SIXT will include a variety of classes from city cars to SUVs to vans and trucks (including 7- and 9-seaters) as well as a full range of propulsion types (including battery electric vehicles) featuring the latest software and infotainment tech features.Specific order quantities  order compositions and delivery dates beyond the volumes that have already been planned for 2024 can be flexibly agreed between both companies considering fleet requirements and demand.Additionally  Stellantis and SIXT will also explore potential cooperation opportunities in various regions around the world including Mobilisights  Stellantis' data as a service (DaaS) business  to provide and develop data packages for developing and licensing innovative business-to-business products  applications  and services which will be made available to SIXT. In the course of the deliveries by Stellantis  the number of fully connected vehicles in the SIXT rental fleet will increase significantly and thus the number of vehicles in which telemetry data such as fuel level and mileage can automatically be transmitted to SIXT when a vehicle is returned. This will allow SIXT to streamline handling at branches benefiting customers with even faster processing and even better vehicle availability.Carlos Tavares  CEO of Stellantis: ""With today's amazing announcement with SIXT  we deliver on our commitments to offer the customer clean  safe and affordable mobility seen now in breakthrough vehicles and technology. Within our iconic brands  we offer a vehicle that fits practically every need  price point  and lifestyle. This partnership with SIXT enables current and potential Stellantis brand customers to immerse themselves in our newest offerings with the most advanced propulsion  vehicle connectivity and thoughtful comfort.

This agreement with a progressive  full-range partner underscores our promise to provide our customers with the best choice for all their mobility needs. It enables us to accelerate our growth strategy 'EXPECT BETTER'  after already achieving global revenue growth of almost 20 percent in the first nine months of 2023. This ambition applies to European countries  but of course also to the U.S.  the largest rental market in the world and the most important growth market for our company.""Both companies are dedicated to making mobility more sustainable. As part of its Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  Stellantis announced the ambition of reaching a 100% passenger car battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales mix in Europe and 50% passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the United States by 2030. To achieve these sales targets  the Company is securing approximately 400 GWh of battery capacity. Stellantis is on track to become a carbon net zero corporation by 2038  all scopes included  with single-digit percentage compensation of remaining emissions.By purchasing Stellantis vehicles with state-of-the-art propulsion  including battery electric vehicles (BEV)  the agreement also aligns with SIXT's goal to significantly decrease the CO 2 footprint of its rental fleet (including the goal of reaching a share of 70-90 percent electrified vehicles in Europe by 2030). This is an integral part of SIXT's approach to environmental sustainability besides investing in its own charging infrastructure  further expanding the SIXT App into an ecosystem for sustainable mobility offers  including access to hundreds of thousands of public charging points as well as reducing the CO 2 emissions generated at its own branches and sites as quickly and as far as possible.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.
