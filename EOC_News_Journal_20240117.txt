35037,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/1/16/it-is-time-to-use-russias-frozen-assets-to-help-ukraine,It is time to use Russia’s frozen assets to help Ukraine,Western concerns about the transfer of Russian funds seized in the West to Ukraine are unfounded.,An estimated $350bn in Russian government assets have been frozen in Western accounts since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24  2022. These are not idle funds. In 2023  Belgium-based financial services company Euroclear  whose settling and clearance role mean that it holds 197 billion euros ($214bn) in such assets  reported that they produced at least 3 billion euros ($3.26bn) from interest.Given that the sanctions on the Kremlin remain firmly in place and Putin has shown no willingness to negotiate on his demand to annex one-quarter of Ukraine’s territory or to cease his attacks  how these assets can be harnessed to push for an end to the war or help Ukraine resist has become a key question for Kyiv’s Western allies.British Foreign Secretary David Cameron publicly opened the doors to the idea last December by stating: “Instead of just freezing that money  let’s take that money  [and] spend it on rebuilding Ukraine.” Meanwhile  Washington has privately circulated a plan to seize at least some of the assets although the administration of US President Joe Biden dithered on previous European proposals for such measures in 2022.But action speaks louder than words. The only material step taken thus far is one by Belgium  which is setting aside tax earnings thrown off by the frozen funds to aid Kyiv. Yet dangerous and deadly delays resulting from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Republican hardliners in the US Congress blocking direct financial and material aid have made the question all the more urgent.Washington and Brussels are ultimately likely to find additional funds for Kyiv  but both have already hinted that aid will be diminished compared to what Kyiv received in the past  even as Russia’s military spending grows by leaps and bounds. It is estimated that the Kremlin has budgeted some $140bn – or seven percent of Russia’s gross domestic product – for its military in 2024.And as Europe and the United States both face crucial elections in 2024 that are likely to see calls to further diminish the cost to taxpayers for aiding Ukraine  harnessing Russia’s frozen funds appears not only an increasingly attractive solution but a necessary one if Western support for Kyiv is to be ensured in the years to come.But the process of actually doing so has raised considerable debate among policymakers  historians  diplomats  academics  and international lawyers.As with the West’s initial sanctions response to Russia’s full-scale invasion  the term “unprecedented” has been thrown out quite a lot.Many opponents of seizing Russia’s frozen funds warn that the backlash for the West could be severe because it would establish a precedent for states to openly seize assets of other countries in response to their foreign policy decision-making. Ultimately they fear that this will cause third countries to potentially threaten the same against the West and that doing so will undermine the so-called “global rules-based order”.Others caution that it will accelerate the shift of countries away from the US dollar  which is what grants the US sanctions their extraterritorial reach by threatening access to the core trading instrument of global finance and trade  a cost far greater than aiding Russia  even for its allies and partners except those under sanctions themselves. This is why powers such as China and India are hesitant to openly aid Moscow  and only its fellow sanctions-stricken sovereigns like North Korea  Iran  and Syria do so openly.Those calling for hesitancy point to the expansion of the so-called BRICS alliance – which Putin has openly said should lead the way on finding an alternative to the dollar. But although Egypt  Ethiopia  Iran  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are now nominal members of the bloc  affiliated BRICS institutions remain largely toothless.Even the New Development Bank that is the most solid institutional creation of the founding BRICS members – Brazil  Russia  India  China  and South Africa – remains relatively small. It had just $26bn in assets at the end of 2022  and has suspended giving out new loans to Russia.BRICS members were not only too divided to take up the Russian suggestion of discussing a new currency at their South African summit last year  their fear of losing access to US dollars was so great they agreed Putin was to refrain from attending the meeting.The argument that seizing Russia’s assets risks accelerating de-dollarisation is sophomoric. It fails to consider the fundamental flaw at the heart of a structure like BRICS  or any other hypothetical political-economic tie-up of non-Western countries.For the major BRICS members not only have disparate and often competing geopolitical interests – which they may occasionally leave aside to ally around pushing back on US hegemony – but they also run substantial trade surpluses  i.e. they export more than they import.Thus  their borrowing needs are secondary to their need to find a safe haven for the earnings they gain from selling goods to the rest of the world  whether it be manufactured goods in India or China’s case or commodities in Russia and Brazil’s. It is not that the US dollar and all of Washington’s laws and regulations that come along with holding it is their ideal instrument for banking these earnings.But they need deficit markets like the US’s that import such capital to put their earnings to use. And unlike their own currencies  they want currencies that lack capital controls to ensure these funds can be moved abroad. The only real alternative to the US dollar – because it also lacks capital controls and is the currency of another large deficit market – is the euro.If the US and Europe do proceed as they should and seize Russia’s funds  it may increase some other countries’ desire to move away from the dollar  but it will not erase the structural challenges to doing so.The second reason for Western skittishness comes from the fact that they prefer to talk about operating in a “rules-based system” and to paint Putin and his ilk as the greatest threat to that system. Arguments that seizing Russia’s assets violates a principle of sovereign immunity or does not comport with principles or international law are baseless. The move is after all a response to Russia’s own violation of these principles and is only being held to account for its action.The idea that the international order is based on a series of rules or laws is fallacious. After all  even if there was the will  no other country had the ability to hold Washington to account for its 2003 invasion of Iraq and the devastating aftermath thereof. A precedent that would have raised the cost of doing so would be no bad thing.Solidifying the principle that unilateral aggression or annexation of territory should cause a sovereign’s position under international law to be weakened is precisely the kind of thing that a just rules-based order should seek to implement. If the West’s use of its financial might must make it right  so be it.Time is of the essence as Russia has substantially increased its missile and drone attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks and Putin seeks to further deter Western support for Kyiv. Seizing Russia’s frozen assets is not just the most effective way to ensure that Ukraine can continue to resist Putin’s onslaught  but it can also dissuade future such aggression by any power.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.,positive,0.63,0.36,0.01,negative,0.06,0.23,0.71,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'time', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'British Foreign Secretary David Cameron', 'Belgium-based financial services company', 'other hypothetical political-economic tie-up', 'US President Joe Biden', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'foreign policy decision-making', 'previous European proposals', 'gross domestic product', 'core trading instrument', 'fellow sanctions-stricken sovereigns', 'solid institutional creation', 'competing geopolitical interests', 'global rules-based order', 'United Arab Emirates', 'South African summit', 'New Development Bank', 'substantial trade surpluses', 'founding BRICS members', 'major BRICS members', 'Russian government assets', 'initial sanctions response', 'direct financial', 'Russian suggestion', 'other countries', 'global finance', 'nominal members', 'US Congress', 'new loans', 'new currency', 'US dollars', 'US hegemony', 'BRICS alliance', 'BRICS institutions', 'US sanctions', 'Western accounts', 'full-scale invasion', 'clearance role', '197 billion euros', '3 billion euros', 'material step', 'deadly delays', 'Republican hardliners', 'seven percent', 'United States', 'crucial elections', 'attractive solution', 'Western support', 'considerable debate', 'international lawyers', 'Many opponents', 'extraterritorial reach', 'North Korea', 'Saudi Arabia', 'fundamental flaw', 'borrowing needs', 'safe haven', 'idle funds', 'additional funds', 'frozen funds', 'third countries', 'Western countries', 'key question', 'Western allies', 'tax earnings', 'material aid', 'military spending', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'Euroclear', 'settling', 'Kremlin', 'place', 'willingness', 'demand', 'one-quarter', 'territory', 'attacks', 'war', 'Kyiv', 'doors', 'idea', 'money', 'Washington', 'plan', 'administration', 'measures', 'action', 'words', 'dangerous', 'Brussels', 'past', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'calls', 'cost', 'taxpayers', 'years', 'process', 'policymakers', 'historians', 'diplomats', 'academics', 'term', 'lot', 'backlash', 'precedent', 'Others', 'shift', 'access', 'partners', 'powers', 'China', 'India', 'Moscow', 'Iran', 'Syria', 'hesitancy', 'expansion', 'way', 'alternative', 'Egypt', 'Ethiopia', 'bloc', 'Brazil', 'fear', 'meeting', 'argument', 'de-dollarisation', 'heart', 'structure', 'disparate', 'ally', 'goods', 'world']",2024-01-16,2024-01-17,aljazeera.com

But cautioned that the devil was in the legal detail and that  even if it could be done  it would be no panacea for Kyiv.,[Source: Reuters]Western officials said in Davos they were open to the idea of confiscating $300 billion of Russian assets to help Ukraine.But cautioned that the devil was in the legal detail and that  even if it could be done  it would be no panacea for Kyiv.After President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in 2022  the United States and its allies prohibited transactions with Russia’s central bank and finance ministry  blocking around $300 billion of sovereign Russian assets in the West.Article continues after advertisementG7 countries are discussing possibly confiscating the frozen Russian assets  though some G7 members have concerns about the precedent  mechanism and potential impact of taking such a step against central bank assets.“The first thing you know is a ton of lawyers need to get involved. No decisions been made ” Penny Pritzker  U.S. special representative for Ukraine’s economic recovery  told a panel on Monday.“If a decision gets made it’s going to end up being collective. It’s a misperception to think this is going to be a panacea effect. There’s real effort going on but we are far from a conclusion.”Russia  which was not represented at Davos  has warned that confiscation of those assets would go against the principles of free markets and the Kremlin has warned it would seize U.S.  European and other assets in response to such a move.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last year expressed concerns about significant legal obstacles to confiscating frozen Russian assets  but more recently has embraced exploring the idea in a tighter funding environment.Another concern held by some senior Western officials is that confiscating Russian assets invested in government bonds denominated in euros  U.S. dollars and British pounds could undermine the willingness of central banks to store reserves with each other.The lion’s share of the assets – essentially securities in which the Russian Central Bank had invested – are frozen in Euroclear  a depository based in Brussels.Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told Reuters that he did not oppose the confiscation of the frozen assets  but there needed to be a clear mechanism.“We don’t say no to asset confiscation. But we need to work on a mechanism. For example  they can be used as collateral for raising funds for Ukraine ” De Croo said.“We are open to further discussion and are willing to participate in a solution of finding a legal basis for those transfers to Ukraine  without destabilising the global financial system ” he said.Some securities mature and hence are being converted into cash – a transaction that is taxed at 25%  he said.“If there is any taxable revenue  we will isolate it so it can go to Ukraine ” De Croo told Reuters in Davos. He said tax on the frozen assets totalled about 1.3 billion euros in 2023 and in 2024 would total about 1.7 billion euros.,negative,0.03,0.37,0.6,negative,0.03,0.25,0.73,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'panacea', 'U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo', 'U.S. special representative', 'U.S. dollars', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'tighter funding environment', 'global financial system', 'significant legal obstacles', 'senior Western officials', 'sovereign Russian assets', 'Russian Central Bank', 'frozen Russian assets', 'central bank assets', 'frozen assets', 'central banks', 'legal detail', 'legal basis', 'other assets', 'United States', 'finance ministry', 'G7 countries', 'G7 members', 'potential impact', 'first thing', 'Penny Pritzker', 'economic recovery', 'real effort', 'free markets', 'government bonds', 'British pounds', 'taxable revenue', '1.3 billion euros', '1.7 billion euros', 'panacea effect', 'clear mechanism', 'asset confiscation', 'Source', 'Reuters', 'Davos', 'idea', 'Ukraine', 'devil', 'Kyiv.', 'troops', 'allies', 'transactions', 'Article', 'advertisement', 'concerns', 'precedent', 'step', 'ton', 'lawyers', 'decisions', 'panel', 'Monday', 'misperception', 'conclusion', 'principles', 'Kremlin', 'European', 'response', 'move', 'willingness', 'reserves', 'share', 'securities', 'Euroclear', 'depository', 'Brussels', 'example', 'collateral', 'funds', 'discussion', 'solution', 'transfers', 'cash']",2024-01-17,2024-01-17,fbcnews.com.fj

As p…,"LONDON  Jan 16 (Reuters) - Global securities and banking regulators proposed a blueprint on Tuesday to bolster the market's ability to cope with extreme stresses such as those seen during the COVID lockdowns and the early days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.As prices for commodities jumped  buyers have had to stump up more margin or cash to back their trades at clearing houses such as those operated by LSEG  CME  ICE  Deutsche Boerse and LME.The shocks revealed some participants struggling to meet sudden jumps in margin calls  adding to a ""dash for cash"" that forced central banks to inject liquidity into markets.The Basel Committee  which draws up bank capital rules; IOSCO  a global umbrella group for securities watchdogs; and the allied CPMI global committee on market infrastructure and payments set out 10 policy proposals.They aim to ensure there is enough margin to back trades  and that market participants can better predict hikes in margin.The regulators proposed that clearing houses make available tools for users to simulate how much their margin would change in stressed markets.Clearing houses should be more transparent about how their models for calculating margins work  and disclose a new standardised metric for measuring the ""responsiveness"" of initial margin to changes in prices  the regulators said in a public consultation.Members of clearing houses  such as banks who act on behalf of end users like companies  should also provide greater transparency to clients and the clearers themselves.""Additionally  they should develop enhanced analytical frameworks for assessing margin responsiveness when passing on margin calls to clients "" the document said.Fewer than half of intermediaries surveyed said they could properly estimate increases in margin they could expect from clearing houses in volatile markets  it added.During the ""dash for cash"" some clearers overrode their margin models  making it even harder to prepare for margin increases.""Though relatively rare  there have been cases where market participants received no prior warning of model overrides and minimal ex post explanation for why such override was necessary "" the document said.""This proposal seeks to provide additional transparency around the CCP’s (clearing houses) use of discretion while preserving the CCP’s ability to deal with unexpected circumstances.""The proposals are out to public consultation until mid-April to give banks  clearers and other market participants an opportunity to comment before final rules are published.

The client is an …,"Official EXAIL TECHNOLOGIES press releaseParis  16 January 2024New order for a DriX drone for a global player in hydrographyExail Technologies announces that it has won a new order for its DriX autonomous surface drone for civil hydrography applications. The client is an Australian-based player specializing in maritime data collection that operates several vessels in different continents. After a first order for a DriX drone in the 1st half of 2023  it is now equipping itself with a second DriX in order to multiply the operational capabilities of its vessels.This sale once again illustrates the structural trend for the adoption of drones to carry out missions in addition to or as a replacement for ships. The customer explains that ""autonomous surface drones offer the possibility of providing large amounts of data with low HSE risk at a potentially lower price than traditional operations. At a minimum  they should serve as a force multiplier for conventional survey operations. »This use of the DriX drone was recently highlighted by another client  one of the world leaders  which shared the results of a multi-drone operation off the coast of Australia: link to the video. During this 28-day and 18 000 km mission  the two deployed DriX drones collected 58% of the data for only 4% of the CO2 emissions. Without the use of these two surface drones  the mission would have lasted 73 days instead of 28 and would have emitted 150% more CO2 emissions  with a significantly higher operating cost.About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is the new name of the Gorgé Group  adopted after the transformation of the group at the end of 2022  now focused on the activities of its subsidiary Exail.

Wendel trusts that shareholders will responsibly consider these proposals and bring their support as we believe they would significantly improve the governance framework as well as shareholder rights.The settlement of this ongoing corporate governance matter will allow IHS Towers to fully focus on the execution of its strategy and ultimately foster value restoration for all shareholders.AgendaWednesday February 28  2024FY 2023 results – Publication of NAV as of December 31  2023  and Full-Year consolidated financial statements (post-market release)Thursday April 25  2024Q1 2024 Trading update – Publication of NAV as of March 31  2024 (post-market release)Thursday May 16  2024Annual General MeetingWednesday July 31  2024H1 2024 results – Publication of NAV as of June 30  2024  and condensed Half-Year consolidated financial statements (post-market release)Thursday October 24  2024Q3 2024 Trading update – Publication of NAV as of September 30  2024 (post-market release)Thursday December 5  20242024 Investor DayAbout WendelWendel is one of Europe’s leading listed investment firms.

Wendel trusts that shareholders will responsibly consider these proposals and bring their support as we believe they would significantly improve the governance framework as well as shareholder rights.The settlement of this ongoing corporate governance matter will allow IHS Towers to fully focus on the execution of its strategy and ultimately foster value restoration for all shareholders.AgendaWednesday February 28  2024FY 2023 results – Publication of NAV as of December 31  2023  and Full-Year consolidated financial statements (post-market release)Thursday April 25  2024Q1 2024 Trading update – Publication of NAV as of March 31  2024 (post-market release)Thursday May 16  2024Annual General MeetingWednesday July 31  2024H1 2024 results – Publication of NAV as of June 30  2024  and condensed Half-Year consolidated financial statements (post-market release)Thursday October 24  2024Q3 2024 Trading update – Publication of NAV as of September 30  2024 (post-market release)Thursday December 5  20242024 Investor DayAbout WendelWendel is one of Europe’s leading listed investment firms.

Following this private placement  the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient  based on the current scope of activities  to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2025.2023 operational highlightsMultiplex short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA) non-gene edited technology – All along 2023  we have collected and presented data validating our shRNA multiplexing approach: We developed a chimeric micro-RNA (miRNA) cluster to enable multiplexing of shRNAs  designed for easy  efficient  and tunable downregulation of up to four target genes simultaneously in CAR T-cells; Results detailing the technical aspects of the development of this platform have been published in Molecular Therapy – Nucleic Acids (Mol Ther Nucleic Acids. 2023  34:102038). This publication has raised much interest from the community and was subjected to an editorial comment in the same volume of the Journal (Mol Ther Nucleic Acids. 2023  34:102077); Additional data which demonstrate feasibility of this approach in the context of allogeneic cell therapies or with the aim to create therapies able to overcome the coinhibitory effects of exhaustion markers were presented at several scientific conferences. Posters are available on the company’s website  at https://celyad.com/our-science-technology/publications/ .All along 2023  we have collected and presented data validating our shRNA multiplexing approach:Multispecific NKG2D-based CAR T-cell platform – In 2023  we have compiled and presented data validating our multispecific approach targeting NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL): We have developed different CD19/NKG2DL  BCMA/NKG2DL and PSMA/NKG2DL multispecific CAR T-cells  utilizing both tandem constructs – that encompass the extracellular domain of the natural NKG2D receptor fused to a scFv targeting CD19  BCMA or PSMA  or dual constructs – that co-express the NKG2D-based CAR with an anti-CD19  anti-BCMA or anti-PSMA CAR  respectively; Our data provides the proof-of-concept that NKG2DL are valuable targets in a multispecific CAR approach and demonstrate our CD19/NKG2DL multispecific CAR T-cells are highly effective to counteract relapses due to CD19 antigen loss in vivo. In vitro data generated with BCMA/NKG2DL and PSMA/NKG2DL multispecific CAR T-cells further validate this approach in other hematological and solid indications. Posters are available on the company’s website  at https://celyad.com/our-science-technology/publications/ .In 2023  we have compiled and presented data validating our multispecific approach targeting NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL):Financial highlightsAs of December 31  2023  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €3.0 million and short-term investments of €4.0 million. The Company projects that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short-term investments should be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2025. Therefore  the Company continues to project that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its estimated operating and capital expenditures over at least the next 12 months from the date of this press release.Outlook for 2024More data and evidence in the context of the multispecific CAR T-cell platform and shRNA multiplexing approach will be shared in the first half of 2024  with the aim to develop assets ready for a potential initiation of clinical trials either by the Company and/or through strategic partnerships afterwards.Celyad Oncology will attend the 7th CAR-TCR Europe summit in London  UK (February 27-29  2024)  the must-attend forum to brainstorm and stay at the forefront of cell therapy innovations.Financial Calendar 2024April 5th  2024 Full Year 2023 Financial Results May 6th  2024 Annual shareholders meeting August 6th  2024 First Half 2024 Interim ResultsThe financial calendar is communicated on an indicative basis and may be subject to change.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a cutting-edge biotechnology company dedicated to pioneering the discovery and advancement of revolutionary technologies for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells.

The Company expects to announce topline results from the INITIUM trial in March 2024.The randomized Phase II clinical trial results will provide comparative data on efficacy and safety for UV1 vaccination added to standard-of-care immunotherapy  ipilimumab and nivolumab  in patients with unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma.Oslo  January 16  2024: Ultimovacs ASA (“Ultimovacs”) (OSE ULTI)  a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines  today announced that the last patient enrolled in the INITIUM trial has now been followed for 18 months  thereby enabling readout of the primary endpoint. The Company expects to announce topline results from the randomized Phase II clinical trial in March this year.The first patient was enrolled in INITIUM in June 2020  and the trial completed enrollment of 156 patients in July 2022. As per the original study protocol  data analysis was planned to be initiated after disease progression or death had been verified in 70 patients  which was initially estimated to occur by the first half of 2023. It has taken longer than anticipated for the participants in INITIUM to experience disease progression or death compared with the historical reference data.The INITIUM protocol was therefore amended late 2023 to allow data readout based on a minimum of 18 months of follow-up of all evaluable patients. The amendment was agreed to by the relevant regulatory authorities in the countries where the trial has been conducted. The protocol amendment will maintain the integrity of the study statistics without materially affecting the scientific value of the clinical trial.The patients in the INITIUM trial have been followed for a range of 18 to 42 months with an expected median observation time of approximately 24 months. The patients will continue being followed for survival for an additional two years.“The initiation of the process for the INITIUM readout marks a noteworthy milestone in Ultimovacs’ clinical development program for UV1. We look forward to announcing the topline results in March this year and plan to present the full data thereafter at a medical conference and in a publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal ” said Carlos de Sousa  CEO of Ultimovacs. “There remains an unmet need in the treatment of metastatic melanoma  and UV1 has shown significant potential to be a therapeutic option for these advanced-stage patients. The INITIUM results and additional upcoming Phase II data readouts will be the basis for our next steps in advancing UV1  as we seek to bring UV1 to the patients as quickly as possible.”The INITIUM clinical trial ( NCT04382664 ) evaluates Ultimovacs’ universal cancer vaccine  UV1  as first-line treatment in unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma in combination with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab and CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are considered the “gold standard” treatment for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who can tolerate the potential toxicity.The randomized Phase II clinical trial results will provide comparative data on the efficacy and safety of UV1 vaccination added to the standard-of-care immunotherapy. The primary endpoint of the INITIUM trial is progression-free survival (PFS) as per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS)  objective response rate (ORR)  duration of response (DOR)  and safety of UV1 vaccination in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab.Ultimovacs has received a dual Fast Track designation from the FDA  granted in October 2021   for UV1 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma – either as add-on therapy to pembrolizumab or as add-on therapy to ipilimumab. In December 2021   UV1 was granted Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for treatment of stage IIB-IV melanoma.==ENDS==About INITIUMINITIUM is an Ultimovacs-sponsored randomized  comparative  multicenter Phase II clinical trial in which the universal cancer vaccine UV1 will be evaluated in combination with the checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab and nivolumab for first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma. The first patient received treatment in the INITIUM trial in June 2020  and the last patient was enrolled in July 2022. The trial is being conducted at 39 hospitals across the U.S.  U.K.  Belgium  and Norway. The initial study design called for enrollment of 154 patients. Two additional patients were enrolled  bringing the total number of patients to 156.About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines with broad applicability. Ultimovacs’ lead cancer vaccine candidate UV1 is directed against human telomerase (hTERT)  an antigen present in 85-90% of cancers in all stages of tumor growth. A broad clinical program  with Phase II trials in five cancer indications enrolling more than 670 patients  aims to demonstrate UV1’s impact in combination with other immunotherapies in multiple cancer types expressing telomerase and where patients have unmet medical needs. UV1 is universal  off-the-shelf and easy to use. UV1 is a patented technology owned by Ultimovacs.In addition  Ultimovacs holds all rights to the proprietary TET technology platform for any possible future formulations use in various solid tumor indications. The Company is listed on the Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE: ULTI).About the UV1 Phase II programThe immunotherapeutic cancer vaccine UV1 is investigated in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in patients with various cancer indications with diverse tumor biology. The diversity of the UV1 Phase II program places Ultimovacs in a favorable position to capture the cancer vaccine’s potential broad applicability when combined with checkpoint inhibitors:INITIUM : Evaluating UV1 in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab as first-line treatment for patients with malignant melanoma.

The investigator-initiated trial is led by Vestre Viken (Drammen Hospital) and supported by Ultimovacs.About UV1UV1 is a universal cancer vaccine designed to induce a specific T-cell response against telomerase. UV1 consists of long  synthetic peptides representing a sequence in the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase (hTERT)  shown to induce CD4+ T-cells. These CD4+ T-cells have the potential to provide inflammatory signals  and T-cell support is believed to be critical for triggering a strong anti-tumor immune response. Following intradermal injection  antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin are exposed to the vaccine peptides. These APCs will process the peptides and present vaccine epitopes on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules to naïve T-cells in the lymph nodes. Activated vaccine-specific T-cells will then enter the circulation and search for cells displaying their cognate antigen in the context of HLA molecules.The UV1 peptides contain several epitopes  shown to be non-restrictive in terms of (HLA) alleles for presentation. It is  therefore  not required to perform HLA pre-screening of patients  which potentially enables broad population utilization of the vaccine. UV1 is administered over three months with eight intradermal injections and the immune-modulator GM-CSF.For further information  please contact:Carlos de Sousa  CEOEmail: carlos.desousa@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 908 92507Anne Worsøe  Head of Investor RelationsEmail: anne.worsoe@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 90686815This information is considered to be inside information pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 in the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYVolta Finance posted yet another positive monthly performance of +0.6% in December 2023. This concluded a calendar year where Volta recorded a positive production each month of year to the exception of March (-1.5% MoM) and June (flat). All-in  the year-to-date performance settled at +22.0%  Volta’s strongest since 2013.Despite challenges stemming from geopolitical tensions and Central Bank policy anticipations  broader markets remained composed in December and managed to shrug volatility off as central banks indicated by mid-month that they would maintain rates unchanged. This essentially signaled a pause in the rate hikes cycle as the Federal Reserve acknowledged indications of softer economic growth  prompting traders to price three rate cuts for 2024. Fixed income markets rallied  for instance both Investment Grade and High Yield spreads tightened over the quarter.In the CLO space  market remained active both in Primary and Secondary. As Primary gradually slowed down into Christmas  spreads tightened significantly across all rated tranches and lifted valuations up. We saw notably a decent appetite on low mezzanine assets especially for tranches that had underperformed their peers price-wise due to worsening collaterals quality. A pivot in rates may provide relief to the weakest companies those CLOs are specifically exposed to  prompting bids up.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: +1.0% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +4.0% for CLO Equity tranches  +5.0% for CLO Debt tranches and -5.9% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS. Note that the dividend recorded in December and to be paid in January was included in the +0.6% performance mentioned above.In terms of fund management  while Volta’s 2015-3 Equity piece from Oak Hill Advisors was redeemed  USD 5.00mm of BB-rated risk (+885bps) as well as EUR 2.00mm of Single-B risk (+1125bps) were sourced  both from the Primary market since it offered better value and cleaner collateral pools compared to the Secondary offerings that were available.As of end of December 2023  Volta’s NAV was €245.1m  i.e. €6.70 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 7.16% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.72% as at 21 December 2023  5.44% as at 30 November.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A.

The Company expects to announce topline results from the INITIUM trial in March 2024.The randomized Phase II clinical trial results will provide comparative data on efficacy and safety for UV1 vaccination added to standard-of-care immunotherapy  ipilimumab and nivolumab  in patients with unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma.Oslo  January 16  2024: Ultimovacs ASA (“Ultimovacs”) (OSE ULTI)  a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines  today announced that the last patient enrolled in the INITIUM trial has now been followed for 18 months  thereby enabling readout of the primary endpoint. The Company expects to announce topline results from the randomized Phase II clinical trial in March this year.The first patient was enrolled in INITIUM in June 2020  and the trial completed enrollment of 156 patients in July 2022. As per the original study protocol  data analysis was planned to be initiated after disease progression or death had been verified in 70 patients  which was initially estimated to occur by the first half of 2023. It has taken longer than anticipated for the participants in INITIUM to experience disease progression or death compared with the historical reference data.The INITIUM protocol was therefore amended late 2023 to allow data readout based on a minimum of 18 months of follow-up of all evaluable patients. The amendment was agreed to by the relevant regulatory authorities in the countries where the trial has been conducted. The protocol amendment will maintain the integrity of the study statistics without materially affecting the scientific value of the clinical trial.The patients in the INITIUM trial have been followed for a range of 18 to 42 months with an expected median observation time of approximately 24 months. The patients will continue being followed for survival for an additional two years.“The initiation of the process for the INITIUM readout marks a noteworthy milestone in Ultimovacs’ clinical development program for UV1. We look forward to announcing the topline results in March this year and plan to present the full data thereafter at a medical conference and in a publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal ” said Carlos de Sousa  CEO of Ultimovacs. “There remains an unmet need in the treatment of metastatic melanoma  and UV1 has shown significant potential to be a therapeutic option for these advanced-stage patients. The INITIUM results and additional upcoming Phase II data readouts will be the basis for our next steps in advancing UV1  as we seek to bring UV1 to the patients as quickly as possible.”The INITIUM clinical trial ( NCT04382664 ) evaluates Ultimovacs’ universal cancer vaccine  UV1  as first-line treatment in unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma in combination with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab and CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are considered the “gold standard” treatment for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who can tolerate the potential toxicity.The randomized Phase II clinical trial results will provide comparative data on the efficacy and safety of UV1 vaccination added to the standard-of-care immunotherapy. The primary endpoint of the INITIUM trial is progression-free survival (PFS) as per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS)  objective response rate (ORR)  duration of response (DOR)  and safety of UV1 vaccination in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab.Ultimovacs has received a dual Fast Track designation from the FDA  granted in October 2021   for UV1 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma – either as add-on therapy to pembrolizumab or as add-on therapy to ipilimumab. In December 2021   UV1 was granted Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for treatment of stage IIB-IV melanoma.==ENDS==About INITIUMINITIUM is an Ultimovacs-sponsored randomized  comparative  multicenter Phase II clinical trial in which the universal cancer vaccine UV1 will be evaluated in combination with the checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab and nivolumab for first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma. The first patient received treatment in the INITIUM trial in June 2020  and the last patient was enrolled in July 2022. The trial is being conducted at 39 hospitals across the U.S.  U.K.  Belgium  and Norway. The initial study design called for enrollment of 154 patients. Two additional patients were enrolled  bringing the total number of patients to 156.About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines with broad applicability. Ultimovacs’ lead cancer vaccine candidate UV1 is directed against human telomerase (hTERT)  an antigen present in 85-90% of cancers in all stages of tumor growth. A broad clinical program  with Phase II trials in five cancer indications enrolling more than 670 patients  aims to demonstrate UV1’s impact in combination with other immunotherapies in multiple cancer types expressing telomerase and where patients have unmet medical needs. UV1 is universal  off-the-shelf and easy to use. UV1 is a patented technology owned by Ultimovacs.In addition  Ultimovacs holds all rights to the proprietary TET technology platform for any possible future formulations use in various solid tumor indications. The Company is listed on the Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE: ULTI).About the UV1 Phase II programThe immunotherapeutic cancer vaccine UV1 is investigated in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in patients with various cancer indications with diverse tumor biology. The diversity of the UV1 Phase II program places Ultimovacs in a favorable position to capture the cancer vaccine’s potential broad applicability when combined with checkpoint inhibitors:INITIUM : Evaluating UV1 in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab as first-line treatment for patients with malignant melanoma.

The investigator-initiated trial is led by Vestre Viken (Drammen Hospital) and supported by Ultimovacs.About UV1UV1 is a universal cancer vaccine designed to induce a specific T-cell response against telomerase. UV1 consists of long  synthetic peptides representing a sequence in the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase (hTERT)  shown to induce CD4+ T-cells. These CD4+ T-cells have the potential to provide inflammatory signals  and T-cell support is believed to be critical for triggering a strong anti-tumor immune response. Following intradermal injection  antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin are exposed to the vaccine peptides. These APCs will process the peptides and present vaccine epitopes on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules to naïve T-cells in the lymph nodes. Activated vaccine-specific T-cells will then enter the circulation and search for cells displaying their cognate antigen in the context of HLA molecules.The UV1 peptides contain several epitopes  shown to be non-restrictive in terms of (HLA) alleles for presentation. It is  therefore  not required to perform HLA pre-screening of patients  which potentially enables broad population utilization of the vaccine. UV1 is administered over three months with eight intradermal injections and the immune-modulator GM-CSF.For further information  please contact:Carlos de Sousa  CEOEmail: carlos.desousa@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 908 92507Anne Worsøe  Head of Investor RelationsEmail: anne.worsoe@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 90686815This information is considered to be inside information pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 in the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has updated the label for Dupixent® (dupilumab) in atopic dermatitis  adding efficacy and safety data for patients aged 12 years and older with atopic dermatitis with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe hand and/or foot involvement. These Phase 3 data are from the first and only trial evaluating a biologic specifically for this difficult-to-treat population and have also been added to the Dupixent label in the European Union  with regulatory submissions underway in additional countries.“We rely heavily on our hands and feet throughout the day  making atopic dermatitis particularly disruptive for patients who experience constant itch and painful cracking and bleeding skin lesions on these critical areas of the body ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “Dupixent has been used to treat hundreds of thousands of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis around the world since its initial U.S. approval in 2017  and we are pleased that Dupixent is now the first biologic with data in the label supporting its use in this particularly challenging subset of the disease.”“Living with atopic dermatitis on your most essential body areas like the hands and feet can make daily activities including walking and writing incredibly burdensome even in the case where disease symptoms are mild elsewhere. Unfortunately  treating atopic dermatitis on the hands and feet has historically been difficult and there have been no Phase 3 trials evaluating a biologic in this population of patients ” said Naimish Patel  M.D.  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. “Having these data added for this difficult-to-treat population is important for physicians looking for tools to treat these patients and reinforces the already well-established efficacy and safety of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis overall.”The label update is based on data from the Phase 3 LIBERTY-AD-HAFT trial. In the trial  patients received Dupixent (n=67) every two weeks (adults 300 mg  adolescents 200 mg or 300 mg based on body weight) or placebo (n=66). At 16 weeks  patients treated with Dupixent experienced the following:40% achieved clear or almost clear skin on hands and feet compared to 17% with placebo  the primary endpoint52% saw a clinically meaningful reduction in itch on hands and feet compared to 14% with placebo  the key secondary endpointThe safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. Most common adverse events (AEs) observed with Dupixent (≥1%) in atopic dermatitis include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  blepharitis  oral herpes  keratitis  eye pruritus  other herpes simplex virus infection  dry eye and eosinophilia.About the Clinical TrialThe Phase 3 double-blind  placebo-controlled trial  LIBERTY-AD-HAFT  evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 133 adult and adolescent (aged 12 to 17 years) patients with atopic dermatitis with moderate-to-severe hand and/or foot involvement who had an inadequate response or intolerance to topical corticosteroids. Patients with hand and foot disease predominantly driven by allergic or irritant contact dermatitis were excluded from the trial.The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin of hand and feet eczema at 16 weeks  as measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator Global Assessment Scale. The key secondary endpoint measured the proportion of patients with improvement in itch on hands and feet from baseline (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Peak-Pruritis Numeric Rating Scale [PP-NRS] on a 0-10 scale) at 16 weeks.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 800 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

The designer said he got the idea from founder Christian Dior’s garden  with models — some wearing neon-colored beanie hats — standing in for flowers.That inspired photographer Rafael Pavarotti  who showcased the campaign stars on pedestals against blue  green  yellow  orange and pink color gradients.The Dior spring 2024 men’s advertising campaign. Rafael Pavarotti/Courtesy of DiorModels Emile Danckaert  Awwal Adeoti  Younghoon Jeon  Viktor Krohm and Dara Gueye wear outfits that pay tribute to the brand’s storied cast of creative directors ranging from Yves Saint Laurent to Marc Bohan and Gianfranco Ferré  in a celebration of house codes focused on tweed.Meanwhile  Dior’s signature cannage pattern appears on everything from cropped sweaters  paired with herringbone cardigans  to cognac-colored satchels.Jones said despite the quiet luxury trend  some consumers hanker for strong brand signifiers. “You just have to go down the street in America or China or somewhere and you see how people dress  so it depends where you are ” he said.The campaign was art-directed by Ronnie Cooke Newhouse and styled by Melanie Ward. Peter Philips did the makeup and Benjamin Muller the hair. — JOELLE DIDERICHBROOKLYN IN MILAN: Stuart Weitzman unveiled its first men’s shoes collection in Milan  a product extension that responds to demands from all of the brand’s geographical markets  said Jonathan Lelonek  senior vice president of global wholesale.Marking the launch  friend of the house Brooklyn Beckham touted the craftsmanship of the shoes. His favorites? “The chunky loafers from the Club line — they are comfortable  lightweight and go perfect with any outfit ” he said  pointing to his own suit pants  T-shirt and bomber jacket.Brooklyn Beckham Tonya MatyuHe said his wife  Nicola Peltz  helped him choose the ones he was wearing at the presentation and she was not far from his thoughts as he held a cap with “Lola” written on it  supporting her latest venture  the film of the same name she directed and acted in.Beckham said he’d always been “a big fan” of Stuart Weitzman  and that “hopefully we’ll build a really long collaboration.”The collection includes three main lines: the Club  comprising sleek loafers and oxfords in supple leather and suede; Premiere  for special occasions  including velvet and precious embellishments  and Resort  laid-back moccasins and slides  in soft suede or durable tumbled leather.Designs will retail at around $595 and the collection will be available at the brand’s online store and at retailers including Saks  Neiman Marcus  Bergdorf Goodman and Nordstrom beginning in February. — LUISA ZARGANINOW YOU SEE IT: Just days before parading his third men’s collection for Louis Vuitton  Pharrell Williams teased a collaboration between the French luxury brand and Timberland.The musician  identifiable by his jewelry including a gold Human Made bangle  is seen in a short video lifting the leg of his jeans to reveal a loosely laced yellow Timberland boot. A Louis Vuitton logo appears on the tongue of the shoe  which he folds to reveal the brand’s signature monogram printed on the inside.Pharrell Williams in his studio at Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris. Stéphane Feugère for WWDThe short video was posted on the Instagram account Skateboard  the unofficial account run by the musician’s team which posts behind-the-scenes content from inside the Vuitton menswear studio.In another video  Williams can be seen wearing the boots with flared jeans  a yellow Kenzo sweatshirt and a white cowboy hat as he watches a quadruped Spot robot built by U.S. firm Boston Dynamics walking around the Vuitton studio during preparations for the show  scheduled for Tuesday.Pharrell Williams’ custom painted Timberland boots. Robert Sadler ClarkAhead of his debut last June  Williams posed on Instagram in outfits from the collection  prompting Vuitton chairman and chief executive officer Pietro Beccari to gently chide his new recruit.“Pharrell is unveiling the collection piece by piece  because it is already 20 days that he wears [items from] the show ” Beccari said in the interview last June  noting that Williams is approaching the assignment from the perspective of a prolific luxury shopper. “He’s impatient and I said  ‘He’s the client  right? So that’s it.’”That means that industry observers will be closely scrutinizing the music star’s appearances in the run-up to his shows. A collaboration with Timberland appears a logical move  given the brand’s close association with the hip-hop community.The workwear boot was popularized by musicians including Wu-Tang Clan  Jay-Z  Tupac Shakur  Kanye West and The Notorious B.I.G.  who frequently rapped about his “Timbs.” The boots were also adopted by female stars like Rihanna  Missy Elliott and Aaliyah.It wouldn’t be the first big footwear collection for Vuitton  which under its previous menswear designer  the late Virgil Abloh  launched its own versions of Nike’s iconic Air Force 1 trainers.Williams also has a history with Timberland  having designed several styles of the boot through his streetwear brand Billionaire Boys Club’s Bee Line collection. In 2022  a Timberland boot he customized with his own drawings sold for $7 500 on his auction platform Joopiter. — J.D.CHANEL EXIT: Christine Dagousset  the global open innovation officer of Chanel  has left the company  WWD has learned.Dagousset  who could not be reached for comment  is a beauty industry veteran who joined the company in 1998 as senior vice president of global skin care  and quickly rose through the ranks.

This led to the development of the patient-centric Genio HGNS system. Genio's single-incision  leadless  upgradable design powered and controlled by a wearable resonated with clinicians and patients and led to a strong European launch. Genio's bilateral stimulation enables treatment of CCC  and the label was subsequently expanded to include these patients  whose only treatment option after failing CPAP up until then was major palate surgery "" commented Olivier Taelman  Chief Executive Officer.""In our ongoing effort to provide patients greater control over their therapy  thereby making sleep simple again  we then received approval for Genio 2.1. Genio 2.1 offers patients daily feedback on therapy usage and autonomy to adjust stimulation amplitude within pre-defined boundaries  improving patient comfort and compliance without the need for a surgical procedure to replace the implantable component.""""We are now on the cusp of the most significant milestone in the Company's history with the reporting of DREAM results in the coming months. We expect to complete the PMA submission shortly after and are accelerating manufacturing and commercial investments to ensure we are fully prepared to replicate our European success in the U.S. With an approaching U.S. launch and continued growth in Europe  we are excited for the coming years.""About NyxoahNyxoah is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).
