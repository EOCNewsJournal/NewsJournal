35097,Euroclear,Bing API,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/davos-debate-tokenization-same-activity-192635052.html,Davos Debate: Should Tokenization Follow the 'Same Activity  Same Rules' Approach?,Regulation should be technology-agnostic  and focus on the activity and the outcome. But with blockchain-based security issuance  that approach could hold back the industry’s progress  says .,I was hoping I could get through the week without mentioning Davos  since the conference has been getting increasingly tedious over the years  not to mention irrelevant.But  alas  that harsh judgment is largely unfair  since the agenda at the annual meeting of the world’s elite does attempt to tackle large global issues by inviting the ultimate “influencers” to say their piece. We can mock the private jets used to travel to a venue to discuss the perils of climate change  scoff at privileged financiers dismissing tools for financial freedom  and laugh at the hypocrisy of wanting to fight misinformation with censorship . Yet  we can also appreciate the showcasing  parading and parties for the networking opportunities they are. And we can enjoy the glitz of the media coverage  which is increasingly what Davos is about.Intriguing yet overlooked debates sometimes get surfaced. This happened yesterday  on the Tokenization Economy panel   which I actually enjoyed. It featured good dialogue and smart people  including Circle’s Jeremy Allaire  Stellar’s Denelle Dixon  Euroclear’s Lieve Mostrey and Skybridge’s Anthony Scaramucci.Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading  and host of the CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter  which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers  and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.The discussion was about use cases  regulation  jurisdictional differences – the usual stuff but eloquently said. At the very end  however  just as I was concluding “nice  but nothing new ” an audience-member asked for the panel’s opinion on the regulatory approach of “same activity  same risk  same regulation.”A-ha! Finally  something potentially controversial.Euroclear’s Mostrey chimed in first  insisting that regulation has to be technology-agnostic if we don’t want to block progress. This has been Euroclear’s approach so far  issuing a short-term note on their own proprietary blockchain and then passing it over to traditional rails  fully compliant with existing laws.Story continuesRead more: Noelle Acheson - Bitcoin ETFs and Wall Street: A Double MilestoneI get this  and on principle I agree – it’s the outcome that matters when it comes to protection  not the technology. But when it comes to blockchain and securities  the technology does matter a lot. It confers not just new advantages but also new functionalities that the legacy rails can’t contemplate. True  that’s not exactly “same activity.” But insisting that all blockchain-based securities conform to current rules limits the potential at the starting gate. We will only ever get “more of the same” but with some efficiency. Surely we can aim higher.Same but differentEven if we accept that we start with the “same” and work with regulators on crafting rules for the “different ” there are still regulatory issues that need addressing. To start with  the Euroclear blockchain-based note needed to be passed to legacy rails in order to be fully compliant. That adds steps  layers and middlemen  which doesn’t sound so efficient to me. Why can’t the blockchain-based note meet the regulatory requirements?Because recognizing securities transactions natively on a blockchain is not as simple as it sounds. For instance  settlement finality is a key part of securities regulation – when is ownership transferred? In traditional securities  it’s when the seller has accepted payment from the buyer for the asset. This involves many steps  involving clearing houses such as Euroclear. But on a blockchain  settlement “finality” is both atomic (payment and transfer in one step) and usually consensus-based. How much consensus is enough for finality?This is made even more complicated by the variety of blockchains being used for tokenization: there are public chains  permissioned ones  proprietary networks  and sometimes a hybrid. Different blockchains work in different ways.There is also a lack of clarity for now as to what reporting is needed for on-chain transactions  and how it should be delivered. Plus  what sort of identity should be used?And when a security’s whole life cycle is embedded in code  who is responsible if something goes wrong? Depending on the chosen platform  blockchain “fixes” are not at all straightforward.The Euroclear approach can work: use the blockchain  but repeat everything on legacy rails so the regulators are happy and traditional investors don’t feel excluded. But is it optimal? Is squeezing this new type of asset into an existing structure the most efficient approach? It broadens the potential reach for now by getting it past the gate-keepers – but  ultimately  it’s no more than a very short-term fix.Circle’s Allaire’s response summed it up succinctly: “[Same activity  same rules] is still a looking-backward philosophy.”Read more: Colin Butler - 2024 Will Be the Year Tokenization Truly (Finally) BeginsHe used the early days of the Internet as an example. If this philosophy had been applied back then  he said  the world today would look very different. All websites would need to have registered with the Federal Communications Commission. If any were to stream audio  they’d need to get a radio license. For peer-to-peer communication  a platform would need to apply to become a telecom operator. With this maze of requirements  the Internet’s main use would probably still be for exchanging research papers.Crypto is in a similar situation. I totally agree that regulation should care about outcomes  not the technology. But ignoring the ability of the technology to do things in a radically different way is cutting off the potential just as it takes its first steps.It’s a difficult problem to solve. Financial assets have a totally different risk profile than publications or audio content. The layers of regulations to protect investors while ring-fencing economies are orders of magnitude more complex  as they should be.And waiting for new rules to be drafted  that take into account the new characteristics of blockchain-based asset transfer  could end up delaying progress by years.A compromiseSo  what’s the solution? My preference is for “simple” tokenized securities to be covered by existing rules  to allow crypto-native and legacy market participants to start experimenting with processes and market reactions. Meanwhile  sandboxes should allow for experimentation with the regulators’ blessing. The sandboxes need to recognize that markets are changing  and “out there” ideas could end up becoming the norm of a more efficient tomorrow. It’s not that long ago in the arc of history that electronic trading was regarded as a radical departure from common sense.Tokenization is a similar leap forward – just as electronic trading unleashed a previously unimaginable range of new types of product and trading strategies  so will blockchain-based markets. Just as electronic trading enabled increasingly sophisticated dashboards to improve both intelligence and reporting  blockchain transparency can reduce risk while enabling new market functionalities.The potential is much greater than doing something more efficiently. It’s about what we’ll be able to do that we couldn’t before. For that  new rules will be needed – but we can work within the existing ones meanwhile.,neutral,0.03,0.93,0.04,mixed,0.33,0.21,0.45,True,English,"[""Same Rules' Approach"", 'Same Activity', 'Davos Debate', 'Tokenization', 'CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast', 'large global issues', 'Tokenization Economy panel', 'The Euroclear approach', 'Euroclear blockchain-based note', 'regulatory issues', 'short-term note', 'blockchain-based securities', 'harsh judgment', 'annual meeting', 'ultimate “influencers', 'private jets', 'climate change', 'privileged financiers', 'financial freedom', 'networking opportunities', 'media coverage', 'overlooked debates', 'good dialogue', 'smart people', 'Denelle Dixon', 'Anthony Scaramucci', 'Noelle Acheson', 'former head', 'Genesis Trading', 'macro landscapes', 'investment advice', 'use cases', 'jurisdictional differences', 'usual stuff', 'regulatory approach', 'same activity', 'same risk', 'traditional rails', 'existing laws', 'Bitcoin ETFs', 'Wall Street', 'Double Milestone', 'new advantages', 'new functionalities', 'legacy rails', 'starting gate', 'regulatory requirements', 'key part', 'clearing houses', 'one step', 'public chains', 'proprietary networks', 'chain transactions', 'life cycle', 'traditional investors', 'new type', 'existing structure', 'efficient approach', 'short-term fix', 'backward philosophy', 'Colin Butler', 'Year Tokenization', 'early days', 'securities transactions', 'traditional securities', 'current rules', 'settlement finality', 'settlement “finality', 'different ways', 'same rules', 'Jeremy Allaire', 'Lieve Mostrey', 'shifting crypto', 'same regulation', 'many steps', 'potential reach', 'proprietary blockchain', 'blockchain “fixes', 'securities regulation', 'Different blockchains', 'week', 'Davos', 'conference', 'years', 'agenda', 'world', 'elite', 'piece', 'venue', 'perils', 'tools', 'hypocrisy', 'misinformation', 'censorship', 'showcasing', 'parading', 'parties', 'glitz', 'Intriguing', 'Circle', 'Stellar', 'Skybridge', 'research', 'host', 'article', 'newsletter', 'overlap', 'opinions', 'discussion', 'audience-member', 'something', 'progress', 'Story', 'principle', 'outcome', 'protection', 'technology', 'efficiency', 'regulators', 'order', 'layers', 'middlemen', 'instance', 'ownership', 'seller', 'payment', 'buyer', 'asset', 'transfer', 'consensus', 'variety', 'hybrid', 'lack', 'clarity', 'reporting', 'sort', 'identity', 'security', 'code', 'platform', 'everything', 'gate-keepers', 'response', 'Internet', 'example']",2024-01-18,2024-01-18,ca.finance.yahoo.com

Increase hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS) market penetration and Genio market share in Europe. For 2024  we expect continued sales growth driven by an increasing benefit from direct-to-consumer (DTC) initiatives  initial contribution from the ResMed commercial partnership in Germany and geographic expansion.“Since Nyxoah’s founding we have been guided by the mission to improve the lives of OSA patients. This led to the development of the patient-centric Genio HGNS system. Genio’s single-incision  leadless  upgradable design powered and controlled by a wearable resonated with clinicians and patients and led to a strong European launch. Genio’s bilateral stimulation enables treatment of CCC  and the label was subsequently expanded to include these patients  whose only treatment option after failing CPAP up until then was major palate surgery ” commented Olivier Taelman  Chief Executive Officer.“In our ongoing effort to provide patients greater control over their therapy  thereby making sleep simple again  we then received approval for Genio 2.1. Genio 2.1 offers patients daily feedback on therapy usage and autonomy to adjust stimulation amplitude within pre-defined boundaries  improving patient comfort and compliance without the need for a surgical procedure to replace the implantable component.”“We are now on the cusp of the most significant milestone in the Company’s history with the reporting of DREAM results in the coming months. We expect to complete the PMA submission shortly after and are accelerating manufacturing and commercial investments to ensure we are fully prepared to replicate our European success in the U.S. With an approaching U.S. launch and continued growth in Europe  we are excited for the coming years.”About NyxoahNyxoah is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

This strategic step could give us a chance to agree a registration pathway for PXT3003 in CMT1A  with the FDA and the EMA..To focus financial resources on issues directly related to this new development phase  Pharnext has decided to stop all other operating expenses. The aim is to reduce cash consumption from an average of €2.0 million per month in S1 2023 to an average of €0.5-0.9 million per month in S1 2024. To achieve this goal  Pharnext has already taken all the necessary measures  in particular :Cessation of all preclinical and clinical projects  initiated or planned  generating around 70% of expected savings;Rationalization of internal and external operating costs  generating around 30% of expected savings.In addition  in order to optimize the Company's short-term cash position  Pharnext Développement  a company controlled and managed by Néovacs  in its capacity as general partner  has decided to defer payment of amounts due to Pharnext's management. Furthermore  Global Tech Opportunities 13 agreed to amend its financing contract enabling Pharnext to secure a minimum drawdown of €250k per week over the next 4 weeks  with an additional 20% remuneration compared with the terms of the initial contract.Hugo Brugière  Manager of Pharnext  said: “Thanks to these painful but always necessary measures  we want to continue our mission of valuing many years' work for the benefit of patients awaiting treatment  and investors who support the Company. With our financing needs back in the conventional zone  we can explore possible options and serenely discuss with our various partners to continue moving forward. I would like to thank Global Tech Opportunities 13 for playing its part in covering our short-term needs  and point out that Neovacs is fully playing its role as a responsible manager”.DisclaimerPharnext arranged (I) financing in the form of convertible bonds financing (OCEAN-BSA) with Global Tech Opportunities 13 which  after receiving the shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of these instruments  will not remain shareholder of the Company  and (II) financing in OS bonds which were subsequently transferred to a trust  which is now responsible for their equitization.The shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of the above-mentioned securities will generally be sold on the market at very short notice  which may create strong downward pressure on the share price. In the specific case of the trust  the shares are sold on the market in accordance with the terms set out in the trust agreement.Shareholders may suffer a loss of their invested capital due to a significant fall in the Company's share price  as well as significant dilution due to the large number of securities issued to Global Tech Opportunities 13 and/or the trust.Investors are advised to exercise extreme caution before deciding to invest in the securities of a listed company that carries out such dilutive financing transactions  particularly when they are carried out in succession. The Company wishes to point out that this is not the first dilutive financing transaction it has undertaken.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions.

This strategic step could give us a chance to agree a registration pathway for PXT3003 in CMT1A  with the FDA and the EMA..To focus financial resources on issues directly related to this new development phase  Pharnext has decided to stop all other operating expenses. The aim is to reduce cash consumption from an average of €2.0 million per month in S1 2023 to an average of €0.5-0.9 million per month in S1 2024. To achieve this goal  Pharnext has already taken all the necessary measures  in particular :Cessation of all preclinical and clinical projects  initiated or planned  generating around 70% of expected savings;Rationalization of internal and external operating costs  generating around 30% of expected savings.Hugo Brugière  Manager of Pharnext  said: “Thanks to these painful but always necessary measures  we want to continue our mission of valuing many years' work for the benefit of patients awaiting treatment  and investors who support the Company. With our financing needs back in the conventional zone  we can explore possible options and serenely discuss with our various partners to continue moving forward”.DisclaimerPharnext arranged (I) financing in the form of convertible bonds financing (OCEAN-BSA) with Global Tech Opportunities 13 which  after receiving the shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of these instruments  will not remain shareholder of the Company  and (II) financing in OS bonds which were subsequently transferred to a trust  which is now responsible for their equitization.The shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of the above-mentioned securities will generally be sold on the market at very short notice  which may create strong downward pressure on the share price. In the specific case of the trust  the shares are sold on the market in accordance with the terms set out in the trust agreement.Shareholders may suffer a loss of their invested capital due to a significant fall in the Company's share price  as well as significant dilution due to the large number of securities issued to Global Tech Opportunities 13 and/or the trust.Investors are advised to exercise extreme caution before deciding to invest in the securities of a listed company that carries out such dilutive financing transactions  particularly when they are carried out in succession. The Company wishes to point out that this is not the first dilutive financing transaction it has undertaken.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions.

It should be noted that the impact on revenue growth resulting from the integration of GS Partners (acquisition of our distributor in the Czech Republic closed in May) and Globion (acquisition in India closed in November)  representing only 0.3 points of growth  is considered non-material and therefore consolidation scope was not restated.Quarterly consolidated revenueOur fourth-quarter revenue amounted €321.7 million  up +9.1% compared to the same period in 2022. Adjusted for the unfavorable impact of exchange rates  our revenue reached a record level of €329 million  in strong progression by +11.5%. It should be noted that this increase includes a +0.9% impact related to the integration of Globion (India)  which acquisition was finalized in November  such impact has not been restated for materiality reasons. This growth reflects the Group's sustained business momentum  driven by the outstanding commitment of our teams around the world. All geographies contributed to this momentum  with Europe and Latin America accounting for almost 75% of overall organic growth achieved during the quarter. In Europe  growth of +11.6% at constant rates was mainly driven by the performance of the United Kingdom (+20.7% at constant rates)  fuelled by strong growth in our dog and cat parasiticides products  and Northern Europe (+8.1% at constant rates)  as well as by the double-digit growth in our petfood range  particularly in Turkey and France. Latin America closed the quarter with a growth of +24.0% at constant rates  thanks to the remarkable performance of Brazil (+35.6% at constant rates)  where our companion animal products are on the rise  and the contribution of Mexico and Central American countries (+19% at constant rates)  whereas Chile (+24.9% at constant rates) benefited from a rebound linked to strong demand for a parasiticide product for salmon. North America was also up by +14.7%  benefiting from strong sales momentum in our companion animal ranges  particularly dermatology products. Asia/Pacific region grew by +2.3% at constant rates  with contrasting trends over the quarter. India (+13.7% at constant rates) and South-East Asia (+8.8% at constant rates) compensated for the drop in revenue observed on the one hand in Australia (-18.1% at constant rates)  where 2023 had been so far marked by a very favorable agricultural context (climate  prices and herd stock increases)  and on the other hand in China (-16.4% at constant rates) due to a base effect subsequent to a very good last quarter in 2022.This remarkable performance in the last quarter of 2023 is reflected in both our business segments. Thanks to the momentum of our petfood  specialties  dental and dermatology ranges  which achieved double-digit growth  the companion animal segment grew by +10.9% at constant rates. On the farm animal segment  we achieved growth of +12.5% at constant rates  all our ranges by species recorded significant progressions  particularly in the aquaculture and ruminant segments.Annual consolidated revenueAt the end of December 2023  our annual revenue amounted €1 246.9 million compared with €1 216.2 million  representing an overall change of +2.5% compared with the same period in 2022  and a +4.9% growth at constant exchange rates. The impact on revenue growth resulting from the integration of GS Partners (acquisition of our distributor in the Czech Republic closed in May) and Globion (acquisition in India closed in November) is only 0.3 points. Excluding these two acquisitions  growth at constant rates would have been +4.6%. Against a backdrop of normalizing market growth  this performance demonstrates the resilience of our business model  which was significantly challenged by two intrinsic and unfavorable one-off effects during the year. As a reminder  these were a temporary limitation of our production capacities for companion animal vaccines  and a cyber attack on June 19 which forced us to shut down plants for several weeks. Europe (+5.8% at constant rates) and Asia/Pacific (+4.0% at constant rates) remain the main areas driving our organic growth momentum over the year. Growth in Europe was mainly driven by France (+6.9% at constant rates)  Northern Europe and Southern Europe (respectively +4.0% and +4.9% at constant rates)  as well as by Turkey  where business volume more than doubled compared with 2022. In Asia/Pacific  the main contributors were India (+6.1% at constant rates)  followed by Australia and New Zealand (respectively +4.9% and +6.7% at constant rates)  offsetting the drop observed in China (-10.8% at constant rates)  while business in Southeast Asia remained stable. In Latin America (+4.9% at constant rates)  we observed very good growth dynamics in all our subsidiaries  with the exception of Chile which  despite a rebound in the second semester  continues to be penalized by the sharp slowdown in our aquaculture business observed in the first semester  particularly in antibiotics and vaccines. Our revenue in the United States rose by +3.5% at constant rates  despite a year-long distributors’ destocking effect.In terms of species  despite a drop in sales on dog and cat vaccine range (which was out of stock throughout the year) and a decline in parasiticides  the companion animal segment grew by +3.5% at constant rates  driven by the performance of our petfood  specialties and dermatology ranges. The farm animal segment posted a more pronounced growth of +6.7% at constant rates  driven by both ruminants (+7.8% at constant rates) and pigs (+13.1% at constant rates).OutlookIn line with our press release dated December 19  2023  at constant rates  our ratio of ""current operating income before amortization of assets resulting from acquisitions” (Ebit adjusted) to “revenue” is expected around 15%. Excluding acquisitions and the impact of the share buyback plan  our net cash position should improve by around €50 million compared with the end of December 2022.For the year 2024  we confirm our revenue growth target between 4% and 6% at constant rates and scope  as well as a ratio of ""current operating income before amortization of assets resulting from acquisitions” (Ebit adjusted) to “revenue” around 15% at constant exchange rates. As announced in our previous communications  this level of profitability takes into account a deliberate further acceleration in our R&D investments  representing almost +0.5 points as a percentage of revenue compared with 2023.We reaffirm our ambition to achieve an Ebit adjusted ratio of 20% by 2030: in this respect  we plan over the next few years to gradually restore our R&D investments to the Group's normative and historical level  with a ratio of R&D investments to revenue around 2.0 percentage points below 2024 level.CONSOLIDATED FIGURESNon-audited figuresin millions of euros 2023 2022 Growth Growthat constant exchange rates 1 Growthat constant exchange rates and scope 1 First quarter revenue 314.8 318.0 -1.0% -1.3% -1.3% Second-quarter revenue 295.7 298.3 -0.9% +2.1% +2.1% Third-quarter revenue 314.8 304.9 +3.3% +7.8% +7.8% Fourth-quarter revenue 321.7 295.0 +9.1% +11.5% +10.6% Annual Revenue 1 246.9 1 216.2 +2.5% +4.9% +4.6%1growth at constant exchange rates and scope corresponds to organic growth of revenue  excluding exchange rate variations  by calculating the indicator for the financial year in question and the indicator for the previous financial year on the basis of identical exchange rates (the exchange rate used is the one from the previous financial year)  and excluding change in scope  by calculating the indicator for the financial year in question on the basis of the scope of consolidation for the previous financial year.

Adjusted for the unfavorable impact of exchange rates  our revenue reached a record level of €329 million  in strong progression by +11.5%. It should be noted that this increase includes a +0.9% impact related to the integration of Globion (India)  which acquisition was finalized in November  such impact has not been restated for materiality reasons.

It is encouraging to see a return to strong safety performance as the health and wellbeing of our team at the Moma Mine is our highest priority.Ilmenite production was 986 300 tonnes in 2023  within our revised guidance range for the year  and production of our other products met or exceeded our original guidance.Markets for our products were challenging in 2023 due to global economic uncertainty  resulting in lower pricing. However strong pigment production in China and the thriving titanium metal market drove demand for our high-quality ilmenite  relative to other titanium feedstocks.In 2023  we made $31 million of debt repayments  paid $58 million in dividends  bought back $30 million in shares  began the capital investment for the transition to Nataka  and finished the year with $21 million net cash. We expect total 2023 dividends to be approximately $50 million.”OverviewLost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.15 per 200 000 hours worked to 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 0.09)  with zero Lost Time Injuries (“LTIs”) in Q4 20232023 revised production guidance achieved for ilmenite; original production guidance achieved for primary zircon and rutile and materially exceeded for concentratesHeavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 1 448 300 tonnes in 2023  a 9% decrease compared to 2022 (1 586 200 tonnes)  due to lower ore grades and mining rates impacted by power interruptions and a severe lightning strike in Q1Ilmenite production of 986 300 tonnes in 2023  a 9% decrease on 2022 (1 088 300 tonnes)  and broadly in line with the reduction in HMC processedShipments of finished products of 1 045 200 tonnes in 2023  a 3% decrease on 2022 (1 075 600 tonnes). Q4 2023 was the strongest quarter of the year  with 324 900 tonnes shippedShare buy-back of 5.9% of Kenmare’s issued share capital for £23.6 million ($30.0 million) completed in September 2023Interim 2023 dividend of USc17.5 per share paid in October 2023  an increase of 59% compared to H1 2022 (USc10.98)Net cash of $20.7 million at year-end 2023 (2022: $27.5 million net cash)  with cash and cash equivalents of $71.0 million (year-end 2022: $108.3 million)Weakness in the global economy led to lower average prices for all of Kenmare’s products in 2023Ilmenite production guidance for 2024 is 950 000 to 1 050 000 tonnesOperations updateOperational results for the Moma Mine in Q4 and full year 2023 were as follows:Q42023 vs Q4 2022 vs Q3 2023 2023 vs 2022 tonnes % change % change tonnes % change Excavated ore1 9 348 000 -8% -14% 38 549 000 -4% Grade1 4.83% 2% 12% 4.38% -5% Production HMC produced 399 800 -1% -4% 1 448 300 -9% HMC processed 399 800 0% -3% 1 450 400 -8% Ilmenite 269 600 -5% -7% 986 300 -9% Primary zircon 14 000 -4% -1% 51 100 -13% Rutile 2 100 -5% -22% 8 400 -6% Concentrates2 10 500 -10% -29% 45 700 1% Shipments 324 900 -11% 99% 1 045 200 -3%Excavated ore and grade prior to any floor losses. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.In December 2023  Kenmare achieved two million hours without an LTI. Five LTIs were recorded in the 12 months to 31 December 2023  resulting in a rolling 12-month LTIFR of 0.15 per 200 000 hours worked (31 December 2022: 0.09).HMC production in Q4 2023 was 399 800 tonnes  a 1% decrease compared to Q4 2022 (404 000 tonnes).HMC production in 2023 was 1 448 300 tonnes  down 9% compared to 2022 (1 586 200 tonnes)  although with significantly improved production in H2 (814 400 tonnes versus 633 900 tonnes in H1 2023). The 9% annual reduction was a product of a 4% decrease in excavated ore volumes to 38 549 000 tonnes (2022: 40 029 000 tonnes) and a 5% decrease in ore grades to 4.38% (2022: 4.61%). Ore volumes were impacted primarily by the effects of the severe lightning strike in Q1 and power supply interruptions  which affected operations throughout the year. Ore grades were down principally due to Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) B mining in wetlands  where grades were lower than expected  and WCP A mining lower grade ore as it approaches the end of its mine path in Namalope.Production of all finished products decreased in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022  although HMC processed was in line with the prior period. Ilmenite production was 269 600 tonnes in Q4 2023  down 5% compared to Q4 2022 (283 900 tonnes)  due to lower recoveries  as a result of a shortage of HMC and some unplanned stoppages. Similarly  primary zircon and rutile production were down 4% and 5%  while concentrates production was down 10%.For 2023  ilmenite production was 986 300 tonnes and within the revised guidance range of 980 000 to 1 040 000 tonnes. Production of primary zircon and rutile was within original guidance and concentrates production exceeded original guidance.Ilmenite production in 2023 was down 9% compared to 2022 (1 088 300 tonnes)  broadly in line with the 8% reduction in HMC processed.Primary zircon production was 51 100 tonnes in 2023  a 13% decrease compared to 2022 (58 400 tonnes). This was the product of reduced HMC processed and lower recoveries.Rutile production was 8 400 tonnes in 2023  a 6% decrease compared to 2022 (8 900 tonnes). This reflects the reduction in HMC processed  partially offset by higher rutile content in the HMC and the drawdown of intermediate stock.Concentrates production was 45 700 tonnes in 2023  up 1% compared to 2022 (45 200 tonnes)  performing better relative to other products as a result of lower recoveries in primary zircon and the processing of intermediate stockpiles.Q4 2023 was the strongest quarter of the year for shipments  with 324 900 tonnes shipped  despite poor weather conditions. Although volumes were down 11% compared to Q4 2022 (365 700 tonnes)  which was a near record quarter  they were up 99% compared to Q3 2023. Shipments in Q4 2023 comprised 278 700 tonnes of ilmenite  22 300 tonnes of primary zircon  4 500 tonnes of rutile and 19 500 tonnes of concentrates.Shipment volumes in 2023 were 1 045 200 tonnes  a 3% decrease compared to 2022 (1 075 600 tonnes). This was impacted by more cautious buying from customers during this period of weaker demand  compounded by destocking. Shipments during the year comprised 939 000 tonnes of ilmenite  51 300 tonnes of primary zircon  7 900 tonnes of rutile and 47 000 tonnes of concentrates.Closing stock of HMC at the end of 2023 was 16 700 tonnes  compared with 18 800 tonnes at the start of the year. Closing stock of finished products at the end of 2023 was 259 100 tonnes  compared with 213 500 tonnes at the end of 2022. Shipments are expected to exceed production in Q1 2024  partly as a result of shipments deferred from Q4 2023 due to weather.Capital projects updateAs previously announced  WCP A will complete mining at Namalope in late 2025 and commence its transition to the Nataka ore zone. Nataka is the largest of Moma’s ore zones  representing 75% of Kenmare’s Mineral Resources. WCP A is expected to mine Nataka for the remainder of its economic life  which exceeds 20 years.The development capital expenditure profile for the transition to Nataka was announced in April 2023 at Kenmare’s Capital Markets Day (“CMD”) and updated in December 2023 in the Projects Update.Although orders for important long lead time items  such as the two new dredges  were placed in 2023  the capital incurred was lower than forecast  increasing the capital to be spent in subsequent years.The table below compares the two estimated spending profiles:Capital cost schedule ($m) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Total April 2023 (CMD) 29 130 88 23 270 December 2023 11 179 121 20 10 341As previously outlined in December 2023  the $341 million capital expenditure represents the upper end of the $316-331 million range  plus the $10 million of additional infrastructure in 2027. The range relates to the WCP A Infrastructure Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”)  which is still underway and scheduled to be completed in Q2 2024. The costs of which are currently estimated to be $91-106 million.The increase of $71m in the project cost estimates are principally related to:Changes in scope/design (approximately 60%): The scope amendments reflect opportunities to mitigate execution risk of the project and enhance long-term operational capacity.Additional indirect costs (approximately 25%): Engineering  Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM) and Owners costs were comprehensively updated as part of the DFS process to include increased project governance for schedule risk minimisation.Contingency additions (approximately 15%): A quantitative risk assessment of the project components has been completed for the WCP A upgrade and Tailings Storage Facility. This process  which included comparison against multiple international projects with similar characteristics  recommended the inclusion of additional contingency to manage the potential for schedule overrun and reflect the remote location.Finance updateOn 13 October 2023  Kenmare paid its interim 2023 dividend of USc17.5 per share  an increase of 59% compared to the interim 2022 dividend (USc10.98 per share). This represented a total interim distribution of $16.6 million.The Company expects total dividends in respect of 2023 to be approximately $50 million  subject to prevailing product market and other conditions. This in line with Kenmare’s dividend policy payout ratio of 20% to 40% of underlying Profit After Tax.In September 2023 Kenmare completed a share buy-back. The Company repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares  representing 5.9% of the Company’s issued share capital  for a total consideration of £23.6 million ($30.0 million).The Company’s debt refinancing process  initiated in September 2023 to support the capital programme  is well-advanced and expected to complete in Q1 2024.At 31 December 2023  Kenmare had net cash of $20.7 million (2022: $27.5 million net cash). Cash and cash equivalents were $71.0 million (2022: $108.3 million) and gross bank loans  including accrued interest  were $50.3 million (2022: $80.8 million).Market updateDemand for Kenmare’s products remained relatively robust in 2023  although prices decreased through the year due to weaker global economic activity. Despite this short-term pressure  the Company believes the fundamentals for its products are strong  due primarily to medium- and long-term supply constraints within the titanium feedstocks industry.In 2023  feedstock supply remained flat. Several large western feedstock producers have depleting Mineral Resources and production disruptions were experienced at several major operations outside China  reducing global supply. However  this was balanced by increased volumes of ilmenite concentrates entering China in 2023  the largest source of new supply.Downstream demand for titanium pigment remained soft in 2023  although improving as H2 progressed. While western pigment producers reduced production  this was partially offset by significantly increased pigment production in China. Consequently  Kenmare experienced elevated demand from Chinese pigment producers  who prefer to purchase ilmenite for beneficiation over high-grade feedstocks.The challenges faced by the pigment market prompted producers to sustain lower-than-normal inventories throughout 2023 and the rebuilding of these inventories through increased utilisation rates in 2024 will support demand for ilmenite. Market dynamics continue to favour Kenmare’s ilmenite and the Company has a strong order book for Q1 2024  whilst also benefiting from its first quartile cost position. Nonetheless  the Company is experiencing lower pricing in Q1 2024 than it achieved in Q4 2023.Demand for zircon remained sluggish in Q4 2023  as global economic uncertainty continues to weigh on demand for products such as ceramic tiles. Prices for zircon in Europe remain under pressure in early 2024 but Kenmare has seen a stabilisation in the Chinese spot market in recent months  which should provide some support to the global market.2024 guidance2024 guidance for production and operating costs is as follows:Unit 2024 Guidance 2023 Actual Production Ilmenite tonnes 950 000-1 050 000 986 300 Primary zircon tonnes 45 000-50 000 51 100 Rutile tonnes 8 000-9 000 8 400 Concentrates1 tonnes 37 000-41 000 45 700 Costs Total cash operating costs $m 219-243 N/R2 Cash costs per tonne of finished product $/t 198-218 N/R2Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate. To be reported in full year financial statements.Ilmenite production in 2024 is expected to be between 950 000 and 1 050 000 tonnes. Excavated ore volumes are expected to increase relative to 2023  although a conservative view of WCP B ore grades in the wetlands and lower grades from dry mining result in production of HMC and final products being in line with 2023. Production is anticipated to be weighted towards H2 due to the grade profile and planned maintenance on WCP B in Q1.Following poor electrical reliability in 2023  Kenmare has intervened and funded the refurbishment of the Nampula statcom in the Electricidade de Moçambique (“EdM”) network. This was commissioned in Q4 2023 and is expected to provide increased stability in the regional power grid. In addition  a new 400kw line is under construction by EdM and expected to connect to Nampula in H1 2024  further enhancing network stability.Closing product inventories at the end of 2023 were above normal levels  providing the opportunity to maintain sales volumes with lower production in H1 2024.Total cash operating costs are anticipated to increase to $219-243 million in 2024  largely due to cost increases in production overheads and power. Total cash operating costs for 2023 are anticipated to be towards the upper end of guidance ($208-228 million). Full details of 2023 costs will be provided with the 2023 Preliminary Results.Expenditure on development projects and studies is expected to be approximately $189 million in 2024. These costs primarily relate to the transition of WCP A to Nataka and feasibility studies for the upgrade works to WCP B.Improvement projects are expected to cost $6 million in 2024 and relate primarily to upgrades to the Mineral Separation Plant.Sustaining capital costs in 2024 are expected to be approximately $29 million.Notice of 2023 Preliminary ResultsKenmare plans to release its 2023 Preliminary Results on Wednesday  20 March 2024.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine Sutton / Michael StarkeInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

Five LTIs were recorded in the 12 months to 31 December 2023  resulting in a rolling 12-month LTIFR of 0.15 per 200 000 hours worked (31 December 2022: 0.09).HMC production in Q4 2023 was 399 800 tonnes  a 1% decrease compared to Q4 2022 (404 000 tonnes).HMC production in 2023 was 1 448 300 tonnes  down 9% compared to 2022 (1 586 200 tonnes)  although with significantly improved production in H2 (814 400 tonnes versus 633 900 tonnes in H1 2023). The 9% annual reduction was a product of a 4% decrease in excavated ore volumes to 38 549 000 tonnes (2022: 40 029 000 tonnes) and a 5% decrease in ore grades to 4.38% (2022: 4.61%). Ore volumes were impacted primarily by the effects of the severe lightning strike in Q1 and power supply interruptions  which affected operations throughout the year. Ore grades were down principally due to Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) B mining in wetlands  where grades were lower than expected  and WCP A mining lower grade ore as it approaches the end of its mine path in Namalope.Production of all finished products decreased in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022  although HMC processed was in line with the prior period. Ilmenite production was 269 600 tonnes in Q4 2023  down 5% compared to Q4 2022 (283 900 tonnes)  due to lower recoveries  as a result of a shortage of HMC and some unplanned stoppages.

Although volumes were down 11% compared to Q4 2022 (365 700 tonnes)  which was a near record quarter  they were up 99% compared to Q3 2023. Shipments in Q4 2023 comprised 278 700 tonnes of ilmenite  22 300 tonnes of primary zircon  4 500 tonnes of rutile and 19 500 tonnes of concentrates.Shipment volumes in 2023 were 1 045 200 tonnes  a 3% decrease compared to 2022 (1 075 600 tonnes). This was impacted by more cautious buying from customers during this period of weaker demand  compounded by destocking. Shipments during the year comprised 939 000 tonnes of ilmenite  51 300 tonnes of primary zircon  7 900 tonnes of rutile and 47 000 tonnes of concentrates.Closing stock of HMC at the end of 2023 was 16 700 tonnes  compared with 18 800 tonnes at the start of the year. Closing stock of finished products at the end of 2023 was 259 100 tonnes  compared with 213 500 tonnes at the end of 2022. Shipments are expected to exceed production in Q1 2024  partly as a result of shipments deferred from Q4 2023 due to weather.Capital projects updateAs previously announced  WCP A will complete mining at Namalope in late 2025 and commence its transition to the Nataka ore zone.

Prices for zircon in Europe remain under pressure in early 2024 but Kenmare has seen a stabilisation in the Chinese spot market in recent months  which should provide some support to the global market.2024 guidance2024 guidance for production and operating costs is as follows:Unit 2024 Guidance 2023 Actual Production Ilmenite tonnes 950 000-1 050 000 986 300 Primary zircon tonnes 45 000-50 000 51 100 Rutile tonnes 8 000-9 000 8 400 Concentrates1 tonnes 37 000-41 000 45 700 Costs Total cash operating costs $m 219-243 N/R2 Cash costs per tonne of finished product $/t 198-218 N/R2Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate. To be reported in full year financial statements.Ilmenite production in 2024 is expected to be between 950 000 and 1 050 000 tonnes. Excavated ore volumes are expected to increase relative to 2023  although a conservative view of WCP B ore grades in the wetlands and lower grades from dry mining result in production of HMC and final products being in line with 2023. Production is anticipated to be weighted towards H2 due to the grade profile and planned maintenance on WCP B in Q1.Following poor electrical reliability in 2023  Kenmare has intervened and funded the refurbishment of the Nampula statcom in the Electricidade de Moçambique (“EdM”) network. This was commissioned in Q4 2023 and is expected to provide increased stability in the regional power grid. In addition  a new 400kw line is under construction by EdM and expected to connect to Nampula in H1 2024  further enhancing network stability.Closing product inventories at the end of 2023 were above normal levels  providing the opportunity to maintain sales volumes with lower production in H1 2024.Total cash operating costs are anticipated to increase to $219-243 million in 2024  largely due to cost increases in production overheads and power. Total cash operating costs for 2023 are anticipated to be towards the upper end of guidance ($208-228 million). Full details of 2023 costs will be provided with the 2023 Preliminary Results.Expenditure on development projects and studies is expected to be approximately $189 million in 2024. These costs primarily relate to the transition of WCP A to Nataka and feasibility studies for the upgrade works to WCP B.Improvement projects are expected to cost $6 million in 2024 and relate primarily to upgrades to the Mineral Separation Plant.Sustaining capital costs in 2024 are expected to be approximately $29 million.Notice of 2023 Preliminary ResultsKenmare plans to release its 2023 Preliminary Results on Wednesday  20 March 2024.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine Sutton / Michael StarkeInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

I have to add that our policy for strong debt reduction will result in a sizeable decrease of our LTV ratio as early as 2024  to be under 40% by the end of 20261.Beyond these considerations  we confirm that we are deploying a very proactive ESG roadmap. We are thus fully committed to reduce our carbon impact. This is why we systematically deploy our Aut0nom®-labelled warehouses that generate their own green energy and invest €50 million in the coming years in the installation of electric heat pumps to replace gas boilers installed in our existing portfolio. Lastly  it is important for us that all employees benefit from team success  100% of ARGAN’s employees are from now on shareholders of the company through a Free share Plan renewed each year.”Ambitious 2024 targets driven by a proven model for value creation and debt under tight control:Indicators 2024targets Full year2023 Changevs. 2023 Rental income €197 million €184 million +7% Recurring net income – Group share €133 million €126 million +6% Dividend per share €3.305 €3.156 +5%Financial performance as at December 31  20232023 financial key figures:Consolidated income statement Dec. 31  2023 Dec. 31  2022 Change Rental income €183.6 million €166.1 million +11% Net income – Group share -€263.5 million €95.1 million n.a Net recurring income – Group share €125.6 million €119.2 million +5% Net income per share – Groupe share -€11.41 €4.2 n.a Net recurring income per share – Group share €5.57 €5.2 +5% Valuation indicators Dec. 31  2023 Dec. 31  2022 Change Portfolio valuation excluding duties €3.68 billion €3.94 billion - 7% NAV EPRA NTA per share €79.18 €92.9 - 15% NAV EPRA NRV per share €90.62 €104.8 - 14% NAV EPRA NDV per share €83.62 €94.2 -11%Debt indicators Dec. 31  2023 Dec. 31  2022 Change LTV EPRA 49.7% 45.1% +460 bps LTV EPRA (including duties) 47.1% 42.8% +430 bps Cost of debt 2.3% 1.5% +80 bpsOn January 15  2024  ARGAN's Management Board approved the 2023 consolidated financial statements. The audit procedures of our statutory auditors on these consolidated financial statements have been carried out. The certification report will be issued after the specific checks have been carried out.Strong increase in our main financial indicatorsOver 2023  ARGAN recorded an excellent operating performance  which resulted in a strong increase of the rental income (+11%) and Group share net recurring income (+5%). These results demonstrate once again our Group’s capacity to turn its very good performance into robust cash flow  in particular thanks to tight control over our debt.Significant increase in our rental income: +11% in 2023ARGAN recorded a sizeable increase of +11% in its rental income in 2023  which stood at €184 million over the year. The strong momentum of 2023 came from the full-year effect of rents coming from the developments in 2022  rents of 5 warehouses delivered in 2023  as well as the indexation that took place on January 1  2023 (+4% on average).An occupancy rate that remains at 100%Driven by a PRIME-quality portfolio  in demanded locations  the occupancy rate has been lastingly standing at 100% amid a rental market with low supply (French vacancy rate at 4.7% at the end of December 2023 as published by CBRE). Our EPRA vacancy rate thus stands at 0%.Continued increase in our Group share Net recurring income: up +5%The Group share net recurring income increased +5%  to €126 million in 2023  representing a high margin of 69% of our rental income. Note that the net recurring income is the best reflection of our Group’s cash flow generation and shows ARGAN’s capacity to pursue the financing of its development model despite the rise of financial costs recorded over the year (+43%).When integrating the mechanical impact of the change in fair value of our portfolio for -€373.2 million  on a backdrop of rising capitalisation rates  the Group share net income stood at -€263.5 million over 12 months.Portfolio and NAV EPRA NTA: valuation maintained at levels showcasing the PREMIUM-quality of our assetsA PREMIUM portfolio appraised at €3.68 billion with a capitalisation rate of 5.1% (excluding duties)  down -7% over 12 monthsThe delivered portfolio (excluding properties under development) stood at 3 580 000 sq.m as atDecember 31  2023. Its valuation amounts to €3.68 billion excluding duties (€3.89 billion including duties)  down -7% compared with December 31  2022.The valuation of the delivered portfolio at €3.68 billion shows a capitalisation rate of 5.10% excluding duties  up from the rate of 4.45% excluding duties recorded at December 31  2022. At 4.85% including duties (EPRA Net Initial Yield)  the capitalisation rate of our portfolio is thus close to the French prime rate of 4.75% (source: CBRE as at December 31  2023)  thus reflecting the PREMIUM-quality of our assets.The average residual lease term increased to 5.7 years compared with 5.5 years as at December 31  2022.The weighted average age was 11.1 years.A record development pipeline for 2024: €180 million9After €132 million of investments in 2023 for 100 000 sq.m of new lettable area  ARGAN is determined to drive its solid momentum further in 2024 by delivering €180 million of investments in additional 170 000 sq.m of new pre-let leased off-plan (BEFA) warehouses. The average yield of 2024 projects approaches 7%.The high profitability of deliveries planned for 2024 testifies to ARGAN’s ability to pursue its profitable growth momentum  driven by a portfolio of Aut0nom® -labelled warehouses on strategic locations  as part of a long-term partnership approach with reliable and blue-chip clients.Half of 2024 developments were pre-financed through mortgage amortizing loans  and the other half will be through warehouses disposals in 2024 and in 2025.Overall  2023 and 2024 are two record years in terms of investments for ARGAN  with a total of over €310 million for 270 000 sq.m of new lettable areas.With a development pipeline projected to be steady and solid  ARGAN is anticipating an average annual growth rate of about +5% in its rental income over the 2024-2026 period (including the impact of selective warehouse disposals that will be carried out over the same period).NAV EPRA of continuation (NTA) at €79 per shareThe NRV (reconstitution NAV) was €90.6 per share at December 31  2023 (-14% over one year).The NTA (continuation NAV) was €79.1 per share at December 31  2023 (-15% over one year).The NDV (liquidation NAV) was €83.6 per share at December 31  2023 (-11% over one year).More particularly  the trend in the NTA (continuation NAV) over the year represents  in value  a-€13.8 decrease compared with December 31  2022 that comes from net earnings per share (+€5.5)  the change in the value of the assets (-€16.2)  the payment of the dividend in cash (-€2.7) and in shares (-€0.4).A solid balance sheet: debt ratios set to decrease significantlyA cost of debt under tight controlReflecting tight control  our gross debt remained virtually stable compared with the end of December 2022 and stood at €1.9 billion  which is the same level our net debt stood at.On a backdrop of strongly increasing interest rates in 2023  the average cost of our debt remained low at 2.3% as at December 31  2023  compared with 1.5% as at December 31  2022  for a maturity of 5.8 years. Our Group is not expecting a significant increase of its cost of debt  estimating it at about 2.4% for 2024 based on a hypothesis of 4% for the average 3-month Euribor rate for the year.ARGAN primarily uses long-term financing with fixed rates or with hedging instruments  which helps our Group contain the impact of changing interest rates on the cost of its debt. Our debt is indeed made up of:55% fixed-rate debt;40% of hedged variable debt ;Only 5% variable rate debt that is not hedged.Selective asset disposals in the short term set to accelerate the natural pace of our debt reductionARGAN confirmed it would no longer use debt to finance its development (2024-2026 period). As planned  our Group has more particularly repaid on July 4  2023  its bond in an amount of €130 million  issued in June 2017  at a fixed rate of 3.25%.The Group’s debt is mainly made of mortgage loans (74% of our debt at the end of December 2023)  which means it is being amortized by around €100 million each year. This particularity grants ARGAN with a linear and adequate debt reimbursement. This also means that an LTV ratio approaching 50% is of smaller significance for us than for other companies whose debt structure would primarily consist in bonds  with substantial maturity deadlines and refinancing needs.Moreover  of the two previously laid-out options  ARGAN has decided at this stage to self-finance its development  through selective asset disposals from 2024 on and pending on trends in market conditions.This value-creative positive policy will consist in selling assets with lower capitalisation rates to develop in turn warehouses more frugal in terms of carbon emissions with higher yields.This is why  a first asset is under the process of being sold (for a value of €17 million) and ARGAN is aiming for total proceeds from assets sales of about €75 million in 2024.As such  ARGAN is renouncing for now  due to current market conditions  to set up a third-party investment with selected investors .Significant and fast decrease in debt ratiosOur net debt level as at December 31  2023 results in an net EPRA LTV (net financial debt/appraised value excluding duties) that increased to 49.7% due to the mechanical impact of assets valuation  but that also remained much lower than our bond’s covenant (65%).As part of a strengthened debt reduction policy by ARGAN from 2024 to 2026  and assuming a capitalisation rate remaining close to the one recorded at the end of December of 2023 (equal to or lower than 5.25%)  our LTV ratio (excluding duties) would significantly decrease already by the end of 2024. It would then stand below 40% by the end of 2026  thus remaining well under our (bond) covenant of 65%. This trajectory would also be consistent with an LTV ratio of about 33% by 2030.In addition  our net debt to EBITDA ratio  which stood at 11 times at the end of December 2023  would then decrease to about 8x by the end of 2026 and 7x at the end of 2030  under the same hypotheses as above.ARGAN’s trajectory prevents any financing in the short term. It will also result in a good positioning to be granted optimal conditions to refinance our bond  in an amount of €500 million  when its maturity date comes in November 2026.ESG roadmap: a strongly proactive policyAccelerating the decarbonation of our businessARGAN has no intention to build warehouses whose operation processes are not up to the stakes linked with climate change and the preservation of our ecosystems.This is why our Group is already systematically deploying for all new projects Aut0nom® -labelled warehouses. This Net Zero “in-use” logistics warehouse generates and uses its own green energy. Consequently  carbon emissions are drastically shrunk compared with a standard logistics building.Regarding residual emissions  we are committing  starting 2024  to compensate them with reforestation actions that will be submitted to the French State Low Carbon Label (Label Bas Carbone délivré par l’État français).Additionally  for the existing portfolio of warehouses  ARGAN is investing an overall amount of €50 million over the coming years to replace gas boilers  which are highly CO 2 emitting  with air/water electric heat pumps. These investments are projected to generate yields of 8% or over.Together  these actions  along the commitments made for 2025 and 2030 and part of our published 2023 ESG report  place our roadmap for carbon emissions reduction in line with a 1.5°C SBTi trajectory.Fully involving ARGAN employees to team successRegarding the Social and Societal component  ARGAN is lastly focusing on continued involvement of all employees to collective success by sharing the created value. This is why we decided to maintain an attractive salary policy with 100% of our people who are from now on shareholders of the company through Free Share Plans  which are renewed each year.2024 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)March 21: General Assembly 2024April 2: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2024July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2024July 24: Half-year results 2024October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20242025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2024January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services (""the Company"")  announces","Amsterdam and Kyiv  18 January 2024 - VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services (""the Company"")  announces its preliminary assessment of the financial impact of the cybersecurity incident that affected the network and services of its Ukrainian subsidiary Kyivstar in December 2023.The incident  which was caused by a widespread external cyberattack  resulted in a temporary disruption of Kyivstar's network and services  interrupting the provision of voice and data connectivity on mobile and fixed networks  international roaming  and SMS services  amongst others  for Kyivstar customers in Ukraine and abroad. Working relentlessly  and in collaboration with the Ukrainian law enforcement agencies  the Security Service of Ukraine and government agencies  Kyivstar restored services in multiple stages starting with voice and data connectivity. After stabilizing the network  Kyivstar immediately launched offers to thank its customers for their loyalty  including one month of free services on certain types of contracts.VEON and Kyivstar also engaged in a financial impact assessment  the preliminary results of which have become available.Largely because of the limited period during which the critical services were down  VEON expects no material financial impact on its consolidated results for the year ended 31 December 2023 due to these service disruptions  or due to costs associated with additional IT capabilities required for restoring services  replacing lost equipment  or compensating external consultants and partners in 2023.However  the Company does anticipate that there will be an impact on its consolidated revenue results for the year ending 31 December 2024 associated with the revenue loss arising from the customer loyalty measures taken by Kyivstar in order to compensate for the inconvenience caused during the disruptions. The revenue impact of these offers is currently estimated to be approximately 3.6 billion UAH (approximately 95 million USD).Kyivstar plans to continue its remediation and compensation efforts in the coming months. The costs or loss of revenue of any other such remediation measures is uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.VEON and Kyivstar would once again like to thank their customers for the support and loyalty demonstrated during and in the aftermath of the cyberattack; and to their industry partners and Ukrainian authorities for their support in the recovery of the services.Important NoticeElements of this press release contain or may contain ""inside information"" as defined under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014.About VEONVEON is a digital operator that provides converged connectivity and digital services to nearly 160 million customers.

For 2024  we expect continued sales growth driven by an increasing benefit from direct-to-consumer (DTC) initiatives  initial contribution from the ResMed commercial partnership in Germany and geographic expansion.“Since Nyxoah’s founding we have been guided by the mission to improve the lives of OSA patients. This led to the development of the patient-centric Genio HGNS system. Genio’s single-incision  leadless  upgradable design powered and controlled by a wearable resonated with clinicians and patients and led to a strong European launch. Genio’s bilateral stimulation enables treatment of CCC  and the label was subsequently expanded to include these patients  whose only treatment option after failing CPAP up until then was major palate surgery ” commented Olivier Taelman  Chief Executive Officer.“In our ongoing effort to provide patients greater control over their therapy  thereby making sleep simple again  we then received approval for Genio 2.1. Genio 2.1 offers patients daily feedback on therapy usage and autonomy to adjust stimulation amplitude within pre-defined boundaries  improving patient comfort and compliance without the need for a surgical procedure to replace the implantable component.”“We are now on the cusp of the most significant milestone in the Company’s history with the reporting of DREAM results in the coming months. We expect to complete the PMA submission shortly after and are accelerating manufacturing and commercial investments to ensure we are fully prepared to replicate our European success in the U.S. With an approaching U.S. launch and continued growth in Europe  we are excited for the coming years.”About NyxoahNyxoah is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).
