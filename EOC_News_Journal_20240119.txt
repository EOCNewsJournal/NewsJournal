Flutter plans to retain its primary London listing but will delist from Euronext Dublin.“Excitement about the company’s imminent U.S. stock market listing and commentary around continued momentum in the business allowed investors to look past a hit from customer-friendly sporting results in the U.S. at Flutter Entertainment ” said Russ Mould  investment director at AJ Bell.“The hope will be the company  whose strategy is heavily oriented to capitalizing on an emerging opportunity in the U.S.  can attract a higher valuation off the back of its U.S. listing. The legalisation of sports betting across much of the U.S. has created a huge new market which many U.K. bookmakers are looking to tap into  to varying degrees of success.”Flutter said FanDuel retains its “clear number one sportsbook” in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. The rival to DraftKings DKNG  +0.21%   Penn Entertainment PENN  -1.85% and others said fourth-quarter U.S. revenue will be $225 million lower than previous guidance  at $1.42 billion.Flutter did say it was pleased with its U.S. sportsbook gross revenue margins of 13.5%  up by 2.2 percentage points from last year. “We’ve been growing over the years our expected margin  and that’s the capabilities that we have in risk and trading  the very strong market share that we have in the parlay product  which we are really the most famous for  and that does have a high margin for us ” said CFO Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson on an analyst call  according to a FactSet transcript.“Q4 and Q1 are the biggest sports quarters  as you know  and the biggest in the sports that we are biggest in  so they are our best quarters from a margin perspective. It won’t be a performance that we can replicate every quarter  certainly not at the moment  and we’ll have to see what happens in the first quarter.”Flutter also said its ex-U.S. trading was in line with guidance.Flutter said it can’t give forward guidance until its registration statement is approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services (“the Company”)  announces its preliminary assessment of the financial impact of the c…,Amsterdam and Kyiv  18 January 2024 – VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services (“the Company”)  announces its preliminary assessment of the financial impact of the cybersecurity incident that affected the network and services of its Ukrainian subsidiary Kyivstar in December 2023.The incident  which was caused by a widespread external cyberattack  resulted in a temporary disruption of Kyivstar's network and services  interrupting the provision of voice and data connectivity on mobile and fixed networks  international roaming  and SMS services  amongst others  for Kyivstar customers in Ukraine and abroad. Working relentlessly  and in collaboration with the Ukrainian law enforcement agencies  the Security Service of Ukraine and government agencies  Kyivstar restored services in multiple stages starting with voice and data connectivity. After stabilizing the network  Kyivstar immediately launched offers to thank its customers for their loyalty  including one month of free services on certain types of contracts.VEON and Kyivstar also engaged in a financial impact assessment  the preliminary results of which have become available.Largely because of the limited period during which the critical services were down  VEON expects no material financial impact on its consolidated results for the year ended 31 December 2023 due to these service disruptions  or due to costs associated with additional IT capabilities required for restoring services  replacing lost equipment  or compensating external consultants and partners in 2023.However  the Company does anticipate that there will be an impact on its consolidated revenue results for the year ending 31 December 2024 associated with the revenue loss arising from the customer loyalty measures taken by Kyivstar in order to compensate for the inconvenience caused during the disruptions. The revenue impact of these offers is currently estimated to be approximately 3.6 billion UAH (approximately 95 million USD).Kyivstar plans to continue its remediation and compensation efforts in the coming months. The costs or loss of revenue of any other such remediation measures is uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.VEON and Kyivstar would once again like to thank their customers for the support and loyalty demonstrated during and in the aftermath of the cyberattack; and to their industry partners and Ukrainian authorities for their support in the recovery of the services.Important NoticeElements of this press release contain or may contain “inside information” as defined under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014.About VEONVEON is a digital operator that provides converged connectivity and digital services to nearly 160 million customers.

(NASDAQ:VEON  Euronext Amsterdam:VEON)  a leading global provider of connectivity and internet services  has reported a preliminary financial assessment related to a cyberattack on its Ukrainian subsidiary Kyivstar in December 2023. The cyberattack caused significant disruptions to Kyivstar's network  affecting voice and data services  international roaming  and SMS for users both in Ukraine and abroad.The company worked closely with Ukrainian law enforcement  the Security Service of Ukraine  and government agencies to restore services  starting with voice and data connectivity. In an expression of gratitude for customer loyalty during the outage  Kyivstar offered one month of free services on certain contracts.Despite the service disruption  VEON expects no material financial impact on its consolidated results for the fiscal year ended December 31  2023. The costs associated with restoring services  replacing equipment  and external consultancy have been deemed non-material. However  VEON anticipates an impact on its 2024 revenue due to the loyalty offers extended to Kyivstar customers. The estimated revenue loss from these offers is approximately 3.6 billion UAH (around 95 million USD).The full extent of financial implications from ongoing remediation efforts is currently uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated  as stated by VEON. The company has reiterated its gratitude to customers for their support and loyalty post-cyberattack  and to its industry partners and Ukrainian authorities who assisted in the recovery process.VEON is a digital operator that serves nearly 160 million customers across six countries  aiming to transform lives with technology-driven services. Headquartered in Amsterdam  the company is publicly traded on NASDAQ and Euronext.This announcement is based on a press release statement and contains forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services (“the Company”)  announces its preliminary assessment of the financial impact of the cybersecurity incident that affected the network and services of its Ukrainian subsidiary Kyivstar in December 2023.The incident  which was caused by a widespread external cyberattack  resulted in a temporary disruption of Kyivstar's network and services  interrupting the provision of voice and data connectivity on mobile and fixed networks  international roaming  and SMS services  amongst others  for Kyivstar customers in Ukraine and abroad. Working relentlessly  and in collaboration with the Ukrainian law enforcement agencies  the Security Service of Ukraine and government agencies  Kyivstar restored services in multiple stages starting with voice and data connectivity. After stabilizing the network  Kyivstar immediately launched offers to thank its customers for their loyalty  including one month of free services on certain types of contracts.VEON and Kyivstar also engaged in a financial impact assessment  the preliminary results of which have become available.Largely because of the limited period during which the critical services were down  VEON expects no material financial impact on its consolidated results for the year ended 31 December 2023 due to these service disruptions  or due to costs associated with additional IT capabilities required for restoring services  replacing lost equipment  or compensating external consultants and partners in 2023.However  the Company does anticipate that there will be an impact on its consolidated revenue results for the year ending 31 December 2024 associated with the revenue loss arising from the customer loyalty measures taken by Kyivstar in order to compensate for the inconvenience caused during the disruptions. The revenue impact of these offers is currently estimated to be approximately 3.6 billion UAH (approximately 95 million USD).Kyivstar plans to continue its remediation and compensation efforts in the coming months. The costs or loss of revenue of any other such remediation measures is uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.VEON and Kyivstar would once again like to thank their customers for the support and loyalty demonstrated during and in the aftermath of the cyberattack; and to their industry partners and Ukrainian authorities for their support in the recovery of the services.Important NoticeElements of this press release contain or may contain “inside information” as defined under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014.About VEONVEON is a digital operator that provides converged connectivity and digital services to nearly 160 million customers.

The maximum amount of the issue is €2.3 million. “We are delighted to have been selected by LITA.co  whose commitment to the sustainable economy through the financing of responsible businesses with a positive impact is perfectly aligned with our values. The platform’s panel of experts praised ENOGIA’s growth prospects  its sense of responsibility and its positive impact on society. ENOGIA aims to use the funds raised to finance its commercial acceleration  while at the same time offering all investors the opportunity to share in its favourable growth prospects  in an environment driven by the challenges of decarbonisation and the need to accelerate the ecological transition of industrial companies ” said Arthur Leroux  Chairman and CEO of ENOGIA. ENOGIA  a unique technology serving the energy transition A French SME founded in 2009 to accelerate the ecological transition of heavy industry  ENOGIA uses a unique ORC micro-turbine technology (120 installed to date in over 25 countries) to convert waste heat into low-carbon electricity. The challenges: Industrial processes  which are responsible for more than 20% of global CO 2 emissions  generate residual heat known as waste heat  particularly from furnace fumes  dryer vapours and cooling systems. Recovering this lost energy is a major challenge for decarbonising industry. ENOGIA’s solutions: The ORC micro-turbines manufactured by ENOGIA enable the waste heat generated by an industrial site to be transformed into low-carbon energy that can be reused for the site’s own needs  as well as those of businesses located nearby or in the local area. The distinctive features of the ENOGIA solution are its great adaptability – it enables unprecedented use to be made of low-temperature heat sources – and the exceptional compactness of its micro-turbines  probably the best on the market. Its business model: ENOGIA derives over 90% of its revenue from machine sales and maintenance  with the remainder coming from customised turbomachinery engineering services (studies and prototypes for third parties). In the medium term  the commercial strategy is to roll out an economy of use model based on the sale of long-term electricity agreements. It is a more capital-intensive model  but one that offers greater recurrence of revenue  more value creation over the medium term and a shorter sales cycle. Following a pre-collection period  subscriptions open today at noon and close no later than 31 March 2024  with the aim of raising a maximum of €2.3 million (minimum €1 million). This bond is eligible for the PEA-PME equity savings plan from a minimum investment of €5 000 via LITA.co.

Following this decision  VYVGART is now approved in Japan for both intravenous (IV) and self-administered SC use.“Today’s approval of VYVDURA marks a significant milestone for the gMG community in Japan and furthers our commitment to deliver innovative treatments to autoimmune patients globally ” said Hermann Strenger  General Manager  argenx Japan. “Bringing VYVDURA to Japan means there are now two formulations available for gMG patients  including the possibility to self-inject at home  allowing patients and their healthcare providers to choose the best option to meet their treatment needs.”The approval of VYVDURA is based on positive results from the Phase 3 ADAPT-SC study. ADAPT-SC established the efficacy of VYVDURA by demonstrating a reduction in percent change from baseline in total immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels comparable to VYVGART IV in adult gMG patients. ADAPT-SC was a bridging study to the Phase 3 ADAPT study  which formed the basis for approval of VYVGART in Japan in January 2022.About the ADAPT-SC TrialThe Phase 3 ADAPT-SC trial was a multicenter  randomized  open-label  parallel-group study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of VYVDURA compared with VYVGART in adult patients with gMG. The pharmacodynamic effect was measured by percent change from baseline for both total IgG and AChR autoantibody levels at day 29. Safety  clinical efficacy  immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) were also assessed. A total of 110 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the ADAPT-SC trial. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive VYVDURA or VYVGART for one treatment cycle consisting of four doses at once-weekly intervals. The total study duration was approximately 12 weeks  including seven weeks of follow-up after the treatment cycle. At the completion of ADAPT-SC  patients had the opportunity to roll-over to ADAPT-SC+  an open-label extension study.About VYVDURA®VYVDURA is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART®  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVDURA results in the reduction of circulating IgG. VYVGART SC was approved in the United States in June 2023 and is marketed as VYVGART® Hytrulo.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness.

Following this decision  VYVGART is now approved in Japan for both intravenous (IV) and self-administered SC use.“Today’s approval of VYVDURA marks a significant milestone for the gMG community in Japan and furthers our commitment to deliver innovative treatments to autoimmune patients globally ” said Hermann Strenger  General Manager  argenx Japan. “Bringing VYVDURA to Japan means there are now two formulations available for gMG patients  including the possibility to self-inject at home  allowing patients and their healthcare providers to choose the best option to meet their treatment needs.”The approval of VYVDURA is based on positive results from the Phase 3 ADAPT-SC study. ADAPT-SC established the efficacy of VYVDURA by demonstrating a reduction in percent change from baseline in total immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels comparable to VYVGART IV in adult gMG patients. ADAPT-SC was a bridging study to the Phase 3 ADAPT study  which formed the basis for approval of VYVGART in Japan in January 2022.About the ADAPT-SC TrialThe Phase 3 ADAPT-SC trial was a multicenter  randomized  open-label  parallel-group study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of VYVDURA compared with VYVGART in adult patients with gMG. The pharmacodynamic effect was measured by percent change from baseline for both total IgG and AChR autoantibody levels at day 29. Safety  clinical efficacy  immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) were also assessed. A total of 110 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the ADAPT-SC trial. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive VYVDURA or VYVGART for one treatment cycle consisting of four doses at once-weekly intervals. The total study duration was approximately 12 weeks  including seven weeks of follow-up after the treatment cycle. At the completion of ADAPT-SC  patients had the opportunity to roll-over to ADAPT-SC+  an open-label extension study.About VYVDURA®VYVDURA is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART®  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVDURA results in the reduction of circulating IgG. VYVGART SC was approved in the United States in June 2023 and is marketed as VYVGART® Hytrulo.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in the U.S.  Japan  Israel  the EU  the UK  Canada and China.

I have to add that our policy for strong debt reduction will result in a sizeable decrease of our LTV ratio as early as 2024  to be under 40% by the end of 20261.Beyond these considerations  we confirm that we are deploying a very proactive ESG roadmap. We are thus fully committed to reduce our carbon impact. This is why we systematically deploy our Aut0nom®-labelled warehouses that generate their own green energy and invest €50 million in the coming years in the installation of electric heat pumps to replace gas boilers installed in our existing portfolio.

The audit procedures of our statutory auditors on these consolidated financial statements have been carried out. The certification report will be issued after the specific checks have been carried out.Strong increase in our main financial indicatorsOver 2023  ARGAN recorded an excellent operating performance  which resulted in a strong increase of the rental income (+11%) and Group share net recurring income (+5%). These results demonstrate once again our Group’s capacity to turn its very good performance into robust cash flow  in particular thanks to tight control over our debt.Significant increase in our rental income: +11% in 2023ARGAN recorded a sizeable increase of +11% in its rental income in 2023  which stood at €184 million over the year. The strong momentum of 2023 came from the full-year effect of rents coming from the developments in 2022  rents of 5 warehouses delivered in 2023  as well as the indexation that took place on January 1  2023 (+4% on average).An occupancy rate that remains at 100%Driven by a PRIME-quality portfolio  in demanded locations  the occupancy rate has been lastingly standing at 100% amid a rental market with low supply (French vacancy rate at 4.7% at the end of December 2023 as published by CBRE). Our EPRA vacancy rate thus stands at 0%.Continued increase in our Group share Net recurring income: up +5%The Group share net recurring income increased +5%  to €126 million in 2023  representing a high margin of 69% of our rental income. Note that the net recurring income is the best reflection of our Group’s cash flow generation and shows ARGAN’s capacity to pursue the financing of its development model despite the rise of financial costs recorded over the year (+43%).When integrating the mechanical impact of the change in fair value of our portfolio for -€373.2 million  on a backdrop of rising capitalisation rates  the Group share net income stood at -€263.5 million over 12 months.Portfolio and NAV EPRA NTA: valuation maintained at levels showcasing the PREMIUM-quality of our assetsA PREMIUM portfolio appraised at €3.68 billion with a capitalisation rate of 5.1% (excluding duties)  down -7% over 12 monthsThe delivered portfolio (excluding properties under development) stood at 3 580 000 sq.m as atDecember 31  2023. Its valuation amounts to €3.68 billion excluding duties (€3.89 billion including duties)  down -7% compared with December 31  2022.The valuation of the delivered portfolio at €3.68 billion shows a capitalisation rate of 5.10% excluding duties  up from the rate of 4.45% excluding duties recorded at December 31  2022. At 4.85% including duties (EPRA Net Initial Yield)  the capitalisation rate of our portfolio is thus close to the French prime rate of 4.75% (source: CBRE as at December 31  2023)  thus reflecting the PREMIUM-quality of our assets.The average residual lease term increased to 5.7 years compared with 5.5 years as at December 31  2022.The weighted average age was 11.1 years.A record development pipeline for 2024: €180 million9After €132 million of investments in 2023 for 100 000 sq.m of new lettable area  ARGAN is determined to drive its solid momentum further in 2024 by delivering €180 million of investments in additional 170 000 sq.m of new pre-let leased off-plan (BEFA) warehouses. The average yield of 2024 projects approaches 7%.The high profitability of deliveries planned for 2024 testifies to ARGAN’s ability to pursue its profitable growth momentum  driven by a portfolio of Aut0nom® -labelled warehouses on strategic locations  as part of a long-term partnership approach with reliable and blue-chip clients.Half of 2024 developments were pre-financed through mortgage amortizing loans  and the other half will be through warehouses disposals in 2024 and in 2025.Overall  2023 and 2024 are two record years in terms of investments for ARGAN  with a total of over €310 million for 270 000 sq.m of new lettable areas.With a development pipeline projected to be steady and solid  ARGAN is anticipating an average annual growth rate of about +5% in its rental income over the 2024-2026 period (including the impact of selective warehouse disposals that will be carried out over the same period).NAV EPRA of continuation (NTA) at €79 per shareThe NRV (reconstitution NAV) was €90.6 per share at December 31  2023 (-14% over one year).The NTA (continuation NAV) was €79.1 per share at December 31  2023 (-15% over one year).The NDV (liquidation NAV) was €83.6 per share at December 31  2023 (-11% over one year).More particularly  the trend in the NTA (continuation NAV) over the year represents  in value  a-€13.8 decrease compared with December 31  2022 that comes from net earnings per share (+€5.5)  the change in the value of the assets (-€16.2)  the payment of the dividend in cash (-€2.7) and in shares (-€0.4).A solid balance sheet: debt ratios set to decrease significantlyA cost of debt under tight controlReflecting tight control  our gross debt remained virtually stable compared with the end of December 2022 and stood at €1.9 billion  which is the same level our net debt stood at.On a backdrop of strongly increasing interest rates in 2023  the average cost of our debt remained low at 2.3% as at December 31  2023  compared with 1.5% as at December 31  2022  for a maturity of 5.8 years. Our Group is not expecting a significant increase of its cost of debt  estimating it at about 2.4% for 2024 based on a hypothesis of 4% for the average 3-month Euribor rate for the year.ARGAN primarily uses long-term financing with fixed rates or with hedging instruments  which helps our Group contain the impact of changing interest rates on the cost of its debt. Our debt is indeed made up of:55% fixed-rate debt;40% of hedged variable debt ;; Only 5% variable rate debt that is not hedged.Selective asset disposals in the short term set to accelerate the natural pace of our debt reductionARGAN confirmed it would no longer use debt to finance its development (2024-2026 period). As planned  our Group has more particularly repaid on July 4  2023  its bond in an amount of €130 million  issued in June 2017  at a fixed rate of 3.25%.The Group’s debt is mainly made of mortgage loans (74% of our debt at the end of December 2023)  which means it is being amortized by around €100 million each year. This particularity grants ARGAN with a linear and adequate debt reimbursement. This also means that an LTV ratio approaching 50% is of smaller significance for us than for other companies whose debt structure would primarily consist in bonds  with substantial maturity deadlines and refinancing needs.Moreover  of the two previously laid-out options  ARGAN has decided at this stage to self-finance its development  through selective asset disposals from 2024 on and pending on trends in market conditions.This value-creative positive policy will consist in selling assets with lower capitalisation rates to develop in turn warehouses more frugal in terms of carbon emissions with higher yields.This is why  a first asset is under the process of being sold (for a value of €17 million) and ARGAN is aiming for total proceeds from assets sales of about €75 million in 2024.As such  ARGAN is renouncing for now  due to current market conditions  to set up a third-party investment with selected investors .Significant and fast decrease in debt ratiosOur net debt level as at December 31  2023 results in an net EPRA LTV (net financial debt/appraised value excluding duties) that increased to 49.7% due to the mechanical impact of assets valuation  but that also remained much lower than our bond’s covenant (65%).As part of a strengthened debt reduction policy by ARGAN from 2024 to 2026  and assuming a capitalisation rate remaining close to the one recorded at the end of December of 2023 (equal to or lower than 5.25%)  our LTV ratio (excluding duties) would significantly decrease already by the end of 2024. It would then stand below 40% by the end of 2026  thus remaining well under our (bond) covenant of 65%. This trajectory would also be consistent with an LTV ratio of about 33% by 2030.In addition  our net debt to EBITDA ratio  which stood at 11 times at the end of December 2023  would then decrease to about 8x by the end of 2026 and 7x at the end of 2030  under the same hypotheses as above.ARGAN’s trajectory prevents any financing in the short term. It will also result in a good positioning to be granted optimal conditions to refinance our bond  in an amount of €500 million  when its maturity date comes in November 2026.ESG roadmap: a strongly proactive policyAccelerating the decarbonation of our businessARGAN has no intention to build warehouses whose operation processes are not up to the stakes linked with climate change and the preservation of our ecosystems.This is why our Group is already systematically deploying for all new projects Aut0nom® -labelled warehouses. This Net Zero “in-use” logistics warehouse generates and uses its own green energy. Consequently  carbon emissions are drastically shrunk compared with a standard logistics building.Regarding residual emissions  we are committing  starting 2024  to compensate them with reforestation actions that will be submitted to the French State Low Carbon Label (Label Bas Carbone délivré par l’État français).Additionally  for the existing portfolio of warehouses  ARGAN is investing an overall amount of €50 million over the coming years to replace gas boilers  which are highly CO 2 emitting  with air/water electric heat pumps. These investments are projected to generate yields of 8% or over.Together  these actions  along the commitments made for 2025 and 2030 and part of our published 2023 ESG report  place our roadmap for carbon emissions reduction in line with a 1.5°C SBTi trajectory.Fully involving ARGAN employees to team successRegarding the Social and Societal component  ARGAN is lastly focusing on continued involvement of all employees to collective success by sharing the created value. This is why we decided to maintain an attractive salary policy with 100% of our people who are from now on shareholders of the company through Free Share Plans  which are renewed each year.2024 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)March 21: General Assembly 2024April 2: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2024quarter 2024 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2024quarter 2024 July 24: Half-year results 2024October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20242025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2024quarter 2024 January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market.

At 4.85% including duties (EPRA Net Initial Yield)  the capitalisation rate of our portfolio is thus close to the French prime rate of 4.75% (source: CBRE as at December 31  2023)  thus reflecting the PREMIUM-quality of our assets.The average residual lease term increased to 5.7 years compared with 5.5 years as at December 31  2022.The weighted average age was 11.1 years.A record development pipeline for 2024: €180 million9After €132 million of investments in 2023 for 100 000 sq.m of new lettable area  ARGAN is determined to drive its solid momentum further in 2024 by delivering €180 million of investments in additional 170 000 sq.m of new pre-let leased off-plan (BEFA) warehouses. The average yield of 2024 projects approaches 7%.The high profitability of deliveries planned for 2024 testifies to ARGAN’s ability to pursue its profitable growth momentum  driven by a portfolio of Aut0nom® -labelled warehouses on strategic locations  as part of a long-term partnership approach with reliable and blue-chip clients.Half of 2024 developments were pre-financed through mortgage amortizing loans  and the other half will be through warehouses disposals in 2024 and in 2025.Overall  2023 and 2024 are two record years in terms of investments for ARGAN  with a total of over €310 million for 270 000 sq.m of new lettable areas.With a development pipeline projected to be steady and solid  ARGAN is anticipating an average annual growth rate of about +5% in its rental income over the 2024-2026 period (including the impact of selective warehouse disposals that will be carried out over the same period).NAV EPRA of continuation (NTA) at €79 per shareThe NRV (reconstitution NAV) was €90.6 per share at December 31  2023 (-14% over one year).The NTA (continuation NAV) was €79.1 per share at December 31  2023 (-15% over one year).The NDV (liquidation NAV) was €83.6 per share at December 31  2023 (-11% over one year).More particularly  the trend in the NTA (continuation NAV) over the year represents  in value  a-€13.8 decrease compared with December 31  2022 that comes from net earnings per share (+€5.5)  the change in the value of the assets (-€16.2)  the payment of the dividend in cash (-€2.7) and in shares (-€0.4).A solid balance sheet: debt ratios set to decrease significantlyA cost of debt under tight controlReflecting tight control  our gross debt remained virtually stable compared with the end of December 2022 and stood at €1.9 billion  which is the same level our net debt stood at.On a backdrop of strongly increasing interest rates in 2023  the average cost of our debt remained low at 2.3% as at December 31  2023  compared with 1.5% as at December 31  2022  for a maturity of 5.8 years. Our Group is not expecting a significant increase of its cost of debt  estimating it at about 2.4% for 2024 based on a hypothesis of 4% for the average 3-month Euribor rate for the year.ARGAN primarily uses long-term financing with fixed rates or with hedging instruments  which helps our Group contain the impact of changing interest rates on the cost of its debt. Our debt is indeed made up of:55% fixed-rate debt;40% of hedged variable debt ;; Only 5% variable rate debt that is not hedged.Selective asset disposals in the short term set to accelerate the natural pace of our debt reductionARGAN confirmed it would no longer use debt to finance its development (2024-2026 period). As planned  our Group has more particularly repaid on July 4  2023  its bond in an amount of €130 million  issued in June 2017  at a fixed rate of 3.25%.The Group’s debt is mainly made of mortgage loans (74% of our debt at the end of December 2023)  which means it is being amortized by around €100 million each year. This particularity grants ARGAN with a linear and adequate debt reimbursement. This also means that an LTV ratio approaching 50% is of smaller significance for us than for other companies whose debt structure would primarily consist in bonds  with substantial maturity deadlines and refinancing needs.Moreover  of the two previously laid-out options  ARGAN has decided at this stage to self-finance its development  through selective asset disposals from 2024 on and pending on trends in market conditions.This value-creative positive policy will consist in selling assets with lower capitalisation rates to develop in turn warehouses more frugal in terms of carbon emissions with higher yields.This is why  a first asset is under the process of being sold (for a value of €17 million) and ARGAN is aiming for total proceeds from assets sales of about €75 million in 2024.As such  ARGAN is renouncing for now  due to current market conditions  to set up a third-party investment with selected investors .Significant and fast decrease in debt ratiosOur net debt level as at December 31  2023 results in an net EPRA LTV (net financial debt/appraised value excluding duties) that increased to 49.7% due to the mechanical impact of assets valuation  but that also remained much lower than our bond’s covenant (65%).As part of a strengthened debt reduction policy by ARGAN from 2024 to 2026  and assuming a capitalisation rate remaining close to the one recorded at the end of December of 2023 (equal to or lower than 5.25%)  our LTV ratio (excluding duties) would significantly decrease already by the end of 2024. It would then stand below 40% by the end of 2026  thus remaining well under our (bond) covenant of 65%. This trajectory would also be consistent with an LTV ratio of about 33% by 2030.In addition  our net debt to EBITDA ratio  which stood at 11 times at the end of December 2023  would then decrease to about 8x by the end of 2026 and 7x at the end of 2030  under the same hypotheses as above.ARGAN’s trajectory prevents any financing in the short term. It will also result in a good positioning to be granted optimal conditions to refinance our bond  in an amount of €500 million  when its maturity date comes in November 2026.ESG roadmap: a strongly proactive policyAccelerating the decarbonation of our businessARGAN has no intention to build warehouses whose operation processes are not up to the stakes linked with climate change and the preservation of our ecosystems.This is why our Group is already systematically deploying for all new projects Aut0nom® -labelled warehouses. This Net Zero “in-use” logistics warehouse generates and uses its own green energy. Consequently  carbon emissions are drastically shrunk compared with a standard logistics building.Regarding residual emissions  we are committing  starting 2024  to compensate them with reforestation actions that will be submitted to the French State Low Carbon Label (Label Bas Carbone délivré par l’État français).Additionally  for the existing portfolio of warehouses  ARGAN is investing an overall amount of €50 million over the coming years to replace gas boilers  which are highly CO 2 emitting  with air/water electric heat pumps. These investments are projected to generate yields of 8% or over.Together  these actions  along the commitments made for 2025 and 2030 and part of our published 2023 ESG report  place our roadmap for carbon emissions reduction in line with a 1.5°C SBTi trajectory.Fully involving ARGAN employees to team successRegarding the Social and Societal component  ARGAN is lastly focusing on continued involvement of all employees to collective success by sharing the created value. This is why we decided to maintain an attractive salary policy with 100% of our people who are from now on shareholders of the company through Free Share Plans  which are renewed each year.2024 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)March 21: General Assembly 2024April 2: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2024quarter 2024 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2024quarter 2024 July 24: Half-year results 2024October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20242025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2024quarter 2024 January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market.

35179,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/exclusive-eurazeo-takes-stake-ex-nihilo-niche-perfume-brand-1236135573/,Eurazeo Takes Stake in Ex Nihilo Niche Perfume Brand,The investment group has poured about 25 million euros into Ex Nihilo  which turned 10 last year.,PARIS — Eurazeo has taken a minority stake in French niche perfumery brand Ex Nihilo.The European group has invested approximately 25 million euros in the company  while Ex Nihilo cofounders — Sylvie Loday  Olivier Royère and Benoît Verdier — are majority owners.Niche fragrance brands are a sweet spot in the swiftly growing perfume industry today.“Consumers are now looking for more personalized fragrance to express their individuality  creating strong demand for niche fragrance brands ” said Aishwarya Rajpara  senior research analyst at Euromonitor International.Simultaneously  new demographics  such as Chinese shoppers  are swiftly becoming niche fragrance aficionados  expanding the overall market substantially.Eurazeo’s investment is mean to help support Ex Nihilo’s growth  with the investment group leveraging its international network spanning Europe  Asia and the U.S. Eurazeo is also to lend its digital capabilities  home in on Ex Nihilo and its community  as well as bolster the brand’s organization worldwide.Ex Nihilo  which is Latin for “created out of nothing ” was founded in 2013. The brand is rooted in French luxury perfumery savoir-faire and has made a mark with its modern approach to craftsmanship  artistic and brand collaborations  and the possibility for personalization of fragrances and packaging.“When we created the house  the idea was to represent the French avant-garde ” Verdier said.The brand partners with Givaudan perfumers. Ex Nihilo’s bestselling fragrance was among its first — Fleur Narcotique  by Quentin Bisch.“We love to collaborate with the outsiders  the young and emerging talents that could bring a lot to the house ” Verdier said.Ex Nihilo cofounders Benoît Verdier  Sylvie Loday and Olivier Royère.Ex Nihilo has about 50 perfumes today  with prices upward of 280 euros for a 100ml. bottle.Fragrance blending is possible through the brand’s Osmologue machines  which let consumers customizecertain Ex Nihilo scents. The brand also produces collectible pieces and unique  made-to-measure perfumes on demand.Ex Nihilo generates about $60 million in retail sales through brick-and-mortar and digital retail channels. Its distribution includes prestige department stores  such as Harrods  Bergdorf Goodman  Galeries Lafayette and Saks Fifth Avenue. There are also seven flagships offering the personalization service  plus partnerships with specialty stores and niche perfumeries.The brand has about 300 sales points globally today.Europe and the Middle East are Ex Nihilo’s geographic anchors at present.Verdier said organically  the time has become right to bring in an investor.“After 10 years  we were quite big and well-established  but still quite small and very exclusive ” he said. “Now  we want to give a new momentum. We wanted to find the right partner.”Eurazeo was a great fit in many ways  including corporate culture and on a personal level  according to Verdier.Geographically  a strategy is to grow Ex Nihilo’s presence in the U.S. and soon in China  as well as elsewhere in Asia and digitally.All its stores are inspired by the first Paris boutique  on Rue Saint-Honoré  with the house’s signature royal blue as well as a local detail.“[Eurazeo is] expert in growing mid-sized companies into something bigger ” Verdier said. They bring a lot of knowledge.”That includes consumer-related data.Laurent Droin  managing director of Eurazeo Brands  called the relationship with Ex Nihilo founders “a partnership.”“It’s a whole story and a very differentiated brand ” he said.Droin explained Eurazeo was drawn to Ex Nihilo for various reasons.“One is the sector [it’s in] ” he said. “Niche fragrance is a very interesting sector. Fragrance in general is a growing market  but niche fragrance is the segment that is growing the most.”Droin described perfume as a category that gives a lot of experience and content  what consumers are after.“The fragrance you wear tells who you are  it’s an experience that you smell every day. It is also a message you want to pass on to people ” he explained. “So it’s incredibly powerful.”Droin sees the niche fragrance segment poised for growth.“The high-end niche fragrance is here to stay ” he said.Eurazeo’s Laurent Droin Peter AllanEurazeo was also drawn to Ex Nihilo itself.“It’s quite difficult to build a differentiated brand in this market  and the three founders have managed to create a brand of scale ” said Droin  adding this has been done through the consumer experience and perfume quality. He also lauded Ex Nihilo’s authenticity.“The third piece is the quality of the partnership ” Droin said. “It’s very important that we are value-add capital. I think there was a real fit between what they were expecting — support  a sparring partner and what we want to do. There has been a good chemistry with them.”The first orders of the day will be to structure the company for the next phase of growth. That includes recruiting and reinforcing the brand’s culture.“The second point is going to be to help them polish the brand — they have a gem ” Droin said. “When you scale it  you have to polish the diamond.”Thirdly  it’s to support Ex Nihilo’s international growth  in a limited number of key markets. Growing business in the U.S. is the next frontier  while Asia  especially China  is a commitment for the long term.Eurazeo has been refocusing on Europe. Jill Granoff  formerly chief executive officer of U.S.-based Eurazeo Brands  has shifted her role to become a senior adviser. In Eurazeo’s December newsletter  Christophe Bavière and William Kadouch-Chassaing  co-CEOs of Eurazeo  wrote: “Our ambition is to become the leading player in private asset management in Europe in the mid-cap  growth and impact segments.”In April 2022  Eurazeo  through its brands team  led a Series B funding round for Gisou  the premium honey-based hair and beauty brand from the Netherlands. That left Eurazeo with a minority stake in the business. Eurazeo sees in the consumer segment an opportunity to invest in growth equity — Droin underlined Eurazeo’s commitment to the long-term prospect of brands offering what’s relevant and meaningful to consumers.“We are really about the future of consumers ” he said. “And we believe that consumers are here to stay — the spending is not going down. They are just reallocating in a more meaningful way.”They’re about less but better  more experience and content  outlined Droin.“Every shift is an opportunity for investors ” he said.In the consumer segment  especially beauty  exit opportunities are very good  as many big strategics are looking to invest in the category today. Over the past two years in niche perfumes  major deals have included Kering acquiring Creed and Puig purchasing Byredo.Strategics are after innovative brands to scale for the long term.Eurazeo  which is listed on Euronext Paris  has 33.5 billion euros in diversified assets under management and supports more than 600 mid-market companies.
