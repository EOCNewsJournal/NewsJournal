European green and renewable hydrogen producer and supplier Lhyfe (EURONEXT: LHYFE) and European renewable energy developer Source,"Nantes (France) & London (United Kingdom)  22 January 2024 - 7.30am. European green and renewable hydrogen producer and supplier Lhyfe (EURONEXT: LHYFE) and European renewable energy developer Source Galileo today announced their joint agreement to develop commercial-scale green and renewable hydrogen production units in the UK and Ireland.The companies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the goal of deploying production facilities powered by renewable energy  providing a boost to the Net Zero goals of both countries.Under the agreement  Lhyfe and Source Galileo will combine their expertise to generate and supply the environmentally-friendly gas to a variety of customers across industry and transport  helping them decarbonise their operations.The partnership will see Lhyfe and Source Galileo collaborate to establish commercial-scale green hydrogen production sites in the UK  with plans already underway for multiple units.The energy firms are also exploring opportunities in Ireland  focusing on identifying consumers and assessing factors such as grid availability  power supply  land accessibility  and planning requirements.By working together  Lhyfe and Source Galileo believe that their economies of scale can accelerate the roll-out of green hydrogen  meeting the increasing demand from companies aiming to reduce their reliance on natural gas and other fossil fuels.Initially  the companies will focus on using electricity from onshore renewable sources. However  in the longer term  they could harness the enormous offshore wind potential in the UK and Ireland  which would help overcome electricity grid constraints.Lhyfe is one of the world's pioneers in producing green and renewable hydrogen through water electrolysis  with its units being powered by renewable electricity.The France-based multinational's first plant at Pays de La Loire has been operating since the 2nd half of 2021  with two more sites inaugurated in Occitanie and Brittany in December 2023.An additional five sites are currently under construction or extension throughout Europe.Since launching its UK operation in 2022 to support regional decarbonisation  Lhyfe has established offices in Newcastle and Sheffield.Lhyfe aims to achieve a green hydrogen production capacity of 200MW by the end of 2026 and an ambitious goal of 3GW by the end of 2030.Source Galileo was founded to accelerate the roll-out of large-scale renewable energy projects as part of the energy transition.It has a pipeline of approximately 10GW of offshore wind and hydrogen projects under development in the UK  Ireland and Norway.The company is also developing onshore battery storage and solar projects.Green hydrogen can support deep decarbonisation  particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy industry  including chemicals and steelmaking. It can also be used for heavy transport  including buses  trucks  construction or logistics vehicles  etc.Green hydrogen  produced from water and electrolysis  can also in the long term replace the more than 3000TWh of hydrogen currently produced from oil  gas and coal throughout the world.The UK Government has doubled its low-carbon hydrogen production target from 5GW to 10GW by 2030  with at least half of this coming from green hydrogen.Ireland published its National Hydrogen Strategy in July 2023  outlining plans to develop 2GW of hydrogen production from offshore wind farms in the country by 2030.Kevin Lynch  CEO of Source Galileo  said: ""We believe the development of a hydrogen economy alongside electricity is critical to the energy transition. Both the UK and Ireland have hydrogen strategies. The UK has committed to deploying 50GW of offshore wind by 2030  and Ireland is expected to develop at least 20GW of offshore wind by 2040  with an initial target of 2GW of hydrogen production from offshore wind by 2030. Our partnership with Lhyfe provides an onshore and offshore platform and a major step forward from which to assist in delivering government hydrogen targets.""Stirling Habbitts  Director Hydrogen Business Development at Source Galileo  said: ""With Lhyfe  we are geared towards decarbonising challenging sectors  particularly industrial processes  through the use of green hydrogen. Hydrogen's role as an energy carrier will be pivotal in overcoming emerging constraints in current electricity grids  ensuring a supplemental and additional supply of clean energy to industries beyond the electricity grid's current capabilities.""Taia Kronborg  Chief Business Officer at Lhyfe  said: ""We are pleased to announce this agreement with Source Galileo  which represents an exciting opportunity to drive forward the clean energy transition with large-scale green hydrogen production. At Lhyfe  we are moving at pace to enable decarbonisation in our communities and unleash the extraordinary potential of renewable energy across the UK and Ireland. Green hydrogen is one of the key solutions to reaching net zero  and the good news is it's available to be deployed today  improving national energy security while turbo-charging local economies.""About Green HydrogenHydrogen is a gas that emits no carbon dioxide when it is used  but its carbon footprint varies depending on how it is made. Lhyfe's green and renewable hydrogen is produced from a process of electrolysis of water  in production units powered by renewable electricity.Water is fed into the electrolyser  which is split into hydrogen and oxygen meaning the only by-product is oxygen.The hydrogen is compressed and transported locally from the production unit  providing an alternative to fossil fuels.About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen. Its production sites and portfolio of projects intend to provide access to green and renewable hydrogen in industrial quantities  and enable the creation of a virtuous energy model capable of decarbonising entire sectors of industry and transport.In 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the first industrial-scale green hydrogen production plant in the world to be interconnected with a wind farm. In 2022  the company inaugurated the first offshore green hydrogen production pilot platform in the world. In 2023  it inaugurated its second and third sites  and currently has five sites under construction or expansion across Europe.Lhyfe is represented in 12 European countries and had 192 staff at the end of June 2023. The company is listed on the Euronext market in Paris (ISIN: FR0014009YQ1 - LHYFE).

However  in the longer term  they could harness the enormous offshore wind potential in the UK and Ireland  which would help overcome electricity grid constraints.Lhyfe is one of the world's pioneers in producing green and renewable hydrogen through water electrolysis  with its units being powered by renewable electricity.The France-based multinational's first plant at Pays de La Loire has been operating since the 2nd half of 2021  with two more sites inaugurated in Occitanie and Brittany in December 2023.An additional five sites are currently under construction or extension throughout Europe.Since launching its UK operation in 2022 to support regional decarbonisation  Lhyfe has established offices in Newcastle and Sheffield.Lhyfe aims to achieve a green hydrogen production capacity of 200MW by the end of 2026 and an ambitious goal of 3GW by the end of 2030.Source Galileo was founded to accelerate the roll-out of large-scale renewable energy projects as part of the energy transition.It has a pipeline of approximately 10GW of offshore wind and hydrogen projects under development in the UK  Ireland and Norway.The company is also developing onshore battery storage and solar projects.Green hydrogen can support deep decarbonisation  particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy industry  including chemicals and steelmaking. It can also be used for heavy transport  including buses  trucks  construction or logistics vehicles  etc.Green hydrogen  produced from water and electrolysis  can also in the long term replace the more than 3000TWh of hydrogen currently produced from oil  gas and coal throughout the world.The UK Government has doubled its low-carbon hydrogen production target from 5GW to 10GW by 2030  with at least half of this coming from green hydrogen.Ireland published its National Hydrogen Strategy in July 2023  outlining plans to develop 2GW of hydrogen production from offshore wind farms in the country by 2030.Kevin Lynch  CEO of Source Galileo  said: “We believe the development of a hydrogen economy alongside electricity is critical to the energy transition. Both the UK and Ireland have hydrogen strategies. The UK has committed to deploying 50GW of offshore wind by 2030  and Ireland is expected to develop at least 20GW of offshore wind by 2040  with an initial target of 2GW of hydrogen production from offshore wind by 2030. Our partnership with Lhyfe provides an onshore and offshore platform and a major step forward from which to assist in delivering government hydrogen targets.”Stirling Habbitts  Director Hydrogen Business Development at Source Galileo  said: “With Lhyfe  we are geared towards decarbonising challenging sectors  particularly industrial processes  through the use of green hydrogen. Hydrogen's role as an energy carrier will be pivotal in overcoming emerging constraints in current electricity grids  ensuring a supplemental and additional supply of clean energy to industries beyond the electricity grid's current capabilities.”Taia Kronborg  Chief Business Officer at Lhyfe  said: “We are pleased to announce this agreement with Source Galileo  which represents an exciting opportunity to drive forward the clean energy transition with large-scale green hydrogen production. At Lhyfe  we are moving at pace to enable decarbonisation in our communities and unleash the extraordinary potential of renewable energy across the UK and Ireland. Green hydrogen is one of the key solutions to reaching net zero  and the good news is it's available to be deployed today  improving national energy security while turbo-charging local economies.”About Green HydrogenHydrogen is a gas that emits no carbon dioxide when it is used  but its carbon footprint varies depending on how it is made. Lhyfe's green and renewable hydrogen is produced from a process of electrolysis of water  in production units powered by renewable electricity.Water is fed into the electrolyser  which is split into hydrogen and oxygen meaning the only by-product is oxygen.The hydrogen is compressed and transported locally from the production unit  providing an alternative to fossil fuels.About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen. Its production sites and portfolio of projects intend to provide access to green and renewable hydrogen in industrial quantities  and enable the creation of a virtuous energy model capable of decarbonising entire sectors of industry and transport.In 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the first industrial-scale green hydrogen production plant in the world to be interconnected with a wind farm. In 2022  the company inaugurated the first offshore green hydrogen production pilot platform in the world. In 2023  it inaugurated its second and third sites  and currently has five sites under construction or expansion across Europe.Lhyfe is represented in 12 European countries and had 192 staff at the end of June 2023. The company is listed on the Euronext market in Paris (ISIN: FR0014009YQ1 – LHYFE).
