35229,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://euobserver.com/ukraine/157958,Russia may attack Baltic nations after Ukraine  says Lithuania,Russia may launch attacks against Baltic nations and other eastern flank states if it is not stopped in Ukraine  says Lithuania.,"Russia may launch attacks against Baltic nations and other eastern flank states if it is not stopped in Ukraine  according to Lithuania.""If Russia is not stopped in Ukraine  it could continue. And then it's Baltic states who would be next "" Gabrielius Landsbergis  Lithuania's minister of foreign affairs  told reporters in Brussels on Monday (22 January).Student or retired? Then this plan is for you.Speaking ahead of a ministerial meeting that included a video conference with Ukrainian foreign minister Dmitry Kuleba  Landsbergis said immediate efforts are needed to prepare for a possible conflict with Russia.The statements followed earlier comments from Germany's defence minister  Boris Pistorius  that Russia could launch attacks against Nato members within the next few years  amid an acute ammunition and funding shortage for Ukraine.Sweden's commander-in-chief general Micael Bydén had earlier this month instructed Swedes to mentally prepare for war.Dutch admiral and senior Nato official Rob Bauer also said on 19 January: ""We have to realise it's not a given that we are in peace. And that's why [Nato forces] are preparing for a conflict with Russia.""Landsbergis said preparations are needed now  saying that Ukraine is buying the rest of Europe time through spilled blood on its behalf.He said Lithuania has since increased its defence spending to 2.7 percent of its GDP with talks underway to introduce universal conscription.""We feel the chill of the war on our necks "" he said  noting that a collective EU fund is needed to further shore up aid to Ukraine.Latvia and Estonia on edgeSimilar comments were issued by the foreign ministers of Latvia and Estonia  also on Monday.Estonia's foreign minister Margus Tsahkna told EUobserver: ""When I was [Estonian] defence minister in 2017  we used to have 100 000 troops on the other side of the Russian border ready to go if they got the order. Many of these troops were sent to Ukraine and don't exist any more  so I'm not panicking. But  of course  we know  Russia is able to prepare for the next conflict [after Ukraine] and be ready in maybe three or four years"".Latvia's foreign minister Krišjānis Karins  said: ""I think we have to open up our eyes and realise that Russia will not stop its war in Ukraine"".Karins said a decision needs to be made to ensure funding for Ukraine in the long-term.""We also have to make sure that we provide the weapons and the ammunition that they need in order to do this task "" he said.Sign up for EUobserver’s daily newsletter All the stories we publish  sent at 7.30 AM. By signing up  you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.And without mentioning Hungary  he took a broad swipe at those who believe EU money is better spent elsewhere.""If we do not help Ukraine stop Russia now. It will be only all the more expensive for us later "" he said.The comments are likely linked to a stalled disbursement of €50bn in long-term funding for Ukraine that Budapest vetoed in December  as well as funding troubles from the European Peace Facility (EPF)  an off-budget instrument.The EPF reimburses member states for weapons sent to Ukraine.But another EU funding instrument is currently being mulled  in a proposal put forward by the EU's foreign policy branch  the European External Action Service (EEAS).It would seek to more rapidly deliver both lethal and non-lethal equipment to Ukraine.The overall funding shortfall warnings were echoed by Tsahkna  who also said that frozen Russian assets need to help pay for Ukraine.Almost €200bn alone is tied up in Belgium's Euroclear  a firm that deals with cross-border securities transactions and risk management.The European Commission had in December come forward with a proposal to use the Russian assets to help rebuild Ukraine.Talks are ongoing on how to use the extraordinary profits generated from the assets  and not the assets themselves  given the sensitivity of openly seizing assets of other countries.For its part  Estonia is pressing for assets to be on the table. And its parliament has already passed a first reading of a draft law to use Russian frozen assets  inspired by a similar law in Canada.

At an interim analysis for the other primary endpoint of overall survival (OS)  the data demonstrated a trend toward improvement for the combination  however  these data were immature  and the trial will continue to the next planned analysis  anticipated in 2024. Safety for the combination appeared to be consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines  and no new safety signals were identified.Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men1 and for those living with advanced metastatic castration-resistant disease  the prognosis is poor  with an estimated survival of 1-2 years2.“At the advanced metastatic castration-resistant stage of disease  the prognosis is poor  with a median survival of two years and limited available treatment options ” said Stéphane Oudard  Professor of Oncology and Chief of the Oncology Clinical and Translational Research Unit at Georges Pompidou Hospital in Paris  France. “These results from the CONTACT-02 trial represent a positive step in the context of the current treatment landscape  contributing the first positive Phase III data of its kind for the benefit of patients  as we await further data from the overall survival analysis.”Also  four-year extended follow-up data from the landmark Phase III CheckMate -9ER trial investigating the combination of Cabometyx and nivolumab versus sunitinib in people living with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) will be presented (Abstract #362).With a median follow-up of 55.6 months for OS  the combination of Cabometyx and nivolumab demonstrated a sustained and clinically meaningful OS benefit versus sunitinib  with an absolute median OS gain of 10.5 months (46.5 months for the combination vs 36.0 months for sunitinib  HR 0.77  95% CI: 0.63-0.95). Additionally  median PFS remained almost double that for the combination versus sunitinib  at 16.4 vs 8.4 months respectively (HR 0.58  95% CI: 0.49-0.70). The safety profile was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines  and no new safety signals were identified.Renal cell carcinoma is the most common form of kidney cancer3  4 and for the 30% of people diagnosed with an advanced form of the disease  the 5-year survival rate is low at 12%  with no identified cure for this disease.5 6“Data from our ongoing trials continue to reinforce the value of Cabometyx for patients across a number of challenging tumor types ” said Christelle Huguet  EVP and Head of Research and Development  Ipsen. “In combination with immunotherapy  Cabometyx is delivering long-term survival benefits today for people living with renal cell carcinoma worldwide  while also showcasing future potential in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer  an area of significant unmet need where no other trials of this modality have proven successful in recent decades.”Additionally  health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data from a modelling analysis based on the CheckMate 9ER trial explored the link between HRQoL and clinical outcomes at a median follow-up of 32.9 months (Abstract #384). These data provide further patient-focused context to the benefits of the combination of Cabometyx and nivolumab  whilst also reinforcing the association of the combination with an increased chance of tumor shrinkage  survival and progression-free survival  independent of early HRQoL deterioration.ENDSAbout CabometyxCabozantinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)  including VEGFRs  MET  RET and the TAM family (TYRO3  MER  AXL).7 These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as oncogenesis  metastasis  tumor angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow)  drug resistance  modulation of immune activities and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment.7 8 9 10Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx outside of the U.S. and Japan. Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Cabometyx in the U.S.In over 60 countries outside of the United States and Japan  including in the European Union (E.U.)  Cabometyx is currently indicated as:8Monotherapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). as first-line treatment of adults with intermediate- or poor-risk disease. in adults following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy. in combination with nivolumab for the first-line treatment of aRCC in adults.Monotherapy for the treatment of adults living with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC)  refractory or not eligible to radioactive iodine (RAI) who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapy.Monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib.The detailed recommendations for the use of Cabometyx are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics (EU SmPC).About mCRPCProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men and the fourth most common cancer overall globally.1 In 2020  there were more than 1.4 million new cases of prostate cancer and about 375 300 deaths worldwide.1 Prostate cancer is considered mCRPC when it has spread beyond the prostate and does not respond to androgen-suppression therapies  a common treatment for prostate cancer.11 Men diagnosed with mCRPC often have a poor prognosis  with an estimated survival of 1-2 years.2About aRCCThere were over 400 000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed worldwide in 2020.12 Of these  RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer  accounting for approximately 90% of cases.3 4 It is almost twice as common in men  and male patients account for over two thirds of deaths.12 At diagnosis  up to 30% of patients present with advanced or metastatic RCC. If detected in the early stages  the five-year survival rate is high  but for people living with advanced or late-stage metastatic RCC  the survival rate is much lower  around 12%  with no identified cure for this disease.5 6About the CONTACT-02 trialCONTACT-02 is a global  multicenter  randomized  Phase III  open-label study that enrolled 575 patients who were randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of Cabometyx in combination with atezolizumab and the control arm of a second NHT (either abiraterone and prednisone or enzalutamide). The study included patients with mCRPC who have measurable visceral disease or measurable extra-pelvic adenopathy and who have progressed on one prior NHT. The two primary endpoints of the trial are PFS and OS. The PFS analysis was conducted in the first 400 randomized patients (PFS in the intent-to-treat [ITT] population) and assessed by a blinded independent radiology committee (BIRC) per RECIST 1.1. The OS analysis was conducted in the ITT population (n=507). The secondary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) per BIRC. The trial is sponsored by Exelixis and co-funded by Ipsen  Roche and Takeda. Takeda is conducting the trial in Japan. More information about CONTACT-02 is available at ClinicalTrials.gov.About the CheckMate -9ER trialCheckMate -9ER is an open-label  randomized  multi-national Phase III trial evaluating people living with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC. A total of 651 patients (23% favorable risk  58% intermediate risk  20% poor risk; 25% PD-L1 ≥1%) were randomized to Cabometyx plus nivolumab (n= 323) versus sunitinib (n= 328). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints include OS and ORR. The primary efficacy analysis compared the doublet combination versus sunitinib in all randomized patients. The trial is sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical Co and co-funded by Exelixis  Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s latest Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com.References1 Prostate cancer statistics.

European green and renewable hydrogen producer and supplier Lhyfe and European renewable energy developer Source Galileo today announced their joint agreement to develop commercial-scale gree…,"Official LHYFE press releaseNantes (France) & London (United Kingdom)  22 January 2024 – 7.30am. European green and renewable hydrogen producer and supplier Lhyfe (EURONEXT: LHYFE) and European renewable energy developer Source Galileo today announced their joint agreement to develop commercial-scale green and renewable hydrogen production units in the UK and Ireland.The companies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the goal of deploying production facilities powered by renewable energy  providing a boost to the Net Zero goals of both countries.Under the agreement  Lhyfe and Source Galileo will combine their expertise to generate and supply the environmentally-friendly gas to a variety of customers across industry and transport  helping them decarbonise their operations.The partnership will see Lhyfe and Source Galileo collaborate to establish commercial-scale green hydrogen production sites in the UK  with plans already underway for multiple units.The energy firms are also exploring opportunities in Ireland  focusing on identifying consumers and assessing factors such as grid availability  power supply  land accessibility  and planning requirements.By working together  Lhyfe and Source Galileo believe that their economies of scale can accelerate the roll-out of green hydrogen  meeting the increasing demand from companies aiming to reduce their reliance on natural gas and other fossil fuels.Initially  the companies will focus on using electricity from onshore renewable sources. However  in the longer term  they could harness the enormous offshore wind potential in the UK and Ireland  which would help overcome electricity grid constraints.Lhyfe is one of the world's pioneers in producing green and renewable hydrogen through water electrolysis  with its units being powered by renewable electricity.The France-based multinational's first plant at Pays de La Loire has been operating since the 2nd half of 2021  with two more sites inaugurated in Occitanie and Brittany in December 2023.An additional five sites are currently under construction or extension throughout Europe.Since launching its UK operation in 2022 to support regional decarbonisation  Lhyfe has established offices in Newcastle and Sheffield.Lhyfe aims to achieve a green hydrogen production capacity of 200MW by the end of 2026 and an ambitious goal of 3GW by the end of 2030.Source Galileo was founded to accelerate the roll-out of large-scale renewable energy projects as part of the energy transition.It has a pipeline of approximately 10GW of offshore wind and hydrogen projects under development in the UK  Ireland and Norway.The company is also developing onshore battery storage and solar projects.Green hydrogen can support deep decarbonisation  particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy industry  including chemicals and steelmaking. It can also be used for heavy transport  including buses  trucks  construction or logistics vehicles  etc.Green hydrogen  produced from water and electrolysis  can also in the long term replace the more than 3000TWh of hydrogen currently produced from oil  gas and coal throughout the world.The UK Government has doubled its low-carbon hydrogen production target from 5GW to 10GW by 2030  with at least half of this coming from green hydrogen.Ireland published its National Hydrogen Strategy in July 2023  outlining plans to develop 2GW of hydrogen production from offshore wind farms in the country by 2030.Kevin Lynch  CEO of Source Galileo  said: “We believe the development of a hydrogen economy alongside electricity is critical to the energy transition. Both the UK and Ireland have hydrogen strategies. The UK has committed to deploying 50GW of offshore wind by 2030  and Ireland is expected to develop at least 20GW of offshore wind by 2040  with an initial target of 2GW of hydrogen production from offshore wind by 2030. Our partnership with Lhyfe provides an onshore and offshore platform and a major step forward from which to assist in delivering government hydrogen targets.”Stirling Habbitts  Director Hydrogen Business Development at Source Galileo  said: “With Lhyfe  we are geared towards decarbonising challenging sectors  particularly industrial processes  through the use of green hydrogen. Hydrogen's role as an energy carrier will be pivotal in overcoming emerging constraints in current electricity grids  ensuring a supplemental and additional supply of clean energy to industries beyond the electricity grid's current capabilities.”Taia Kronborg  Chief Business Officer at Lhyfe  said: “We are pleased to announce this agreement with Source Galileo  which represents an exciting opportunity to drive forward the clean energy transition with large-scale green hydrogen production. At Lhyfe  we are moving at pace to enable decarbonisation in our communities and unleash the extraordinary potential of renewable energy across the UK and Ireland. Green hydrogen is one of the key solutions to reaching net zero  and the good news is it's available to be deployed today  improving national energy security while turbo-charging local economies.”About Green HydrogenHydrogen is a gas that emits no carbon dioxide when it is used  but its carbon footprint varies depending on how it is made. Lhyfe's green and renewable hydrogen is produced from a process of electrolysis of water  in production units powered by renewable electricity.Water is fed into the electrolyser  which is split into hydrogen and oxygen meaning the only by-product is oxygen.The hydrogen is compressed and transported locally from the production unit  providing an alternative to fossil fuels.About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen. Its production sites and portfolio of projects intend to provide access to green and renewable hydrogen in industrial quantities  and enable the creation of a virtuous energy model capable of decarbonising entire sectors of industry and transport.In 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the first industrial-scale green hydrogen production plant in the world to be interconnected with a wind farm. In 2022  the company inaugurated the first offshore green hydrogen production pilot platform in the world. In 2023  it inaugurated its second and third sites  and currently has five sites under construction or expansion across Europe.Lhyfe is represented in 12 European countries and had 192 staff at the end of June 2023. The company is listed on the Euronext market in Paris (ISIN: FR0014009YQ1 – LHYFE).

The disappointing performance in 2023  mainly due to weak machinery sales  leads the group to take measures to improve its results quickly and …,"Official PRODWAYS GROUP press releaseProdways today Group announces the cessation of its activity of small printers for jewelry. The disappointing performance in 2023  mainly due to weak machinery sales  leads the group to take measures to improve its results quickly and structurally.This decision reflects the “growth and profitability” strategy implemented by the company since its creation. Prodways Group remains one of the best players in 3D printing on a global scale  both technologically and in terms of financial profitability. This decision should strengthen this position by allowing the group to focus on the segment of large industrial printers with high added value.A strategic choice to allocate resources to high-volume industrial applicationsFor several years  Prodways Group has been marketing small printers for the high-end jewellery sector under the Solidscape brand. The sales of these small printers (with a unit value of around €15k)  as well as the associated materials and services  generated a turnover of around €5 million in 2023 and a significant operating loss. The cessation of this activity will therefore have a positive structural impact on Prodways' profitability.Although the 3D market for jewelry is still growing  the weak performance of 2023 has led the group to reassess the efforts needed to turn around this small printer business in a sustainable way  especially in comparison with the prospects for industrial printers. As a result  Prodways Group has decided to discontinue the jewellery application in order to focus on the segment of large high value-added printers and associated materials  in particular the MovingLight range. The growth levers in this segment are easier to activate and have a higher profitability profile. Prodways Group also benefits from its good positioning in existing markets  such as the medical sector  and could generate opportunities through new industrial applications for sectors such as aeronautics.The shutdown of the jewellery activity is being implemented now and should be finalized by the end of summer 2024. The impact in the 2023 financial statements is estimated at this stage at around €15 million in depreciation (non-cash impact)[1]. In 2024  the costs related to this shutdown are expected to represent just over €1 million  mainly in the first half of the year.Next publication: full-year 2023 revenuesProdways Group will publish its 2023 revenues on 14 February and will provide details on the performance of the group's other activities and the outlook for 2024.The company is already indicating significant changes in the recognition of revenues from the Software business. From an accounting point of view  the recognition of revenues from this activity is changing due to the classification of Prodways Group as an ""agent"" under IFRS 15 standard as of July 2023  whereas the company was considered ""principal"" until that date[2]. As an agent  Prodways Group now recognizes the gross margin earned on these sales as turnover. This change therefore reduces the absolute value of the revenues recognized  by around €5 to €7 million in 2023  but has no impact on current EBITDA in absolute value. The precise figures are note available yet and will be communicated with the full-year revenue on 14 February.The other notable development in this activity is the shift in sales to the SaaS (Software as a Service) model  which has been becoming significant since the second half of 2023 and will be even more so in 2024. Unlike traditional “on-premises” sales  SaaS sales generate a recurring revenue stream that is smoothed over time  with a mechanical drop in revenues during the transition period. Supported by Dassault Systèmes  this change of model now gives Prodways the opportunity to gain market share and increase the number of customers in this business to offset this effect.Overall  these measures and changes are expected to improve Prodways' recurring revenue generation and growth opportunities. In particular  the refocusing of the Printers business will have a positive impact on profitability and cash generation starting from the second half of 2024.About Prodways GroupProdways Group is a specialist in industrial and professional 3D printing with a unique positioning as an integrated European player. The Group has developed across the entire 3D printing value chain (software  printers  materials  parts & services) with an industrial solution with high technological added value.

At an interim analysis for the other primary endpoint of overall survival (OS)  the data demonstrated a trend toward improvement for the combination  however  these data were immature  and the trial will continue to the next planned analysis  anticipated in 2024. Safety for the combination appeared to be consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines  and no new safety signals were identified.Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men1 and for those living with advanced metastatic castration-resistant disease  the prognosis is poor  with an estimated survival of 1-2 years2.“At the advanced metastatic castration-resistant stage of disease  the prognosis is poor  with a median survival of two years and limited available treatment options ” said Stéphane Oudard  Professor of Oncology and Chief of the Oncology Clinical and Translational Research Unit at Georges Pompidou Hospital in Paris  France. “These results from the CONTACT-02 trial represent a positive step in the context of the current treatment landscape  contributing the first positive Phase III data of its kind for the benefit of patients  as we await further data from the overall survival analysis.”Also  four-year extended follow-up data from the landmark Phase III CheckMate -9ER trial investigating the combination of Cabometyx and nivolumab versus sunitinib in people living with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) will be presented (Abstract #362).With a median follow-up of 55.6 months for OS  the combination of Cabometyx and nivolumab demonstrated a sustained and clinically meaningful OS benefit versus sunitinib  with an absolute median OS gain of 10.5 months (46.5 months for the combination vs 36.0 months for sunitinib  HR 0.77  95% CI: 0.63-0.95). Additionally  median PFS remained almost double that for the combination versus sunitinib  at 16.4 vs 8.4 months respectively (HR 0.58  95% CI: 0.49-0.70). The safety profile was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines  and no new safety signals were identified.Renal cell carcinoma is the most common form of kidney cancer3  4 and for the 30% of people diagnosed with an advanced form of the disease  the 5-year survival rate is low at 12%  with no identified cure for this disease.5 6“Data from our ongoing trials continue to reinforce the value of Cabometyx for patients across a number of challenging tumor types ” said Christelle Huguet  EVP and Head of Research and Development  Ipsen. “In combination with immunotherapy  Cabometyx is delivering long-term survival benefits today for people living with renal cell carcinoma worldwide  while also showcasing future potential in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer  an area of significant unmet need where no other trials of this modality have proven successful in recent decades.”Additionally  health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data from a modelling analysis based on the CheckMate 9ER trial explored the link between HRQoL and clinical outcomes at a median follow-up of 32.9 months (Abstract #384). These data provide further patient-focused context to the benefits of the combination of Cabometyx and nivolumab  whilst also reinforcing the association of the combination with an increased chance of tumor shrinkage  survival and progression-free survival  independent of early HRQoL deterioration.ENDSAbout CabometyxCabozantinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)  including VEGFRs  MET  RET and the TAM family (TYRO3  MER  AXL).7 These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as oncogenesis  metastasis  tumor angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow)  drug resistance  modulation of immune activities and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment.7 8 9 10Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx outside of the U.S. and Japan. Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Cabometyx in the U.S.In over 60 countries outside of the United States and Japan  including in the European Union (E.U.)  Cabometyx is currently indicated as:8Monotherapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). as first-line treatment of adults with intermediate- or poor-risk disease. in adults following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy. in combination with nivolumab for the first-line treatment of aRCC in adults.Monotherapy for the treatment of adults living with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC)  refractory or not eligible to radioactive iodine (RAI) who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapy.Monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib.The detailed recommendations for the use of Cabometyx are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics (EU SmPC).About mCRPCProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men and the fourth most common cancer overall globally.1 In 2020  there were more than 1.4 million new cases of prostate cancer and about 375 300 deaths worldwide.1 Prostate cancer is considered mCRPC when it has spread beyond the prostate and does not respond to androgen-suppression therapies  a common treatment for prostate cancer.11 Men diagnosed with mCRPC often have a poor prognosis  with an estimated survival of 1-2 years.2About aRCCThere were over 400 000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed worldwide in 2020.12 Of these  RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer  accounting for approximately 90% of cases.3 4 It is almost twice as common in men  and male patients account for over two thirds of deaths.12 At diagnosis  up to 30% of patients present with advanced or metastatic RCC. If detected in the early stages  the five-year survival rate is high  but for people living with advanced or late-stage metastatic RCC  the survival rate is much lower  around 12%  with no identified cure for this disease.5 6About the CONTACT-02 trialCONTACT-02 is a global  multicenter  randomized  Phase III  open-label study that enrolled 575 patients who were randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of Cabometyx in combination with atezolizumab and the control arm of a second NHT (either abiraterone and prednisone or enzalutamide). The study included patients with mCRPC who have measurable visceral disease or measurable extra-pelvic adenopathy and who have progressed on one prior NHT. The two primary endpoints of the trial are PFS and OS. The PFS analysis was conducted in the first 400 randomized patients (PFS in the intent-to-treat [ITT] population) and assessed by a blinded independent radiology committee (BIRC) per RECIST 1.1. The OS analysis was conducted in the ITT population (n=507). The secondary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) per BIRC. The trial is sponsored by Exelixis and co-funded by Ipsen  Roche and Takeda. Takeda is conducting the trial in Japan. More information about CONTACT-02 is available at ClinicalTrials.gov.About the CheckMate -9ER trialCheckMate -9ER is an open-label  randomized  multi-national Phase III trial evaluating people living with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC. A total of 651 patients (23% favorable risk  58% intermediate risk  20% poor risk; 25% PD-L1 ≥1%) were randomized to Cabometyx plus nivolumab (n= 323) versus sunitinib (n= 328). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints include OS and ORR. The primary efficacy analysis compared the doublet combination versus sunitinib in all randomized patients. The trial is sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical Co and co-funded by Exelixis  Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

Marc de Garidel  Chief Executive Officer of Abivax  says: “We are on track to deliver our strategic roadmap as laid out in September last year to prepare obefazimod for commercialization if approved  starting with ulcerative colitis in the US. Our US office has recently been opened and we have completed the recruitment of a very experienced team with a particular focus in the US. For 2024  our priority stays on the completion of patient recruitment into the ABTECT Phase 3 induction trials.” Didier Blondel  Chief Financial Officer of Abivax  adds: “With the successful Nasdaq IPO in October 2023  the largest ever Nasdaq IPO of a French-listed biotech company  we expect to be fully financed through the planned data read-outs of the UC and CD induction trials. In parallel  we continue to implement our multi-pronged financing strategy to fund our ambitious projects in 2024 and beyond  with the objective to increase shareholder value.”Clinical trial priorities and milestones Obefazimod Phase 3 program in UC (ABTECT) The obefazimod Phase 3 ABTECT program investigating efficacy and safety in adults with moderately to severely active UC is progressing. Recruitment into both induction trials  ABTECT-1 and ABTECT-2  is ongoing in all designated regions. The ABTECT program is designed for 1 200 UC patients across 36 countries in over 600 trial sites to take part in the pivotal Phase 3 program that covers North America  Europe  Latin America and Asia Pacific. Clinical remission is the primary endpoint for the eight-week induction trials as well as for the maintenance trial at week 52 (which is week 44 of the maintenance trial). Anticipated milestones: Q4 2024: ABTECT planned enrollment of last patient into induction trialsQ1 2025: ABTECT planned top-line induction data read-out after eight weeks of treatmentQ1 2026: ABTECT planned top-line maintenance results after one year of treatment Objectives: Obtain robust Phase 3 data for obefazimod in moderately to severely active UC as a potentially differentiated oral treatment optionEstablish obefazimod as a potential first-line advanced therapy for the treatment of UCObefazimod 25 mg long-term extension trial in UC UC patients initially treated with 50 mg of oral  once-daily obefazimod and who completed the Phase 2a or Phase 2b maintenance trials could roll over into a follow-on  open-label maintenance trial with a reduced dose of 25 mg. In an interim analysis as of July 31  2023  of the 71 eligible patients  63 completed their 48-week visit  with a demonstrated disease control rate (stable or improved Modified Mayo Score) of 84% (53 of 63 patients) with the 25 mg once-daily dose of obefazimod. No new safety signals were detected in UC patients treated up to five years with oral  once-daily obefazimod. Anticipated milestones: Q3 2024: New obefazimod UC extension trial read-out after one and two years of continued treatment with reduced dose of 25 mg Objectives: Confirm safety and efficacy data of Phase 2 maintenance trials and long-term extension trial interim analysisConfirm safety and efficacy results for reduced dose of 25 mg obefazimod for chronic long-term useConduct further clinical laboratory parameter analysis to validate obefazimod’s novel mechanism of action and its capacity to relieve UC symptomsObefazimod Phase 2 trial in Crohn’s disease (ENHANCE-CD) Based on existing supportive preclinical and clinical Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) data  Abivax is advancing obefazimod in a Phase 2 trial in moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD). Anticipated milestones: Q4 2023: IND for ENHANCE-CD trial was submitted and cleared. Abivax is currently evaluating FDA comments and will consider any recommended adjustments to trial designH2 2025: ENHANCE-CD planned top-line induction data read-out pending decision to modify the trial design after evaluation of FDA comments Objectives: Reproduce obefazimod UC Phase 2 safety and efficacy data for the treatment of CDR&D progress Obefazimod in combination therapy: Based on its early clinical profile  the formal process evaluating combination therapy of oral and injectable candidates with obefazimod in UC is ongoing and preclinical data to support decision-making on a combination agent is expected in 2H 2024.Based on its early clinical profile  the formal process evaluating combination therapy of oral and injectable candidates with obefazimod in UC is ongoing and preclinical data to support decision-making on a combination agent is expected in 2H 2024.
