35288,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/591170-eu-frozen-russian-assets/,EU won’t seize Russia’s assets – Reuters,Moscow’s retaliation could damage the euro and collapse Euroclear  so Brussels may target interest on frozen funds instead Read Full Article at RT.com,The bloc stands to lose far more than the US if Moscow retaliatesThe European Union is “unlikely” to confiscate the Russian Central Bank funds that are currently frozen due to Ukraine-related sanctions  Reuters reported on Tuesday. There is no agreement among the members for the risky move  senior bloc officials told the agency.The US and its allies froze an estimated $300 billion of Russian state assets in 2022  citing the Ukraine conflict. Kiev has repeatedly called for the West to seize the funds and hand them over to Ukraine  even more so in recent months as financial and military aid from Washington and Brussels has dried up.”Confiscation of the capital of the Russian assets is not going to happen. There is no agreement on this among EU member states ” said one senior EU official  described as having insight into the talks on the matter.Such a confiscation of sovereign assets would be unprecedented. It could also scare off investors from around the world  concerned that their money would not be safe in the EU.”We need to be very prudent with that proposition ” Belgian Finance Minister Vincent van Peteghem told reporters on Tuesday. “I think that it’s important that what can come on the table should be legally sound and we should avoid any impact on financial stability.”Luxembourgish Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel told Reuters he was “very cautious” about seizing Russian assets. “Imagine if we decide politically to give billions to Ukraine. And in six months we have a judicial decision saying we are not allowed to give it to them. Who will [we] pay then?” Bettel said.Another concern for the bloc is that most of the currently frozen Russian assets – about $200 billion – are with the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear.”The EU cannot bail out Euroclear ” one senior official said. “Euroclear manages trillions and its bankruptcy would be far more than the budget of the EU. We have to balance risk and profit.”Russia has repeatedly warned the US and its allies that a seizure of its sovereign assets would amount to “theft” that would violate international law  undermine Western reserve currencies and disrupt the global financial system. Moscow also has access to $288 billion in Western assets it has threatened to confiscate in reprisal – much of it belonging to Euroclear.The frozen Russian assets are still generating interest  and the European Commission proposed last month to seize those funds and direct them to Ukraine  leaving the principal intact. According to officials who spoke to Reuters  this could amount to as much as €17 billion ($18.5 billion) over the next four years. The plan to send Kiev a total of €50 billion ($54.25 billion) in EU funding through 2027 has been held up by Hungary.,neutral,0.06,0.71,0.22,negative,0.03,0.31,0.66,True,English,"['EU', 'Russia', 'assets', 'Belgian Finance Minister Vincent van Peteghem', 'Luxembourgish Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel', 'Russian Central Bank funds', 'one senior EU official', 'one senior official', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'next four years', 'Western reserve currencies', 'The European Union', 'EU member states', 'global financial system', 'Russian state assets', 'senior bloc officials', 'Russian assets', 'Western assets', 'European Commission', 'sovereign assets', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'risky move', 'recent months', 'military aid', 'financial stability', 'six months', 'judicial decision', 'international law', 'EU funding', 'The US', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Moscow', 'Reuters', 'Tuesday', 'agreement', 'members', 'agency', 'allies', 'Kiev', 'Washington', 'Brussels', 'Confiscation', 'capital', 'insight', 'talks', 'matter', 'investors', 'world', 'money', 'proposition', 'reporters', 'table', 'impact', 'billions', 'concern', 'Euroclear', 'trillions', 'bankruptcy', 'budget', 'profit', 'seizure', 'access', 'reprisal', 'interest', 'principal', 'plan', 'total', 'Hungary']",2024-01-23,2024-01-24,rt.com

35290,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://news.yahoo.com/eu-moves-ahead-plan-tax-095630909.html,EU Moves Ahead on Plan to Tax Gains of Frozen Russian Assets,(Bloomberg) -- The European Union is progressing with plans to apply a windfall tax to the profits generated by frozen Russian central bank assets  while...,(Bloomberg) -- The European Union is progressing with plans to apply a windfall tax to the profits generated by frozen Russian central bank assets  while opting not to seize the immobilized money outright.Most Read from BloombergEU foreign ministers gave their political blessing to the windfall tax on Monday and it will be discussed by the bloc’s ambassadors later this week  according to people familiar with the plans.Ukraine’s allies broadly agree that Russia needs to pay for the damage its war has caused. The EU  Group of Seven nations and Australia have frozen about €260 billion ($283 billion) in Russian central bank assets in the form of securities and cash  with more than two thirds of that immobilized in the EU. The majority of the EU-based assets are held by the clearing house Euroclear  where they earned about €3 billion last year.The EU’s foreign policy chief  Josep Borrell  told reporters on Monday that progress was made on the windfall tax during a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers  and that discussions will continue.”I am convinced that we can move forward with this file ” Belgian Finance Minister Vincent Van Peteghem  whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU  told Bloomberg TV in an interview.A group of countries including Germany have made clear they are against seizing the Russian assets outright due to legal concerns  said the people  who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.Asked to clarify the German position  a foreign ministry spokesman said Tuesday that the priority of the government in Berlin is to ensure legal certainty so that the stability of financial markets is guaranteed.Speaking later in Berlin  Finance Minister Christian Lindner said that while the motive behind exploiting the assets in some way “corresponds to a sense of justice ” it’s also important to respect “the rules-based international order  international law and financial stability.”“Every step in this direction  especially as far as central bank assets are concerned  must be examined very carefully in terms of the law and its consequences ” Lindner said at a business forum. “It’s not about weakening us and the rules-based international order  the aim is to support Ukraine and weaken Putin.”Belgium’s Van Peteghem sees the option of seizing assets in a critical light as well. “I am a little bit more reluctant  because I think we need a global level playing field and we also need to be sure that is legally sound and it cannot impact the financial stability of systemic institutions such as Euroclear ” he said.The EU’s foreign affairs service proposed a multi-step process last year that would initially identify the relevant assets and set out actions that the central securities depositories holding those funds would need to take before next steps are put forward.Read More: Russian Anti-War Candidate Gathers Signatures to Challenge PutinThose steps would outline how a windfall tax is applied to the profits generated by the frozen assets and the proceeds transferred to the EU’s budget to use for Ukraine. Expenses and national taxes would be deducted before the proceeds are transferred  Bloomberg previously reported.The US has recently signaled that it could be open to seizing the assets outright. But even the lesser step of taxing profits has progressed slowly in the EU as several member states and the European Central Bank are worried about the potential impact the move could have on the euro’s stability.Separately  the debate over aid for Ukraine has hit a critical juncture  with questions arising over the war-torn country’s immediate needs. About $100 billion in aid remains stalled by political processes in Washington and Brussels.--With assistance from Lyubov Pronina  Maria Tadeo  Jorge Valero  Kamil Kowalcze and John Follain.(Updates with German comment starting in seventh paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.06,0.76,0.18,negative,0.03,0.25,0.72,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'Tax Gains', 'EU', 'Plan', 'Belgian Finance Minister Vincent Van Peteghem', 'Finance Minister Christian Lindner', 'global level playing field', 'Russian Anti-War Candidate Gathers', 'Russian central bank assets', 'European Central Bank', 'several member states', 'foreign policy chief', 'foreign ministry spokesman', 'foreign affairs service', 'based international order', 'central securities depositories', 'The European Union', '2024 Bloomberg L.P.', 'EU foreign ministers', 'Russian assets', 'EU-based assets', 'relevant assets', 'frozen assets', 'The US', 'international law', 'windfall tax', 'political blessing', 'Seven nations', 'two thirds', 'clearing house', 'Josep Borrell', 'rotating presidency', 'legal concerns', 'confidential information', 'German position', 'legal certainty', 'financial markets', 'business forum', 'critical light', 'systemic institutions', 'multi-step process', 'national taxes', 'lesser step', 'potential impact', 'critical juncture', 'immediate needs', 'political processes', 'Lyubov Pronina', 'Maria Tadeo', 'Jorge Valero', 'Kamil Kowalcze', 'John Follain', 'German comment', 'seventh paragraph', 'Bloomberg TV', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'financial stability', 'next steps', 'war-torn country', 'taxing profits', 'plans', 'money', 'Monday', 'bloc', 'ambassadors', 'people', 'Ukraine', 'allies', 'damage', 'Group', 'Australia', 'cash', 'majority', 'Euroclear', 'reporters', 'progress', 'meeting', 'discussions', 'file', 'interview', 'countries', 'Germany', 'priority', 'government', 'Berlin', 'motive', 'way', 'sense', 'justice', 'rules', 'direction', 'terms', 'consequences', 'aim', 'Putin', 'Belgium', 'option', 'actions', 'funds', 'Signatures', 'proceeds', 'budget', 'Expenses', 'move', 'debate', 'aid', 'questions', 'Washington', 'Brussels', 'assistance', 'Updates']",2024-01-23,2024-01-24,news.yahoo.com

A four-year package worth €50 billion and financed from the EU budget was vetoed by Hungary last month. The country’s prime minister  Viktor Orban  spoke against committing money for years in advance and warned that supporting Kiev must not “harm” the bloc’s finances.The EU and the G7 froze about $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian central bank in 2022. Most of the assets in the EU are held by the Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear  where they generated about €3 billion in income last year.A number of countries have spoken out against seizing the assets outright over legal concerns. The idea of taxing the profits instead was first circulated last year.

Cardin said he expected the Democratic-majority Senate and Republican-majority House would be able to resolve the differences between the two bills.The EU  United States  Japan and Canada froze some $300 billion of Russian central bank assets in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. Only about $5 billion to $6 billion are in the United States  with most held in Europe  and most of those in Belgium’s Euroclear central securities depositary.‘A BIG HAMMER’The bill’s backers acknowledged the groundbreaking nature of the legislation  but noted the seriousness of what Russia has done.“This is intended to be a big hammer. It’s intended to be a very new way of attacking a country that does not behave itself ” Republican Senator Jim Risch said before the vote.U.S. and British officials have been working to jumpstart efforts to seize confiscated Russian assets and hope that Group of Seven leaders will issue a strong statement when they meet in late February  around the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.G7 leaders have long argued that Russia is obligated under international law to end its war and pay for the damage it has caused  which already exceeds $400 billion dollars  according to the World Bank.Senior European Union officials said on Tuesday that the bloc was unlikely to confiscate Russian central bank assets frozen in Europe  despite G7 plans to discuss the legality of such a move at a meeting in February.European officials are concerned not only with the legality of such an unprecedented confiscation  but also with the potential consequences for the euro currency. Investors might pull out of euro assets out of concern their money might one day be seized too.Moscow has condemned the effort  pledging to retaliate by confiscating Western assets in Russia  which some reports put at $288 billion.The REPO Act says any seized Russian funds would be used to rebuild Ukraine. It is separate from Biden’s request for $61 billion in security assistance for Ukraine.That request has been stalled in Congress for months  as Republicans insist the aid must be coupled with unrelated changes to how the country handles immigration via the border with Mexico.(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Don Durfee and Bill Berkrot)Disclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.

He said the legal case is too uncertain to use frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine.Others are concerned that confiscating frozen assets may set a precedent that has knock-on effects on the euro  with investors pulling out assets in fear that their money might be also be seized  Reuters said.Financial institutions may also be impacted.

But now awash with cash  Euroclear’s position is that this wartime profit — around a hefty €4 billion in 2023 — is its own private property.Euroclear’s narrow commercial interest in keeping this blood money cannot stand. But in any event  this is a sideshow. Europe needs to seize not just the profits from but all of Russia’s underlying assets — and it must do so now.Morally  everyone agrees that Russia must pay for the death and destruction it has visited on Ukraine. The United Nations General Assembly has held unambiguously that Russia “must bear the legal consequences” for its war of aggression  including reparations.There has also been a lot of legal analysis arriving at the same conclusion we reached in the European Parliament a couple of months ago: Russia must pay now.In October  the Parliament accepted an amendment of mine to the Ukraine Facility  unequivocally stating that confiscating Russia’s public assets is justified “under customary international law  either as a collective countermeasure in response to Russia’s violation of the fundamental rule prohibiting wars of aggression or as an act of collective self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter.”Likewise  the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States House of Representatives approved a proposed bill authorizing the confiscation of Russian state assets. And Canadian law already permits the seizure of public assets.As a practitioner of international law  let me unpack the basic logic underpinning these conclusions — at least in Europe.First  in the absence of a world government  legislature and court  states often need to resort to individual and collective self-help to secure their rights. Ukraine  for instance  cannot rely on the U.N. to protect it and is defending its territory with its own brave citizens on the battlefield  as well as extensive help from its Western partners. Thus  even though the predominant damage has occurred in Ukraine  the European Union has incurred extensive costs as well.Second  as a matter of international custom  states can suspend duties owed to another country — such as the immunity of sovereign assets — in order to compel compliance with their obligations. That’s how the international legal system works in practice — otherwise  aggressors would be shielded by interpretations of international law  which would only add insult to injury for the victims.Men wearing military uniforms bearing a Z letter  an insignia of Russian troops in Ukraine  walk along the Red square in Moscow  on January 19  2024 | Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty ImagesThe same logic applies to collective self-defense. Thus  Europe can freeze Russia’s private and public assets  impose 12 rounds of sanctions and establish travel bans. Thus  it can train tens of thousands of Ukrainians for the front lines and provide billions of euros in weapons supplies. Indeed  the Parliament invoked collective self-defense only a few days after Russia’s full-scale invasion  calling on EU member countries to provide Ukraine with the military support it needs to prevail.From a political perspective  the time to seize these assets is also now — not in some distant future as part of peace negotiations. The brutal reality of modern conflict is that it can drag on for years  without a total victory by either side or the ability to dictate terms. And if we wait  we’re unlikely to ever seize these assets  which is why we should do so immediately  as part of EU’s overall strategy to squeeze Russia’s economy and military machine.Meanwhile  economically speaking  the critique sometimes offered against confiscating state assets is that doing so would disrupt financial markets and lead to the withdrawal of assets by countries like China. But where would these assets go? The vast majority of central bank reserves are in Western capitals  as it makes economic sense for these countries in terms of managing their international transactions. And would China really withdraw its assets? Wouldn’t that signal that it might be considering its own war of aggression?In essence  if the EU and the G7 were to move together on this issue  they could forestall any real economic disruptions.Finally  let us also consider the consequences of the failure to seize these assets. We’ve been primarily talking about the reconstruction of Ukraine but  given the increasing difficulty of securing Western financial support in the context of a prolonged conflict  Ukraine may simply run out of money to sustain its defensive effort. Plus  the postwar picture will look equally grim — a destroyed economy and infrastructure  hundreds of thousands of veterans struggling to find jobs and reintegrate into society amid a general sense of abandonment. Europe needs to anticipate the potential political consequences for all.If it is to provide Ukraine the resources it needs  Europe must confiscate Russia’s state assets now. And for all the talk of strategic autonomy in recent years  it would be ironic if even on an issue like this — where the assets are located in Europe and the EU could very well seize them — nothing happened until the U.S. made a move.Europe must grab this opportunity and show leadership by finally flexing its geo-economic muscle.,negative,0.12,0.41,0.47,negative,0.04,0.23,0.73,True,English,"['state assets', 'Europe', 'Russia', 'The United Nations General Assembly', 'A Ukrainian rescuer', 'Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz', 'narrow commercial interest', 'central bank reserves', 'United States House', 'former prime minister', 'Foreign Affairs Committee', 'Getty Images Press', 'moral, legal, political', 'international legal system', 'customary international law', 'underlying state assets', 'Russian state assets', 'EU member countries', 'foreign minister', 'legal consequences', 'legal analysis', 'Russian troops', 'political capital', 'international custom', 'political perspective', 'international transactions', 'Canadian law', 'underlying assets', 'residential building', 'missile attack', 'Sergey Bobok/AFP', 'artificial intelligence', 'economic arguments', 'separate issue', 'financial pipeline', 'one depository', 'full-scale invasion', 'wartime profit', 'blood money', 'same conclusion', 'collective countermeasure', 'fundamental rule', 'collective self-defense', 'UN Charter', 'basic logic', 'world government', 'collective self-help', 'U.N.', 'brave citizens', 'extensive help', 'Western partners', 'predominant damage', 'European Union', 'extensive costs', 'military uniforms', 'Z letter', 'Red square', 'Alexander Nemenov/AFP', 'same logic', 'travel bans', 'front lines', 'weapons supplies', 'military support', 'distant future', 'peace negotiations', 'brutal reality', 'modern conflict', 'total victory', 'overall strategy', 'military machine', 'financial markets', 'vast majority', 'Western capitals', 'economic sense', 'public assets', 'sovereign assets', 'European Parliament', 'private property', 'Ukraine Facility', 'result', 'Kharkiv', 'January', 'article', 'Poland', 'case', 'recovery', 'reconstruction', 'profits', 'Euroclear', 'Brussels', 'intermediary', 'funds', 'outbreak', 'cash', 'position', 'event', 'sideshow', 'everyone', 'death', 'destruction', 'aggression', 'reparations', 'lot', 'months', 'October', 'amendment', 'mine', 'response', 'violation', 'wars', 'Representatives', 'bill', 'confiscation', 'seizure', 'practitioner', 'conclusions', 'absence', 'legislature', 'court', 'individual', 'rights', 'instance', 'territory', 'battlefield', 'matter', 'duties', 'country', 'immunity', 'order', 'compliance', 'obligations', 'practice', 'aggressors', 'interpretations', 'insult', 'injury', 'victims', 'insignia', 'Moscow', '12 rounds', 'sanctions', 'thousands', 'Ukrainians', 'euros', 'years', 'ability', 'terms', 'economy', 'critique', 'withdrawal', 'China']",2024-01-24,2024-01-24,politico.eu

The deal is part of a roughly 18.5% stake sale to foreign and local investors for 353 million shekels ($95 million)  meaning the couple would have paid $25 million  according to calculations by Bloomberg.“Owning an exchange in a country with tremendous long-term growth potential is one of the best investments you can make ” Ackman said in a statement. “Investing in the TASE of ‘Startup Nation’ is precisely that. It represents our support for Israel  and our confidence in its economy and long-term future.”The transaction is the latest high-profile move from the hedge fund billionaire  who has become an increasingly vocal voice in America’s culture wars in recent months  speaking out against the media  and antisemitism on university campuses  as well the way diversity programs are run. That’s touched a nerve among the political left  but won him plenty of praise from conservative activists  members of the Jewish community and even Elon Musk.For Israel  the deal is another sign of foreign investors returning to the country after having pulled money at the onset of the war. The share sale “received a lot of interest from international and local investors  including from large investors who have not yet invested in Israel ” said Ittai Ben Zeev  chief executive officer of the stock exchange.Story continuesAckman and Oxman were the only investors named in a statement detailing the sale  which was priced at a 2% discount to the stock’s last close.Shares in the bourse jumped as much as 9.4%  putting it on track to erase all war-linked losses.

Ackman swore off big  messy short selling campaigns in 2022  telling investors he’d take a “quieter approach.”Though Ackman remains the fund’s final decision-maker  he deputized a chief investment officer. The structure of his fund  unusual in the hedge fund world  means he doesn’t have to answer to big-money investors as a typical manager would.At the same time he’s pushing ahead on hot-button topics  opining on the platform X with the same pugnacity that defined his Wall Street career.His Israel investment comes on the heels of a campaign directed at Harvard’s leadership for failing to root out antisemitism on campus.

Head below for the details.  more…,Philips Hue is once again expanding its lineup of smart lighting options. The company has announced the new Philips Hue Dymera wall light  the new Philips Hue pendant cord  and more. Head below for the details.The headlining announcement from Philips Hue is the new Philips Hue Dymera wall light  seen above. Here’s how the company describes this product:With its sophisticated black design  Dymera is suitable for both indoors and outdoors  where it can illuminate large surfaces with warm-to-cool white and color light. Using the Philips Hue app  each light can be dimmed or brightened while changing the colors individually. You can also set a scene from the scene gallery for a more cohesive look.You may remember that Philips Hue entered the smart camera market last August. The company is finally launching one of the products announced as part of that announcement last year. The Philips Hue Secure floodlight camera is now available in the European Union and will be launching in the United States on February 27 for $349.99.Keep in mind  the Philips Hue smart cameras don’t support HomeKit or HomeKit Secure Video  as we detailed last year.Specifically developed for outdoor use  the previously announced Philips Hue Secure floodlight camera is now available  bringing the best of the Philips Hue system together. It lets you keep an eye on the backyard  patio  or driveway  and — when you trigger a light alarm from the Philips Hue app — the floodlight immediately illuminates a large area in any color  such as bright white or even red. The Philips Hue Bridge is required for the Secure floodlight camera.Next up we have the Philips Hue Secure starter kit  which the company says is “specifically designed to bring a full suite of smart home security security capabilities to new users.”It offers a Philips Hue Secure wired camera — which includes a power supply unit and wall mount to install the camera wherever you want — as well as two Philips Hue Secure contact sensors to send real-time notifications when the contact sensor is opened or closed. Furthermore  the starter kit includes two Philips Hue bulbs that offer warm-to-cool white and colored light and a Philips Hue Bridge  granting access to all the features that the Philips Hue Secure system has to offer. With features such as live view  night vision  and two-way talk  Philips Hue Secure can send you notifications of potential security threats or scare off intruders with unique light and sound alarms.Philips Hue has also introduced more flexible options for the Philips Hue pendant cord  new colors for the Philips Hue Go portable table lamp  and more. Check out the full press release below.Full press releaseNew Philips Hue launches offer more flexibility to design your own lighting experienceCreate a sophisticated look with the Philips Hue Dymera wall light that offers individually controllable up and down light in white and color  both indoors and outdoorsBring a subtle look to any room with the Philips Hue pendant cord  made from 55% biocircular material 1   for the popular Filament bulbs  for the popular Filament bulbs Get more flexibility to create your personal light experience with new connectors for Philips Hue Perifo track lightingEnhance your home security with the Philips Hue Secure starter kit  Philips Hue Secure floodlight camera  and additional app featuresEindhoven  the Netherlands – Signify (Euronext: LIGHT)  the world leader in lighting  announced the availability of new Philips Hue lights and accessories to design personalized lighting experiences. The new Philips Hue Dymera wall light offers individually controllable up and down light to create an architectural look both indoors and outdoors. Design is also kept at the forefront with the new 3D printed Philips Hue pendant cord  made from 55% bio-circular material1 and tailored for the Filament bulbs. New connectors for Philips Hue Perifo track lighting allow for more versatility when designing the track system for your home. In North America  new additions for the Philips Hue Being ceiling light are being introduced  and the same holds for the Go portable table lamp in the US. Lastly  smart lighting is uniquely integrated with smart home security with the Philips Hue Secure starter kit and Secure floodlight camera  as well as additional app features.Dual beam control for a sophisticated sceneryThe Philips Hue Dymera wall light combines functionality and style  offering individual control over two beams of light that shine up and down. With its sophisticated black design  Dymera is suitable for both indoors and outdoors  where it can illuminate large surfaces with warm-to-cool white and color light. Using the Philips Hue app  each light can be dimmed or brightened while changing the colors individually. You can also set a scene from the scene gallery for a more cohesive look.Dual beam control for a sophisticated sceneryThe new Philips Hue pendant cord is made specially to complement the popular Philips Hue Filament bulbs. The pendant cord can be easily mounted above a coffee or dining table and used with a Filament bulb to create an eye-catcher in your home. The pendant cord is available in black or white and in two sizes  so it easily blends in with any home decor. The 3D printed parts are made from 55% bio-circular material that consist of waste and residues of biological origin1.For ceilings as well as walls  new Philips Hue Perifo track lighting connectors also offer more flexibility so you can truly be your own home lighting designer. With the Philips Hue Perifo T connector  rails can run three different directions  letting you illuminate the entire room with smart track lighting. The Philips Hue Perifo flexible connector gives complete flexibility over the shape of the track  as the connector allows the rails to run in any direction and beyond 90-degree angles. This offers more possibilities to create any track lighting shape  and even run track lighting from your wall to your ceiling. Both connectors are available in black and white.The Philips Hue Being ceiling light is now also available in black and white in addition to the existing aluminum version. With a halo of soft light around the lamp and the ability to use 50 000 shades of warm-to-cool white light  the lamp is suitable for bedrooms  hallways  and entryways.Bring light wherever you need itIn addition to its previously introduced standard colors  the Philips Hue Go portable table lamp has new versions with exclusive color combinations: black with an orange grip and white with a teal grip. The silicone grip makes it easy to take the lamp with you wherever you go  whether it’s for reading a book indoors or lighting up a party in the garden. The Go portable table lamp can be charged wirelessly within three to four hours  with a battery life of up to 48 hours. Recharging the battery is easy with the included charging stand.Enhancing the Philips Hue Secure systemThe Philips Hue Secure camera starter kit and the Philips Hue Secure floodlight camera are now available. Suitable for both indoors and outdoors  the Philips Hue Secure starter kit is specifically designed to bring a full suite of smart home security capabilities to new users. It offers a Philips Hue Secure wired camera — which includes a power supply unit and wall mount to install the camera wherever you want — as well as two Philips Hue Secure contact sensors to send real-time notifications when the contact sensor is opened or closed. Furthermore  the starter kit includes two Philips Hue bulbs that offer warm-to-cool white and colored light and a Philips Hue Bridge  granting access to all the features that the Philips Hue Secure system has to offer.

The Philips Hue Bridge is required for the Secure floodlight camera.Upcoming features for Philips Hue SecureFinally  Philips Hue is continuously bringing new features to the Security Center of the Philips Hue app. New updates are expected in the first half of 2024 and include improvements to security push notifications and the event timeline  as well as automatic light and sound alarms when motion is detected. Additionally  Philips Hue is working to develop support for Amazon Alexa and Google Home for the Philips Hue Secure system.AvailabilityPhilips Hue Dymera wall light (available February 27  2024 in EU and NAM) EU: EUR 219.99 NAM: USD 219.99Philips Hue pendant cord in black or white for Filament bulbs (available February 2024 in EU – excluding UK) EU: EUR 59.99 (size M) / EUR 69.99 (size L)Philips Hue Perifo flexible connector (available February 6  2024 in EU and April 16  2024 in NAM) and T connector (available Q1  2024 in EU and April  2024 in NAM) EU: EUR 34.99 NAM: USD 34.99Philips Hue Being ceiling light in black or white (available March 26  2024 in NAM) NAM: USD 219.99Philips Hue Go portable table lamp with teal or orange grip (available December 5  2023 in US) US: USD 159.99Philips Hue Secure starter kit (available January 23  2024 in EU and NAM) EU: EUR 399.99 NAM: USD 399.99Philips Hue Secure floodlight camera (available January 23  2024 in EU and February 27  2024 in NAM) EU: EUR 349.99 NAM: USD 349.99,neutral,0.1,0.89,0.01,mixed,0.27,0.46,0.27,True,English,"['floodlight camera release date', 'Philips Hue', 'Philips Hue Go portable table lamp', 'two Philips Hue Secure contact sensors', 'The Philips Hue Dymera wall light', 'The Philips Hue Secure floodlight camera', 'new Philips Hue Dymera wall light', 'Philips Hue Secure wired camera', 'Philips Hue Secure starter kit', 'Philips Hue Perifo track lighting', 'new Philips Hue pendant cord', 'popular Philips Hue Filament bulbs', 'smart home security security capabilities', 'The Philips Hue Bridge', 'New Philips Hue launches', 'new Philips Hue lights', 'Philips Hue Secure system', 'two Philips Hue bulbs', 'Philips Hue smart cameras', 'Philips Hue app', 'Philips Hue system', 'Philips Hue Being', 'popular Filament bulbs', 'smart camera market', 'new 3D printed', 'potential security threats', 'HomeKit Secure Video', 'power supply unit', 'personalized lighting experiences', 'smart lighting options', 'full press release', 'Dual beam control', 'personal light experience', 'additional app features', 'sophisticated black design', 'wall mount', 'track system', 'two beams', 'new users', 'new connectors', 'new additions', 'new colors', 'light alarm', 'colored light', 'unique light', 'ceiling light', 'full suite', 'individual control', 'flexible options', 'sophisticated look', 'sophisticated scenery', 'color light', 'large surfaces', 'cohesive look', 'European Union', 'United States', 'outdoor use', 'large area', 'live view', 'night vision', 'two-way talk', 'sound alarms', 'subtle look', '55% biocircular material', 'world leader', 'architectural look', '55% bio-circular material1', 'North America', 'same holds', 'cool white', 'headlining announcement', 'real-time notifications', 'lineup', 'company', 'details', 'product', 'indoors', 'outdoors', 'gallery', 'part', 'February', 'mind', 'eye', 'backyard', 'patio', 'driveway', 'access', 'intruders', 'flexibility', 'controllable', 'room', 'Eindhoven', 'Netherlands', 'Signify', 'Euronext', 'availability', 'forefront', 'versatility', 'functionality', 'style', 'coffee', 'dining']",2024-01-23,2024-01-24,9to5mac.com

As a result  Nasdaq and Euronext have created indices ta…,While artificial intelligence is the talk of the café du commerce  it didn't take long for stock market operators to seize the financial windfall promised by these new technologies. As a result  Nasdaq and Euronext have created indices tailor-made to take advantage of the AI rally.Euronext AI World (EAIWP)Comprising over 100 stocks  this index is a broad brush. Unsurprisingly  it includes the American stalwarts  whether leaders or auxiliaries in the sector (Meta  Nvidia  Broadcom  Qualcomm  Apple  Alphabet  Oracle  Micron  AMD  Palantir  Adobe  Cisco  Hewlett Packard  Intel  IBM  Microsoft  Synopsys...)  even if there are a few absentees (Super Micro Computer  Microsoft ...).There are also their Old Continent and Asian counterparts (Adyen  STMicroelectronics  Capgemini  Infineon  Renesas  Nokia)  and a number of high-profile technology players (Dassault Systèmes  Fujitsu  Fortinet  Hitachi  Ericsson) who should also benefit from the trend.More unexpected is the presence of major manufacturers (Daimler  General Electric  General Motors  Schlumberger  Siemens)  which can be justified by the gains promised by AI in automation  research and data analysis.Even more surprising is the addition of giants from the pharmaceutical (Bristol-Myers Squibb  Sanofi)  catering (Chipotle Mexican Grill)  defense (RheinMetall) and insurance (Tokio Marine) sectors. But the promises of AI are so vast  in both production and operations  that we could well add Abercrombie & Fitch or Manchester United plc to the list  and it probably wouldn't shock anyone.The index  divided into GR (gross return) and NR (net return)  boasts a 26% increase since its creation  and 5% since January 1.Nasdaq CTA AI & Robotics (NQROBO)The big American brother  also made up of 100 stocks and dedicated to robotics on the margins  is a little more concentrated on techs (+52%). In addition to the above-mentioned companies  there are pure players in the field and parallel sectors (C3.AI  Ciena  Emerson Electric  Luminar  NXP Semiconductor  Teradyne  Sony  Autodesk). Asian (Baidu  Seiko) and American companies are more heavily represented than European ones.Industrials account for nearly 26%  and consumer discretionary takes no less than 8% of the index!Here again  we note related industries that should also benefit from the AI trend in the long term  such as logistics (GXO)  genetic research (Illumina)  medicine and pharma (Medtronic  Johnson & Johnson)  automotive technologies in the broadest sense (Mobileye  Gentex  Nio  Denso)  e-commerce (JD.com)  and entertainment technologies (Akamai).The additions of the machinery (Deere&Co  Shibaura  AeroVironment  Cargotec) and orthopedic equipment (Stryker Corp) segments should correspond to the Robotics segment of the index.While the index has fallen slightly since the start of the year (-23%)  it has gained over 23% since January 1  2023.Nasdaq CTA AI Index (NQINTEL)Smaller than its predecessor  with just 67 stocks  the Nasdaq CTA AI Index comprises a majority of similar stocks  with an even greater emphasis on technology (which accounts for 89% of the index). Like its aforementioned counterpart  it offers a notable weighting to telecoms players (between 4% and 5% for both indices).Among the big tech names absent from the above index are Autodesk  Broadcom and Marvell tech  as well as France's STMicroelectronics.More focused on growth stocks  and less geographically dispersed  it has gained 53% since January 2023  and is at breakeven this year.The Nasdaq Global Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Index (NYGBIG)With 88 stocks  nearly 72% of which are technology companies  the NYGBIG has a special feature: over 15% of the index is dedicated to telecoms and networks (AT&T  BT group  Juniper  Nokia  Verizon).The other major segment is consumer discretionary  with almost 7% of the index. These include Uber and Lyft in passenger transportation  Snap in social networking  DropBox  Extreme Networks  Pure Storage and Twilio in the cloud.Also of note is the presence of an Indian company (Wipro)  a Canadian bank (Toronto-Dominion)  and a number of European companies (such as SAP).Driven  like its peers  by the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Apple  Alphabet  Microsoft  Amazon  Tesla  Meta  Nvidia)  it also benefits from healthy cloud segments  hardware suppliers (such as Lenovo) and the Bitcoin rally (MicroStrategy).It has gained over 74% year-on-year  and over 4% year-to-date  to top this comparative chart.,neutral,0.2,0.78,0.02,negative,0.1,0.33,0.57,True,English,"['Indices', 'AI', 'The Nasdaq Global Artificial Intelligence', 'Nasdaq CTA AI Index', 'café du commerce', 'stock market operators', 'Super Micro Computer', 'Dassault Systèmes', 'Chipotle Mexican Grill', 'Manchester United plc', 'big tech names', 'big American brother', 'other major segment', 'Euronext AI World', 'high-profile technology players', 'Big Data Index', 'healthy cloud segments', 'major manufacturers', 'data analysis', 'Marvell tech', 'AI rally', 'American stalwarts', 'pure players', 'American companies', 'financial windfall', 'new technologies', 'broad brush', 'Hewlett Packard', 'Old Continent', 'General Electric', 'General Motors', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb', 'Tokio Marine', 'gross return', 'net return', 'Emerson Electric', 'NXP Semiconductor', 'consumer discretionary', 'related industries', 'long term', 'automotive technologies', 'broadest sense', 'JD.com', 'entertainment technologies', 'Deere&Co', 'orthopedic equipment', 'Stryker Corp', 'greater emphasis', 'notable weighting', 'special feature', 'AT&T', 'BT group', 'passenger transportation', 'social networking', 'Pure Storage', 'Indian company', 'Canadian bank', 'Magnificent Seven', 'hardware suppliers', 'Bitcoin rally', 'comparative chart', 'AI trend', 'telecoms players', 'Robotics segment', 'technology companies', 'Asian counterparts', 'parallel sectors', 'genetic research', 'Extreme Networks', 'similar stocks', 'growth stocks', 'European companies', '100 stocks', '67 stocks', '88 stocks', 'talk', 'result', 'indices', 'advantage', 'EAIWP', 'leaders', 'auxiliaries', 'Meta', 'Nvidia', 'Broadcom', 'Qualcomm', 'Apple', 'Alphabet', 'Oracle', 'Micron', 'AMD', 'Palantir', 'Adobe', 'Cisco', 'IBM', 'Microsoft', 'Synopsys', 'absentees', 'Adyen', 'STMicroelectronics', 'Capgemini', 'Infineon', 'Renesas', 'Nokia', 'number', 'Fujitsu', 'Fortinet', 'Hitachi', 'Ericsson', 'presence', 'Daimler', 'Schlumberger', 'Siemens', 'gains', 'automation', 'addition', 'giants', 'pharmaceutical', 'Sanofi', 'catering', 'defense', 'insurance', 'promises', 'production', 'operations', 'Abercrombie', 'Fitch', 'list', 'NR', '26% increase', 'creation', 'January', 'NQROBO', 'margins', 'techs', 'mentioned', 'field', 'Ciena', 'Luminar', 'Teradyne', 'Sony', 'Autodesk', 'Baidu', 'Seiko', 'Industrials', 'less', 'logistics', 'GXO', 'Illumina', 'medicine', 'Medtronic', 'Johnson', 'Mobileye', 'Gentex', 'Nio', 'Denso', 'Akamai', 'machinery', 'Shibaura', 'AeroVironment', 'Cargotec', 'start', 'year', 'NQINTEL', 'predecessor', 'majority', 'France', 'NYGBIG', 'Juniper', 'Verizon', 'Uber', 'Lyft', 'Snap', 'DropBox', 'Twilio', 'note', 'Wipro', 'SAP', 'peers', 'performance', 'Amazon', 'Tesla', 'Lenovo', 'MicroStrategy']",2024-01-23,2024-01-24,marketscreener.com

The exchange is now the world's most valuable exchange operator  boasting a $73 billion market cap.That means Lutnick's venture would be up against the world's leading derivatives marketplace.

The study showed that glenzocimab  when used with standard thrombolysis treatment  reduced the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage to 0% from 10% and all-cause mortality to 8% from 21% in comparison to a placebo.The ACTIMIS trial focused on the combination of glenzocimab with reference treatments such as thrombolysis with or without thrombectomy in AIS patients. The results suggest that patients with severe strokes  who are at a higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage  might benefit the most from the treatment.Coordinating Investigator for ACTIMIS and first author of the manuscript  Professor Mikaël Mazighi  commented on the significance of the findings  highlighting the potential of glenzocimab to pave the way for new treatments in the acute phase of ischemic stroke. Dr. Yannick Pletan  Chief Medical Officer of Acticor Biotech  noted the study's contribution to understanding the dual action of glenzocimab in reducing intracranial hemorrhages and mortality.The results  initially presented at the European Stroke Organisation Conference (ESOC) in 2022  have been further supported by a post-hoc analysis using artificial intelligence to assess brain imaging. This independent analysis confirmed a reduction in the number and volume of intracerebral lesions in patients treated with glenzocimab.Acticor Biotech is now focusing on the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 clinical trial  which completed recruitment in October 2023  with results expected in the second quarter of 2024. The company has been granted ""PRIME"" status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for glenzocimab in stroke treatment  facilitating early dialogues with regulatory authorities.This news is based on a press release statement from Acticor Biotech  a company listed on Euronext Growth Paris under the ticker FR0014005OJ5 - ALACT.InvestingPro InsightsAs Acticor Biotech progresses with its clinical trials for glenzocimab  investors and stakeholders are keeping a close eye on the company's financial health and market performance. With a market capitalization of 40.49 million USD and a notably high Price / Book ratio of 96.79 as of the last twelve months ending Q2 2023  the company's valuation metrics are intriguing. Despite these challenging valuations  the stock has shown a positive one-week price total return of 5.94%.Acticor Biotech's financials reveal some concerns  as highlighted by the InvestingPro Tips. The company is quickly burning through cash and has been operating with a moderate level of debt. Additionally  it has not been profitable over the last twelve months  with an operating income of -18.19 million USD. Analysts do not anticipate the company will turn a profit this year  which aligns with the reported negative Return on Assets of -145.59%. These factors could be crucial for investors considering the long-term prospects of the company's stock  which often moves counter to the market trend.For those looking to delve deeper into Acticor Biotech's financials and market potential  InvestingPro offers additional insights.

This new functionality is made possible thanks to a new  native integration between the SAP Document and Reporting Compliance solution and the Wolters Kluwer CCH® SureTax® solution.SAP Document and Reporting Compliance helps enable companies to transform  standardize and harmonize processes  globally  so they can more efficiently comply with local tax mandates  worldwide. Currently  the solution serves 58 countries for statutory reporting and electronic invoicing  addressing more than 450 regulations and helping enterprises leverage localized business processes for operational efficiency and seamless compliance.However  until now  users of SAP Document and Reporting Compliance have needed to utilize a separate solution  outside of SAP S/4HANA  to automate the way they visualize  report and comply with constantly changing U.S. indirect tax rules  which vary at the state  local municipality and county levels. This new  native integration will change that  by incorporating the features and functionality of the Wolters Kluwer CCH SureTax solution into the SAP Document and Reporting Compliance solution.Wolters Kluwer is one of the world's largest providers of digital knowledge solutions and cloud software for tax  finance  accounting and legal professionals  worldwide. The company’s CCH SureTax solution removes unnecessary risk from sales-and-use tax matters  by helping businesses accurately calculate  collect  and remit U.S. local and state taxes to correct authorities. Because U.S. local and state tax rates and rules vary widely  by location  and frequently change  Wolters Kluwer's extensive team of experienced tax experts continually update the CCH SureTax calculation engine to reflect the most precise indirect tax data.Elvira Wallis  Senior Vice President & Global Head of Globalization Services  SAP  said:“Integrating with SAP Document and Reporting Compliance  CCH SureTax can help tax professionals drive global indirect tax compliance within one solution - taking advantage of capabilities to automate and standardize processes worldwide while increasing traceability to business transactions in SAP S/4HANA Cloud.”Ralf Gärtner  Senior Vice President & General Manager  Corporate Performance Management Solutions at Wolters Kluwer  said: “This new  native integration between SAP Document and Reporting Compliance and CCH SureTax will be a tax reporting and compliance game-changer for the thousands of multinational companies that currently do business in the U.S.  or plan to expand into U.S. markets. Now  for the first time  multinational companies can automate their U.S. state and local tax reporting  just like they automate their tax reporting for other countries  all within the unified user experience of SAP S/4HANA Cloud.”To learn more  visit CCH SureTax for SAP Document & Reporting Compliance. The integration is the latest evolution of Wolters Kluwer’s relationship with SAP  which builds on its previous participation in SAP’s technology adoption program.###About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in Health  Tax and Accounting  Financial Corporate Compliance  Legal & Regulatory  and Corporate Performance & ESG.

This contract follows the recent announcement of Eviden leading the consortium to manufacture the JUPITER system  in October 2023  a renewed mark of confidence from Jülich Supercomputing Centre.Through a unique conception  Eviden will bring together a set of about 50 pre-built and interchangeable modules – amongst which are 20 IT containers  15 power feed containers and 10 logistic containers (lobby  workshop  warehouse etc.) – over 2 300m² to form a complete turnkey data center. Key benefits for the client include the fact that this modular solution brings more flexibility and agility in the long term by facilitating smoother updates or replacement of single modules  independently from the rest of the system. Unlike current systems with which the dismantling of an obsolete system and upgrading the datacenter to support new technologies can take weeks or month and incur long unavailability  with this system all it takes is to remove a module and replace it by one featuring an upgraded IT configuration. The same is true for the power sub-system and the logistic area.Compared to traditional ‘brick and mortar’ datacenters  this innovative and flexible approach shows once again Eviden’s integration capabilities to deliver a full end-to-end HPC solution with costs cut by 3 and a delivery time reduced by 50%. Manufactured in Eviden’s factory in Angers (France)  the JUPITER HPC racks will be integrated into the containers along with cooling  power  networking and cabling directly on the factory floor  before client delivery. This key step dramatically speeds up the installation process and reduces the risk of default discovery once on the customer’s site.As the overall eco-efficiency of any HPC system has become a key concern  this modular data center will also help reduce energy consumption  improve the recycling of the material used and will globally improve the energy efficiency. Through Eviden’s free cooling technology integrated with the supercomputer’s patented direct liquid cooling  the heat generated by the Exascale system will also offer an improved capacity to reuse within the Jülich Research Center.Prof. Dr. Dr. Thomas Lippert  Director of the Jülich Supercomputing Centre  Forschungszentrum Jülich highlighted: ""JUPITER will be perhaps the most powerful AI supercomputer in the world! Its modular computer architecture enables a particularly high level of energy efficiency. However  its enormous computing power comes with demands on the energy supply that no scientific data centre in Germany has been able to meet so far. I am pleased that the modular data centre will now allow for such a supply infrastructure to be created very quickly  which will also offer the possibility of using the thermal energy generated during cooling to heat the Jülich campus.""Emmanuel Le Roux  SVP  Global Head of HPC  AI and Quantum at Eviden  Atos Group said “This new contract which is to the benefit of Europe’s scientific and economic sovereignty as well as to its competitiveness brings us great pride. We are extremely honored to be part of Europe’s exascale journey by leading the JUPITER manufacturing consortium and now by delivering the data center to host the system. These two key strategic contracts demonstrate Eviden’s position as a trusted partner as well as its commitment to a unique and innovative technological performance with reduced energy consumption.”***About Eviden1Eviden is a next-gen technology leader in data-driven  trusted and sustainable digital transformation with a strong portfolio of patented technologies.

This contract follows the recent announcement of Eviden leading the consortium to manufacture the JUPITER system  in October 2023  a renewed mark of confidence from Jülich Supercomputing Centre.Through a unique conception  Eviden will bring together a set of about 50 pre-built and interchangeable modules – amongst which are 20 IT containers  15 power feed containers and 10 logistic containers (lobby  workshop  warehouse etc.) – over 2 300m² to form a complete turnkey data center. Key benefits for the client include the fact that this modular solution brings more flexibility and agility in the long term by facilitating smoother updates or replacement of single modules  independently from the rest of the system. Unlike current systems with which the dismantling of an obsolete system and upgrading the datacenter to support new technologies can take weeks or month and incur long unavailability  with this system all it takes is to remove a module and replace it by one featuring an upgraded IT configuration. The same is true for the power sub-system and the logistic area.Compared to traditional ‘brick and mortar’ datacenters  this innovative and flexible approach shows once again Eviden’s integration capabilities to deliver a full end-to-end HPC solution with costs cut by 3 and a delivery time reduced by 50%. Manufactured in Eviden’s factory in Angers (France)  the JUPITER HPC racks will be integrated into the containers along with cooling  power  networking and cabling directly on the factory floor  before client delivery. This key step dramatically speeds up the installation process and reduces the risk of default discovery once on the customer’s site.As the overall eco-efficiency of any HPC system has become a key concern  this modular data center will also help reduce energy consumption  improve the recycling of the material used and will globally improve the energy efficiency. Through Eviden’s free cooling technology integrated with the supercomputer’s patented direct liquid cooling  the heat generated by the Exascale system will also offer an improved capacity to reuse within the Jülich Research Center.Prof. Dr. Dr. Thomas Lippert  Director of the Jülich Supercomputing Centre  Forschungszentrum Jülich highlighted: ""JUPITER will be perhaps the most powerful AI supercomputer in the world! Its modular computer architecture enables a particularly high level of energy efficiency. However  its enormous computing power comes with demands on the energy supply that no scientific data centre in Germany has been able to meet so far. I am pleased that the modular data centre will now allow for such a supply infrastructure to be created very quickly  which will also offer the possibility of using the thermal energy generated during cooling to heat the Jülich campus.""Emmanuel Le Roux  SVP  Global Head of HPC  AI and Quantum at Eviden  Atos Group said “This new contract which is to the benefit of Europe’s scientific and economic sovereignty as well as to its competitiveness brings us great pride. We are extremely honored to be part of Europe’s exascale journey by leading the JUPITER manufacturing consortium and now by delivering the data center to host the system.

This new functionality is made possible thanks to a new  native integration between the SAP Document and Reporting Compliance solution and the Wolters Kluwer CCH® SureTax® solution.SAP Document and Reporting Compliance helps enable companies to transform  standardize and harmonize processes  globally  so they can more efficiently comply with local tax mandates  worldwide. Currently  the solution serves 58 countries for statutory reporting and electronic invoicing  addressing more than 450 regulations and helping enterprises leverage localized business processes for operational efficiency and seamless compliance.However  until now  users of SAP Document and Reporting Compliance have needed to utilize a separate solution  outside of SAP S/4HANA  to automate the way they visualize  report and comply with constantly changing U.S. indirect tax rules  which vary at the state  local municipality and county levels. This new  native integration will change that  by incorporating the features and functionality of the Wolters Kluwer CCH SureTax solution into the SAP Document and Reporting Compliance solution.Wolters Kluwer is one of the world's largest providers of digital knowledge solutions and cloud software for tax  finance  accounting and legal professionals  worldwide. The company’s CCH SureTax solution removes unnecessary risk from sales-and-use tax matters  by helping businesses accurately calculate  collect  and remit U.S. local and state taxes to correct authorities. Because U.S. local and state tax rates and rules vary widely  by location  and frequently change  Wolters Kluwer's extensive team of experienced tax experts continually update the CCH SureTax calculation engine to reflect the most precise indirect tax data.Elvira Wallis  Senior Vice President & Global Head of Globalization Services  SAP  said:“Integrating with SAP Document and Reporting Compliance  CCH SureTax can help tax professionals drive global indirect tax compliance within one solution - taking advantage of capabilities to automate and standardize processes worldwide while increasing traceability to business transactions in SAP S/4HANA Cloud.”Ralf Gärtner  Senior Vice President & General Manager  Corporate Performance Management Solutions at Wolters Kluwer  said: “This new  native integration between SAP Document and Reporting Compliance and CCH SureTax will be a tax reporting and compliance game-changer for the thousands of multinational companies that currently do business in the U.S.  or plan to expand into U.S. markets. Now  for the first time  multinational companies can automate their U.S. state and local tax reporting  just like they automate their tax reporting for other countries  all within the unified user experience of SAP S/4HANA Cloud.”To learn more  visit CCH SureTax for SAP Document & Reporting Compliance. The integration is the latest evolution of Wolters Kluwer’s relationship with SAP  which builds on its previous participation in SAP’s technology adoption program.###About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in Health  Tax and Accounting  Financial Corporate Compliance  Legal & Regulatory  and Corporate Performance & ESG.

In Q3  2023-2024  Prismaflex International recorded total sales of €11.9 million  down -11.5% (-10.2% at constant exchange rates). The results are due to Hardware activity that continues to be impacted by the volatility of the order flow. Printing confirms the resilience of its activity with a return to growth for the period. This quarterly variation takes total sales for the first nine months to €38.5 million  a drop of -11.6% (-9.7% at constant exchange rates).Printing activity for the nine-month period stands at €27.6 million  down -3.0% compared with the same period 2022-2023 but down only by -0.8% at constant exchange rates. Communications activity continues to resist well with total sales at €24.9 million  in line with results for the same period 2022-2023. In a difficult economic climate  Prismaflex International is focusing on its diversification into new geographical markets and sectors and the development of its all-inclusive print-to-installation service offers. Home decor activity however is down €0.6 million at €2.7 million  and continues to be hit by a fall in demand  notably from key commercial clients.Hardware activity sales stand at €10.9 million  down -27.8% (-26.4% at constant exchange rates) on the first nine-month period 2022-2023. This trend can be explained by a drop in sales for LED solutions (€5.9 million vs €9.9 million over nine months 2022-2023)  which did not benefit this year from any major international orders as was the case last year in Germany. In France  the activity remains strong  driven by relatively dynamic activity on the municipalities sector. Sales figures for traditional hardware activities (notably static signage solutions) remain stable at €5.0 million (vs €5.2 million in N-1).Outlook 2023-2024Commercial activity in Q3 2023-2024 took order backlog on December 31  2023 to €8.4 million  above that recorded on September 30  2023  with €4.0 million for Printing and €4.4 million for Hardware.The Printing division continues to benefit from the resilience of the Communications sector and pursues its diversification operations to limit the impact of a decline in Home Decor orders. Importantly  Prismaflex International recently acquired 49% of the capital of its subsidiary FPI and now owns 100% of the capital of the company.The Hardware division continues its marketing action to promote the Group's latest innovations which continue to be well received by customers. The Group confirms it is well placed for major projects in France and abroad with potential deliveries in 2024.In such a context  Prismaflex International aims to achieve total sales in Q4 higher than those recorded in Q3. At the same time  the Group will continue prioritising improving current operating profitability and a positive free cash-flow.Forthcoming dates :2023-2024 annual sales figures  May 7  2024 after closure.PRISMAFLEX INTERNATIONALOUTDOOR ADVERTISING SOLUTIONS MANUFACTURER AND WIDE FORMAT DIGITAL PRINTINGISIN : FR0004044600-ALPRI - Reuters : ALPRI.PA – Bloomberg : ALPRI.FPEURONEXT GROWTHTMwww.prismaflex.comContacts :Florence Thérond – CFO - Phone: +33 (0)4 74 70 68 00 – finance@prismaflex.comGuillaume Le Floch – Analysts/investors contacts – Phone: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 70 - glefloch@actus.frMarie-Claude Triquet – Press relations - Phone: +33 (0)6 84 83 21 82 – mctriquet@actus.frThis publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: nWdqZZxqZ27GymuclcprbZVsm2ZhmGCZa5PJyGKcmJydmnKRlWuSmZuYZnFknWdn- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Quarterly financial reporting:- Third quarter financial report Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/83821-pri-230124-ca-t3-2023-2024-gb.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2024 ActusNews",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.45,0.29,0.26,True,English,"['Prismaflex International', 'Third-quarter trend', 'first half', 'Total sales', 'nine-month period', 'par', 'January', '12:05', 'Third quarter financial report', 'OUTDOOR ADVERTISING SOLUTIONS MANUFACTURER', 'WIDE FORMAT DIGITAL PRINTING', '2023-2024 annual sales figures', 'constant exchange rates', 'strong 2022-2023 basis', 'difficult economic climate', 'new geographical markets', 'installation service offers', 'static signage solutions', 'Home Decor orders', 'current operating profitability', 'positive free cash-flow', 'Florence Thérond', 'Guillaume Le Floch', 'Quarterly financial reporting', 'original press release', 'next press releases', 'Total constant currencies', 'traditional hardware activities', 'first six-month period', 'foreign exchange impact', 'The Hardware division', 'Home decor activity', 'The Printing division', 'Comparable total sales', 'major international orders', 'key commercial clients', 'first nine-month period', 'first nine months', 'SECURITY MASTER Key', 'Actusnews SECURITY MASTER', '9-month total Q3', 'Hardware activity sales', 'LED solutions', 'Press relations', 'quarterly variation', 'major projects', 'Commercial activity', 'same period', 'Printing activity', 'Significant points', 'previous years', 'Order backlog', 'order flow', 'inclusive print', 'municipalities sector', 'Communications sector', 'marketing action', 'latest innovations', 'The Group', 'potential deliveries', 'same time', 'Forthcoming dates', 'EURONEXT GROWTHTM', 'Marie-Claude Triquet', 'Regulated information', 'Communications activity', 'dynamic activity', 'Prismaflex International', 'diversification operations', 'investors contacts', '9 Months', '3 Months', 'Q3.', 'return', 'comparison', 'December', 'September', 'YTD', 'turnover', 'April', 'Oct.', '€M', 'variations', 'CAD', 'ZAR', 'trend', 'results', 'volatility', 'resilience', 'drop', 'line', 'sectors', 'development', 'fall', 'demand', 'case', 'last', 'Germany', 'France', 'N-1', 'Outlook', 'capital', 'subsidiary', 'FPI', 'company', 'customers', 'context', 'Q4', 'closure', 'ALPRI', 'Reuters', 'Bloomberg', 'CFO', 'Phone', 'glefloch', 'mctriquet', 'publication', 'nWdqZZxqZ27GymuclcprbZVsm2ZhmGCZa5PJyGKcmJydmnKRlWuSmZuYZnFknWdn', 'Full', 'PDF', 'email', '6']",2024-01-23,2024-01-24,marketscreener.com

After the last DSR treatment  patients will be followed for a three-month safety follow-up period. The first patient is expected to be enrolled in Q1 2024 and interim data are planned for H2 2024.Dr. Oliver Gödje  Chief Medical Officer of Sequana Medical  commented: “We are delighted to announce the ongoing progress of our US MOJAVE study and look forward to enrol the first patient in the randomized cohort later this quarter. Building upon the strong data reported from the non-randomized MOJAVE cohort and our previous RED DESERT and SAHARA studies  we are confident about the clinical effectiveness of our DSR therapy compared to loop diuretics. We look forward to reporting interim data from the MOJAVE randomized cohort in the second half of this year to further demonstrate the potential of DSR as a disease-modifying heart failure drug therapy tackling cardiorenal syndrome.”Positive data from non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE studyData from the four-week DSR treatment period  as reported previouslyii:All three patients treated in the non-randomized cohort of the MOJAVE study had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and severe diuretic resistance at baseline (mean furosemide equivalent dose of 1 227 mg per day). At the start of the study treatment period  loop diuretics were withheld  and patients were treated with DSR 2.0 up to daily for four weeks  followed by a three-month safety follow-up period.Dramatic improvement in diuretic response and renal status: During the four-week DSR treatment period  all three patients maintained euvolemia without the need of loop diuretics. Their diuretic responseiii nearly normalized with a mean increase of 324% in their six-hour urinary sodium excretion post-treatment vs baseline. There was a broad improvement in their kidney function with a a mean improvement in eGFRiv of 47% and blood urea nitrogenv of 57% post-treatment vs baseline.Updated data from the three-month safety follow-up period:Loop diuretics virtually eliminated vs. baseline: Two patients have completed the three-month safety follow-up period and one patient is still in the follow-up period. The need for loop diuretics was dramatically reduced or even completely eliminated up to 15 weeks after the four-week DSR treatment period (see table below).Patient No. of weeks after last DSR therapy Reduction in furosemide equivalent dose vs. baseline 1 15 97% 2 15 100% 3 9 95%Improvement in renal parameters maintained: At the end of the three-month safety follow-up period  the diuretic response of the two patients who already completed the study remained normalized  with a similar high output in their six-hour urinary sodium excretion as compared to their dramatically improved diuretic response after the four-week DSR treatment period. Their kidney function also remained stable as measured by their improvement in eGFR and blood urea nitrogen.To date  no clinically relevant changes in serum sodium levels or progressive hyponatremia were observed and none of the patients needed to be hospitalized for congestion since the start of the study. Until today  there was only one serious adverse event of short-term hypertension at 12 weeks after the last DSR therapy  which was adjudicated as non-related to DSR therapy. Short-term hypertension is often seen in this very sick patient population. These data indicate that DSR 2.0 is safe and well tolerated as confirmed by the DSMB.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579About the MOJAVE studyMOJAVE is a randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a study in the US to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DSR 2.0 in diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure patients with persistent congestion. The objective is to validate the positive results from the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies in US patients using DSR 2.0.The study started with a non-randomized cohort of three patients treated with DSR 2.0 on top of optimized usual care for congestive heart failure for up to four weeks  followed by a three-month safety follow-up period (with an initial review after 30 days). Data from these patients showed i) that DSR was safe and could effectively maintain euvolemia without the need for loop diuretics  ii) a considerable benefit in their cardio-renal health and iii) a dramatic improvement in their diuretic response and at least 95% reduction in loop diuretic requirements up to 15 weeks after the last DSR therapy. Following the positive review of the non-randomized cohort data by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in January 2024  up to a further 30 patients will be enrolled in the multi-center randomized cohort. Up to 20 patients will be treated with DSR 2.0 on top of optimized usual care for congestive heart failure for up to four weeks  and up to ten control patients treated with intravenous loop diuretics as part of maximized usual care for congestive heart failure.Primary and secondary safety and efficacy endpoints include the rate of adverse and serious adverse events and the improvement in diuretic response (measured as a six-hour urine sodium output) from baseline through the end of the treatment period. Exploratory endpoints measured from baseline through the end of the treatment period include change in weight (volume status)  creatinine (a marker of renal function)  natriuretic peptides (a marker of heart failure) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class; and the number of heart failure related rehospitalizations.About DSR  a disease-modifying heart failure drug therapy tackling cardiorenal syndrome (CRS)Cardiorenal syndrome is a key clinical challenge in heart failure and results from the combined vicious cycle of dysfunction of the heart and kidney with hypothesised complex and interconnected mechanisms such as aberrations in hemodynamic  neurohormonal  inflammatory  and sodium handling pathways. Despite the complex multidimensional pathophysiology  the resultant clinical profile is thought to manifest as a self-reinforcing negative feedback cycle characterized by decreased glomerular filtration  increased renal sodium avidity  and congestion  despite escalating diuretic doses.No current therapies have been shown to improve patient outcomes in this complex and poorly understood indication. Reducing congestion is a key element of therapy but loop diuretics exacerbate many of the core mechanisms thought to underly CRS  thus even worsening diuretic resistance and CRS. Through effective control of the volume status for an extended period of time and thereby avoiding the negative consequences of loop diuretics  DSR has the potential to break the negative feedback cycle of this important indication with clear unmet clinical needs.Extensive analysis of patients in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies shows the benefit from DSR therapy on i) volume status  ii) normalized diuretic response and dramatically reduced loop diuretic dosing  iii) improvement in kidney function  iv) neurohormonal status and signalling  as well as v) cardiovascular parameters. In these patients there were no congestion-related re-hospitalizations  a one class improvement in their NYHA status and a reduction of 75% in their predicated one-year mortality (based on the Seattle Heart Failure model). Initial data from the non-randomized cohort in the US MOJAVE study support these findings and indicated that DSR is safe and well tolerated  restores diuretic response and improves cardio-renal health.Data from the RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies have been submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company submitted a Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump to the US FDA in December 2023 having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis.Results of the Company’s RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR’s mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a DSR clinical study is ongoing  seeking to confirm the strong efficacy seen in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort have been successfully treated with DSR and the DSMB approved the start of the randomized cohort of up to a further 30 patients.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

In 2022  outside investigators publishedi findings that defined three subtypes based on biomarkers – including a severe form marked by high levels of pain  of certain biomarkers and persistent and progressive inflammation. Using this new approach to stratifying disease  BioSenic commissioned a post hoc analysis of a phase 3 trial for JTA-004 that had showed inconclusive results for patients with knee OA. By instead focusing on patients in their study with the severe inflammatory subtype  the analysis detected pain-relieving efficacy superior to both placebo and the active comparator.Given the promising new findings  BioSenic now intends to expand patent protection for ""Hyaluronic acid-based compositions and related methods for use in the treatment of osteoarthritis in specifically selected subjects."" The rights were initially acquired from Bone Therapeutics following a reverse merger with Medsenic SAS to form BioSenic. As BioSenic develops a new clinical plan  this position will support steps toward commercializing JTA-004 for patients experiencing severe pain from knee OA.JTA-004 differs from other hyaluronic acid-based products for OA in its inclusion of clonidine  an alpha-2 adrenergic inhibitor  as an active pharmacological component. Its analgesic properties have been known for decades  and more recent data has demonstrated prolonged local anti-inflammatory activity  as well as a normalizing effect on cell differentiation of chondrocytes. New findings publishedii this month in Nature further connect chondrocytes to degeneration in knee OA  providing further potential explanation for JTA-004’s positive clinical results in reducing symptoms of pain and inflammation in severe cases.Prof. François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic said: ""Given the exciting new findings in knee osteoarthritis  it is time to build on previous efforts to develop JTA-004 to control the most severe subtype of progressive knee osteoarthritis. As further clinical work is needed to fully establish the significant benefits expected from JTA-004  our IP position will provide significant protection as we explore partnerships to bring this important asset to a very large pharmacological market. We are dedicated to improving the lives of millions of patients continue to suffer from this often-debilitating disease.”iAngelini F  et al. Ann Rheum Dis Feb 2022iiFu W  et al. Nature Jan 2024About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform (with key target indications including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and (ii)  the development of innovative products to meet unmet needs in immune and autoimmune diseases. Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning and key strengths to develop  separately and in combination  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO) with its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available on the website at http://www.biosenic.com .About BioSenic technology platformsThe ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). BioSenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in an early phase 2a study. Systemic sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol. ALLOB  an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. After phase 2 clinical results with contradictory conclusions  BioSenic is now focusing on determining the best time to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB (between early or late treatment).The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ● ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ghislaine.gasparetto@seitosei-actifin.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

The increase in the NAV of € 117 million during the quarter reflects increases in the estimated fair value of Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited (‘Pension Corporation’)  offset by decreases in the estimated fair value of certain investments including British American Tobacco p.l.c. (‘BAT’)  Trilantic Capital Partners  TruArc Partners and Prescient funds. Details of the Company’s NAV and details of movements in key investments can be found on pages 2 and 3 of this report. Reinet records its assets and liabilities in euro; the weakening of sterling  the US dollar and the South African rand against the euro during the quarter has resulted in an overall decrease in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying current quarter end exchange rates to the September 2023 assets and liabilities would have resulted in a decrease in the September 2023 NAV of some € 62 million.

Whilst inflation has started to fall  high prices continue to put significant pressure on households and consumers as many central banks hold interest rates at current levels to mitigate the inflation concerns. The extent and impact of these factors remain uncertain. Reinet has no direct exposure to Russia  Ukraine or the Middle East through its underlying investments or banking relationships and has not experienced any significant direct impacts in respect of interest rate fluctuations or inflation. Reinet has various banking relationships with highly rated institutions  and a well-diversified approach to cash and liquidity management. Reinet continues to value its investments in line with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (‘IPEV’) guidelines and its approved valuation procedures and methodologies. All investment valuations have been prepared using latest available data  including exchange rates and listed share prices as at 31 December 2023. Discussions have taken place with fund managers and investee companies to determine any significant changes in value and any impacts related to the various geo-political areas of conflict  volatility in stock and currency markets  interest rates  inflation and exposure to certain financial institutions. Future valuations will take into account any new impacts of the above  which could affect the valuation of underlying investments. INVESTMENTS Reinet seeks  through a range of investment structures  to build partnerships with other investors  specialised fund managers and entrepreneurs to find and develop opportunities for long-term value creation for its shareholders. Since its formation in 2008  Reinet has invested some € 3.6 billion and at 31 December 2023 has committed to provide further funding of € 561 million to its current investments.

In addition  Reinet has a fixed-rate £ 100 million margin loan due to Bank of America  N.A.  which is repayable in March 2025. At 31 December 2023  the fair value of the loan amounted to € 113 million (30 September 2023: € 110 million). The increase in the estimated fair value of both loans reflects the decrease in time to maturity and a decrease in the discount rates used. Some 15 million BAT shares have been pledged to collateralise these two loans. In addition  Reinet has a facility agreement in place with Citibank N.A. up to August 2024 and with Bank of America  N.A. up to March 2025. These facilities allow Reinet to drawdown the equivalent of up to € 230 million (£ 200 million) in a combination of currencies to fund further investment commitments. As at 31 December 2023 no funds have been drawn under these facilities.OTHER LIABILITIES Minority interest  fees payable and other liabilities  net of other assets comprise: Minority interest  fees payable and other liabilities  net of other assets comprise: 31 December 2023 30 September 2023 € m € m Minority interest (4) (4) Management fee (10) (18) Performance fee (60) (12) Tax provisions (5) (4) Accruals and other payables  net of other receivables (9) (9) BAT dividend receivable 32 32 Total other liabilities (56) (15) The minority interest liability is in respect of a minority partner’s share in the gains and losses not yet distributed arising from the estimated fair value movement of investments in which they have interests.

As a result  2023 marked a record year in bookings for Sidetrade despite a difficult macroeconomic environment. Given our business' inherent lag between bookings and revenues  we now know that revenue growth in 2024 will be in double digits.Sidetrade delivered a remarkable 2023 performance in revenue terms  up 20% at constant exchange rates. This additional growth is mainly due to our successful expansion in the United States  with revenues up 40%  to more than €12 million  representing almost a third of the Company's total revenue less than three years after we launched business in the region. In parallel  our business strategy targeting multinationals significantly contributed to this momentum; subscription revenues from this segment were up 48% and now account for nearly half of total recurring revenue. With this in mind  our technological edge in AI is increasingly recognized by major customers who are now noticeably more mature in the field. This competitive advantage is illustrated by our commercial success rate for contracts won in preference over North American market leaders – increasing from 45% in 2021 to 68% in 2022 and 79% in 2023.In addition to considerably stepping up our investment  2023 also saw us relentlessly focusing on Group-wide productivity and efficiency enhancements. This endeavor to optimize performance should result in a higher-than-expected operating margin  from the fiscal year 2023.""With €11.2 million in bookings  Sidetrade exceeds its record in 2022  up 9%Sidetrade(€m) 2023 2022 Change New SaaS subscriptions (New ARR) 6.2 6.4 -4% Services bookings 5.0 3.8 +31% New Annual Contract Value (ACV) 11.2 10.3 +9% of which North America (ACV) 4.1 3.4 +22%2023 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.On a full-year basis  for the fiscal year 2023  Sidetrade succeeded in slightly exceeding its record bookings achieved in 2022  in an uncertain economic environment. New Annual Contract Value (ACV) totaled €11.2 million  up 9%. As a reminder  ACV bookings in 2022 posted record revenue of €10.3 million  with impressive growth of 36% versus 2021. 2023 therefore set a record for Sidetrade bookings. The United States contributed to Sidetrade’s 2023 growth  with a 22% increase in bookings which accounts for 37% of total bookings. Also of note is the start of a recovery in the Northern Europe region (mainly the United Kingdom) with ACV of €1.09 million in 2023 versus €0.36 million in 2022 (+200%)  paving the way for additional growth in 2024.New SaaS bookings totaled €6.18 million  remaining almost stable versus 2022 (-4%). Against a backdrop of economic uncertainties  the Company is committed to increasing visibility of its future revenues in contract negotiations. To this end  in 2023  the initial period for new contracts continued rising  up to 45.5 months versus 44.9 months the previous year. As such  Total Contract Value (TCV) for 2023 slightly increased to €21.1 million versus €20.7 million in 2022. In parallel  services bookings  which are almost all invoiced within twelve months of their signing  totaled €5.04 million  up 31% compared to 2022 (€3.84 million). This strong increase is largely due to the growing number of global deployment projects.Overall  the 2023 bookings performance was due to 1/ a business strategy kick-started eighteen months ago  with a focus on companies generating $1 billion-plus revenue  2/ increased recognition by multinationals of Sidetrade's technological edge in artificial intelligence  particularly in the United States  and 3/ the development of a comprehensive Order-to-Cash software suite  resulting from a strategy of continuous innovation.In 2023  Sidetrade's appeal was powerfully demonstrated by contracts won with industry giants including BIC  Agfa  NielsenIQ  Dassault Systèmes  Bayer  Nutrien and Morningstar  Inc. This wealth of leading brands not only serves as a testament of confidence  but also a tangible validation of the relevance and efficiency behind Sidetrade's solutions.In the fiscal year 2023  bookings by new customers (""New Business"") accounted for 58% of the total new bookings  while 20% of total new bookings were driven by cross-selling. Lastly  upselling of additional modules to existing customers represented the remaining 22% of bookings.Robust revenue growth  up 20% at constant exchange rates  with SaaS subscriptions up 23%Sidetrade(€m) 2023 2022 Change ‘Order-to-Cash’ activities 43.1 35.9 +20% of which SaaS Subscriptions 36.6 30.1 +22% ‘Sales & Marketing’ activities 0.6 0.9 -33% Revenue 43.7 36.8 +19%2023 information is from consolidated  unaudited data. Reported basisIn 2023  revenue for 'Order-to-Cash' SaaS subscriptions grew substantially  up 23% at constant exchange rates and 22% on a reported basis.Sidetrade's revenue for 2023 totaled €43.7 million  up 20% at constant exchange rates and 19% on a reported basis.This performance is attributable to three factors:Successful expansion in the United StatesQuarter after quarter in 2023  the United States was a key growth driver for Sidetrade  posting revenues up 40% on a full-year basis to €12.1 million. As a result of this successful expansion  international markets now represent 58% of the Company's total revenue  already including 28% in North America. Going forward  the United States will continue to be pivotal for Sidetrade's growth.Increasing demand from multinational corporationsAnalysis of customer profiles for 'Order-to-Cash' activities is underpinned by impressive growth of 48% in subscriptions with multinational corporations on annual recurring revenue (ARR) contracts in excess of €250 000. These subscriptions now account for 43% of Sidetrade's total subscriptions and are expected to remain an important growth driver in the quarters ahead.Consolidation of CreditPoint Software businessEffective July 1  2023  the consolidation of the CreditPoint Software business has positively contributed to Sidetrade's performance. In H2 2023  CreditPoint generated revenue of €0.9 million with a 2% impact on annual growth.It should be noted that all multi-year Sidetrade contracts are routinely indexed to inflation (the Syntec for Southern Europe  the UK CPI for Northern Europe and the US CPI for the United States). This measure alters the total price of SaaS subscriptions each year by reference to changes in these price indices  without the need for contract renewals.Sidetrade looks ahead to the fiscal year 2024 with confidence and a clear vision  and has the resources to fulfill its ambitions.Next financial announcementAnnual Results for 2023: March 27  2024  after the stock market closes.Investor relationsChristelle Dhrif 00 33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comMedia relationsBecca Parlby 00 44 7824 5055 84 bparlby@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

As a result  2023 marked a record year in bookings for Sidetrade despite a difficult macroeconomic environment. Given our business' inherent lag between bookings and revenues  we now know that revenue growth in 2024 will be in double digits.Sidetrade delivered a remarkable 2023 performance in revenue terms  up 20% at constant exchange rates. This additional growth is mainly due to our successful expansion in the United States  with revenues up 40%  to more than €12 million  representing almost a third of the Company's total revenue less than three years after we launched business in the region. In parallel  our business strategy targeting multinationals significantly contributed to this momentum; subscription revenues from this segment were up 48% and now account for nearly half of total recurring revenue. With this in mind  our technological edge in AI is increasingly recognized by major customers who are now noticeably more mature in the field. This competitive advantage is illustrated by our commercial success rate for contracts won in preference over North American market leaders – increasing from 45% in 2021 to 68% in 2022 and 79% in 2023.In addition to considerably stepping up our investment  2023 also saw us relentlessly focusing on Group-wide productivity and efficiency enhancements. This endeavor to optimize performance should result in a higher-than-expected operating margin  from the fiscal year 2023.""With €11.2 million in bookings  Sidetrade exceeds its record in 2022  up 9%Sidetrade(€m) 2023 2022 Change New SaaS subscriptions (New ARR) 6.2 6.4 -4% Services bookings 5.0 3.8 +31% New Annual Contract Value (ACV) 11.2 10.3 +9% of which North America (ACV) 4.1 3.4 +22%2023 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.On a full-year basis  for the fiscal year 2023  Sidetrade succeeded in slightly exceeding its record bookings achieved in 2022  in an uncertain economic environment. New Annual Contract Value (ACV) totaled €11.2 million  up 9%. As a reminder  ACV bookings in 2022 posted record revenue of €10.3 million  with impressive growth of 36% versus 2021. 2023 therefore set a record for Sidetrade bookings. The United States contributed to Sidetrade’s 2023 growth  with a 22% increase in bookings which accounts for 37% of total bookings. Also of note is the start of a recovery in the Northern Europe region (mainly the United Kingdom) with ACV of €1.09 million in 2023 versus €0.36 million in 2022 (+200%)  paving the way for additional growth in 2024.New SaaS bookings totaled €6.18 million  remaining almost stable versus 2022 (-4%). Against a backdrop of economic uncertainties  the Company is committed to increasing visibility of its future revenues in contract negotiations. To this end  in 2023  the initial period for new contracts continued rising  up to 45.5 months versus 44.9 months the previous year. As such  Total Contract Value (TCV) for 2023 slightly increased to €21.1 million versus €20.7 million in 2022. In parallel  services bookings  which are almost all invoiced within twelve months of their signing  totaled €5.04 million  up 31% compared to 2022 (€3.84 million). This strong increase is largely due to the growing number of global deployment projects.Overall  the 2023 bookings performance was due to 1/ a business strategy kick-started eighteen months ago  with a focus on companies generating $1 billion-plus revenue  2/ increased recognition by multinationals of Sidetrade's technological edge in artificial intelligence  particularly in the United States  and 3/ the development of a comprehensive Order-to-Cash software suite  resulting from a strategy of continuous innovation.In 2023  Sidetrade's appeal was powerfully demonstrated by contracts won with industry giants including BIC  Agfa  NielsenIQ  Dassault Systèmes  Bayer  Nutrien and Morningstar  Inc. This wealth of leading brands not only serves as a testament of confidence  but also a tangible validation of the relevance and efficiency behind Sidetrade's solutions.In the fiscal year 2023  bookings by new customers (""New Business"") accounted for 58% of the total new bookings  while 20% of total new bookings were driven by cross-selling. Lastly  upselling of additional modules to existing customers represented the remaining 22% of bookings.Robust revenue growth  up 20% at constant exchange rates  with SaaS subscriptions up 23%Sidetrade(€m) 2023 2022 Change ‘Order-to-Cash’ activities 43.1 35.9 +20% of which SaaS Subscriptions 36.6 30.1 +22% ‘Sales & Marketing’ activities 0.6 0.9 -33% Revenue 43.7 36.8 +19%2023 information is from consolidated  unaudited data. Reported basisIn 2023  revenue for 'Order-to-Cash' SaaS subscriptions grew substantially  up 23% at constant exchange rates and 22% on a reported basis.Sidetrade's revenue for 2023 totaled €43.7 million  up 20% at constant exchange rates and 19% on a reported basis.This performance is attributable to three factors:Successful expansion in the United StatesQuarter after quarter in 2023  the United States was a key growth driver for Sidetrade  posting revenues up 40% on a full-year basis to €12.1 million. As a result of this successful expansion  international markets now represent 58% of the Company's total revenue  already including 28% in North America. Going forward  the United States will continue to be pivotal for Sidetrade's growth.Increasing demand from multinational corporationsAnalysis of customer profiles for 'Order-to-Cash' activities is underpinned by impressive growth of 48% in subscriptions with multinational corporations on annual recurring revenue (ARR) contracts in excess of €250 000. These subscriptions now account for 43% of Sidetrade's total subscriptions and are expected to remain an important growth driver in the quarters ahead.Consolidation of CreditPoint Software businessEffective July 1  2023  the consolidation of the CreditPoint Software business has positively contributed to Sidetrade's performance. In H2 2023  CreditPoint generated revenue of €0.9 million with a 2% impact on annual growth.It should be noted that all multi-year Sidetrade contracts are routinely indexed to inflation (the Syntec for Southern Europe  the UK CPI for Northern Europe and the US CPI for the United States). This measure alters the total price of SaaS subscriptions each year by reference to changes in these price indices  without the need for contract renewals.Sidetrade looks ahead to the fiscal year 2024 with confidence and a clear vision  and has the resources to fulfill its ambitions.Next financial announcementAnnual Results for 2023: March 27  2024  after the stock market closes.Investor relationsChristelle Dhrif 00 33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comMedia relationsBecca Parlby 00 44 7824 5055 84 bparlby@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

Assuming the conditions of the CVR are met  this would represent additional cash consideration of approximately $296 million for Inhibrx’s shareholders;Sanofi will be responsible for the satisfaction of Inhibrx’s currently outstanding third-party debt;Inhibrx’s shareholders will receive 0.25 shares of the newly created entity New Inhibrx per Inhibrx share. New Inhibrx will be capitalized with $200 million of cash at distribution;Sanofi will retain an 8% equity stake in New Inhibrx.New Inhibrx will retain non-INBRX-101 assets  notably including its immuno-oncology pipeline (INBRX-109  INBRX-106  INBRX-105)  as well as Inhibrx assets not related to INBRX-101 and Inhibrx’s employees. It will be led by Mark P. Lappe  Founder and CEO of Inhibrx  as Chairman and CEO of New Inhibrx  and will continue to operate under the Inhibrx name.The transaction was unanimously approved by both the Sanofi and Inhibrx Boards of Directors.Sanofi’s acquisition of Inhibrx is subject to the completion of the New Inhibrx spin-off transaction and other customary closing conditions  including receipt of regulatory approvals and approval by Inhibrx’s shareholders.

By signing another long-term contract with a major client  EDPR reaffirms its strong PPA activity with utilities and big companies  and nowadays has more than 55% of the 2023-2026 additions already secured.EDPR entered Germany in 2022 through the acquisition of Kronos Solar EDPR and currently has a pipeline of over 8 GWp in different stages of development in solar utility scale  including agri-PV projects. Although EDPR's business in Germany is focused on solar technology  the company has the ambition of developing wind projects in the country by the end of the decade.“Signing this long-term agreement with Lhyfe is an important opportunity for EDPR as it reinforces our commitment to ramp up the penetration of renewable energy in Europe  especially in a market that has the ambition to achieve significant photovoltaic targets by the end of this decade. We are happy to be able  through Kronos Solar EDPR  to contribute to these goals by partnering with Lhyfe  whose activity complements our aim of reducing CO 2 emissions”  highlights Duarte Bello  Chief Operating Officer for Europe at EDP Renewables.“Thanks to this agreement  we are securing in a local and long-term manner our renewable electricity supply. Almost the entire output of the EDPR photovoltaic solar plant will be used to power our green and renewable hydrogen production sites contributing to the decarbonisation of mobility and industry which currently use fossil fuels or carbon-derived hydrogen. We also keep strengthening our strategic relation with EDPR  with whom we are extremely happy to jointly collaborate in the H2 industry"" Matthieu Guesné  CEO and founder of Lhyfe.About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

In Italy it is more common for shareholders to propose board candidates.Under the bill  the outgoing board's list will need approval by at least two-thirds of directors  which critics say could give minority shareholders veto powers.The bill introduces also a second vote on individual candidates  which professional investors find unnecessary.Moreover  headhunters say that a new provision requiring board lists to include 30% more candidates than will be elected pose a major hurdle  as nominees need to agree to be included knowing not all of them will get picked.HOW DOES GENERALI COME INTO THE PICTURE?The amendment was championed by businessman Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone  an investor in Generali who has repeatedly complained about the influence that Mediobanca exerted on the insurer.However  Generali Chief Excutive Philippe Donnet in November said the legislation could make large listed groups unmanageable.If passed  as expected  by parliament  the new rules will become effective in 2025 and companies will have to amend their bylaws by then to comply.WHAT ROLE DID THE GOVERNMENT PLAY?In announcing the bill last year  Italy's Treasury proposed that voting rights enhancements would only apply to companies that plan to list  given its goal was to persuade business owners to go public without worrying about losing control.Yet the cabinet office and the ruling parties opted for a more aggressive approach  extending to listed companies the possibility of issuing shares with up to 10 times voting rights.Meloni also defended the provision on the board list  saying this month it would curb the practice of directors getting re-appointed indefinitely with little regard to shareholders.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?Government representatives have said Rome will not backtrack on either of the disputed measures.However  political sources told Reuters that Meloni's administration could revisit the rule on the board slate later this year  as it plans a new set of measures to boost Italy's financial markets.Such a U-turn has a precedent as Italy last year shocked investors with a windfall bank tax which it later effectively neutered.($1 = 0.9183 euros)(Editing by Tomasz Janowski)",neutral,0.06,0.62,0.32,mixed,0.07,0.31,0.61,True,English,"['Capital Markets', 'Explainer', 'Italy', 'Generali Chief Excutive Philippe Donnet', 'Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni', 'businessman Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone', 'minority shareholders veto powers', 'windfall bank tax', 'Milan stock exchange', 'corporate governance rules', 'leading Italian companies', 'large listed groups', 'large foreign funds', 'voting rights enhancements', '10 times voting rights', 'one vote"" rule', 'investment funds', 'foreign investments', 'Milan bourse', 'one share', 'second vote', 'new rules', 'leading investors', 'Giuseppe Fonte', 'Valentina Za', 'mounting criticism', 'capital markets', 'listed companies', 'financial industry', 'EQUITY MARKET', 'overall capitalisation', '2023 year-end data', 'three exchanges', 'Borsa Italiana', 'recent years', 'other markets', 'listing process', 'medium-sized enterprises', 'established shareholders', 'tight grip', 'asset managers', 'BOARD RENEWALS', 'bigger say', 'outgoing board', 'next term', 'board lists', 'major hurdle', 'GOVERNMENT PLAY', 'business owners', 'cabinet office', 'ruling parties', 'aggressive approach', 'up to', 'little regard', 'political sources', 'board slate', 'new set', 'financial markets', 'Tomasz Janowski', '762 billion euros', 'trillion euros', 'prominent companies', 'insurer Generali', 'longstanding investors', 'professional investors', 'parliamentary amendment', 'board candidates', 'individual candidates', 'new provision', 'HOW DOES', 'Government representatives', 'government bill', '0.9183 euros', 'ROME', 'Reuters', 'country', 'measures', 'influence', 'Italy', 'concerns', 'legislation', 'February', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'Euronext', 'April', 'newcomers', 'string', 'buyouts', 'package', 'range', 'firms', 'incentives', 'shares', 'relocations', 'Netherlands', 'proposal', 'concentration', 'hands', 'SNAG', 'Lawmakers', 'conditions', 'company', 'practice', 'banks', 'UniCredit', 'Mediobanca', 'approval', 'two-thirds', 'directors', 'critics', 'headhunters', 'nominees', 'PICTURE', 'November', 'bylaws', 'ROLE', 'Treasury', 'goal', 'control', 'possibility', 'administration', 'U-turn', 'precedent']",2024-01-24,2024-01-24,money.usnews.com

This is the same day Flutter expects to list on the NYSE in the US.Flutter ordinary shares remain eligible for and continue to trade on the main market of the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Listing in the US will not impact trading in London.The group trades on the LSE under the FLTR ticker symbol  while its NYSE ticker has already been confirmed as FLUT.Ordinary shares will also launch on the NYSE  subject to the US Securities and Exchange Commission approving its Form 20-F Registration Statement. This approval is the only remaining step required for the US listing.Flutter expects this process to complete ahead of the market opening on 29 January.Why is Flutter listing in the US?The US listing was first mooted in February 2023  with Flutter saying it would support wider US growth plans. Shareholders approved the dual listing at Flutter’s AGM in April and the group has been working towards the listing ever since.Flutter has reported significant growth within the US in recent years due to the success of FanDuel. Acquired in May 2018  while the brand was still a daily fantasy sports operator  FanDuel has grown to become a major US provider of sports betting and igaming.Ahead of the Euronext Dublin delisting and subsequent US listing  Flutter last week posted a trading update for 2023. This included further evidence of its ongoing growth in the US.Group revenue for the 12 months to 31 December was 25% higher year-on-year at £9.51bn (€11.01bn/$12.09bn) for its 2023 financial year. This  Flutter said  was driven by a 38% rise in revenue from operations in the US to £3.06bn.As was the case in 2022  US operations remain the primary revenue source for the group  drawing 37.9% of all revenue. Based on growth in previous year  this share only looks set to increase in 2024 and beyond.On a constant currency (CC) basis  US sports revenue jumped 39% while gaming was 47% higher. Flutter also noted a 38% increase in average monthly players to more than 3.2 million.Flutter eyes further US growthSpeaking in an earnings call after the update  Flutter CEO Peter Jackson outlined a three-year strategy for success in the US. He said Flutter plans for FanDuel to complete a race to the finish line in the final year.“From an igaming perspective  we’re following the strategy we laid out at the capital markets day ” Jackson said.“We said in the first year there were things that were broken that we were going to fix. We said in the second year we’d get to product parity and in the third year we’re going to get ahead of the market.”,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.29,0.4,0.31,True,English,"['Euronext Dublin', 'US listing', 'Flutter', 'Form 20-F Registration Statement', 'constant currency (CC) basis', 'daily fantasy sports operator', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'wider US growth plans', 'Flutter CEO Peter Jackson', 'average monthly players', 'London Stock Exchange', 'FLTR ticker symbol', 'primary revenue source', 'major US provider', 'Euronext Dublin delisting', 'US sports revenue', 'subsequent US listing', 'Flutter ordinary shares', 'Exchange Commission', 'sports betting', 'significant growth', 'ongoing growth', 'same day', 'remaining step', 'recent years', 'earnings call', 'finish line', 'capital markets', 'product parity', 'US Securities', 'dual listing', '2023 financial year', 'previous year', 'final year', 'first year', 'second year', 'third year', 'NYSE ticker', 'main market', 'market opening', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Flutter eyes', 'three-year strategy', 'igaming perspective', 'Flutter listing', 'US operations', 'Group revenue', 'trading update', 'Ireland', 'launch', '23 January', '29 January', 'LSE', 'approval', 'process', 'February', 'Shareholders', 'AGM', 'April', 'success', 'FanDuel', 'May', 'brand', 'evidence', '12 months', '31 December', '38% rise', 'case', '38% increase', 'race', 'things', '2022']",2024-01-24,2024-01-24,igamingbusiness.com
