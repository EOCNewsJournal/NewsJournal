Brussels plans to spend the interest earned on frozen Russian assets on military aid for Kiev worth $666 million  Belga News Agency reported on Tuesday  citing the Belgian defense minister’s office.Defense Minister Ludivine Dedonder had a phone call with her Ukrainian counterpart  Rustem Umerov  on Monday. “Belgium will provide €611 million ($666 million) in military aid this year and has a long-term commitment to supporting the modernization of our defense forces ” Umerov said on X (formerly Twitter) following the conversation. Dedonder reposted the message.The Belgian minister’s office then confirmed to Belga on Tuesday that the phone call had taken place  adding that the money for the promised aid would come from interest generated by frozen Russian assets stored in Belgium. The defense ministry did not issue any separate statement on the issue.A total of $300 billion worth of Russian forex reserves have been frozen by G7 countries  the EU  and Australia since the start of the conflict between Moscow and Kiev in February 2022. Most of those reserves ($232 billion) are reportedly held in the EU  with $208 billion located in Belgium.According to Belga  the vast majority of frozen Russian reserves are held by the Belgium-based Euroclear financial company  which continues to make “record profits.”The US and its allies in Europe and elsewhere have so far been reluctant to consider confiscating frozen Russian assets  despite otherwise slapping Russia with unprecedented sanctions over its ongoing military campaign. Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency reported this week that the West could stand to lose almost just as much money as it would seize from Russia if it proceeds with its confiscation plan.Calls for the seizure of assets have grown louder in recent months  according to the media. In December  the Financial Times reported that Washington had proposed that working groups from the G7 explore ways to confiscate the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets on February 24  2024. Bloomberg also reported that the idea had received support from the White House.On Tuesday  Reuters reported that EU member states had so far failed to reach an agreement on the risky move  and such a possibility remained “unlikely.” Last month  Brussels proposed seizing interest generated by the frozen Russian funds instead while leaving the principal intact.,neutral,0.07,0.72,0.21,negative,0.02,0.3,0.68,True,English,"['EU state', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'money', 'media', 'Belgium-based Euroclear financial company', 'RIA Novosti news agency', 'Defense Minister Ludivine Dedonder', 'Belga News Agency', 'Belgian defense minister', 'ongoing military campaign', 'first EU nation', 'EU member states', 'Russian forex reserves', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Belgian minister', 'Financial Times', 'defense forces', 'defense ministry', 'Russian reserves', 'Russian funds', 'phone call', 'Ukrainian counterpart', 'long-term commitment', 'separate statement', 'vast majority', 'record profits', 'The US', 'unprecedented sanctions', 'confiscation plan', 'recent months', 'working groups', 'White House', 'risky move', 'military aid', 'military assistance', 'Rustem Umerov', 'G7 countries', 'interest', 'Kiev', 'money', 'Ukraine', 'Brussels', 'Tuesday', 'office', 'Monday', 'modernization', 'Twitter', 'conversation', 'message', 'place', 'issue', 'total', 'billion', 'Australia', 'start', 'conflict', 'Moscow', 'February', 'allies', 'Europe', 'West', 'Calls', 'seizure', 'media', 'December', 'Washington', 'ways', 'Bloomberg', 'idea', 'support', 'Reuters', 'agreement', 'possibility', 'principal']",2024-01-24,2024-01-25,rt.com

The failure of the U.S. and Europe to approve additional aid has left Ukraine perilously,Nearly two years since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  the war has reached a critical phase. The failure of the U.S. and Europe to approve additional aid has left Ukraine perilously low on weaponry  ammunition and manpower.With Russian President Vladimir Putin showing no signs of relenting  Western governments are now openly considering another option: seizing frozen Russian state assets and giving the proceeds to Ukraine.The idea of making Russia pay for its aggression with its own assets has undeniable moral and practical appeal. At a time of tightening budgets  it’s an easier message to deliver to Western taxpayers than new funding packages. Proponents rightly want to help Ukraine  punish Putin and bring an end to the war. Yet confiscating sovereign assets now could end up making Ukraine’s predicament even worse.Some $300 billion in Russian central bank reserves have been immobilized by Western governments. Joe Biden’s administration has introduced a bill that would authorize the president to confiscate Russian state assets held in the U.S. It has asked other members of the Group of 7  which meets in February  to consider how frozen reserves in other countries can be legally repurposed to help Ukraine.In truth  little prevents the U.S. from authorizing such a transfer — it did so as recently as 2022  with frozen assets belonging to Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover. It seized Iraqi state assets in 2003. A consensus among G-7 countries  which collectively account for 44% of the world’s gross domestic product  would increase the legitimacy of any move against Russian state assets.Yet the circumstances and scale would make confiscation in Russia’s case unique. For all its savagery in Ukraine  Russia is a recognized state with a long-standing government. Any confiscation will face court challenges by Russia in multiple countries. Ukraine would be unlikely to have access to the money for years  even decades  if those processes are respected. At best  the confiscated funds might eventually help finance Ukraine’s postwar reconstruction. At worst  skeptics in the U.S. and Europe will use the distant prospect of unlocking Russian assets as an excuse not to send fresh military aid to Ukraine  handing victory to Putin.Aside from the legal wrangling  sovereign seizure on this scale would set a precedent that could be abused in the future  undermining the stability of international relations and economic systems. And it would deprive the West of a bargaining chip in any future negotiations with Russia over ending the war.For now  there are better options for handling Russian assets. Most of the funds frozen by the U.S. and Europe are being held at the Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear. Rather than attempt to claim possession of those assets  the European Union should adopt a windfall tax on the income made by depositories on Russia’s frozen assets. Belgium already transfers to Ukraine the additional corporate tax revenue it collects from those immobilized assets. Repurposing the Euroclear profits would amount to several billion more euros a year.Needless to say  that’s not nearly enough for Ukraine to fund its government and war. Leveraging the underlying assets for investment and borrowing offers the prospect of greater returns  but the legal process for doing so isn’t straightforward. In the meantime  more than $110 billion in aid — monumental for Ukraine but a pittance compared to Western defense budgets — is being held up by a faction of hard-line Republicans in the U.S. Congress and  in Europe  by Hungary’s pro-Russian leader  Viktor Orban.Embarking on a long and contested process to seize Russian assets may allow Western governments to claim they’re doing something.

Most of this money is kept in the Belgium-based Euroclear central securities depositary  while only around $5 billion is held in U.S. institutions.The bill ""Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity (REPO) for Ukrainians Act"" was supported 20 to one.If it were to pass the Senate and House of Representatives and be signed into law by President Joe Biden  the bill would enable Washington's first-ever seizure of central bank assets from a country with which it is not at war.The White House reportedly backs confiscating Russian assets but seeks to align its position with other Group of Seven (G7) allies  namely the EU  where around two-thirds of Russian frozen assets are held.Read also: Ukraine Business Roundup — January 16Senator Ben Cardin  the Democratic foreign relations committee chairman  told reporters that the bill has broad support from both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and House  as well as from Biden's administration.He said he expected that the Democratic-majority Senate and Republican-majority House would be able to resolve the differences between this bill and a similar one passed in the House.The potential confiscation should be discussed during a G7 meeting in February.The decision to confiscate frozen Russian assets must be taken collectively and is unlikely to happen quickly  U.S. Special Representative for Economic Recovery in Ukraine Penny Pritzker said during the World Economic Forum on Jan. 15.Senior European Union officials said this week that the bloc was unlikely to confiscate Russian central bank assets frozen in Europe  according to Reuters.Instead  the EU has been discussing ways of providing Ukraine with a windfall tax on profits generated by the frozen assets. In October  Belgium announced it would create a $1.8 billion fund for Ukraine  financed by the tax revenue from interest on frozen Russian assets.Moscow has pledged to respond to the potential seizure by confiscating Western assets in Russia  which reportedly amount to $288 billion.The World Bank assessed early in 2023 that the total cost of Ukraine's reconstruction would amount to $411 billion. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba commented in January that the total amount of Russian assets could cover over 80% of recovery costs.Read also: US Treasury Secretary reassures Ukrainian PM on $11.8 billion of budget supportWe’ve been working hard to bring you independent  locally-sourced news from Ukraine.

Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading ...,I was hoping I could get through the week without mentioning Davos  since the conference has been getting increasingly tedious over the years  not to mention irrelevant.But  alas  that harsh judgment is largely unfair  since the agenda at the annual meeting of the world’s elite does attempt to tackle large global issues by inviting the ultimate “influencers” to say their piece. We can mock the private jets used to travel to a venue to discuss the perils of climate change  scoff at privileged financiers dismissing tools for financial freedom  and laugh at the hypocrisy of wanting to fight misinformation with censorship . Yet  we can also appreciate the showcasing  parading and parties for the networking opportunities they are. And we can enjoy the glitz of the media coverage  which is increasingly what Davos is about.Intriguing yet overlooked debates sometimes get surfaced. This happened yesterday  on the Tokenization Economy panel   which I actually enjoyed. It featured good dialogue and smart people  including Circle’s Jeremy Allaire  Stellar’s Denelle Dixon  Euroclear’s Lieve Mostrey and Skybridge’s Anthony Scaramucci.Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading  and host of the CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter  which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers  and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.The discussion was about use cases  regulation  jurisdictional differences – the usual stuff but eloquently said. At the very end  however  just as I was concluding “nice  but nothing new ” an audience-member asked for the panel’s opinion on the regulatory approach of “same activity  same risk  same regulation.”A-ha! Finally  something potentially controversial.Euroclear’s Mostrey chimed in first  insisting that regulation has to be technology-agnostic if we don’t want to block progress. This has been Euroclear’s approach so far  issuing a short-term note on their own proprietary blockchain and then passing it over to traditional rails  fully compliant with existing laws.Story continuesRead more: Noelle Acheson - Bitcoin ETFs and Wall Street: A Double MilestoneI get this  and on principle I agree – it’s the outcome that matters when it comes to protection  not the technology. But when it comes to blockchain and securities  the technology does matter a lot. It confers not just new advantages but also new functionalities that the legacy rails can’t contemplate. True  that’s not exactly “same activity.” But insisting that all blockchain-based securities conform to current rules limits the potential at the starting gate. We will only ever get “more of the same” but with some efficiency. Surely we can aim higher.Same but differentEven if we accept that we start with the “same” and work with regulators on crafting rules for the “different ” there are still regulatory issues that need addressing. To start with  the Euroclear blockchain-based note needed to be passed to legacy rails in order to be fully compliant. That adds steps  layers and middlemen  which doesn’t sound so efficient to me. Why can’t the blockchain-based note meet the regulatory requirements?Because recognizing securities transactions natively on a blockchain is not as simple as it sounds. For instance  settlement finality is a key part of securities regulation – when is ownership transferred? In traditional securities  it’s when the seller has accepted payment from the buyer for the asset. This involves many steps  involving clearing houses such as Euroclear. But on a blockchain  settlement “finality” is both atomic (payment and transfer in one step) and usually consensus-based. How much consensus is enough for finality?This is made even more complicated by the variety of blockchains being used for tokenization: there are public chains  permissioned ones  proprietary networks  and sometimes a hybrid. Different blockchains work in different ways.There is also a lack of clarity for now as to what reporting is needed for on-chain transactions  and how it should be delivered. Plus  what sort of identity should be used?And when a security’s whole life cycle is embedded in code  who is responsible if something goes wrong? Depending on the chosen platform  blockchain “fixes” are not at all straightforward.The Euroclear approach can work: use the blockchain  but repeat everything on legacy rails so the regulators are happy and traditional investors don’t feel excluded. But is it optimal? Is squeezing this new type of asset into an existing structure the most efficient approach? It broadens the potential reach for now by getting it past the gate-keepers – but  ultimately  it’s no more than a very short-term fix.Circle’s Allaire’s response summed it up succinctly: “[Same activity  same rules] is still a looking-backward philosophy.”Read more: Colin Butler - 2024 Will Be the Year Tokenization Truly (Finally) BeginsHe used the early days of the Internet as an example. If this philosophy had been applied back then  he said  the world today would look very different. All websites would need to have registered with the Federal Communications Commission. If any were to stream audio  they’d need to get a radio license. For peer-to-peer communication  a platform would need to apply to become a telecom operator. With this maze of requirements  the Internet’s main use would probably still be for exchanging research papers.Crypto is in a similar situation. I totally agree that regulation should care about outcomes  not the technology. But ignoring the ability of the technology to do things in a radically different way is cutting off the potential just as it takes its first steps.It’s a difficult problem to solve. Financial assets have a totally different risk profile than publications or audio content. The layers of regulations to protect investors while ring-fencing economies are orders of magnitude more complex  as they should be.And waiting for new rules to be drafted  that take into account the new characteristics of blockchain-based asset transfer  could end up delaying progress by years.A compromiseSo  what’s the solution? My preference is for “simple” tokenized securities to be covered by existing rules  to allow crypto-native and legacy market participants to start experimenting with processes and market reactions. Meanwhile  sandboxes should allow for experimentation with the regulators’ blessing. The sandboxes need to recognize that markets are changing  and “out there” ideas could end up becoming the norm of a more efficient tomorrow. It’s not that long ago in the arc of history that electronic trading was regarded as a radical departure from common sense.Tokenization is a similar leap forward – just as electronic trading unleashed a previously unimaginable range of new types of product and trading strategies  so will blockchain-based markets. Just as electronic trading enabled increasingly sophisticated dashboards to improve both intelligence and reporting  blockchain transparency can reduce risk while enabling new market functionalities.The potential is much greater than doing something more efficiently. It’s about what we’ll be able to do that we couldn’t before. For that  new rules will be needed – but we can work within the existing ones meanwhile.,neutral,0.03,0.93,0.04,mixed,0.33,0.21,0.45,True,English,"[""Same Rules' Approach"", 'Same Activity', 'Davos Debate', 'Tokenization', 'CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast', 'large global issues', 'Tokenization Economy panel', 'The Euroclear approach', 'Euroclear blockchain-based note', 'regulatory issues', 'short-term note', 'blockchain-based securities', 'harsh judgment', 'annual meeting', 'ultimate “influencers', 'private jets', 'climate change', 'privileged financiers', 'financial freedom', 'networking opportunities', 'media coverage', 'overlooked debates', 'good dialogue', 'smart people', 'Denelle Dixon', 'Anthony Scaramucci', 'Noelle Acheson', 'former head', 'Genesis Trading', 'macro landscapes', 'investment advice', 'use cases', 'jurisdictional differences', 'usual stuff', 'regulatory approach', 'same activity', 'same risk', 'traditional rails', 'existing laws', 'Bitcoin ETFs', 'Wall Street', 'Double Milestone', 'new advantages', 'new functionalities', 'legacy rails', 'starting gate', 'regulatory requirements', 'key part', 'clearing houses', 'one step', 'public chains', 'proprietary networks', 'chain transactions', 'life cycle', 'traditional investors', 'new type', 'existing structure', 'efficient approach', 'short-term fix', 'backward philosophy', 'Colin Butler', 'Year Tokenization', 'early days', 'securities transactions', 'traditional securities', 'current rules', 'settlement finality', 'settlement “finality', 'different ways', 'same rules', 'Jeremy Allaire', 'Lieve Mostrey', 'shifting crypto', 'same regulation', 'many steps', 'potential reach', 'proprietary blockchain', 'blockchain “fixes', 'securities regulation', 'Different blockchains', 'week', 'Davos', 'conference', 'years', 'agenda', 'world', 'elite', 'piece', 'venue', 'perils', 'tools', 'hypocrisy', 'misinformation', 'censorship', 'showcasing', 'parading', 'parties', 'glitz', 'Intriguing', 'Circle', 'Stellar', 'Skybridge', 'research', 'host', 'article', 'newsletter', 'overlap', 'opinions', 'discussion', 'audience-member', 'something', 'progress', 'Story', 'principle', 'outcome', 'protection', 'technology', 'efficiency', 'regulators', 'order', 'layers', 'middlemen', 'instance', 'ownership', 'seller', 'payment', 'buyer', 'asset', 'transfer', 'consensus', 'variety', 'hybrid', 'lack', 'clarity', 'reporting', 'sort', 'identity', 'security', 'code', 'platform', 'everything', 'gate-keepers', 'response', 'Internet', 'example']",2024-01-18,2024-01-25,finance.yahoo.com

It follows former fellow corporate finance director Stephen Kane deciding to leave Goodbody in October to become director of corporate finance at housebuilder Cairn Homes.David Kearney  the company’s former head of corporate broking  also left the company late last year  after 18 years.READ MORESeparately  Colm Ryan  who had headed up Goodbody’s fixed income – or bond desk – and was a key player in the firm being named last June as a primary dealer for Irish Government bonds  left the company just before Christmas.Mr Ryan’s departure  however  was a delayed one under the voluntary redundancy plan announced in early October. Garret Grogan  a former global head of trading at Bank of Ireland who joined Goodbody two years ago  has been named as Mr Ryan’s successor  sources said.The firm missed out on being named as one of the international banks and securities firms hired earlier this month to sell €3 billion of bonds for the Government.Goodbody  which has been led by chief executive Martin Tormey since it was bought by AIB two years ago  told staff last October not to expect bonuses for a second straight year under the bank’s ownership.The warning came weeks after the firm moved to cut about 20 of then 100 investment banking unit jobs  amid actual and planned stock market exits and a dearth of stock market flotations.CRH  traditionally the largest company on the Iseq  quit Euronext Dublin in September as it moved its main listing from London to New York. Paddy Power’s parent company  Flutter Entertainment  is on track to follow suit next Monday. Smurfit Kappa  another Iseq bellwether  also plans to exit the Irish market this year and move its main listing to Wall Street as part of a planned merger with US peer WestRock.Goodbody revealed in November that it had swung to a loss of €15.8 million in 2022 as fee income slumped amid weak equity markets and money made from its own securities trading book also slid.

The deal is part of a roughly 18.5% stake sale to foreign and local investors for 353 million shekels ($95 million)  meaning the couple would have paid $25 million  according to calculations by Bloomberg.The transaction is the latest high-profile move from the hedge fund billionaire  who has become an increasingly vocal voice in America’s culture wars in recent months  speaking out against the media  and antisemitism on university campuses  as well the way diversity programs are run. That’s touched a nerve among the political left  but won him plenty of praise from conservative activists  members of the Jewish community and even Elon Musk.For Israel  the deal is another sign of foreign investors returning to the country after having pulled money at the onset of the war. The share sale “received a lot of interest from international and local investors  including from large investors who have not yet invested in Israel ” said Ittai Ben Zeev  chief executive officer of the stock exchange.Ackman and Oxman were the only investors named in a statement detailing the sale  which was priced at a 2% discount to the stock’s last close.Shares in the bourse jumped as much as 9.4%  putting it on track to erase all war-linked losses. The stock had fallen 3% since the start of the war through Tuesday’s close  under-performing global peers. Saudi Tadawul Group Holding  Deutsche Boerse AG and London Stock Exchange Group Plc all had gains of at least 12% in the same period.Harvard GraduateAckman  a Harvard University graduate who founded Pershing Square Capital Management in 2004  has a personal net worth of $2.6 billion  according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Over the decades  he’s fashioned a place for himself as an arbiter of how public companies should behave  known for his shareholder activism that included an ill-fated short-selling campaign at Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. Ackman swore off big  messy short selling campaigns in 2022  telling investors he’d take a “quieter approach.”Though Ackman remains the fund’s final decision-maker  he deputized a chief investment officer. The structure of his fund  unusual in the hedge fund world  means he doesn’t have to answer to big-money investors as a typical manager would.At the same time he’s pushing ahead on hot-button topics  opining on the platform X with the same pugnacity that defined his Wall Street career.His Israel investment comes on the heels of a campaign directed at Harvard’s leadership for failing to root out antisemitism on campus. Claudine Gay  the university’s first Black president  eventually stepped down amid Ackman’s attacks and allegations of plagiarism.Oxman was a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab. A first lieutenant in the Israeli Air Force  she is a graduate of the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London.According to a recent report in Business Insider  she plagiarized multiple paragraphs of her 2010 doctoral dissertation. Oxman responded to the outlet’s accusations saying she had “omitted quotation marks for certain work” in her 330-page thesis  but had cited other authors appropriately.Ackman has accused the site of holding a “campaign to destroy” his wife  while Business Insider’s chief executive officer said the organization stands by its report.,negative,0.02,0.18,0.8,mixed,0.06,0.27,0.67,True,English,"['first big Israel investment', 'Tel Aviv bourse', 'Hamas war', 'Ackman', 'chunk', 'Harvard', 'antisemitism', 'plagiarism', 'big, messy short selling campaigns', 'London Stock Exchange Group Plc', 'Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd', 'Saudi Tadawul Group Holding', 'Pershing Square Capital Management', 'Tel Aviv bourse', 'Herbalife Nutrition Ltd', 'latest high-profile move', 'Ittai Ben Zeev', 'chief executive officer', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'personal net worth', 'Wall Street career', 'Israeli Air Force', 'Architectural Association School', 'chief investment officer', 'first Black president', 'hedge fund billionaire', 'Bloomberg Billionaires Index', 'hedge fund world', 'fated short-selling campaign', 'Harvard University graduate', 'Harvard Graduate Ackman', 'first lieutenant', 'prominent investments', 'subsequent retaliation', '353 million shekels', 'vocal voice', 'culture wars', 'recent months', 'university campuses', 'diversity programs', 'political left', 'conservative activists', 'Jewish community', 'Elon Musk', 'last close', 'war-linked losses', 'same period', 'public companies', 'shareholder activism', 'quieter approach', 'final decision-maker', 'typical manager', 'same time', 'hot-button topics', 'platform X', 'same pugnacity', 'Claudine Gay', 'Massachusetts Institute', 'Business Insider', 'multiple paragraphs', '2010 doctoral dissertation', 'quotation marks', '330-page thesis', 'other authors', 'local investors', 'large investors', 'big-money investors', 'Israel investment', 'share sale', 'Media Lab', 'recent report', 'Bill Ackman', 'foreign investors', 'Neri Oxman', '18.5% stake sale', 'Hamas attacks', 'wife', 'rise', 'antisemitism', 'deal', 'part', 'couple', 'calculations', 'transaction', 'America', 'nerve', 'plenty', 'praise', 'members', 'sign', 'country', 'onset', 'lot', 'interest', 'international', 'statement', '2% discount', 'Shares', 'track', 'start', 'Tuesday', 'gains', 'decades', 'place', 'arbiter', 'structure', 'heels', 'leadership', 'allegations', 'plagiarism', 'professor', 'Technology', 'Architecture', 'outlet', 'accusations', 'work', 'site', 'organization']",2024-01-24,2024-01-25,fortune.com

In a strategic move to expand its global footprint  Great Eagle has also initiated the listing process for its common shares in the United States on the Over-the-counter (OTC) market.""The Frankfurt Stock Exchange listing marks a pivotal milestone for Great Eagle. This expansion into one of Europe's premier trading platforms not only opens the door to a new realm of European investors but also significantly enhances our trading liquidity and overall market presence. We are deeply committed to broadening our international reach and investor base  and we anticipate that our forthcoming OTC listing in the United States will be a key catalyst in this global growth strategy "" stated Andrew Fletcher  President and Director of the Company.The Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE) stands as one of the most influential international trading hubs for securities. Managed by Deutsche Boerse AG  the FSE is the largest of Germany's seven stock exchanges  commanding around 90 percent of all securities trading in Germany. Renowned for its sophisticated electronic trading  settlement  and information systems  the FSE offers a dynamic platform that facilitates cross-border trading  thus appealing to a broad spectrum of international investors.About Great Eagle Gold Corp.Great Eagle Gold Corp. (CSE: GEGC) (FSE: GI8)  a Canadian public company  aims to be a leading digital green gold miner. Its unique strategy involves developing and acquiring certified gold resources to exchange into digital green gold tokens. By keeping the gold secured in the ground while tokenizing and monetizing its value  Great Eagle Gold Corp. introduces an innovative  ESG-friendly approach to wealth creation in the traditional gold mining industry.Great Eagle Gold's inaugural gold resource development project is situated in Colombia's second-largest gold-producing region  Bajo Cauca. Hacienda Río Rayo encompasses three fully permitted exploration and production concessions  hosting nine active alluvial gold mining operations with an average monthly output of approximately 35 kilograms. The total area covered by these three concessions is 2 523 hectares. Despite its rich history of gold production  this extensive area has never undergone modern exploration or certification of gold resources. Identifying and quantifying this untapped potential is Great Eagle Gold's primary focus. Moreover  Colombia is anticipated to be the first country to enact green gold legislation  as championed by the International Green Gold Council  thus pioneering the way for a thriving green gold tokenization industry.Besides its Colombian project  Great Eagle Gold's global acquisition strategy targets existing mining titles with NI 43-101 certified gold resources. This approach is in anticipation of a wave of green gold legislation  which is expected to open tokenization opportunities worldwide.Great Eagle Gold Corp.Andrew Fletcher  PresidentTel: +1 604 568 0461For further information please contact:Green Gold CommunicationsToll Free +1 877-513-5213Email: info@greateaglegold.comWebsite: www.greateaglegold.comDisclaimerNeither the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE)  nor the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE)  nor their Regulation Services Providers accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.This news release contains ""forward-looking information"" within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

Canada and Mexico are also taking the same step.""The question is no longer if  but how and when it will happen in the EU "" Mairead McGuinness  EU financial services commissioner  told a conference in Brussels  adding it would not happen within months.A shift to the practice known as T+1 would improve market efficiency  increase trading volumes and cut the need for collateral to back trades  but the fragmented nature of EU stock trading means it would be a complex undertaking  requiring a ""political steer""  McGuinness said.Given how financial markets in the EU are interlinked with those in Britain and other non-EU countries  the bloc was open to coordinating the timing of moving to T+1  she said.It was therefore important to keep an ""open dialogue"" with Britain  which is already considering T+1  she said.Gary Gensler  chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  said he expects the EU  Britain and Switzerland to introduce T+1 later this decade.""It will happen "" he told the conference  adding that markets could handle the intervening transatlantic ""mismatch"" in settlement times.Gensler called for a global debate among central banks on moving settlement of forex transactions from T+2 to T+1. ""Time is risk and time is money there as well.""GET TESTING DONEStephan Leithner  a member of Deutsche Boerse's executive board  said he welcomed the clarification from McGuinness on how the EU will respond to Wall Street's move.Story continues""T+1 is absolutely doable technically "" Leithner said  but warned that it must not become a distraction from the EU's efforts to build a deeper capital market.Without cooperation with Britain and Switzerland  moving to T+1 in the EU would be challenging  and the bloc should adopt a fast timeline for the shift  Leithner said.EU securities watchdog ESMA has already undertaken a public consultation on T+1  and it told the conference that the response on its desirability has been mixed.ESMA said it will report back before the end of the year.European investors have voiced concern that the change in May will mean they will not have enough time to line up dollars to pay for U.S. stock transactions  and have urged FX settlement system CLS to delay the 'cutoff' for receiving settlement instructions.""We will wait to see the effect of May T+1 live  and consider afterwards whether we need to change our cutoffs "" CLS Group CEO Marc Bayle told the conference. ""The move of cutoff is not the solution to all the problems.""Ahead of May  Gensler urged European investors to ""be prepared... and get the necessary testing done"".

FRANCE 24 talks to an economist and a unionist about the key f…,Farming malaiseThe protests sweeping across France have cast a renewed focus on the plight of farmers  a shrinking and ageing category at the mercy of volatile prices and grappling with a bleak economic outlook. FRANCE 24 talks to an economist and a unionist about the key figures behind France’s farming crisis.Farmers block a motorway in southeastern France in protest against taxes  food prices and declining income  on January 23  2024.Advertising Read moreFrench farmers expanded their roadblocks on Wednesday in protest at plunging food prices  soaring costs and crippling regulations they say are killing their livelihoods.The protests  part of a rising tide of anger among agricultural producers across the European Union  pose a major challenge to President Emmanuel Macron’s government  coming just months ahead of European elections.The turmoil has reopened a sensitive debate in France  the EU’s leading agricultural producer  which has seen the number of farmers shrink from 2.5 million in the 1950s to fewer than half a million today.An ageing populationFrance’s farming population has not only shrunk dramatically; it is also older than ever before. According to the latest available census  farmers averaged 51.4 years of age in 2020  up from 50.2 in 2010.Of the 496 000 farmers counted in 2020  almost 200 000 – two fifths of the total – will be eligible for retirement by 2026. Meanwhile  aspiring younger farmers are being priced out of the industry  unable to invest in land and property.“Young people who want to go into farming have to invest hundreds of thousands  if not millions  of euros in a profession that is known to be tough  with long working hours  on-call duty  few holidays and a fluctuating income ” says economist Alessandra Kirsch  head of studies at the French think tank Agriculture Stratégies.“The loan repayments they have to make in the first few years are too high compared to the meagre profits generated by farms ” she explains.Read moreWhy French farmers are up in arms: fuel hikes  green regulation  EU directivesImproving the sector’s attractiveness is crucial to its survival  adds Yohann Barbe  a cattle farmer from eastern France who sits on the board of the FNSEA  France’s main farming union.“We need to offer people the prospect of better working conditions ” he says. “We’re lucky enough to work in contact with nature  but we have to be able to make ends meet too.”100 000 fewer farms in one decadeThe corollary of a shrinking workforce is an almost symmetrical decline in the total number of farms  down by almost 21% between 2010 and 2020 – a loss of around 100 000 businesses in the space of a decade.Kirsch points to major hurdles in handing over farms from one generation to another  owing to both the cost of properties and the lack of candidates.01:45“Not to mention the fact that the value of agricultural production decreases over time: to produce the same wealth  you need more capital and more labour ” she adds. “That’s why you end up with bigger farms that employ more people  but earn no more.”The latter trend explains why the actual farming area has remained largely stable between 2010 and 2020  shrinking by just 1% nationwide.A higher risk of suicideThe hardship experienced by farmers has been blamed for a significantly higher suicide rate than the wider population.In 2020  the rate of suicide among farmers aged 15 to 64 was 43.2% higher than the national average  according to figures compiled by the Mutuelle sociale agricole (MSA)  the agricultural sector’s main health insurance provider.“It’s a profession that requires a lot of work and knowledge of many fields (business  administration  agronomy)  and which is constantly under fire ” says Kirsch. “Reconciling professional and social is not easy in such circumstances  and it’s easy to lose one’s footing.”For Barbe  the cattle farmer  agricultural workers have been left behind while the rest of the professional world adapted to changing times.“Nowadays  when we sit down for our evening meal on Sundays  I’m the only one who gets up to go look after the cows ” he says.Poorer and more vulnerableStruggling to cover costs and bills  while fretting over uncertain earnings  is an all too familiar experience for most farmers.At 17.4%  the share of farming households who live below the poverty threshold is higher than among blue-collar workers (13.9%) and clerical workers (12.1%)  and almost twice as high as the national average (9.2%)  according to INSEE  the national institute of statistics.Read moreIn pictures: French farmers block roads  bridges as protests sweep countryFarmers’ greater vulnerability is a consequence of their high income volatility  says Kirsch.“Market prices can change in a matter of weeks  and a weather hazard can wipe out a harvest in a matter of hours. In other professions  you can negotiate your salary  set your selling price and make forecasts. In agriculture  you don’t know what your income will be until you’ve harvested and sold – and it’s not you who sets the price.”Grain prices in freefallWild fluctuations in grain prices are indicative of the challenges farmers face.The price of wheat slumped to €214 per ton in December  its lowest level in over two years and less than half its value in May 2022  according to the Euronext stock exchange.Kirsch points to several factors behind this sharp drop  starting with the abundant Russian stocks that allow Moscow to sell its wheat at ultra-competitive prices  out-competing the French.Adverse weather conditions have compounded French farmers’ disadvantage.“It was difficult to get tractors into flooded fields to prepare the soil and sow at the right time ” Kirsch explains. “We are therefore expecting a poor harvest  combined with prices that are below production costs.”This article is a translation of the original in French.Daily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe,negative,0.02,0.31,0.67,mixed,0.09,0.22,0.69,True,English,"['farming crisis', 'Fewer', 'France', 'numbers', 'French think tank Agriculture Stratégies', 'main health insurance provider', 'bleak economic outlook', 'President Emmanuel Macron', 'latest available census', 'Mutuelle sociale agricole', 'leading agricultural producer', 'main farming union', 'actual farming area', 'high income volatility', 'aspiring younger farmers', 'long working hours', 'economist Alessandra Kirsch', 'higher suicide rate', 'French farmers', 'European Union', 'working conditions', 'higher risk', 'agricultural producers', 'agricultural production', 'agricultural workers', 'Farming malaise', 'farming crisis', 'farming population', 'farming households', 'renewed focus', 'ageing category', 'volatile prices', 'food prices', 'declining income', 'crippling regulations', 'rising tide', 'major challenge', 'European elections', 'sensitive debate', 'ageing population', 'two fifths', 'call duty', 'fluctuating income', 'loan repayments', 'meagre profits', 'fuel hikes', 'green regulation', 'cattle farmer', 'symmetrical decline', 'major hurdles', 'one generation', 'same wealth', 'latter trend', 'wider population', 'national average', 'many fields', 'professional world', 'evening meal', 'uncertain earnings', 'familiar experience', 'poverty threshold', 'blue-collar workers', 'clerical workers', 'national institute', 'greater vulnerability', 'Market prices', 'weather hazard', 'other professions', 'agricultural sector', 'key figures', 'soaring costs', 'EU directives', 'Yohann Barbe', 'one decade', 'shrinking workforce', 'most farmers', 'selling price', '100,000 fewer farms', 'bigger farms', 'Young people', 'southeastern France', 'total number', '496,000 farmers', 'protests', 'plight', 'mercy', 'talks', 'unionist', 'motorway', 'taxes', 'January', 'Advertising', 'roadblocks', 'Wednesday', 'livelihoods', 'part', 'anger', 'government', 'turmoil', '1950s', '51.4 years', 'retirement', 'industry', 'land', 'property', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'millions', 'euros', 'holidays', 'head', 'studies', 'first', 'attractiveness', 'survival', 'board', 'FNSEA', 'prospect', 'contact', 'nature', 'ends', 'corollary', 'loss', '100,000 businesses', 'space', 'properties', 'lack', 'candidates', 'fact', 'value', 'time', 'capital', 'labour', 'hardship', 'MSA', 'lot', 'knowledge', 'administration', 'agronomy', 'fire', 'circumstances', 'footing', 'rest', 'changing', 'Sundays', 'cows', 'Poorer', 'bills', 'share', 'INSEE', 'statistics', 'pictures', 'roads', 'bridges', 'country', 'consequence', 'matter', 'weeks', 'harvest', 'salary', 'forecasts', 'Grai']",2024-01-24,2024-01-25,france24.com

In Baden-Württemberg and in Lower Saxony  Lhyfe is building two production units representing a maximum total production capacity of 8 tonnes of green and renewable hydrogen per day  which will be supplied locally for uses related to mobility and industrial processes. This CPPA allows Lhyfe to further reinforce its European network of renewable electricity supplier partners  following the signing of two other CPPAs in 2023  while guaranteeing competitive sales conditions for renewable hydrogen in the long-term.For EDP Renewables  this deal is a milestone as it is the first long-term corporate contract for renewable energy supply signed in Germany since its expansion and also the first PPA signed with a hydrogen company. This PPA reflects its success in securing new PPAs and reinforces its low-risk profile and growth strategy based on the development of competitive projects with long-term visibility  fostering the acceleration of the energy transition and the decarbonization of the economy. By signing another long-term contract with a major client  EDPR reaffirms its strong PPA activity with utilities and big companies  and nowadays has more than 55% of the 2023-2026 additions already secured.EDPR entered Germany in 2022 through the acquisition of Kronos Solar EDPR and currently has a pipeline of over 8 GWp in different stages of development in solar utility scale  including agri-PV projects. Although EDPR's business in Germany is focused on solar technology  the company has the ambition of developing wind projects in the country by the end of the decade.“Signing this long-term agreement with Lhyfe is an important opportunity for EDPR as it reinforces our commitment to ramp up the penetration of renewable energy in Europe  especially in a market that has the ambition to achieve significant photovoltaic targets by the end of this decade. We are happy to be able  through Kronos Solar EDPR  to contribute to these goals by partnering with Lhyfe  whose activity complements our aim of reducing CO 2 emissions”  highlights Duarte Bello  Chief Operating Officer for Europe at EDP Renewables.“Thanks to this agreement  we are securing in a local and long-term manner our renewable electricity supply. Almost the entire output of the EDPR photovoltaic solar plant will be used to power our green and renewable hydrogen production sites contributing to the decarbonisation of mobility and industry which currently use fossil fuels or carbon-derived hydrogen. We also keep strengthening our strategic relation with EDPR  with whom we are extremely happy to jointly collaborate in the H2 industry"" Matthieu Guesné  CEO and founder of Lhyfe.About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

This figure lies at the mid-point of the target range announced in October  and benefited from a strong fourth quarter that saw several improvements over Q2 and Q3: consultants' productivity rate rose back above 93%  the number of employees waiting between contracts decreased  and headcount slightly increased.Annual revenue in France amounted to €280.5 million  up 6.5% on a like-for-like basis. With this strong performance  Aubay outperformed its benchmark market. Despite an environment of cautiousness and controlled investment budgets  the French market continued to offer opportunities and a number of tenders that  albeit lower than 2022 levels  was well above those in 2021.Internationally  while demand was hampered by a wait-and-see approach concerning investment and a number of decisions to cut spending (as was the case in France)  all regions collectively delivered organic growth of 1.4%  with revenue of €253.6 million.Spain and Portugal performed well  and the major adaptation efforts deployed until Q3 allowed for a reduction in the number of employees waiting between contracts in Q4.Belgium and Luxembourg benefited from the stability that comes with exposure to public markets  particularly in Europe  which contributed to the Group's growth.Italy continued its efforts to stabilize its activity and improve margins through a strategic review of its operations and main sectors of exposure.Operating margin from ordinary activities at the higher end of the adjusted target range.As announced in October 2023  staff activity returned to rates above 93% at the end of September following a disappointing summer.In the fourth quarter  the rate climbed to 93.3%  limiting the decline over the year as a whole to 92.8% (down 2.2 points on 2022).Despite this context  sales prices were able to increase in all regions (with the exception of Italy)  enabling the Group to contain inflationary pressures on wage costs.As a result  operating margin from ordinary activities is expected to be at the higher end of the range announced in October  between 8% and 9%.A stabilized workforceFollowing two consecutive quarters of measured decline  the trend reversed in the fourth quarter with a slight increase in headcount (+41 employees).There was a slight drop in staff turnover across all regions over the year.Total headcount stood at 7 779 at the end of the year  which is unchanged from the start of the year.2024 outlook: encouraging signs in an environment that remains uncertainThe market at the start of 2024 is similar to that of 2023. Many customers still have a wait-and-see attitude  or are even looking for ways to save money. However  there are still plenty of opportunities  and digitalization projects continue to require technical support and cutting-edge expertise.The first quarter will be affected by an unfavorable calendar effect (with one less billable day)  while the 2024 financial year as a whole will benefit from a favorable calendar effect (with one or two additional billable days depending on the region).Remaining cautious  Aubay is still focused  above all else  on safeguarding its margins and currently expects:organic growth of between 0% and 3%  i.e.  annual revenue within the range of €534 million and €550 million;operating margin from ordinary activities at the same level as 2023;Next publication: the full-year 2023 results will be published on March 20  2024 after the close of trading.2024 financial calendar2024/2025 financial calendar Date Q1 2024 revenue Wednesday April 24  2024 Q2 2024 revenue Wednesday July 24  2024 H1 2024 results Wednesday September 18  2024 Financial analysts meeting Thursday September 19  2024 Q3 2024 revenue Wednesday October 23  2024 Q4 2024 revenue Wednesday January 22  2025 2024 annual results Wednesday March 19  2025GlossaryOrganic revenue growth: this refers to growth calculated for a constant scope of activity for a given period  excluding revenue from companies that were acquired or sold during the period.

As we move into 2024  we are determined to continue growing at a sustained pace  and to continue innovating to provide candidates with solutions and services that will make it easier for them to obtain their driving license. 2024 should also mark a key milestone in our trajectory  reaching operating profitability thanks to gross margin increase and costs reduction  in line with the commitment made at the time of our IPO.""In €’000French accounting standards Full Year Q4 2023 2022 Var. 2023 2022 Var.

This one-off quarterly decline was mainly due to:1/ the 18% contraction in sales generated over the period by learners financing their training through the CPF (Personal Training Account) scheme  while traditional sales continued to grow by over 27%.2/ a sharper-than-usual fall in driving hours in December.Operating profitability target reaffirmed for 2024lePERMISLIBRE reaffirms its objective of achieving operating profitability over the full 2024 financial year  with headcount now stabilized at 67 people compared with 82 at the end of 2022  a reduction in fixed costs and better-targeted marketing expenditure  in an annual market of over 2 billion euros [1] in which online driving schools are gradually increasing their market share.Continued growth in 2024To accelerate its growth in 2024 and beyond  lePERMISLIBRE intends to rely on several strategic pilars:- Increasing geographic coverage in cities with populations of less than 50 000  where demand is strong. In 2023 the company has deployed its service in around 40 new towns;- enriching and diversifying its offering. At the end of 2023  lePERMISLIBRE launched ""the Driving License Insurance""  a unique and innovative solution that guarantees learners that they will not have to pay for additional hours of training to obtain their driving license  even if they fail. In 2024  lePERMISLIBRE intends to launch other insurance innovations  with the aim of providing learners with more services to help them pass their driving test and enhance their experience as new drivers;- The development of personalized monitoring of learners' progress  capitalizing on the use of data to offer them specific actions depending on how their training progresses. In particular  to promote proximity and close follow-up  candidates will be able to contact company staff in less than 24 hours. This initiative is designed to help them make the right choices and maximize their success rate in obtaining their driving license.Next press release27 March 2024: 2023 financial resultsABOUT LEPERMISLIBREFounded in Lyon in 2014 and a pioneer of digital driving schools in France  lePERMISLIBRE is reinventing driving lessons by providing a disruptive offering compared to traditional players  more aligned with the new habits and lifestyles of the digital native generation that grew up with the development of digital technology. lePERMISLIBRE federates a community of more than 1 000 loyal  committed and passionate driving instructors  all of whom are State-qualified.

In Italy it is more common for shareholders to propose board candidates.Under the bill  the outgoing board's list will need approval by at least two-thirds of directors  which critics say could give minority shareholders veto powers.The bill introduces also a second vote on individual candidates  which professional investors find unnecessary.Moreover  headhunters say that a new provision requiring board lists to include 30% more candidates than will be elected pose a major hurdle  as nominees need to agree to be included knowing not all of them will get picked.HOW DOES GENERALI COME INTO THE PICTURE?The amendment was championed by businessman Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone  an investor in Generali who has repeatedly complained about the influence that Mediobanca exerted on the insurer.However  Generali Chief Excutive Philippe Donnet in November said the legislation could make large listed groups unmanageable.If passed  as expected  by parliament  the new rules will become effective in 2025 and companies will have to amend their bylaws by then to comply.WHAT ROLE DID THE GOVERNMENT PLAY?In announcing the bill last year  Italy's Treasury proposed that voting rights enhancements would only apply to companies that plan to list  given its goal was to persuade business owners to go public without worrying about losing control.Yet the cabinet office and the ruling parties opted for a more aggressive approach  extending to listed companies the possibility of issuing shares with up to 10 times voting rights.Meloni also defended the provision on the board list  saying this month it would curb the practice of directors getting re-appointed indefinitely with little regard to shareholders.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?Government representatives have said Rome will not backtrack on either of the disputed measures.However  political sources told Reuters that Meloni's administration could revisit the rule on the board slate later this year  as it plans a new set of measures to boost Italy's financial markets.Such a U-turn has a precedent as Italy last year shocked investors with a windfall bank tax which it later effectively neutered.($1 = 0.9183 euros) (Editing by Tomasz Janowski)",neutral,0.02,0.63,0.34,negative,0.03,0.29,0.69,True,English,"['capital markets', 'Italy', 'Generali Chief Excutive Philippe Donnet', 'Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni', 'businessman Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone', 'minority shareholders veto powers', 'windfall bank tax', 'other European peers', 'Milan stock exchange', 'corporate governance rules', 'leading Italian companies', 'large listed groups', 'large foreign funds', '10 times voting rights', 'voting rights enhancements', 'one vote"" rule', 'investment funds', 'foreign investments', 'Milan bourse', 'other markets', 'one share', 'second vote', 'new rules', 'leading investors', 'capital markets', 'financial industry', 'mounting criticism', 'EQUITY MARKET', 'overall capitalisation', '2023 year-end data', 'three exchanges', 'Borsa Italiana', 'recent years', 'listing process', 'medium-sized enterprises', 'tight grip', 'asset managers', 'SNAG OVER', 'BOARD RENEWALS', 'bigger say', 'outgoing board', 'next term', 'board lists', 'major hurdle', 'GOVERNMENT PLAY', 'business owners', 'cabinet office', 'ruling parties', 'aggressive approach', 'up to', 'little regard', 'political sources', 'board slate', 'new set', 'financial markets', 'Tomasz Janowski', 'listed companies', 'established shareholders', '762 billion euros', 'trillion euros', 'prominent companies', 'insurer Generali', 'listed firms', 'board candidates', 'longstanding investors', 'individual candidates', 'professional investors', 'parliamentary amendment', 'new provision', 'HOW DOES', 'Government representatives', 'Government legislation', 'government bill', '0.9183 euros', 'Italy', 'ROME', 'Reuters', 'country', 'measures', 'influence', 'concerns', 'February', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'Euronext', 'April', 'newcomers', 'string', 'buyouts', 'package', 'range', 'incentives', 'shares', 'relocations', 'Netherlands', 'proposal', 'concentration', 'hands', 'Lawmakers', 'conditions', 'company', 'practice', 'banks', 'UniCredit', 'Mediobanca', 'approval', 'two-thirds', 'directors', 'critics', 'headhunters', 'nominees', 'PICTURE', 'November', 'bylaws', 'ROLE', 'Treasury', 'goal', 'control', 'possibility', 'administration', 'U-turn', 'precedent']",2024-01-24,2024-01-25,marketscreener.com

By Reuters,Explainer-What makes Italy's capital markets bill controversial?,"Published Jan 24  2024 07:49AM ET© Reuters. FILE PHOTO: A view shows the Milan stock exchange building  as stocks slid in the first hours of trading after fears that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank could trigger a broader financial crisis  in Milan  Italy  March 13  2023. REUTERS/Claudia Greco/GASI -0.29% Add to/Remove from Watchlist MDIBY -0.67% Add to/Remove from Watchlist MDBI -0.17% Add to/Remove from WatchlistBy Giuseppe Fonte and Valentina ZaROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni faces mounting criticism over a government bill to overhaul the country's capital markets  after it was amended to include measures that boost the influence of leading investors in listed companies.Representatives of investment funds and Italy's financial industry have all voiced concerns that the proposed legislation  which parliament is expected to approve in February  could backfire and discourage foreign investments.HOW BIG IS ITALY'S EQUITY MARKET?With an overall capitalisation of 762 billion euros ($871 billion)  the Milan bourse lags Paris' 3.6 trillion euros or Amsterdam's 1.4 trillion euros  based on 2023 year-end data from Euronext that operates the three exchanges.Announced in April 2023  the bill aims to attract newcomers to Borsa Italiana  after the Milan stock exchange lost a string of prominent companies in recent years to other markets and buyouts.The package includes measures to simplify the listing process and expands the range of firms that can benefit from incentives to list aimed at small- and medium-sized enterprises.HOW ARE VOTING RIGHTS AFFECTED?Under a parliamentary amendment to the bill  listed companies can issue shares that boost up to 10-fold the voting rights of longstanding investors  as Italy seeks to stem relocations to the Netherlands  where corporate governance rules help established shareholders keep a tight grip on companies.The proposal has angered asset managers  including large foreign funds  which favour a ""one share  one vote"" rule that prevents a concentration of power in the hands of a few.WHAT'S THE SNAG OVER BOARD RENEWALS?Lawmakers also want to give investors a bigger say over the conditions under which a company's outgoing board presents a list of candidates for the next term.Such a practice  common abroad  has only recently been adopted by leading Italian companies  including insurer Generali (BIT: ) and banks UniCredit and Mediobanca (OTC: ). In Italy it is more common for shareholders to propose board candidates.Under the bill  the outgoing board's list will need approval by at least two-thirds of directors  which critics say could give minority shareholders veto powers.The bill introduces also a second vote on individual candidates  which professional investors find unnecessary.Moreover  headhunters say that a new provision requiring board lists to include 30% more candidates than will be elected pose a major hurdle  as nominees need to agree to be included knowing not all of them will get picked.HOW DOES GENERALI COME INTO THE PICTURE?The amendment was championed by businessman Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone  an investor in Generali who has repeatedly complained about the influence that Mediobanca exerted on the insurer.However  Generali Chief Excutive Philippe Donnet in November said the legislation could make large listed groups unmanageable.If passed  as expected  by parliament  the new rules will become effective in 2025 and companies will have to amend their bylaws by then to comply.WHAT ROLE DID THE GOVERNMENT PLAY?In announcing the bill last year  Italy's Treasury proposed that voting rights enhancements would only apply to companies that plan to list  given its goal was to persuade business owners to go public without worrying about losing control.Yet the cabinet office and the ruling parties opted for a more aggressive approach  extending to listed companies the possibility of issuing shares with up to 10 times voting rights.Meloni also defended the provision on the board list  saying this month it would curb the practice of directors getting re-appointed indefinitely with little regard to shareholders.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?Government representatives have said Rome will not backtrack on either of the disputed measures.However  political sources told Reuters that Meloni's administration could revisit the rule on the board slate later this year  as it plans a new set of measures to boost Italy's financial markets.Such a U-turn has a precedent as Italy last year shocked investors with a windfall bank tax which it later effectively neutered.($1 = 0.9183 euros)",neutral,0.03,0.72,0.25,mixed,0.07,0.26,0.66,True,English,"['capital markets bill', 'Explainer', 'Italy', 'Reuters', 'Generali Chief Excutive Philippe Donnet', 'Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni', 'businessman Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone', 'minority shareholders veto powers', 'Milan stock exchange building', 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'windfall bank tax', 'corporate governance rules', 'broader financial crisis', 'leading Italian companies', 'large listed groups', 'large foreign funds', 'voting rights enhancements', '10 times voting rights', 'investment funds', 'foreign investments', 'Milan bourse', 'new rules', 'financial industry', 'financial markets', 'leading investors', 'FILE PHOTO', 'first hours', 'Claudia Greco', 'Giuseppe Fonte', 'Valentina Za', 'mounting criticism', 'capital markets', 'listed companies', 'EQUITY MARKET', 'overall capitalisation', '2023 year-end data', 'three exchanges', 'Borsa Italiana', 'recent years', 'other markets', 'listing process', 'medium-sized enterprises', 'established shareholders', 'tight grip', 'asset managers', 'one share', 'one vote', 'BOARD RENEWALS', 'bigger say', 'outgoing board', 'next term', 'second vote', 'board lists', 'major hurdle', 'GOVERNMENT PLAY', 'business owners', 'cabinet office', 'ruling parties', 'aggressive approach', 'up to', 'little regard', 'political sources', 'board slate', 'new set', '762 billion euros', 'trillion euros', 'prominent companies', 'insurer Generali', 'Watchlist MDIBY', 'Watchlist MDBI', 'longstanding investors', 'professional investors', 'parliamentary amendment', 'board candidates', 'individual candidates', 'new provision', 'Government representatives', 'government bill', '0.9183 euros', 'Reuters', 'view', 'stocks', 'trading', 'fears', 'collapse', 'Italy', 'GASI', 'ROME', 'country', 'measures', 'influence', 'concerns', 'legislation', 'February', 'HOW', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'Euronext', 'April', 'newcomers', 'string', 'buyouts', 'package', 'range', 'firms', 'incentives', 'shares', 'relocations', 'Netherlands', 'proposal', 'concentration', 'hands', 'SNAG', 'Lawmakers', 'conditions', 'company', 'practice', 'BIT', 'banks', 'UniCredit', 'Mediobanca', 'OTC', 'approval', 'two-thirds', 'directors', 'critics', 'headhunters', 'nominees', 'PICTURE', 'November', 'bylaws', 'ROLE', 'Treasury', 'goal', 'control', 'possibility', 'administration', 'U-turn', 'precedent', '©']",2024-01-24,2024-01-25,investing.com

For reasons of consistency  the data reported for 2022 and for the first nine months of 2023 has been restated to account for the impact of High Connexion Italy.

Given this context  the Group’s gross profit fell by 2.7% over the year. However  sound cost control enabled us to maintain high profitability and achieve a further rise in earnings in 2023.2024 is expected to be even more challenging due to the uncertainty surrounding Casino group  which is likely to have a significant negative impact on performance over the financial year. Through the strength of its teams  HighCo will nevertheless be able to build on its strongest and most successful activities  and on its solid financial position to pursue its development.”BUSINESS SLOWDOWN IN Q4 2023 AS ANTICIPATEDAs announced last October  HighCo recorded a slowdown in its business in Q4 2023 with gross profit of €17.82 m (down 10.4% LFL). This decrease in Q4 is primarily due to the sharp decline in marketing and communication consulting businesses and in multi-retailer ad selling.In these conditions  the Group’s businesses were down 2.7% in 2023 to €74.35 m  with:Growth in the volumes of coupons cleared (up 4%) thanks to the strong growth of this business in France at the end of the year;(up 4%) thanks to the strong growth of this business in France at the end of the year; A slight slowdown in Mobile businesses (down 1.5% like for like);businesses (down 1.5% like for like); Businesses holding up well in Belgium (down 0.9% like for like);(down 0.9% like for like); Sharp decline in marketing and communication consulting businesses and in multi-retailer ad selling.Digital showed 1.2% growth for the full year 2023. Its share in total Group gross profit continued to grow  rising from 67% in 2022 (reported) to 69.3% in 2023.

This decrease is mainly due to the sharp decline in marketing and communication consulting businesses and in multi-retailer ad selling  which was partly offset by the strong performance of coupon clearing at the end of the year.Digital businesses were down slightly by 0.9% in Q4 2023. Offline businesses posted a sharp decline over the quarter (down 34.4%).Business fell by 3% for the full year 2023  with France accounting for 87.8% of the Group’s gross profit. Digital businesses were on a positive trend  rising 1.8% over the financial year  and their share increased significantly to 70.8% of gross profit. Accounting for one-quarter of business activities in France  Mobile has tapered slightly since the beginning of the year (down 1.5%) against a challenging 2022 comparative base (double-digit growth in 2022).

Down 3.6% like for like  the share of Digital in International businesses represented 58.7% of gross profit.Business in Spain was positive (up 2.8% like for like) and now accounts for 1.2% of the Group’s gross profit  following the discontinuation of operations in Italy (see below).Discontinuation of High Connexion activities in Italy (Mobile)After losing the main Mobile client in Italy  HighCo decided to discontinue its operations in the country and redeploy its international SMS push notifications activities directly from France  where HighCo intends to consolidate its position as leader in SMS solutions (nearly 1.4 bn SMS sent in 2023).As these operations in Italy were discontinued  its subsidiary  which generated €0.57 m in gross profit in 2022 and employed two people  was deconsolidated (IFRS 5 – Discontinued Operations).GROWTH IN 2023 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEBased on the year-end closing in progress  very sound cost control resulted in a further increase in headline PBIT (reported 2022 headline PBIT: €16.22 m). Consequently  the Group forecasts an operating margin of 22.1%  up by more than 100 basis points (reported 2022 operating margin: 21%).Adjusted earnings per share is expected to show double-digit growth (reported adjusted 2022 EPS: €0.45).2023 annual earnings will be released on 27 March after market close. A conference call is scheduled for Thursday  28 March at 10.00 a.m.CASINO: UNCERTAIN CONTEXT IN 2024As announced last July  HighCo is carefully watching to see how the situation will play out with its long-standing client Casino.To date  the Group does not have any information on Casino other than news available from the press: reshuffled share ownership structure  restructured debt  and sales of Casino supermarkets and hypermarkets.Despite the existing contracts between HighCo and Casino  the announced sales of all the food retailer’s supermarkets and hypermarkets could have a significant negative impact on the Group’s business in 2024. However  this impact cannot be measured at this stage.Under these circumstances  performance in recent years cannot be extrapolated to 2024. The uncertainty associated with Casino group’s current situation therefore calls for caution. HighCo is nevertheless maintaining its focus on its innovation strategy and continues to develop growth drivers. The Group can also build on its strongest and most successful activities (in particular promotion issuing and clearing  Mobile) and on its solid financial position.STOCK MARKETS: HIGHCO REMAINS ELIGIBLE FOR FRANCE’S SME EQUITY SAVINGS PLANSIn line with regulations (France’s Action Plan for Business Growth and Transformation  or PACTE  of 22 May 2019)  HighCo remains eligible for France’s government initiative supporting SME equity savings plans (“PEA-PME”).

For reasons of consistency  the data reported for 2022 and for the first nine months of 2023 has been restated to account for the impact of High Connexion Italy.

Given this context  the Group’s gross profit fell by 2.7% over the year. However  sound cost control enabled us to maintain high profitability and achieve a further rise in earnings in 2023.2024 is expected to be even more challenging due to the uncertainty surrounding Casino group  which is likely to have a significant negative impact on performance over the financial year. Through the strength of its teams  HighCo will nevertheless be able to build on its strongest and most successful activities  and on its solid financial position to pursue its development.”BUSINESS SLOWDOWN IN Q4 2023 AS ANTICIPATEDAs announced last October  HighCo recorded a slowdown in its business in Q4 2023 with gross profit of €17.82 m (down 10.4% LFL). This decrease in Q4 is primarily due to the sharp decline in marketing and communication consulting businesses and in multi-retailer ad selling.In these conditions  the Group’s businesses were down 2.7% in 2023 to €74.35 m  with:Growth in the volumes of coupons cleared (up 4%) thanks to the strong growth of this business in France at the end of the year;(up 4%) thanks to the strong growth of this business in France at the end of the year; A slight slowdown in Mobile businesses (down 1.5% like for like);businesses (down 1.5% like for like); Businesses holding up well in Belgium (down 0.9% like for like);(down 0.9% like for like); Sharp decline in marketing and communication consulting businesses and in multi-retailer ad selling.Digital showed 1.2% growth for the full year 2023.

This decrease is mainly due to the sharp decline in marketing and communication consulting businesses and in multi-retailer ad selling  which was partly offset by the strong performance of coupon clearing at the end of the year.Digital businesses were down slightly by 0.9% in Q4 2023. Offline businesses posted a sharp decline over the quarter (down 34.4%).Business fell by 3% for the full year 2023  with France accounting for 87.8% of the Group’s gross profit. Digital businesses were on a positive trend  rising 1.8% over the financial year  and their share increased significantly to 70.8% of gross profit. Accounting for one-quarter of business activities in France  Mobile has tapered slightly since the beginning of the year (down 1.5%) against a challenging 2022 comparative base (double-digit growth in 2022).

Down 3.6% like for like  the share of Digital in International businesses represented 58.7% of gross profit.Business in Spain was positive (up 2.8% like for like) and now accounts for 1.2% of the Group’s gross profit  following the discontinuation of operations in Italy (see below).Discontinuation of High Connexion activities in Italy (Mobile)After losing the main Mobile client in Italy  HighCo decided to discontinue its operations in the country and redeploy its international SMS push notifications activities directly from France  where HighCo intends to consolidate its position as leader in SMS solutions (nearly 1.4 bn SMS sent in 2023).As these operations in Italy were discontinued  its subsidiary  which generated €0.57 m in gross profit in 2022 and employed two people  was deconsolidated (IFRS 5 – Discontinued Operations).GROWTH IN 2023 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEBased on the year-end closing in progress  very sound cost control resulted in a further increase in headline PBIT (reported 2022 headline PBIT: €16.22 m). Consequently  the Group forecasts an operating margin of 22.1%  up by more than 100 basis points (reported 2022 operating margin: 21%).Adjusted earnings per share is expected to show double-digit growth (reported adjusted 2022 EPS: €0.45).2023 annual earnings will be released on 27 March after market close. A conference call is scheduled for Thursday  28 March at 10.00 a.m.CASINO: UNCERTAIN CONTEXT IN 2024As announced last July  HighCo is carefully watching to see how the situation will play out with its long-standing client Casino.To date  the Group does not have any information on Casino other than news available from the press: reshuffled share ownership structure  restructured debt  and sales of Casino supermarkets and hypermarkets.Despite the existing contracts between HighCo and Casino  the announced sales of all the food retailer’s supermarkets and hypermarkets could have a significant negative impact on the Group’s business in 2024. However  this impact cannot be measured at this stage.Under these circumstances  performance in recent years cannot be extrapolated to 2024. The uncertainty associated with Casino group’s current situation therefore calls for caution. HighCo is nevertheless maintaining its focus on its innovation strategy and continues to develop growth drivers. The Group can also build on its strongest and most successful activities (in particular promotion issuing and clearing  Mobile) and on its solid financial position.STOCK MARKETS: HIGHCO REMAINS ELIGIBLE FOR FRANCE’S SME EQUITY SAVINGS PLANSIn line with regulations (France’s Action Plan for Business Growth and Transformation  or PACTE  of 22 May 2019)  HighCo remains eligible for France’s government initiative supporting SME equity savings plans (“PEA-PME”).

This momentum is expected to continue in 2024  and will be reinforced by the gradual ramp-up of recent contracts signed in Germany.Revenue by regionIn France  revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was €106.3 million compared to €107.3 million a year earlier  representing a slight decline of 0.9% (-2.9% organic growth).Connectivity Solutions generated revenue of €73.1 million  down 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. As announced  the traditional back-to-school peak in revenue occurred during the months of September and October  slightly penalizing the fourth quarter.Revenue from Energy Solutions amounted to €17.5 million  up 49% (+31% organic growth). This performance was driven by strong organic growth in the solar business and the integration of Elec ENR.Finally  Technology Solutions posted revenue of €15.7 million  down 16% during the quarter as the group’s main French customers reduced IT spending.France continues to implement its action plan to return to sustainable  profitable growth. As previously indicated  this involves developing technicians’ skill sets to be more cross-functional for the group’s various activities  standardizing and optimizing processes and IT tools  and reducing central costs and overheads.Over the course of the year  revenue in France reached €404.1 million  down 5.1% (-6.0% organic growth).In the Benelux  revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 amounted to €111.7 million compared to €69.7 million a year earlier  representing organic growth of 60.2%. The EBITDA margin  temporarily impacted by very strong growth in the first half of the year  continued its recovery in the last quarter  in line with expectations.Connectivity Solutions generated revenue of €90.2 million in the last quarter of 2023  up 71%. This performance reflects continued strong growth in fiber optics  as a result of contracts signed in 2021 and starting up in 2022.Revenue from Energy Solutions was €16.1 million  up 29%. Smart meter deployments in Flanders continue  while activities related to the energy transition—especially for electric mobility  renewable energy  and smart grids—are expanding.Finally  Technology Solutions maintained its momentum  posting revenue of €5.4 million  up 21%.During 2023 as a whole  revenue from the Benelux countries amounted to €381.3 million  compared to €221.9 million one year earlier  representing organic growth of 71.9%.The Benelux now accounts for 36% of consolidated revenue  surpassing France in the last quarter of 2023 to become the group’s largest region by revenue.In other countries  fourth-quarter revenue for 2023 amounted to €67.7 million  down 4.2% compared to €70.7 million for the same period last year.In Germany  revenue reached €17 million  up 6% compared to the last quarter of 2022. This quarter marked the fruition of months-long sales efforts  culminating in the signature of major contracts within the country. These commercial successes will bolster Solutions30’s standing in the fiber space  playing a crucial role in the company’s strategy  especially since this sector holds the most significant potential for the group’s growth. Germany is the group’s new growth driver  after the Benelux.In Italy  revenue amounted to €13.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023  down 31%. Solutions30 has been slowing down the pace of call-outs to deploy fiber while these customers continue to review their operational strategies. This led to a fall in revenue whereas margins have improved.On the Iberian Peninsula  revenue amounted to €13.0 million  down 15%. The group remains committed to concentrating on its most profitable ventures  especially in the energy sector due to its substantial potential.In Poland  revenue amounted to €14.2 million  up 28%. The group is consolidating its position in this country and gaining market share.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions30’s quarterly revenue was up 17% to €10.0 million. The strategic shift towards FTTH deployments is beginning to show results  evidenced by the increasing revenue from contracts secured in this sector.In all these countries  the group posted 2023 revenue of €270.1 million  an increase of 5.2% compared to the same period in 2022.OutlookIn 2024  Solutions30 anticipates strong revenue growth and further improvement in margins  moving closer to its medium-term objective of double-digit EBITDA margins in every country.To achieve this objective  and as detailed in the December 13th webinar  the group intends to optimize both direct and fixed costs by prioritizing actions according to each country and their issues. In France and the Benelux  the group is consolidating its processes to boost productivity and is continuing to diversify its activities. In the fast-growing markets of Germany  Poland  and the United Kingdom  achieving critical mass is a priority  building on the core of the Solutions30 model—namely developing technicians’ skill sets  automating processes  and keeping central costs under control. In Italy and Spain  the group is refocusing on its most profitable contracts  while maintaining a flexible cost structure.While the group embarks on a new phase of profitable growth  its funding strategy remains based on self-financing and prudent debt management  ensuring financial flexibility and independence. In addition  the actions carried out in the second half of the year have optimized the group’s working capital requirements and improved its financial position at the end of the year.By sticking to this non-dilutive financing approach  Solutions30 is implementing an optimized operational strategy focused on penetrating profitable markets with significant growth potential and maximizing the creation of shareholder value.Upcoming event2023 Earnings Report April 3  2024About Solutions30 SESolutions30 provides consumers and businesses with access to the key technological advancements that are shaping our everyday lives  especially those driving the digital transformation and energy transition.

It follows former fellow corporate finance director Stephen Kane deciding to leave Goodbody in October to become director of corporate finance at housebuilder Cairn Homes.David Kearney  the company’s former head of corporate broking  also left the company late last year  after 18 years.READ MORESeparately  Colm Ryan  who had headed up Goodbody’s fixed income – or bond desk – and was a key player in the firm being named last June as a primary dealer for Irish Government bonds  left the company just before Christmas.Mr Ryan’s departure  however  was a delayed one under the voluntary redundancy plan announced in early October. Garret Grogan  a former global head of trading at Bank of Ireland who joined Goodbody two years ago  has been named as Mr Ryan’s successor  sources said.The firm missed out on being named as one of the international banks and securities firms hired earlier this month to sell €3 billion of bonds for the Government.Goodbody  which has been led by chief executive Martin Tormey since it was bought by AIB two years ago  told staff last October not to expect bonuses for a second straight year under the bank’s ownership.The warning came weeks after the firm moved to cut about 20 of then 100 investment banking unit jobs  amid actual and planned stock market exits and a dearth of stock market flotations.CRH  traditionally the largest company on the Iseq  quit Euronext Dublin in September as it moved its main listing from London to New York. Paddy Power’s parent company  Flutter Entertainment  is on track to follow suit next Monday. Smurfit Kappa  another Iseq bellwether  also plans to exit the Irish market this year and move its main listing to Wall Street as part of a planned merger with US peer WestRock.Goodbody revealed in November that it had swung to a loss of €15.8 million in 2022 as fee income slumped amid weak equity markets and money made from its own securities trading book also slid. It made a profit of €3.2 million in the previous year.The company had about 350 employees before the targeted job cuts and subsequent senior exits. However  it also acquired Clearstream Solutions  an environmental  social and governance consultancy that has 15 employees  in October.AIB sold Goodbody in 2011 to Kerry-based financial services group Fexco and the firm’s management team as it offloaded what were seen as noncore assets in the wake of the bank’s government bailout.

Thanks to the strong commitment of its teams and the antifragile business model developed since the Group's inception 22 years ago  it has once again been able to react quickly to market changes and benefit from shifts in its environment.In the first quarter of 2024  Aramis Group achieved double-digit growth in almost all its geographies  a performance much higher than the market overall. Besides the continued rebound of the pre-registered vehicle segment  the good management of our competitive advantages in the refurbished vehicle segment is generating market share gains. In particular  we have capitalized on our significant multichannel supply network and our on-the-ground proximity to seize opportunities with professionals and satisfy an ever-increasing number of customers through our offering of quality vehicles at the right price.In the coming months  we will maintain our commercial efforts  control of our margins  costs  and inventory  in order to fuel our market share conquest in a responsible and sustainable manner. We also note encouraging signs in recent market dynamics.

Aramis Group sold 26 442 B2C vehicles during the period  a growth of +31.9% compared to last year  and an outperformance of 31 points4 compared to the market for used vehicles less than 8 years old  which is the Group's core target.In detail  revenues for the refurbished car segment amounts to €360.5 million  growing by +14.7% compared to the first quarter of 2023. 20 817 vehicles were delivered  marking a progression of +18.0%.Volumes are positively oriented across all geographies  except in Spain. This performance is undoubtedly the result of our ability to identify and seize market opportunities  through a unique business model  committed teams  and technology dedicated to satisfying our customers.However  activity in Spain remains behind. Clicars  the Spanish subsidiary of the Group  after 6 years of exponential growth  continues its transition. Since last summer  the company has been particularly focused on establishing a reasoned territorial presence in Spain  shifting its mix towards more accessible vehicles  and improving the refurbishing processes at its Villaverde center. A return to a growth trajectory is expected for the second half of 2024As for the average selling price of refurbished vehicles  it is slightly down (c. -3%)  reflecting both mix effects and the impact of the erosion of selling prices in the used vehicle market in general. The decline of the latter has notably accelerated in the United Kingdom since September.Revenues for the pre-registered car segment amount to €100.0 million  more than doubling (+107.4%) compared to the first quarter of 2023. 5 625 vehicles were delivered  representing a significant increase of +134.2%. The French (Aramisauto) and Belgian (Cardoen) subsidiaries of the Group have been particularly agile in fully benefiting from the recovery of this market segment.The evolution of the average selling price of pre-registered vehicles is mainly due to mix effects.B2B – sales of cars to professional customers (8% of revenues)The B2B segment revenues amount to €39.6 million  a decrease of -24.7% compared to the first quarter of 2023  mainly due to a change in the supply mix. The sourcing of used vehicles from private individuals - a portion of which is resold to professionals  mostly vehicles over 8 years old or more than 150 000 km - was less frequent during the period. Conversely  sourcing of used vehicles from Stellantis doubled compared to the first quarter of 2023  returning to levels close to those reached pre-crisis. Moreover  the return to a more usual functioning of the automotive market  particularly through the improvement in the availability of recent used vehicles via professional channels  has led Aramis Group to evolve its sourcing mix to ensure an ever more attractive offer of quality vehicles at competitive prices for its customers.Services (5% of revenues)Services  finally  generated revenues of 26.9 million euros  an increase of +10.9% compared to the first quarter of 2023. The contribution from financing solutions tends to erode in a context of higher interest rates.OUTLOOKAramis Group is observing encouraging signs in market dynamics.Although still well below pre-crisis levels (c. -19%5 compared to the first quarter of 2019)  the used car market has regained a positive orientation in the period between October and December 2023 (first fiscal quarter of 2024 for Aramis Group)  showing a +1% increase compared to the same period in 2022. Furthermore  its way of operating is tending to return to a more usual pattern  with new car production exceeding demand leading to pre-registrations  and increased availability of recent used cars.Moreover  the selling prices of used vehicles have been trending downwards for several quarters now  with an acceleration noted in the United Kingdom in recent months. Although household budgets remain exposed to macroeconomic uncertainties  the downward price trend is likely to support future demand.In this context  Aramis Group is approaching 2024 with confidence. The Group reiterates its objectives for the current fiscal year  namely to generate:at constant scope  B2C vehicle sales volumes of at least 100 000 units;an adjusted EBITDA at least twice that achieved in 2023***Next financial information:2024 first-half results: May 27  2024 (after market close)About Aramis Group – www.aramis.groupAramis Group is the European leader for B2C online used car sales and operates in six countries.

With a +30% top-line CAGR over the last ten years  VusionGroup ranks among the leading growth companies and is a European tech flagship. The keys to this sustainable momentum are: cutting-edge R&D innovation  addressing the very significant modernization needs of commerce; a strong position in the European market; a winning strategy in the United States  the world's #1 economy; rigorous management; and a motivated team whose members have an equity stake in the company. At the most recent National Retail Federation (NRF) big show in New York  we unveiled major innovations across all our families of products. We also launched our new brand identity  bringing our IoT  AI and data analytics solutions under one platform. VusionGroup embodies our vision  bringing together physical stores and digital solutions at the service of commerce and of consumers. We begin 2024 with enthusiasm  and compelling prospects for growth.”Nota Bene: For the sake of comparability  the sales figures commented below correspond to restated sales1 (see details at the end of the press release).Record Q4  second half  and full-year 2023 salesAs expected  the year's fourth quarter produced VusionGroup's highest-ever quarterly sales with top-line reaching €241.9m in restated terms1  an increase of +58% versus Q4 2022. This growth was fueled by a strong order book  particularly in the United States.The second half of the year sales also reached a record level of €424m  equivalent to +27% growth on restated sales1.Full-year 2023 restated sales1 grew +29.7% to €805.1m.Restated sales by region1€m (unaudited) EMEA Rest of World Total H1 2023 317.7 62.9 380.7 H1 2022 221.3 64.6 285.9 Change (in %) +43.6% -2.6% +33.2% Q3 2023 156.2 26.4 182.5 Q3 2022 138.3 43.5 181.8 Change (in %) +12.9% -39.4% +0.4% Q4 2023 168.0 73.9 241.9 Q4 2022 127.1 26.1 153.2 Change (in %) +32.1% +183.4% +57.9% H2 2023 324.2 100.3 424.4 H2 2022 265.4 69.6 335.0 Change (in %) +22.1% +44.1% +26.7% FY Sales 2023 641.9 163.2 805.1 FY Sales 2022 486.7 134.2 620.9 Change (in %) +31.9% +21.6% +29.7%Order entriesThanks to a strong momentum in Q4  order entries for the 12 months of 2023 totaled €950m  a +39% increase compared to 2022. This level of order entries underscores the prospects for on-going strong top-line growth in 2024.Order entries (€m) 2023 2022 % change Q4 240 138 +74% 12-month rolling 950 685 +39%Sales momentum by regionRevenue in the EMEA region (Europe  Middle East  Africa) totaled €168.0m in Q4 2023  for year-on-year growth of +32.1%. For the full year  EMEA sales increased +31.9%. Full-year 2023 sales in EMEA were driven by growth across all of Europe.Fourth quarter 2023 restated sales1 in the Americas and Asia-Pacific region (Rest of World) spiked +183.4% to €73.9m  largely driven by the United States  and the first deliveries to fulfill the Walmart US contract. Restated sales1 in 2023 for the Americas and Asia-Pacific of €163.2m represented +21.6% growth compared to the previous year. This growth is expected to accelerate strongly in 2024.Software  Services and Non-ESL Solutions (VAS)VAS sales totaled €109.1m in 2023  a +17% increase over the €93.3m recorded in 2022. However  this top-line growth momentum is not the same across all VAS business lines. The growth of recurring VAS revenue was strong in 2023  while non-recurring revenue slightly decreased during the same period.Recurring VAS revenue includes sales of subscriptions to VusionCloud  Computer Vision based SaaS applications (Captana and Belive)  as well as Data Analytics SaaS applications (MarketHub and Memory)  and revenue from recurring services contracts. The recurring VAS revenue experienced higher-than-Group growth in 2023 at €42m  and already accounts for more than 39% of total VAS sales.Non-recurring VAS includes revenue from installation services  and non-recurring professional services; hardware such as Captana cameras  Engage video displays and screens  as well as industrial and logistics solutions (PDidigital). The non-recurring VAS revenue slightly decreased in 2023 due to the global economic context and reached €67m (61% of total VAS sales).OutlookIn 2024  VusionGroup anticipates ongoing solid growth  fueled by a strong order book  and anticipates crossing the €1 billion milestone in restated sales1 in 2024.Starting from Q2  growth will be mainly driven by the acceleration of sales in the US due to the Walmart US contract and the launch of new production lines in Mexico. Several other customers will continue their rollouts in the region  propelling the U.S. ahead of Germany as VusionGroup's leading country in terms of sales in 2024.The strong recurring VAS revenue momentum should also continue  along with the continuous improvement in profitability.As 2024 begins  the Group looks with confidence to continuing to achieve its Vusion-27 growth trajectory.Note on IFRS Restatements regarding the new Walmart US contractTwo IFRS restatements related to the revenue generated by the Walmart US contract had a -€3.7m negative impact on the FY 2023 revenue line  as follows:The decrease impact to revenue of the fair value of the warrants granted to Walmart  prorated by the total forecast sales generated by the Walmart contract: the reduced revenue impact is conventional as the warrants will only have a potential dilutive effect  which was modeled and communicated during the allocation of the warrants early June 2023. This does not impact the actual sales invoiced to Walmart. This restatement has no impact on the Group's cash flow. It impacts revenue in 2023 by -€2m  and all of the Group's income statement lines  in the same proportions. This negative impact to the Group's IFRS accounts will continue until the end of the Walmart contract  in direct proportion to the sales generated by this contract. The impact of future volume-based price reductions agreed upon with Walmart from the first deliveries of electronic shelf labels (ESLs): The cost of the Group's hardware solutions is a function of the volume produced. A significant increase in volume might thus lead to lower cost. Therefore  it has been agreed with this customer that they will be granted price reductions in relation to the future sales volume to which they contribute. The IFRS standards (IFRS 15) require prices to be averaged over the life of the contract. The application of this restatement shows revenue in 2023 that is lower than the sales actually invoiced to Walmart  and has a -€1.7m negative impact on revenue and on margin  even though price reductions will only be granted if and when volumes have reached certain thresholds. The application of this standard has a negative impact on revenue and all income statement lines  through to net profit.About VusionGroupVusionGroup (ex- SES-imagotag) is the global leader in providing digitalization solutions for commerce  serving over 350 large retailer groups around the world in Europe  Asia and North America.

I am particularly pleased with the U.S. performance  where we saw  once again  improved operational efficiency and sales force productivity as well as 10% organic sales growth on a constant currency basis. Likewise  in Asia  our team is working actively with our partners at Tasly to operationalize our Joint Venture  which we expect will deliver initial Cellvizio orders for the Chinese domestic market from 2024 onwards. Finally  our R&D team continues to enhance the capabilities and clinical effectiveness of Cellvizio  including advancing AI and wireless connectivity solutions. With a building pipeline of potential new development partners and the ongoing support of the global clinical community  I am excited for what we can accomplish in the year ahead.""2023 HighlightsSuccessful Shift in U.S. OperationsIn 2023  sales efforts focused on high volume Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs) with our Pay-Per-Use (PPU) program which represented 63% of Q4 sales. This model offers greater stability and more consistent recurring revenue  enables access to a high volume of patients  and generates significant operational leverage as system usage increases.Throughout the year  PPU growth accelerated significantly  culminating to year-on-year growth of +109%1 in Q4 2023 and a +52%1 rise from Q3 2023. This growth trajectory is primarily attributed to the high satisfaction rates among physicians using Cellvizio leading to increased adoption among existing accounts and the onboarding of 11 new accounts over the year.Q1 2022 Q2 2022 Q3 2022 Q4 2022 Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Volume of PPU procedures 678 686 613 589 693 1 013 899 1 361Enhanced Operational Leverage Through U.S. Sales GrowthIn 2023  the United States solidified its position as the 1st market  accounting for 72% of total sales  marking a significant increase of 16 percentage points from the previous year. This shift has yielded substantial operational leverage and has particularly improved the Group's profitability profile due to the region's high gross margin.This solid performance was accomplished with a sales force that was reduced by half compared with 2021  reflecting a notable increase in productivity and profitability.Initial Contributions and Operational Launch of the Tasly Joint VentureIn 2023  the Group recorded revenues of $4.7 million (€4.3 million)  including upfront fees of $6.5 million (€6.2 million) spread over 3 years and a technology transfer milestone of $2.5 million (€2.3 million).The year was pivotal in laying the groundwork for the operational launch of the JV  setting up the JV structure  recruiting the leadership and sales teams  and acquiring the necessary business licenses for the marketing of Cellvizio.Strategic Investment from Telix Pharmaceuticals in Mauna Kea Paving the Way for Long-Term CollaborationAt the end of 2023  Telix Pharmaceuticals made a strategic €6.0 million investment in Mauna Kea  reflecting an expansion of their existing alliance in uro-oncologic surgery. The shared vision between the groups is to develop new hybrid pharmaceutical-device products through the combination of Telix's cancer-targeting agents with the Cellvizio platform in order to provide uro-oncologic surgeons with enhanced tools for patient care.This investment marks a significant milestone for Mauna Kea  underscoring the attractiveness and strategic importance of the Cellvizio technology for key players such as Telix. It signals the beginning of a more integrated collaboration between the two entities  aimed at combining the advanced technologies of both groups for the contemplated therapeutic area.Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2023 Sales by Category(in €k) - IFRS Q4 2023 Q4 2022 Change FY 2023 FY 2022 Change % % CER % % CER Systems 83 1 351 -94% -94% 1 171 2 979 -61% -60% Consumables 1 344 964 +39% +42% 3 900 3 131 +25% +28% Services 222 338 -34% -34% 1 134 1 370 -17% -17% License fees 498 - n.a. n.a. 4 299 - n.a. n.a.

Finally  service sales were impacted by a decrease in billing to our partner Johnson & Johnson with the completion of CLEAR Study enrollment.For the year 2023  total sales increased by +42%1 to €10.5 million  reflecting the increase in consumable sales and the recognition of the first €4.3 million of revenues related to the Tasly JV.Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2023 Sales by Geography(in €k) - IFRS Q4 2023 Q4 2022 Change FY 2023 FY 2022 Change % % CER % % CER United States 1 136 1 150 -1% +1% 4 480 4 202 +7% +10% EMEA & ROW 500 1 525 -67% -67% 1 622 2 875 -44% -44% Asia Pacific 512 (22) n.a. n.a. 4 402 402 +995% +995% Total sales 2 147 2 653 -19% -18% 10 504 7 479 +40% +42%In the U.S. sales were up +1%1 despite the lack of system sales  which are typically much harder to predict. These sales  initially anticipated by the end of the year  have been postponed to 2024. However  this shortfall was completely offset by an impressive 109%1 rise in PPU revenue.On the contrary  Europe and the RoW faced a demanding comparison with the previous year's exceptional quarter  which included the sale of 10 systems in Latin America. In Asia Pacific  sales were positively impacted by the recognition of the payments received from the Tasly JV.For the year 2023  growth was mainly driven by the U.S. and the contribution from the Tasly JV.Fourth Quarter 2023 Sales in UnitUnits (#) Q4 2023 Q4 2022 Change New systems sold* 2 11 -9 New systems placed** 5 1 +4 Total systems 7 12 -5 Consumables delivered 109 151 -42* The change in the number of new systems sold over the period may differ from that in reported sales  due to inventory adjustments and product mix variation** The reference date is the contract signature date  which may differ from the system installation date***About Mauna Kea TechnologiesMauna Kea Technologies is a global medical device company that manufactures and sells Cellvizio®  the real-time in vivo cellular imaging platform.
