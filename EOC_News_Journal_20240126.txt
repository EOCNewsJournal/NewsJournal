""This power must be used wisely  however  because international relations are part of a ‘repeated game'.""Europe should still help pay for Ukraine's war effort  ECB policymaker Martins Kazaks said separately and argued that the political decision on how to fund that should not be based on the fate of European assets stranded in Russia.""Forget about the assets stranded in Russia "" Kazak  Latvia's central bank governor said  arguing that Europe will likely never recover these.""I think that hopes that very soon we will be back to the old normal is an illusion "" he told a conference. ""We must stop helping Russia wage this war by still trading directly or indirectly.""The EU  United States  Japan and Canada froze some $300 billion of Russian central bank assets in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. Some $200 billion of that is held in Europe  mainly in the Belgian clearing house Euroclear.Opponents argue that seizing assets could prompt investors from other countries to flee  fearing for the safety of their own investments  ultimately weakening the currency and pushing up yields.Panetta  a former ECB board member  argued that the conflict around Ukraine had led to an increase in the role of the Chinese renminbi at the expense of other currencies  since much of Russia's trade is now done in the Chinese currency.""The Chinese authorities are explicitly promoting its role on the global stage and encouraging its use in other countries  including those sanctioned by the international community following the invasion of Ukraine "" Panetta said.As a result  the renminbi overtook the euro as the second most used currency for trade finance and the yen as the fourth most used currency for global payments  Panetta said.Panetta instead argued that Europe should strengthen the euro by making it more attractive  implementing long-delayed changes that would enhance its role as a reserve currency.This includes the creation of a safe asset that is issued in sufficient  predictable quantities  and the completion of a banking union that would the reduce the difficulty of cross-border banking.Another step would be an efficient payment and market infrastructure system across the bloc  which could be helped by a digital central bank currency.",negative,0.03,0.2,0.77,mixed,0.1,0.28,0.62,True,English,"['ECB policymaker', 'Europe', 'influential European Central Bank policymaker', 'former ECB board member', 'ECB policymaker Martins Kazaks', 'digital central bank currency', 'Russian central bank assets', 'central bank reserves', 'central bank governor', 'Belgian clearing house', 'sufficient, predictable quantities', 'Russian state assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Governor Fabio Panetta', 'Business Business Europe', 'European assets', 'European officials', 'broader repercussions', 'international relations', 'repeated game', 'political decision', 'old normal', 'United States', 'other countries', 'other currencies', 'Chinese authorities', 'global stage', 'international community', 'global payments', 'long-delayed changes', 'safe asset', 'banking union', 'cross-border banking', 'efficient payment', 'infrastructure system', 'Chinese currency', 'reserve currency', 'global conflict', 'war effort', 'Chinese renminbi', 'trade finance', 'euro zone', 'Fri', 'Jan', 'PKT', 'RIGA', 'Reuters', 'months', 'cash', 'Ukraine', 'reconstruction', 'move', 'retaliation', 'loss', 'confidence', 'gain', 'attractiveness', 'emergence', 'alternatives', 'Italy', 'speech', 'power', 'part', 'fate', 'Latvia', 'illusion', 'conference', 'Japan', 'Canada', 'Euroclear', 'Opponents', 'investors', 'safety', 'investments', 'yields', 'increase', 'role', 'expense', 'invasion', 'result', 'second', 'yen', 'fourth', 'creation', 'completion', 'difficulty', 'step', 'market', 'bloc']",2024-01-26,2024-01-26,dunyanews.tv

Sales of products packaged by the Group rose by 1.9%.The Group's sales grew mainly in the Off-Trade in France and Travel Retail internationally  offsetting the contraction in demand in the EU.The export share remained stable at 65%  supported by good momentum in the UK  North America and Asia.Côtes de Provence and Sable de CamargueSales for the Wines division rose by 6.2% to €27.4 million. As expected  second-half sales rebounded strongly to +13.3%  given the carryover of sales to the first half.With the return to normal harvest yields  sales at Grands Domaines du Littoral returned to levels comparable to the pre-Covid period  and benefited from the good momentum of Sable de Camargue  which will become a PDO in the 2023 harvest.Ports and Douro WinesSales of Port and Douro wines rose slightly thanks to domestic consumption and growth in Northern Europe. The second half-year was thus very dynamic  after a first half-year in decline.Sparkling WinesSales rose by 9% for Sparkling Wines made in England and California under the Louis Pommery brand  and those made in Camargue  driven by the Benelux market.MiscellaneousThe zero-margin rebilling of dry materials carried out in 2022 has not been renewed in 2023  and explains the variation in ""other"" activities.Next communicationPublication of 2023 annual results : March 27  2024 after the close of tradingAbout Vranken-Pommery MonopoleVranken-Pommery Monopole manages 2 600 hectares of land  owned outright or under lease and spread over four vineyards in Champagne  Provence  Camargue and Douro.

This growth was driven by the strong sales performance of Distimp products and the consolidation of revenue from Spine Innovations  acquired in July 2022.Europe remains the Group’s leading commercial region (49% of revenue)  with 2023 revenue of €5.2 million  up 78% compared with the previous year  thanks to Distimp and Spine Innovations sales. These have strengthened the Group’s positions in France and Germany.Revenue in Asia amounted to €1.7 million for the year (+24% year on year) and was temporarily penalized by the problems of the Australian distributor of disc prostheses and the tightening of regulations (China and Vietnam). The approval in Indonesia of the VEOS1 range  designed for posterior approach intervertebral fixation  should contribute to revenue in 2024.In Latin America  full-year revenue amounted to €3.1 million in 2023  up 23% on the previous year. The Group expects to further strengthen its positions in the region  notably with the approval in 2023 of the ESP prostheses in Mexico and the VEOS range in Colombia. In addition  the granting of new approvals in 2024 will lead to further sales growth for the Distimp and Spine Innovations ranges.Spineway achieved a good sales performance in 2023  in a generally unfavorable environment  and also stepped up its investments (regulatory  R&D and marketing) to prepare for the coming years. These expenses will weigh on the annual financial statements but should contribute to future growth. Spineway confirms its aim of becoming an innovative player in France and internationally  leader in less invasive spine treatments.Next events : February 7  2024 – Annual results for 2023February 8  2024 – Videoconference with the group managementSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR PEA-SME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

Through 3 strategic bets – putting data and technology at the center with the acquisition of Sapient and Epsilon  implementing a country model  and building a single operational backbone – it has shifted from a holding company to a platform.That platform organization has allowed Publicis to outperform the market on both financial and extra-financial KPIs. But it also now uniquely positions the group to fully harness the power of AI  to become an Intelligent System company capable of connecting every data point  from across every expertise  business unit and geography  and putting them into the hands of all of its people.In short  thanks to the shift to an Intelligent System company  everyone within Publicis will become a data analyst  an engineer  an intelligence partner  with all the information they need at their fingertips to supercharge client growth.An ambition that is already a realityConcretely  Publicis is infusing a layer of AI across its platform organization to connect its enterprise knowledge under one entity: CoreAI.The group is building this unifying AI-led foundation in-house and across its full enterprise  thanks to Publicis Sapient’s unrivalled AI expertise and partnerships  which span designing chips for Nvidia that are used in the training of AI models like ChatGPT  to developing AI-powered digital consumer journeys across multiple industries.Sitting at the center of the group  CoreAI unifies all of Publicis’ proprietary data including the leading consumer data across 2.3 billion profiles of people around the world  with trillions of data points about content  media  and business performance  and almost a petabyte of assets on Marcel  all combined with 35 years of business transformation data and coding owned exclusively by Publicis Sapient.CoreAI makes those trillions of data points shareable and accessible to everyone at Publicis  super powering them across 5 key disciplines:Insight: Brilliant strategy  accurate analyses  and business consultant-level intelligence will power all marketing strategy and plans  transforming everyone into intelligence partners who architect client growth.Media: Media planning  buying and optimization will deliver new levels of accuracy and outcomes positioning clients to win at commerce sooner and faster.Creative + Production: Personalized content will finally be realized at scale  with efficiencies and highly relevant  desirable creative.Software: The best software and digitally enabled products will be brought to market at scale in days and weeks not months.Operations: Groupe operations and client management systems will be boosted with speed  accuracy and efficiency.Publicis plans to invest three hundred million euros over the next three years as it becomes a true Intelligent System. For 2024 alone  the group anticipates an investment of one hundred million euros  with 50% on people  focused on upskilling  training and recruitment  and 50% on technology  through licenses  IT software and cloud infrastructure.The group began engineering CoreAI in the second half of 2023 and plans to iteratively roll out capabilities in the first half of 2024. It will present MVPs at Viva Tech 2024 this upcoming May.*****Arthur Sadoun  CEO & Chairman of Publicis Groupe commented: “Our journey from a holding company to a platform has not been easy  but it definitely paid off  as you can see with our 2023 organic growth outperforming the industry for the fourth year in a row. The platform organization we have built over the last decade  our proprietary data of unmatched breadth and accuracy  and the 45 000 engineers  consultants and data analysts at the heart of our model  uniquely position us to push the boundaries even further by leveraging AI.Putting CoreAI at the heart of our organization and truly becoming an Intelligent System company will make our people more efficient and more productive. But way more importantly  it will allow everyone to do things tomorrow that no one can do today  guided by the highest ethical standards  and at the service of our clients’ growth.As we enter our second century  we are confident that all of the efforts we have made to transform and the ongoing investment we are making in our people and technology will allow Publicis to continue to outperform its peers on organic growth  sustain the highest financial KPIs  and lead the change in our industry.”*****About the financial impact of our AI PlanThe investment in AI of 100 million euros in 2024 will be fully funded by internal efficiencies. It will have no dilutive impact on Groupe’s Operating margin in 2024 and it will be slightly accretive on Operating margin in 2025.About 2023 Preliminary Full Year and Fourth Quarter Net Revenue (non audited)Publicis Groupe today pre-releases its Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 net revenue. Full details of the 2023 Audited Annual Results will be published on 8 February 2024  before the market opens.Full year organic growth came in at +6.3%  above the +5.5% to +6% guidance range last upgraded in October.This included a stronger than anticipated finish to the year  with +5.7% organic growth in the fourth quarter.Media  one third of net revenue  grew by double digits organically on the year  accelerating in Q4 supported by a faster ramp up in new business. Data & tech activities  another third  were very solid on the year while seeing contrasting trends. Epsilon recorded circa +10% organic growth in 2023  further accelerating in H2 with double-digit growth in Q4  led by the rise in demand for first-party data. As anticipated  Publicis Sapient saw ongoing delays in digital business transformation projects  like all comparable IT consulting firms  posting +3% organic growth on the year despite a modest decline in Q4. Creative was again very resilient in both the full year and Q4  with low single-digit organic growth.On a regional basis  the strength of our model was visible in all geographies in both the full year and in Q4.The U.S.  60% of revenue  delivered a remarkable +5.0% organic growth for the year  accelerating to +6.1% in Q4.

But it also now uniquely positions the group to fully harness the power of AI  to become an Intelligent System company capable of connecting every data point  from across every expertise  business unit and geography  and putting them into the hands of all of its people.In short  thanks to the shift to an Intelligent System company  everyone within Publicis will become a data analyst  an engineer  an intelligence partner  with all the information they need at their fingertips to supercharge client growth.An ambition that is already a realityConcretely  Publicis is infusing a layer of AI across its platform organization to connect its enterprise knowledge under one entity: CoreAI.The group is building this unifying AI-led foundation in-house and across its full enterprise  thanks to Publicis Sapient’s unrivalled AI expertise and partnerships  which span designing chips for Nvidia that are used in the training of AI models like ChatGPT  to developing AI-powered digital consumer journeys across multiple industries.Sitting at the center of the group  CoreAI unifies all of Publicis’ proprietary data including the leading consumer data across 2.3 billion profiles of people around the world  with trillions of data points about content  media  and business performance  and almost a petabyte of assets on Marcel  all combined with 35 years of business transformation data and coding owned exclusively by Publicis Sapient.CoreAI makes those trillions of data points shareable and accessible to everyone at Publicis  super powering them across 5 key disciplines:Insight: Brilliant strategy  accurate analyses  and business consultant-level intelligence will power all marketing strategy and plans  transforming everyone into intelligence partners who architect client growth.Media: Media planning  buying and optimization will deliver new levels of accuracy and outcomes positioning clients to win at commerce sooner and faster.Creative + Production: Personalized content will finally be realized at scale  with efficiencies and highly relevant  desirable creative.Software: The best software and digitally enabled products will be brought to market at scale in days and weeks not months.Operations: Groupe operations and client management systems will be boosted with speed  accuracy and efficiency.Publicis plans to invest three hundred million euros over the next three years as it becomes a true Intelligent System. For 2024 alone  the group anticipates an investment of one hundred million euros  with 50% on people  focused on upskilling  training and recruitment  and 50% on technology  through licenses  IT software and cloud infrastructure.The group began engineering CoreAI in the second half of 2023 and plans to iteratively roll out capabilities in the first half of 2024. It will present MVPs at Viva Tech 2024 this upcoming May.*****Arthur Sadoun  CEO & Chairman of Publicis Groupe commented: “Our journey from a holding company to a platform has not been easy  but it definitely paid off  as you can see with our 2023 organic growth outperforming the industry for the fourth year in a row. The platform organization we have built over the last decade  our proprietary data of unmatched breadth and accuracy  and the 45 000 engineers  consultants and data analysts at the heart of our model  uniquely position us to push the boundaries even further by leveraging AI.Putting CoreAI at the heart of our organization and truly becoming an Intelligent System company will make our people more efficient and more productive. But way more importantly  it will allow everyone to do things tomorrow that no one can do today  guided by the highest ethical standards  and at the service of our clients’ growth.As we enter our second century  we are confident that all of the efforts we have made to transform and the ongoing investment we are making in our people and technology will allow Publicis to continue to outperform its peers on organic growth  sustain the highest financial KPIs  and lead the change in our industry.”*****About the financial impact of our AI PlanThe investment in AI of 100 million euros in 2024 will be fully funded by internal efficiencies. It will have no dilutive impact on Groupe’s Operating margin in 2024 and it will be slightly accretive on Operating margin in 2025.About 2023 Preliminary Full Year and Fourth Quarter Net Revenue (non audited)Publicis Groupe today pre-releases its Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 net revenue.

This strong growth was driven by higher-than-expected digital revenue growth during this year-end period of high demand and by our transport business which was back to pre-Covid revenue level outside China.Digital Out of Home (DOOH) grew by +20.5% in Q4 2023  +22.9% on an organic basis  and by +20.8% in full-year 2023  +22.7% on an organic basis  to reach a record of 38.2% of Group revenue in Q4 and of 35.3% of Group revenue in full-year 2023  while analogue advertising revenue also grew in 2023 despite the conversion of some analogue sites to digital. We maintained our focus on the selective roll-out of digital screens in prime locations  as well as on the development of our data and programmatic capabilities.Programmatic advertising revenues through the VIOOH SSP (supply-side platform)  which constitute mostly incremental revenue from innovative dynamic data-driven campaigns and new advertisers grew by +63.5% in 2023 to reach €100.2 million i.e. 8.0% of our digital revenue in 2023. The DOOH programmatic ecosystem continued to gain traction  with the dynamism and the growing number of DSPs (demand-side platforms) connected to VIOOH (the most connected SSP of the OOH media industry with 42 DSPs connected) now active in 22 countries  including Displayce a DSP connected in 53 countries.All activities grew positively organically in Q4 2023. Street Furniture delivered a solid organic revenue growth of +6.7% driven by digital and a continued high demand from advertisers. Transport's organic revenue growth reached +20.0%  back to pre-COVID level outside of China  aligning with the global airport passenger traffic recovery  which is now at pre-COVID level  except for international traffic in China. Billboard grew by +1.3% organically driven by its most digitised markets.All geographies grew positively organically in Q4 2023 including Asia-Pacific  UK and North America growing double-digit. France  UK  Rest of Europe and Rest of the World were above their 2019 revenue levels  while Asia remained significantly behind mainly due to China. The recovery of our activity in China is continuing  at a better pace this quarter  thus reducing the gap with 2019.We will provide a revenue guidance for Q1 2024 when we release our full-year 2023 results on March 7th  2024.We are confident that Out of Home (OOH) will continue to grow its market share in a fragmented media landscape with Digital Out of Home (DOOH) being the second fastest growing media segment. JCDecaux as the industry leader and the most digitised global OOH Media company is well positioned to benefit from this digital transformation.”Following the adoption of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014  the operating data presented below are adjusted to include our prorata share in companies under joint control.Please refer to the paragraph “Adjusted data” on page 3 of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros.

However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group  operating data of the companies under joint control will continue to be proportionately integrated in the operating management reports used by directors to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q4 2023  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€90.0 million (-€74.7 million in Q4 2022)  leaving IFRS revenue at €1 039.9 million (€958.7 million in Q4 2022).For 2023  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€274.1 million (-€242.5 million for the full-year 2022)  leaving IFRS revenue at €3 295.9 million (€3 074.0 million for the full-year 2022).ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 FY 2022 adjusted revenue (a) 683.0 791.8 808.4 1 033.3 3 316.5 2023 IFRS revenue (b) 671.8 795.2 789.0 1 039.9 3 295.9 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 49.5 68.6 66.0 90.0 274.1 2023 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 721.3 863.7 855.0 1 130.0 3 570.0 Currency impacts (e) 1.2 19.1 33.4 22.6 76.3 2023 adjusted revenue at 2022 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 722.5 882 8 888.4 1 152.6 3 646.3 Change in scope (g) -5.7 -9.3 -12.2 -13.1 -40.3 2023 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 716.8 873.6 876.2 1 139.5 3 606.0 Organic growth (i) = (h)/(a)-1 +5.0% +10.3% +8.4% +10.3% +8.7%€m Impact of currencyas of December 31st  2023 CNY 18.5 AUD 16.9 USD 7.9 GBP 7.3 Others 25.8 Total 76.3Average exchange rate FY 2023 FY 2022 CNY 0.1305 0.1413 AUD 0.6140 0.6593 USD 0.9246 0.9496 GBP 1.1497 1.1727Next information:2023 annual results: March 7th  2024 (before market)Key Figures for JCDecaux2023 revenue: €3 570.0m ( a )N°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of more than 850 million people in more than 80 countries1 040 132 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 573 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants11 200 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexesJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (3.4/5)  CDP (A-)  MSCI (AA)  Sustainalytics (13.5)  and has achieved Gold Medal status from EcoVadis1st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (604 536 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 153 airports and 205 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (333 620 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (101 976 advertising panels worldwide)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (654 957 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (170 973 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (129 305 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (24 198 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (19 371 advertising panels)(a) Adjusted revenueFor more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on Twitter   LinkedIn   Facebook   Instagram and YouTube .Forward looking statementsThis news release may contain some forward-looking statements.

First quarter 2023–2024 saw renewed disruptions to logistics  which lengthened delivery times to Australia and North America.SUGAR BEET HARVESTING UP 39.0%While the first quarter remains non-material in terms of seasonal sales patterns  the Sugar Beet Harvesting business continued to grow  driven by strong demand across all segments: new machines  fueled in particular by the previous year’s deferrals  used machinery and spare parts. In geographical terms  while last year’s sales were mainly generated by Eastern Europe  this year first quarter revenue mainly came from Western Europe (France  Germany  Poland).LEISURE DOWN 19.2%Although listings remain satisfying  the Garden division saw its sales volumes shrink in the first quarter of 2023–2024. There is a certain sense of caution among the distributors as the market has declined compared to recent years  coupled with unfavorable weather conditions for sales in 2023 and purchasing power under strain. At this stage  distributor inventories are no larger than in previous years.In the nautical industry  while distributors hold substantial inventories  the latest product innovations from the various brands are enjoying an excellent reception.INDUSTRY UP 12.9%In Industrial Spraying  the Group posted an excellent first quarter driven by strong business growth in Asian markets  following the delivery of major high-viscosity and electrostatic projects for the automotive industry. Western Europe and North America continued to record brisk sales over the quarter.Technical hoses remained in decline  in line with the 2022–2023 trend.2023–2024 outlookAGRICULTURAL SPRAYING Despite the continuous decline in agricultural commodity prices  the order book remains stable  offering clear visibility across all brands and regions for the 2023–2024 fiscal year. The recent agricultural trade fairs in Europe enabled the Group to maintain order intake during the first quarter. In addition  agricultural income in the United States  albeit down compared to the beginning of 2022–2023  nevertheless remains well above the previous years’ performances. Moreover  the recent stabilization of interest rates could make it easier for farmers to finance purchases of agricultural equipment  even though they remain cautious. Recent events in the Red Sea could affect logistics costs and the availability of certain components.SUGAR BEET HARVESTINGEnduringly high sugar prices are expected to continue to bolster the new machines market  giving farmers visibility for replacing their machinery. Order intake for the new sugar beet harvester model is in line with Group expectations. Last year’s exceptional volume of machine replacements in Eastern Europe is unlikely to recur to the same extent in 2023–2024.LEISURE The Garden division companies continued to reorganize  mainly in order to integrate and develop the products of the Devaux group acquired near the end of fiscal year 2022–2023. The Group continues to launch new products for the upcoming season and to develop commercial and geographical synergies. In the nautical industry  the new Wauquiez 55  a model combining performance and elegance  was launched at the Düsseldorf trade fair.INDUSTRY The order book offers clear visibility over the coming months of the 2023–2024 fiscal year thanks to a large number of major projects in Europe  Asia and North America.

The combined impact of these effects is worth around €5 million of gross margin.As a result  EBITDA[3] for FY 2023 is now expected at breakeven.Looking aheadAteme will reap the benefits of the past three years of investment to continue growing revenues  while at the same time controlling opex in 2024 and beyond.Revenue drivers include:Recently launched or revamped products: Ateme recently released the 7 th generation of its video compression technology that powers our solutions such as Titan Live (for streaming) and Titan File (for VOD). This includes more efficient HEVC and AV1 encoding engines  where these 2 standards are set to replace the older H.264 standard in all use cases  as well as the MV-HEVC stereo encoding technology compatible with Apple Vision Pro AR/VR headset  NEA Genesis  the new generation Cloud DVR solution (replacing the former NEA DVR)  that was selected by Swisscom in 2023  And more generally all the NEA software family in which Ateme substantially invested in the past three years  notably NEA Live and NEA CDN for the OTT delivery  and NEA Composer for the dynamic ad insertion and FAST channels markets Partnerships with major public cloud providers  including AWS (Amazon Web Services)  GCP (Google Cloud Platform) and Microsoft Azure  and a few more  in a world where our clients look after hybrid and multi cloud solutions to launch news services while maintaining operational agility and control on over opex A more favorable competitive environment  when a major competitor is looking for divesting their video business unit  with the inherent disorganization in such context Major upcoming global sports events in Europe and in France and the US elections.At the same time  opex control measures include:Maintaining a stable headcount  notably in R&D  for the first time since the IPO Refocusing opex on the regions that deliver higher margins (EMEA and USA / Canada)  while reducing the investment and exposure in more challenging markets (Asia Pacific and Latin America).On the strength of our growth ambitions and the lower increase in opex  Ateme confirms its 2024 EBITDA target of €10m.Michel Artières  Chairman and CEO of Ateme  commented: “The growth of the topline is a great performance and Ateme clearly outperformed the market. Nevertheless  the outcome of the year is a disappointment  particularly in terms of profitability  when Ateme was still on track to deliver on all aspects of our objectives in the last mile. It should not be underestimated that the market environment has significantly evolved since 2021 when our objectives were defined. Consolidation in the media and telco sectors is resulting in cost saving measures or budget freezes at broadcasters and operators  and ultimately in challenges for tech vendors. Navigating through this period will position Ateme more robustly  reducing competition and fostering a stronger market presence.Ateme is now entering a new phase in its development  during which we will reap the rewards of our R&D and commercial investments. This virtuous phase will now result in our revenues growing faster than our opex.""Upcoming event:March 21st  2024: Full Year 2023 ResultsAbout AtemeAteme is a global leader of video compression and delivery solutions helping Tier-1 Content Providers  Service Providers and Streaming Platforms to boost their viewership and subscription engagement.Leveraging a unique R&D task force in the video industry  Ateme's solutions power green sustainable TV services  improve end-users' quality of experience  optimize the total cost of ownership of TV/VOD services and generate new revenue streams based on personalization and ad insertion.

The post hoc analysis of a Phase 3 study found that a single injection of JTA-004 was safe and efficacious for patients with a newly characterized severe inflammatory subtype of knee osteoarthritis (OA). The data will be presented by Yves Henrotin  Ph.D  a professor at University of Liège in Belgium (musculoSKeletal Innovative research Lab  mSKIL)  Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Medicine  CIRM)  as well as Founder and the Chairman of the Board of Artialis  which performed the analysis.JTA-004 is an innovative intra-articular viscosupplement treatment for knee OA  composed of hyaluronic acid  plasmatic proteins  and clonidine. The post-hoc analysis addresses different subpopulations of OA patients in the data of a Phase 3 trial (KOA-2) completed in 2019. The trial was intended to demonstrate that treatment with JTA-004 leads to a reduction in knee pain intensity compared to saline solution or Synvisc-One®  three months after injection  in subjects suffering from symptomatic knee OA.The initial results in a broad pool including patients with several subtypes were inconclusive. However  BioSenic was inspired to reevaluate the previous data following the publication of a study1 that identified biomarkers to stratify OA phenotypes  including a disease subtype characterized by systemic inflammation and the most severe symptoms. The conclusion of the post hoc analysis is that JTA-004 is safe and effective for successfully treating symptoms in this inflammatory-driven subgroup.François Rieger  Ph.D  President of the Board and CEO of the BioSenic Group  said: “We thank Prof. Henrotin  a renowned specialist  and his team of biostatisticians for this collaboration. This new  detailed analysis demonstrates the positive therapeutic effect of JTA-004 in severe OA  and it will enable a more specific approach to the unsolved problem of efficient pharmacological treatment of osteoarthritis pain.”“OARSI is dedicated solely to advancing OA research. It brings together KOLs and renowned researchers from around the world to facilitate the translation of knowledge about OA  a debilitating disease that affects about 528 million people worldwide and rising sharply. With more than 30 years of experience serving the OA community  OARSI provides the necessary framework  expert resources  and support for its international members to address the challenges of OA so that the knowledge gained can ultimately be used to improve patient care and outcomes ” said Carole Nicco  Ph.D  BioSenic Chief Scientific Officer and Chief Operating Officer. “We are pleased to share our findings at the Congress and hope that these data will support the further evaluation of our viscosupplement  which has all the characteristics to treat severe inflammatory OA and address an unmet medical need.”BioSenic recently filed an additional patent application to support further development of JTA-004 for severe OA.“A single intra-articular injection of JTA-004 is safe and efficient for treating symptoms in the most severely affected knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients – a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-and active-treatment controlled phase 3 clinical trial” will be presented at OARSI World Congress 2024  held April 18-21 in Vienna  Austria.1 Angelini F  et al. Ann Rheum Dis Feb 2022About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company specializing in the clinical development of autoimmune disease therapies. Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning  key strengths and strong IP to develop products along two tracks  separately and in combination. The first platform leverages immunomodulatory properties of arsenic trioxide (ATO) for an entirely new arsenal of formulations  including oral delivery (OATO)  for anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune indications such as chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). In parallel  BioSenic develops innovative products through a second platform that includes cell therapies and strong IP protection for tissue repair technologies.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic's technology platformsThe ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in autoimmunity to treat in its chronic  established stage. Chronic GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)  a curative treatment for patients with serious blood diseases  including cancers.BioSenic’s intravenous ATO formulation  Arscimed®  has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA  and it has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy for skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract in an early Phase 2a study. The company is planning a confirmatory international Phase 3 study with its oral ATO (OATO) formulation. OATO will also target moderate-to-severe forms of SLE. BioSenic is also developing a new IP-protected OATO formulation for the treatment of SSc  a serious chronic disease that affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models support the launch of a Phase 2 clinical trial.ALLOB is an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated  bone marrow-sourced mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point-of-use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair  and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated MSCs from healthy donors into bone-forming cells at the site of injury. BioSenic is studying the results of a Phase 2 trial to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB by determining the best timing for therapeutic intervention and seeking partners to continue the development of the promising underlying therapy strategies.The company is also exploring partnerships at all levels for its JTA-004 viscosupplement for a severe inflammatory subtype of osteoarthritis  following a positive post hoc analysis of Phase 3 data demonstrating safety and efficacy in support of this licensing.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsMichelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ● ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ghislaine.gasparetto@seitosei-actifin.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

January 25  2024. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 to 11 years  weighing at least 15 kg  with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Dupixent is now the first and only medicine approved in the U.S. specifically indicated to treat these patients. This approval expands the initial FDA approval for EoE in May 2022 for patients aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg. The FDA evaluated Dupixent for this expanded indication under Priority Review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions.EoE is a chronic  progressive disease driven in part by type 2 inflammation that damages the esophagus and impairs its function. EoE can severely impact a child’s ability to eat  and they may experience heartburn  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  food refusal and failure to thrive. These symptoms can adversely impact their growth and development. Continuous treatment of EoE may be needed to reduce the risk of complications and disease progression. Approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. are currently being treated for EoE with unapproved therapies. However  the actual prevalence of children with the disease is likely higher  given symptoms can be mistaken for other conditions and there are delays in diagnosis.Naimish Patel  M.D.Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi“Young children with eosinophilic esophagitis have significant unmet medical needs; despite existing treatment options  40% of these children in the U.S. under the age of 12 continue to experience symptoms of this disease. Today’s approval underscores our commitment to bringing therapies to young patients with unmet needs and also brings hope to these patients who are at a critical age where struggling to eat and maintain weight directly impacts their overall nutritional intake and development.”The FDA approval is based on data from the Phase 3 EoE KIDS trial with two parts (Part A and Part B) evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE. At 16 weeks  66% of children who received higher dose Dupixent at tiered dosing regimens based on weight (n=32) achieved histological disease remission (≤6 eosinophils/high power field)  the primary endpoint  compared to 3% for placebo (n=29). Histological remission was sustained at week 52  with 17 of 32 (53%) children treated with Dupixent in Parts A and B. Histological remission was also achieved at week 52 in 8 of 15 (53%) children who switched to Dupixent from placebo in Part B. In addition  a greater decrease in the proportion of days with one or more signs of EoE based on Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version (PESQ-C) was observed in children treated with Dupixent at 16 weeks compared to placebo.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.Board co-chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron“Young children are some of the most vulnerable patients with eosinophilic esophagitis  or EoE  as this debilitating and progressive disease threatens their basic ability to eat. Until today  these children had no approved treatment options specifically for EoE  leaving many with unapproved medicines that failed to target the root cause of their disease. With this approval  Dupixent becomes the first and only treatment option for EoE patients aged 1 year and older  weighing at least 15 kg. By targeting the underlying type 2 inflammation that contributes to this disease  Dupixent has the potential to transform the standard of care for these children as it has for adults and adolescents with EoE.”The safety profile of Dupixent observed through 16 weeks in children aged 1 to 11 years weighing at least 15 kg was generally similar to the safety profile of Dupixent observed through 24 weeks in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. The most common adverse events (≥2%) more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were injection site reactions  upper respiratory tract infections  arthralgia (joint pain) and herpes viral infections. In EoE KIDS Part B  one case of helminth infection was reported in the Dupixent arm.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in children aged 1 to 11 years  weighing at least 15 kg  with EoE  as determined by histological  endoscopic and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  97% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease  such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Part A  a 16-week  double-blind  placebo-controlled treatment period  enrolled 61 patients and evaluated the safety and efficacy of Dupixent in a tiered  weight-based dosing schema. The primary endpoint was histological disease remission  which was defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils (eos)/high power field (hpf). Changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g.  stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal]) were evaluated using PESQ-C.Part B was a 36-week extended active treatment period (n=47) in which eligible children from Part A in the Dupixent group continued to receive their dose level and those in the placebo group in Part A switched to Dupixent.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE  and prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 800 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with evidence of type 2 inflammation  and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people's lives.

January 25  2024. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 to 11 years  weighing at least 15 kg  with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Dupixent is now the first and only medicine approved in the U.S. specifically indicated to treat these patients. This approval expands the initial FDA approval for EoE in May 2022 for patients aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg. The FDA evaluated Dupixent for this expanded indication under Priority Review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions.EoE is a chronic  progressive disease driven in part by type 2 inflammation that damages the esophagus and impairs its function. EoE can severely impact a child’s ability to eat  and they may experience heartburn  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  food refusal and failure to thrive. These symptoms can adversely impact their growth and development. Continuous treatment of EoE may be needed to reduce the risk of complications and disease progression. Approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. are currently being treated for EoE with unapproved therapies. However  the actual prevalence of children with the disease is likely higher  given symptoms can be mistaken for other conditions and there are delays in diagnosis.Naimish Patel  M.D.Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi“Young children with eosinophilic esophagitis have significant unmet medical needs; despite existing treatment options  40% of these children in the U.S. under the age of 12 continue to experience symptoms of this disease. Today’s approval underscores our commitment to bringing therapies to young patients with unmet needs and also brings hope to these patients who are at a critical age where struggling to eat and maintain weight directly impacts their overall nutritional intake and development.”The FDA approval is based on data from the Phase 3 EoE KIDS trial with two parts (Part A and Part B) evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE.

Histological remission was also achieved at week 52 in 8 of 15 (53%) children who switched to Dupixent from placebo in Part B. In addition  a greater decrease in the proportion of days with one or more signs of EoE based on Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version (PESQ-C) was observed in children treated with Dupixent at 16 weeks compared to placebo.George D.

The most common adverse events (≥2%) more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were injection site reactions  upper respiratory tract infections  arthralgia (joint pain) and herpes viral infections. In EoE KIDS Part B  one case of helminth infection was reported in the Dupixent arm.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in children aged 1 to 11 years  weighing at least 15 kg  with EoE  as determined by histological  endoscopic and patient- or caregiver-reported measures.

Changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g.  stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal]) were evaluated using PESQ-C.Part B was a 36-week extended active treatment period (n=47) in which eligible children from Part A in the Dupixent group continued to receive their dose level and those in the placebo group in Part A switched to Dupixent.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE  and prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 800 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with evidence of type 2 inflammation  and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people's lives.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 to 11 years  weighing at least 15 kg  with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Dupixent is now the first and only medicine approved in the U.S. specifically indicated to treat these patients. This approval expands the initial FDA approval for EoE in May 2022 for patients aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg. The FDA evaluated Dupixent for this expanded indication under Priority Review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions.EoE is a chronic  progressive disease associated with type 2 inflammation that is thought to be responsible for damaging the esophagus and impairing its function. EoE can severely impact a child’s ability to eat  and they may experience heartburn  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  food refusal and failure to thrive. These symptoms can adversely impact their growth and development. Continuous treatment of EoE may be needed to reduce the risk of complications and disease progression. Approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. are currently being treated for EoE with unapproved therapies. However  the actual prevalence of children with this disease is likely higher  given symptoms can be mistaken for other conditions and there are delays in diagnosis.“Young children are some of the most vulnerable patients with eosinophilic esophagitis  or EoE  as this debilitating and progressive disease threatens their basic ability to eat. Until today  these children had no approved treatment options specifically for EoE  leaving many with unapproved medicines that failed to target the root cause of their disease ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “With this approval  Dupixent becomes the first and only treatment option for EoE patients aged 1 and older  weighing at least 15 kg. By targeting the underlying type 2 inflammation that contributes to this disease  Dupixent has the potential to transform the standard of care for these children as it has for adults and adolescents with EoE.”The FDA approval is based on data from the Phase 3 EoE KIDS trial with two parts (Part A and Part B) evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE. At 16 weeks  66% of children who received higher dose Dupixent at tiered dosing regimens based on weight (n=32) achieved histological disease remission (≤6 eosinophils/high power field)  the primary endpoint  compared to 3% for placebo (n=29). Histological remission was sustained at week 52  with 17 of 32 (53%) children treated with Dupixent in Parts A and B. Histological remission was also achieved at week 52 in 8 of 15 (53%) children who switched to Dupixent from placebo in Part B. In addition  a greater decrease in the proportion of days with one or more signs of EoE based on Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version (PESQ-C) was observed in children treated with Dupixent at 16 weeks compared to placebo.“Young children with eosinophilic esophagitis have significant unmet medical needs; despite existing treatment options  40% of these children in the U.S. under the age of 12 continue to experience symptoms of this disease ” said Naimish Patel  M.D.  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. “Today’s approval underscores our commitment to bringing therapies to young patients with unmet needs and also brings hope to these patients who are at a critical age where struggling to eat and maintain weight directly impacts their overall nutritional intake and development.”The safety profile of Dupixent observed through 16 weeks in children aged 1 to 11 years weighing at least 15 kg was generally similar to the safety profile of Dupixent observed through 24 weeks in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. The most common adverse events (≥2%) more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were injection site reactions  upper respiratory tract infections  arthralgia (joint pain) and herpes viral infections. In EoE KIDS Part B  one case of helminth infection was reported in the Dupixent arm.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in children aged 1 to 11 years  weighing at least 15 kg  with EoE  as determined by histological  endoscopic and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  97% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease  such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Part A  a 16-week  double-blind treatment period  enrolled 61 patients and evaluated the safety and efficacy of Dupixent in a tiered  weight-based dosing schema. The primary endpoint was histological disease remission  which was defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils (eos)/high power field (hpf). Changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g.  stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal]) were evaluated using PESQ-C.Part B was a 36-week extended active treatment period (n=47) in which eligible children from Part A in the Dupixent group continued to receive their dose level and those in the placebo group in Part A switched to Dupixent.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant.

More than 800 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz™ (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement.

Thales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies within three domains: Defence & Security  Aeronautics & Space  and Digital ...,"Thales  the leading global technology and security provider  today announced the launch of its PQC Starter Kit in collaboration with Quantinuum (https://www.quantinuum.com). This first-of-its-kind offering helps enterprises prepare for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The kit provides a trusted environment for businesses to test quantum-hardened PQC-ready encryption keys and understand the implications that quantum computing will have on the security of their infrastructure.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240123494135/en/©ThalesWhile 73% of organizations recognize quantum computing poses a threat to traditional cryptography  61% have yet to define a strategy for a post-quantum world1. Post Quantum Cryptography helps mitigate this threat. As a result  organizations around the world must test their ecosystem applications  data  and devices currently relying upon traditional cryptography to ensure minimal disruption when quantum-safe protocols become mandatory.Todd Moore  Global Head of Data Security Products at Thales commented: “Thales is excited to offer a new solution to its customers to help them prepare for the implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography. We understand the enormous challenges and complexities behind this upcoming disruption in cryptography and want to support customers as they transition to these new algorithms.. For organizations unsure of navigating this transition  we highly recommend testing current applications  data  and devices that use cryptographic protection as soon as possible to ensure a smooth shift to PQC. Although quantum computing may seem like a future-looking risk  with hackers using Harvest Now  Decrypt Later tactics  post-quantum resilience should be on every organization’s radar today.”""Hardening encryption keys is critical for the post-quantum era  and Quantum Origin is a unique technology that provides verifiable quantum randomness to maximize encryption key strength. The combination of Quantum Origin and the Thales HSM is a strong solution for IT teams to help them with their PQC transition. We look forward to working with Thales to help smooth the shift to PQC ” added Duncan Jones  Head of Cybersecurity at Quantinuum.The PQC Starter Kit will allow organizations to test within a trusted lab environment. Using the current NIST proposed algorithms that are built into the system  customers can test various security use cases including PKI  code-signing  TLS  and IoT  and observe the impact of implementing PQC technology in these simulated test-lab scenarios  all without impacting operational processes in real-world production environments. Organizations will also be able to identify potential weaknesses in their encryption deployment and apply changes to their IT infrastructure to protect themselves.The first available PQC Starter Kit option incorporates Luna HSMs and Quantinuum’s quantum random number generation (QRNG) technology through which customers can ensure their keys are securely generated and stored while testing the PQC algorithms. The kit offers a choice of Luna HSMs (i.e. appliance or PCIe card) and Quantinuum’s Quantum Origin - the world’s only source of verified quantum entropy. A PQC Starter Kit for network encryption using Thales High Speed Encryptors (HSE) will be available next.Learn more about the PQC Starter Kit in the customer case study here.About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies within three domains: Defence & Security  Aeronautics & Space  and Digital Identity & Security.
