""This power must be used wisely  however  because international relations are part of a ‘repeated game'.""The EU  United States  Japan and Canada froze some $300 billion of Russian central bank assets in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. Some $200 billion of that is held in Europe  mainly in the Belgian clearing house Euroclear.Opponents argue that seizing assets could prompt investors from other countries to flee  fearing for the safety of their own investments  ultimately weakening the currency and pushing up yields.Panetta  a former ECB board member  argued that the conflict around Ukraine had led to an increase in the role of the Chinese renminbi at the expense of other currencies  since much of Russia's trade is now done in the Chinese currency.""The Chinese authorities are explicitly promoting its role on the global stage and encouraging its use in other countries  including those sanctioned by the international community following the invasion of Ukraine "" Panetta said.As a result  the renminbi overtook the euro as the second most used currency for trade finance and the yen as the fourth most used currency for global payments  Panetta said.Panetta instead argued that Europe should strengthen the euro by making it more attractive  implementing long-delayed changes that would enhance its role as a reserve currency.This includes the creation of a safe asset that is issued in sufficient  predictable quantities  and the completion of a banking union that would the reduce the difficulty of cross-border banking. Another step would be an efficient payment and market infrastructure system across the bloc  he said.

2023 results despite market slump,LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s Paris listed shares surged on Friday following the luxury firm’s decision to hike its dividend on the back of record 2023...,LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s Paris listed shares surged on Friday following the luxury firm’s decision to hike its dividend on the back of record 2023 results  in a rally that lifted shares across the luxury sector amid a slowdown that has pummeled the industry in recent months.The Paris headquartered conglomerate  which owns top brands including Christian Dior and Tiffany & Co  saw its sales surge 10% in the fourth quarter  to €23.9 billion ($26 billion)  in an uptick that saw its full-year revenue reach all-time highs of €86.2 billion.Shares in LVMH MC  +12.81% that are listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange rallied 8% on Friday having lost 8% of their value over the previous 12 months.LVMH’s results saw its net income increase 8%  to €15.2 billion  as its sales grew across all segments of its business aside from its wine & spirits division  which includes cognac brand Hennessy and champagne seller Moët & Chandon.Luxury goods companies including Hermes International RMS  +6.63%   Kering KER  +6.59%   Christian Dior CDI  +12.04%   and Prada 1913  +2.24% also saw their share prices lifted by the rally  following a tough year for the sector which has been hard hit by a drop in consumer spending following the end of a boom during COVID-19.LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault said the company is now entering 2024 with “confidence ” despite signs that growth in the company’s sales had started to slow in the second half of 2023 in the face of an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.The slowdown in the latter half of 2023 saw LVMH’s sales grow at rates of just 9% in the third quarter and 10% in the final three months of 2023  compared to bumper rates of 17% in both the first and second quarter of the year.In a call with investors  Arnault  however  said he expects LVMH’s sales will be boosted in 2024 by the lowering of interest rates and the upcoming U.S. elections  as he noted previous elections have had a “positive impact” on LVMH’s business.LVMH’s results follow Arnault’s decision to nominate his two sons  Alexandre  31  and Frédéric  29  for positions on the luxury conglomerate’s board of directors  in a move that is set to further consolidate the family’s control over the company.In 2023  Arnault previously lost his position as the world’s richest person  after being overtaken by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos  following a dip in LVMH’s share price due to the global slowdown in demand for luxury goods.The LVMH chief  who has a net worth of $164 billion  now sits in third place on Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index behind both Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.The company said it would also call on the board to hike LVMH’s dividend  from rates of €7.50 a share to €13 a share.Citi analysts led by Thomas Chauvet said they expect LVMH’s sales will continue to rise at a low-single-digit percentage over 2024. “This should be enough to support the shares near-term which have lagged slightly this year to date and in the past 3 months ” Citi’s analysts said.,neutral,0.23,0.72,0.04,negative,0.02,0.3,0.68,True,English,"['luxury shares rally', 'record 2023 results', 'LVMH', 'market', 'slump', 'LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis

As a result  the sum of annual orders and contracts has risen from less than €1 million at the start of 2023 to over €9 million today  representing a more than 10-fold increase in 12 months.Three new customers in each of the major geographical regions illustrate  with contracts of over €1 million  the needs of industrial customers in response to consumer expectations. One is a diversified specialist in food ingredients  while another  a player in marine Omega-3s  is introducing a microalgae-based range to its portfolio. The latter is based in Asia  where demand for microalgae-based products is strong in response to concerns about the possible contamination of fish oils by radioactive waste from Fukushima.Growth expected in Q1 and new opportunities to boost momentumThis excellent start to the year should enable Fermentalg to post strong sales growth as early as 1st quarter 2024. Beyond that  the Company has levers to maintain and amplify this momentum throughout the year.Fermentalg has begun discussions with several new prospects  each representing several million euros in potential annual sales  including:In infant formulas  a strategic segment for which Fermentalg has marketing authorizations in Europe and the United States.In the field of high-concentration Omega-3  where Fermentalg has unrivalled legitimacy with an oil concentrated up to 620mg/g of DHA.Fermentalg will also benefit from the planned ramp-up  over the coming months  of its new strategic partnership with the HuvePharma group[3] . This alliance will enable the Company to offer feed and food industry players the only source of algal omega-3 in the European Union  and an oil that meets the highest standards in terms of quality  competitiveness  and environmental performance.Next publication: full-year results 2023 andsales for str quarter 2024  April 3  2024 (after market close)About FermentalgAn expert in the research and bioindustrial exploitation of microalgae  Fermentalg aims to offer sustainable solutions and innovative products that contribute to the development of healthy  natural and high-performance products.

A new Oral Explanation is not mandatory and will be scheduled only if major objections remain after the review of the written responses.AB Science now expects an opinion from the CHMP in the second quarter of 2024.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

In 2023  soft demand  which lasted longer than expected post-pandemic  led to a temporary decline in sales revenue and earnings across the entire life science sector.“2023 was a year of transition in our industry. Destocking  relatively low production levels and muted investment activity at customers weighed on our business development and led to a decline in sales revenue. At the same time and supported by cost measures  our profitability remained at a healthy and above pre-pandemic level. As many customers are further advanced in optimizing their inventory levels  we have seen business picking up since the end of the third quarter and expect this trend to gradually gain traction over the course of the current year ” said René Fáber  CEO of Sartorius Stedim Biotech.“Strategically  the acquisition of transfection reagent specialist Polyplus and the respective expansion of our technology platform for cell and gene therapy applications were major milestones for our company in 2023. The portfolio will enable us to significantly contribute to our customers’ efforts to bring these highly innovative therapies to the market and to patients faster “ continued Fáber.Business development2In 2023  the ongoing demand normalization following the pandemic and a longer-than-expected reduction in inventories among customers led to subdued results and numerous forecast adjustments across the life science industry. Accordingly  sales revenue for Sartorius Stedim Biotech decreased compared to the previous year’s high base  which had been characterized by Covid19-related positive extraordinary effects. The company recorded consolidated sales revenue of 2 775 million euros in 2023  which corresponds to a decline of 18.7 percent in constant currencies (guidance: around -19 percent; organic: -20.7 percent; reported: - 20.5 percent). This includes a growth contribution from acquisitions3 of around 2 percentage points. Excluding the pandemic-related business  the decline in constant currencies was around 14 percent. Main drivers of the soft development were customer destocking which began after the end of the pandemic and is taking longer than expected  in some cases due to relatively low production levels   the largely discontinued business with Russian customers  and an overall muted investment activity on the part of customers  primarily in China and the USA.As expected  the general market weakness affected all business regions. In the EMEA 4 region  which accounted for around 39 percent of total Group revenue  sales revenue declined by 16.7 percent compared to the previous year  which was particularly influenced by business with vaccine manufacturers. In addition  growth was dampened by the discontinuation of business with Russian customers . Sales revenue in the Americas region was down 15.5 percent against the backdrop of inventory reductions and low investment activity by customers in the USA. This corresponds to a share of around 38 percent of total Group revenue. The investment slowdown was even more pronounced in China  leading to a significant decline of 26.4 percent in sales revenue in the Asia | Pacific region  which accounted for around 23 percent of total Group sales revenue.The temporarily weaker market environment was even more significantly reflected in order intake  which decreased by 23.6 percent in constant currencies (reported: -25.3 percent) to 2.476 million euros. In line with progress made by customers in reducing their inventories  business began to recover at the end of the third quarter  so that order intake was slightly above sales revenue in the fourth quarter.The Group’s underlying EBITDA decreased by 35.7 percent to 785 million euros due to the volume development and product mix effects. The resulting margin was 28.3 percent ( guidance: slightly above 28 percent; prior-year period: 35.0 percent). Price effects on the procurement and customer side largely offset each other.Underlying net profit totaled 386 million euros  compared with 797 million euros in the prior-year period while net profit amounted to 310 million euros  compared with 876 million euros in 2022. Underlying earnings per share were 4.19 euros (prior-year period: 8.64 euros) and earnings per share were 3.36 (prior-year period: 9.51 euros).Sartorius Stedim Biotech employed 10 662 people group wide as of December 31  2023  compared to 11 934 at the end of the prior year. The reduction resulted primarily from the expiry of fixed-term employment contracts and regular attrition.Key financial indicatorsEquity was 2 673 million euros as of December 31  2023. Following the Polyplus acquisition  the equity ratio2 stood in line with expectations at 34.5 percent (December 31  2022: 2 514 million euros and 49.6 percent  respectively ). Gross debt was 3 682 million euros (December 31  2022: 1 136 million euros)  while net debt stood at 3 565 million euros  resulting in a ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA2 of 4.5 (December 31  2022: 1 029 million euros and 0.8  respectively). Net operating cash flow stood at 746 million euros  compared with 612 million euros in the prior-year period. Despite the decline in earnings  the increase was primarily achieved through the optimization of working capital  as planned. While Sartorius Stedim Biotech had systematically increased inventories in 2022 and previous years to secure supply ability in view of temporarily constrained supply chains  inventory reductions started as planned in 2023 . The ratio of capital expenditures (capex) to sales revenue was 17.1 percent (prior-year period: 12.3 percent).Outlook for fiscal 2024Based on the slight demand recovery since the end of the third quarter of 2023 and the market outlook forecast by industry observers  Sartorius Stedim Biotech expects profitable growth for 2024 and beyond. However  as inventory optimization measures of customers have not yet been fully completed the company projects business momentum to increase only gradually over the course of the year leading to a moderate first half of 2024. In addition  business performance could also be affected by increasing geopolitical tensions going forward.Against this backdrop of still somewhat unstable market trends and therefore limited visibility   management forecasts an increase in Group sales revenue in the mid to high single-digit percentage range  including a contribution of acquired businesses of around 2 percentage points. In terms of profitability  management expects the underlying EBITDA margin to rise to more than 30 percent compared to the previous year’s figure of 28.3 percent. The above-average profitability of the Polyplus business will have a slightly positive effect on the margin development. The capex ratio is projected to be around 13 percent  below the prior-year figure of 17.1 percent. Excluding potential capital measures and/or acquisitions the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA2 is expected to be 3.5.“Beyond focusing on customer satisfaction  innovation  and organic growth  we will fully concentrate on further efficiency gains and strong cash generation in 2024 to rapidly run down the debt leverage which is at an elevated level following the Polyplus acquisition. To deleverage even faster while maintaining strategic flexibility we are also continuing to consider potential equity measures  subject to market conditions  for example targeting a leverage reduction by approximately one turn  ” said Fáber.Medium-term outlook until 2028Sartorius Stedim Biotech intends to continue its profitable growth course in the long term and expects to grow faster than the market. According to the new medium-term targets  the Group plans to achieve average annual growth in the low- to mid-teens percentage range over the five-year period to 2028 of which acquisitions are anticipated to contribute around a fifth. The underlying EBITDA margin is also expected to increase and reach above 35 percent in 2028. The margin target includes expenses of around 1 percent of Group sales revenue for measures to reduce the company’s CO 2 emission intensity.“ Our goals remain ambitious as we anticipate ever-increasing demand for biopharmaceuticals and vaccines due to a growing and aging population  improved access to medicines in emerging markets  as well as rapidly expanding markets for biosimilars and cell and gene therapies. At the same time  there is a need for continuous innovation  not only to help bring the promises of new therapies to life  but to also support our customers’ sustainability efforts. With our broad portfolio we see ourselves excellently positioned to support our customers in their endeavors and to continue to outgrow the market  “ commented Fáber.Forecasts have been prepared based on historical information and are consistent with accounting policies. All forecast figures are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. Management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the industry have increased significantly in recent years. In addition  uncertainties due to the changed geopolitical situation  such as the emerging decoupling tendencies of various countries  are playing a greater role. This results in higher uncertainty when forecasting business figures.1 Current forecast for 2023 from October 20232 Sartorius Stedim Biotech publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards.

March milling wheat on Paris-based Euronext was down 1.4% at 215.25 euros ($233.78) a metric ton at 1554 GMT  near a life-of-contract low of 214 euros struck last week.A lull in demand this week  following a run of purchases by importers last week  has put the focus back on lagging European Union exports and cheaper competition from Black Sea supplies.“All the gains we saw this week have evaporated today  with Chicago back under $6 a bushel ” a French trader said.“It’s gone very quiet and there’s nothing to give the market impetus.”Easing prices in Russia and rising volumes in Ukraine’s wartime sea shipping channel were keeping attention on competition from the Black Sea zone.“Russian export prices for both 11.5% and 12.% protein wheat for February shipment are stillholding below $240 a ton FOB ” one German trader said.Traders said substantial numbers of grain ships previously booked to ship grains through the Red Sea were still sailing but it is becoming more difficult to book grain ships to make the Red Sea transit.“With more ships being diverted from the Red Sea because of the attacks  people are starting to ask whether Ukrainian wheat will find its way into markets like Algeria in greater volumes ” another trader said. Algeria is one of the largest export markets for EU wheat.Traders also noted news that the Chinese customs authorities have approved Argentine wheat for export to China  which could increase competition for French wheat in what has been a major export destination in recent years.,neutral,0.02,0.93,0.05,negative,0.02,0.22,0.76,True,English,"['EU wheat futures', 'lagging European Union exports', 'wartime sea shipping channel', 'ample global supplies', 'Chinese customs authorities', 'Black Sea supplies', 'Black Sea zone', 'major export destination', 'March milling wheat', 'Red Sea transit', 'Russian export prices', 'one German trader', 'Euronext wheat futures', 'largest export markets', 'stiff export competition', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'Easing prices', '12.% protein wheat', 'Ukrainian wheat', 'EU wheat', 'Argentine wheat', 'French wheat', 'contract lows', 'sharp drop', 'metric ton', 'French trader', 'market impetus', 'rising volumes', 'February shipment', 'ton FOB', 'substantial numbers', 'greater volumes', 'recent years', 'cheaper competition', 'grain ships', 'Friday', 'Chicago', 'worries', '215.25 euros', '1554 GMT', 'life', '214 euros', 'lull', 'demand', 'run', 'purchases', 'importers', 'focus', 'gains', 'bushel', 'Ukraine', 'attention', 'Traders', 'grains', 'attacks', 'people', 'way', 'Algeria', 'news', 'China']",2024-01-28,2024-01-27,brecorder.com
