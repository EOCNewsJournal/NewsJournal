He was commenting on discussions in Brussels regarding frozen Russian assets.The EU  US  Japan and Canada froze some $300 billion of Russian central bank assets in 2022 as part of Ukraine-related sanctions against Moscow. Some $200 billion of that is held in the EU  largely in the Belgian clearing house Euroclear.Brussels is currently working on plans to apply a windfall tax to the profits Euroclear is making on the frozen funds  while opting not to seize the immobilized money outright. However  Italy is one of several EU member states  including Germany and France  that have been skeptical of moves involving the assets  arguing that using them could prompt investors from other countries to doubt the safety of their own holdings in the EU and quit the bloc’s market  ultimately weakening the euro.“This power must be used wisely ” Panetta said  referring to euro’s standing as a global reserve currency.“International relations are part of a ‘repeated game’: weaponizing a currency inevitably reduces its attractiveness and encourages the emergence of alternatives ” he warned at an event in Riga  marking the 10th anniversary of Latvia adopting the euro.According to the official  the recent surge in the use of the yuan in trade between China and Russia is “instructive in this respect ” because it was Western sanctions that prompted the trend  as they made it difficult for Russia to use US dollars and euros in cross-border trade.“The Chinese authorities are explicitly promoting [the yuan’s] role on the global stage and encouraging its use in other countries  including those sanctioned by the international community following the invasion of Ukraine ” Panetta said  adding that the share of Chinese trade financed in the domestic currency has doubled in the past three years  allowing the yuan to overtake the euro as the world’s second most-used trade currency.The official warned if the need to “be alert to the possibility that politics will have a greater impact on international currencies in the coming years.”Western currencies have been largely phased out in Russia-China trade  as nearly 95% of all transactions between the countries are now carried out either in rubles or yuan. Russia is not the only major economy to use the Chinese currency for trade settlements  as more and more nations seek alternatives to the dollar and euro. These include Argentina  Saudi Arabia  Brazil and Iran.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,negative,0.01,0.06,0.93,negative,0.03,0.2,0.78,True,English,"['Italian central bank', 'Russia', 'money', 'euro', 'several EU member states', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Belgian clearing house', 'past three years', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Governor Fabio Panetta', 'global reserve currency', 'frozen funds', 'global stage', 'coming years', 'sanctions wars', 'political disputes', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'windfall tax', 'International relations', 'repeated game', '10th anniversary', 'recent surge', 'Western sanctions', 'Chinese authorities', 'international community', 'greater impact', 'international currencies', 'Western currencies', 'Saudi Arabia', 'business section', 'single currency', 'domestic currency', 'Chinese currency', 'cross-border trade', 'Chinese trade', 'Russia-China trade', 'trade settlements', 'The EU', 'trade currency', 'other countries', 'US dollars', 'major economy', 'harm', 'head', 'Italy', 'euro', 'tool', 'image', 'standing', 'Friday', 'discussions', 'Brussels', 'Japan', 'Canada', 'part', 'Moscow', 'plans', 'profits', 'money', 'Germany', 'France', 'moves', 'investors', 'safety', 'holdings', 'bloc', 'market', 'power', 'attractiveness', 'emergence', 'alternatives', 'event', 'Riga', 'Latvia', 'official', 'yuan', 'respect', 'trend', 'role', 'invasion', 'share', 'world', 'need', 'possibility', 'politics', 'transactions', 'rubles', 'nations', 'Argentina', 'Brazil', 'Iran', 'stories', 'finance']",2024-01-27,2024-01-28,rt.com

He added that these actions already “helped” drive bilateral relations between Moscow and Washington “into an impasse.”“In addition  they force sensible national capitals to seriously consider abandoning the dollar. Once again  this confirms the urgent need for global transition towards multipolarity ” the diplomat emphasized. Antonov earlier warned that Russia would be forced to reciprocate if Western countries decide to confiscate its assets.The EU  US  Japan  and Canada froze about $300 billion of Russian central bank assets in 2022 due to Ukraine-related sanctions against Moscow.
