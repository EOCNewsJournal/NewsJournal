""EU Ambassadors just agreed in principle on a proposal on the use of windfall profits related to immobilised assets to support Ukraine’s reconstruction "" the Belgian Presidency said on X (formerly Twitter).Following the start of Russia's special military operation  the US-led West slapped widespread sanctions on Moscow  including freezing Russian assets worth approximately 300 billion euros ($329 billion). The bulk of this sum  approximately 200 billion euros ($221 billion)  is being held in the European Union  predominantly in accounts at Euroclear  a European central securities depository.Russia has repeatedly warned that any attempt by the EU to confiscate Moscow's frozen assets would violate international law.In December  2023  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that the Western countries would face repercussions if they used Russia's frozen assets to assist Ukraine.russiaukrainebelgiumSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 602024Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalrussian assets  confiscation of russian assets  frozen funds  frozen assets  illegal appropriation  illegal confiscation  illegal seizure  russian property  frozen property  aid to ukraine  support for ukraine  europe for ukraine  belgium for ukraine  weapons for ukraine  aid to ukraine  funding of ukraine  financial aid  military aid  confiscate money  us sanctions  eu sanctions  sanctions against russia",neutral,0.08,0.9,0.02,negative,0.03,0.27,0.7,True,English,"['Russian Frozen Assets', 'EU Ambassadors', 'Preliminary Plan', 'Finance Minister Vincent Van Peteghem', 'Belgian Deputy Prime Minister', 'European central securities depository', 'europe belgium european union', 'special military operation', 'EU permanent representatives', 'Russian Frozen Assets', 'european commission sanctions', 'assets russia ukraine', 'Russian assets', 'Belgian Presidency', 'russian property', 'frozen property', 'sovereign assets', 'Preliminary Plan', 'technical work', 'last year', 'windfall profits', 'US-led West', '200 billion euros', 'international law', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'Western countries', 'Sputnik International', 'Rosiya Segodnya', 'illegal appropriation', 'illegal seizure', 'military aid', 'frozen funds', 'widespread sanctions', 'eu sanctions', 'EU Ambassadors', 'illegal confiscation', 'financial aid', 'preliminary proposal', 'sputnikglobe', 'agree', 'preliminary-plan', 'russian-frozen-assets', 'use', 'income', 'Council', 'Monday', 'world', 'meta', 'description', 'cdn', 'implementation', 'end', 'proceeds', 'interests', 'principle', 'immobilised', 'reconstruction', 'Twitter', 'start', 'Moscow', 'bulk', 'sum', 'accounts', 'Euroclear', 'attempt', 'December', 'repercussions', 'sputniknews', 'MIA', 'support', 'weapons', 'funding', 'money']",2024-01-29,2024-01-30,sputnikglobe.com

The source said this would take place as soon as possible.The European Commission would then be expected to propose transferring the money set aside to the EU budget and subsequently to Kyiv though it is unclear when it would arrive in Ukraine.France and Germany have already voiced reservations about the plan  while the European Central Bank has warned it could undermine confidence in the euro and unsettle global markets.The EU  United States  Japan and Canada froze some $300 billion of Russian central bank assets in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine.

EU member countries have backed a plan to set aside billions of euros of profits arising from the freezing of assets of Russia’s central bank in a first step towards their possible use for Ukraine’s reconstruction  the Financial Times wrote.Of the €260 bln of Russian foreign reserves immobilized in 2022  €191 bln is sitting in Belgium’s Euroclear  a central security depository  and is generating billions as securities reach maturity and are reinvested. Under the agreement struck on Monday  profits generated by Euroclear will be booked separately and not be paid out as dividends to shareholders until EU countries unanimously decide to set up a ""financial contribution to the [EU] budget that shall be raised on these net profits to support Ukraine""  according a draft text seen by the Financial Times.That levy will be ""consistent with applicable contractual obligations  and in accordance with [EU] and international law""  the text added. There is no timeline for when such a separate proposal should be made.The proposal only targets future profits and will not apply retrospectively. Member nations will also determine what amount central security depositories will be able to keep  on top of amounts needed to cover legal and management costs.Earlier reports said that the European Commission planned to receive around 15 bln euro by 2027 as revenues from reinvestment of frozen Russian funds.

The bloc acted in concert with the G7 group of wealthy nations to freeze the Russian assets.The United States wants a collective G7 decision on how to tap the Russian money.Diplomats say Washington is increasingly in favour of outright confiscation of all frozen Russian funds  but that the Europeans have pushed back on that.The movement on the frozen funds issue comes at an otherwise difficult time for Ukraine as continued Western support runs into political headwinds in both Washington and Brussels.In the United States  opposition Republicans are blocking further US funds and weapons for Ukraine in manoeuvring over domestic issues  notably migration.And in the European Union  Hungary -- whose leader Viktor Orban is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin -- has blocked a 50-billion-euro EU financial lifeline for Kyiv.A summit in Brussels on Thursday will again tackle that issue with hopes of persuading Hungary to drop its veto.The estimated total cost of rebuilding Ukraine is at least $411 billion (380 billion euros)  according to a joint assessment put out in March last year by the World Bank  the European Commission and the United Nations.rmb/del/lth",neutral,0.17,0.77,0.06,negative,0.03,0.27,0.7,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'profits', 'Ukraine', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', '50-billion-euro EU financial lifeline', 'Russian central bank assets', 'legally fraught debate', 'Russian state assets', 'international deposit organisation', 'frozen Russian assets', '2nd step proposal', 'The United States', 'three billion euros', 'overnight preliminary agreement', 'The European Commission', 'collective G7 decision', '27 EU member countries', 'frozen funds issue', 'World Bank', 'frozen assets', 'Russian funds', '200 billion euros', '380 billion euros', 'first step', 'international markets', 'deposit holders', 'Russian money', 'cautious proposal', 'second proposal', 'G7 group', 'United Nations', 'European Union', 'G7 issue', 'Western countries', 'Tobias SCHWARZ', 'Belgian presidency', 'Western institutions', 'windfall tax', 'Arnoldas Pranckevicius', 'wealthy nations', 'outright confiscation', 'difficult time', 'Western support', 'political headwinds', 'opposition Republicans', 'US funds', 'domestic issues', 'Viktor Orban', 'total cost', 'joint assessment', 'EU ambassadors', 'reconstruction efforts', 'ring-fenced profits', 'war-ravaged Ukraine', 'country', 'officials', 'plan', 'order', 'Twitter', 'long', 'wake', 'Moscow', 'invasion', '90 percent', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'option', 'Kyiv', 'interest', 'Lithuania', 'beginning', 'road', 'use', 'start', 'discussion', 'Story', 'bloc', 'concert', 'Diplomats', 'Washington', 'favour', 'Europeans', 'movement', 'Brussels', 'weapons', 'migration', 'Hungary', 'leader', 'summit', 'Thursday', 'hopes', 'veto', 'March', 'rmb']",2024-01-30,2024-01-30,uk.news.yahoo.com

The airline said it expects Boeing will have completed just 50 deliveries by June 2024  of a total 57 planes that were initially due to be delivered by April 2024.The airline warned these delays mean its own passenger numbers will drop from 205 million this year to 200 million in 2025.Ryanair  however  signaled that it remains confident in Boeing and continues to work closely with the plane manufacturer following a meeting with the company’s senior management at its Seattle headquarters in January.The airline on Monday also said it would be willing to buy any Boeing MAX-10’s that have been rejected by the manufacturer’s U.S. customers  following the Federal Aviation Administration’s decision to ground Boeing’s MAX-9s after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines flight in January.,neutral,0.04,0.57,0.39,negative,0.01,0.28,0.71,True,English,"['profit guidance', 'travel agents', 'Boeing delays', 'Ryanair', 'clash', 'growth', 'The Irish air carrier', 'consumer protection watchdogs', 'customer verification measures', 'other ancillary products', 'Federal Aviation Administration', 'Alaska Airlines flight', 'pirate” travel agents', 'final three months', 'Booking Holdings BKNG', 'U.S. customers', 'The Irish airline', 'online travel agents', 'incorrect passenger details', 'full-year profit guidance', '35% higher fuel prices', 'Boeing aircraft deliveries', 'Boeing delivery delays', 'online agents', 'Booking.com', 'final quarter', 'U.K.', 'passenger numbers', 'ticket prices', 'new guidance', 'staffing costs', 'new set', 'Love Holidays', 'seat price', 'pilots’ unions', 'operating costs', 'Euronext Dublin', 'analysts’ estimates', 'seven analysts', 'unforeseen events', 'possible worsening', 'Israel-Hamas conflict', 'Ukraine war', 'total 57 planes', 'senior management', 'Seattle headquarters', 'coming year', 'full year', 'post-tax profits', 'unauthorized websites', 'third-party websites', 'Company watchers', 'plane manufacturer', 'low-cost airline', 'Ryanair flights', '50 deliveries', 'Monday', 'decision', 'investors', 'growth', 'RYAAY', 'Kiwi', 'Kayak', 'early-December', '1% drop', 'listings', 'pressure', 'concerns', 'passengers', 'deals', 'shift', 'markups', 'agreements', 'Belgium', 'Italy', '21% uptick', 'revenues', '13% rise', 'shares', 'March', 'Factset', 'ability', 'world', 'escalation', 'BA', 'June', 'April', 'meeting', 'January', 'MAX-9s', 'panel']",2024-01-29,2024-01-30,marketwatch.com

The extended lineup and increased in-house  industrial scale production of fuel cell vans helps cement Stellantis’ standing as the undisputed leader in zero-emission propulsion in commercial vehicles in Europe.In October 2023  the Company unveiled a full revamp of the van lineup as a key element of the Pro One strategic offensive for Stellantis’ Commercial Vehicles Business. Stellantis and its brands are leveraging a full range of advanced electrified propulsion  safety  ADAS and connectivity technologies to provide a stress-free environment for drivers and a reliable business partner to commercial owners.

The level of revenues achieved in the 4e quarter (€64.6m) should enable the Group to confirm its mid-December 2023 adjusted target of an organic EBITDA margin in excess of 17%.Consolidated sales (unaudited)Sales (€M) 2023 2022 Published change On a like-for-like basis First quarter 40 9 38 0 +7 6% +8 5% Second quarter 56 3 46 0 +22 3% +24 7% Third quarter 41 8 40 9 +2 2% +4 8% Fourth quarter 64 6 66 0 -2 2% -3.4% 12 months 203 6 191 0 +6 6% +7 5% of which Photonics 100 8 93 5 +7 8% +7.4% Medical 102 8 97 5 +5 5% +7 6%By divisionThe Photonics division grew by +7.8% (+7.4% on a like-for-like basis) over the year  with a 4th quarter at €34.9m  close to the record set in the 4th quarter of 2022 (€35.3m).The Defence/Space segment  driven by growing demand and an attractive range of very high-tech products  which include a large number of components produced within the Group  grew by 30.9% to €39.4m (+34.5% on a like-for-like basis)  and by 8.2% to €15.8m in the 4th quarter.The Lidar segment fell by 7.5% to €24.1m (down 6.1% on a like-for-like basis)  down 39.6% in Q4 (to €5.8m)  mainly due to a particularly high basis of comparison vs Q4 2022. The LIDAR business continues to grow strongly in the wind energy sub-segment  where LUMIBIRD sells its Lidar systems directly  and recorded this year a decline in the 3D Scan sub-segment  without however calling into question the strong growth prospects for this market.In Industrial and Scientific activities  the Group ended the year with revenues of €37.4m  stable at-0.1% (-5.0% on a like-for-like basis)  up 19.6% in the 4th quarter (€13.2m)  driven largely by the catching up of production delays in the first quarter. Revenues generated by the CONVERGENT business  acquired at the end of August 2023  are included in Industrial and Scientific activities. They totalled €2.7m in 2023 over 4 months  including €2.1m in Q4 2023.Revenues in the Medical division rose by 5.5% over the year to €102.8m (+7.6% at constant exchange rates)  with a slight decline in the fourth quarter (-3% to €29.8m) due to the postponement of sales to 2024 for regulatory reasons (delay in marketing authorisations) and administrative reasons (new purchasing policy for public hospitals in China). The breakdown of revenues between diagnostics (23%) and treatment (77%) is similar to previous years.The currency effect had a negative impact on revenues of €4.5m in 2023  split between Photonics (€2.4m) and Medical (€2.1m).

The catch-up in Industrial and Scientific sales in the 4th quarter had a favourable impact on the Asia-Pacific region  which grew by 17.3% over the year.The Medical division ended the year with solid growth in Europe (+9%)  while the Americas (-7.7%) and Asia (+3.1%) were affected by the postponement of sales to 2024.OutlookThe level of revenues achieved over the year confirms the expected level of profitability  with an organic EBITDA margin of over 17% for the full 2023 financial year.The Group is maintaining its growth trajectory  driven by the dynamism of its key markets: Defence/Space  Medical and Lidar  where demand is strong in the short and medium term.The CONVERGENT business acquired in 2023 brings to the Group revenues on a new range of fibre lasers and key semiconductor technologies. This acquisition  along with the development of the fibre business at Lannion  provide technological building blocks that will enable the Group to accelerate its vertical expansion over the coming months and bolster its profitable growth. The Convergent business  together with high-power fibre lasers for civil applications  will also enable the Group to develop new medical activities outside ophthalmology. The Convergent business is not expected to be profitable (negative EBITDA) in 2023.

Jan. 29  2024 -- NANOBIOTIX   a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced achievement of operation…,PARIS and CAMBRIDGE  Mass.  Jan. 29  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced achievement of operational requirements in NANORAY-312  an ongoing pivotal Phase 3 study evaluating potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3 for elderly patients with head and neck cancer  resulting in a $20M milestone payment from strategic partner Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (“Janssen”)  a Johnson & Johnson company.“This first milestone payment related to our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 study evaluating NBTXR3 for patients with head and neck cancer represents another step forward in our pathway to bring NBTXR3 to registration ” said Laurent Levy  Nanobiotix co-founder and chairman of the executive board. “We look forward to continued collaboration with Janssen as we work to deliver the potential benefits of NBTXR3 to millions of patients around the world.”This $20M represents the first applicable development milestone from the global licensing agreement executed between Nanobiotix and Janssen (For more details  please consult the press release dated 4 December 2023).About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized phase III study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the phase III study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023 Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

The level of revenues achieved in the 4e quarter (€64.6m) should enable the Group to confirm its mid-December 2023 adjusted target of an organic EBITDA margin in excess of 17%.Consolidated sales (unaudited)Sales (€M) 2023 2022 Published change On a like-for-like basis First quarter 40 9 38 0 +7 6% +8 5% Second quarter 56 3 46 0 +22 3% +24 7% Third quarter 41 8 40 9 +2 2% +4 8% Fourth quarter 64 6 66 0 -2 2% -3.4% 12 months 203 6 191 0 +6 6% +7 5% of which Photonics 100 8 93 5 +7 8% +7.4% Medical 102 8 97 5 +5 5% +7 6%By divisionThe Photonics division grew by +7.8% (+7.4% on a like-for-like basis) over the year  with a 4th quarter at €34.9m  close to the record set in the 4th quarter of 2022 (€35.3m).The Defence/Space segment  driven by growing demand and an attractive range of very high-tech products  which include a large number of components produced within the Group  grew by 30.9% to €39.4m (+34.5% on a like-for-like basis)  and by 8.2% to €15.8m in the 4th quarter.The Lidar segment fell by 7.5% to €24.1m (down 6.1% on a like-for-like basis)  down 39.6% in Q4 (to €5.8m)  mainly due to a particularly high basis of comparison vs Q4 2022. The LIDAR business continues to grow strongly in the wind energy sub-segment  where LUMIBIRD sells its Lidar systems directly  and recorded this year a decline in the 3D Scan sub-segment  without however calling into question the strong growth prospects for this market.In Industrial and Scientific activities  the Group ended the year with revenues of €37.4m  stable at-0.1% (-5.0% on a like-for-like basis)  up 19.6% in the 4th quarter (€13.2m)  driven largely by the catching up of production delays in the first quarter. Revenues generated by the CONVERGENT business  acquired at the end of August 2023  are included in Industrial and Scientific activities. They totalled €2.7m in 2023 over 4 months  including €2.1m in Q4 2023.Revenues in the Medical division rose by 5.5% over the year to €102.8m (+7.6% at constant exchange rates)  with a slight decline in the fourth quarter (-3% to €29.8m) due to the postponement of sales to 2024 for regulatory reasons (delay in marketing authorisations) and administrative reasons (new purchasing policy for public hospitals in China). The breakdown of revenues between diagnostics (23%) and treatment (77%) is similar to previous years.The currency effect had a negative impact on revenues of €4.5m in 2023  split between Photonics (€2.4m) and Medical (€2.1m).

The catch-up in Industrial and Scientific sales in the 4th quarter had a favourable impact on the Asia-Pacific region  which grew by 17.3% over the year.The Medical division ended the year with solid growth in Europe (+9%)  while the Americas (-7.7%) and Asia (+3.1%) were affected by the postponement of sales to 2024.OutlookThe level of revenues achieved over the year confirms the expected level of profitability  with an organic EBITDA margin of over 17% for the full 2023 financial year.The Group is maintaining its growth trajectory  driven by the dynamism of its key markets: Defence/Space  Medical and Lidar  where demand is strong in the short and medium term.The CONVERGENT business acquired in 2023 brings to the Group revenues on a new range of fibre lasers and key semiconductor technologies. This acquisition  along with the development of the fibre business at Lannion  provide technological building blocks that will enable the Group to accelerate its vertical expansion over the coming months and bolster its profitable growth. The Convergent business  together with high-power fibre lasers for civil applications  will also enable the Group to develop new medical activities outside ophthalmology. The Convergent business is not expected to be profitable (negative EBITDA) in 2023. The implementation of synergies and the development of sales should enable these activities to achieve financial performance standards in line with those of the Group in the years to come.The Group anticipates more profitable growth in the years ahead  as it reaps the rewards of its investments.Next meeting: Annual results 2023  Tuesday 12 March 2024  after close of tradingLUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading laser specialists.

Following the merger with OneWeb forming Eutelsat Group  and a review of trading for the first three months since completion of the merger  Eutelsat Group provides the following update.The legacy Eutelsat business remains on track with expected performance and confirms a return to top line growth for FY 2023-24  mainly driven by the entry into service of satellites EUTELSAT 10B and KONNECT VHTS.The results of the LEO activities of OneWeb  while progressing well  with 100% of the satellites in place and a backlog of $1.1bn1 at the end of the last quarter  are running behind schedule relative to the original roadmap. This reflects delays in the availability of the ground network  as well as a revenue mix more oriented than expected towards the sale of user terminals  which impacts margins. The delay in the ground network impacts revenues  especially in mobility and in certain geographies where market access is still outstanding.The deployment of the ground network is progressing well  towards a 90% completion rate in Q2 2024. We continue to see strong momentum in the take-up of pre-signed commitments with major customers  and we believe we are on track towards our longer-term targets.Nevertheless  this dynamic will not suffice to close the gap relative to our near-term expectations  and in consequence we are adjusting our financial objectives for FY 2023-24 as follows (at a €/$ rate of 1.00)2:Revenues are now expected in a range of €1.25bn to €1.3bn (versus €1.32bn to €1.42bn previously).Adjusted EBITDA is expected in a range of €650m to €680m (versus €725m to €825m previously).After synergies  cash capex is expected to remain well contained within a €725m to €875m per annum average range over the period FY 2025 to FY 2030; Cash capex for FY 2024 is expected in a range between €600m and €650m.We also continue to target leverage of c.3x in the medium term.To allow for a more accurate assessment of prospects in the context of the rapid development of OneWeb’s business  financial objectives for FY 2024-25 will be reviewed and shared on the occasion of Eutelsat Group’s FY 2023-24 Results on August 2nd  2024; previously communicated objectives for FY 2024-25 are meanwhile suspended.Management remains confident in the prospects of OneWeb and the potential of Eutelsat Group’s unique combined GEO-LEO offer. As the constellation achieves full global operational coverage  we anticipate an acceleration in revenues and continue to target double-digit CAGR in revenues and Adjusted EBITDA between FY 2024 and FY 2028.A conference call hosted by Management will take place at 08.30h CET  today  29th January 2024 Webcast link: https://channel.royalcast.com/landingpage/eutelsat-en/20240129_1/ (The webcast link will remain available for replay) Conference call: France: +33 (0) 1 7037 7166 UK: +44 (0) 33 0551 0200 USA: +1 786 697 3501 Quote Eutelsat to the operator when connecting to the callAbout Eutelsat CommunicationsFounded in 1977  Eutelsat Communications is one of the world's leading satellite operators.

The alfapump is the Company’s fully implantable  wirelessly charged device for patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and received breakthrough device designation from the US FDA in 2019.The PMA application for the alfapump system  which was based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  was submitted with a filing date of 28 December 2023  and is now under substantive review by the FDA. This notification from the FDA was anticipated on 11 February 2024. Pending FDA approval  which the Company anticipates in the second half of 2024  alfapump could become the first active implantable medical device in the US for treating liver ascites.Timur Resch  Global Vice President QM/QA/RA at Sequana Medical  commented: “The acceptance of our PMA file for substantive review by the FDA is an important milestone that reflects the tremendous efforts of our team. This achievement means that the FDA recognizes the completeness of our application and will now begin an in-depth review. We look forward to working closely with the FDA during the review process  with the ultimate goal of making the alfapump available to US patients as soon as possible.”For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579About alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosisRecurrent or refractory ascites is a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period. If approved by the FDA  the alfapump could become the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination.The PMA application submitted to the US FDA was based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada with a total of 69 patients implanted with the alfapump. The primary effectiveness endpoints at six months post-implantation in the Pivotal Cohorti exceeded the predefined thresholds with statistical significance  and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectationsii. Data at 12 months post-implantation continued to show a strong and durable clinical profile  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis and delivering a clinically meaningful improvement in patients’ quality of lifeiii.Data from the patient preference study and a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELDiv registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures and that the safety profile of the alfapump is comparable to standard of care.The North American market of recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is forecast to grow 6-7% per year  from 78 000 patients in 2025  reaching a market opportunity for alfapump of over $2.5 billion by 2035  with NASH being the major driver of growthv. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company’s Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated in the second half of 2024.Results of the Company’s RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR’s mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a DSR clinical study is ongoing  with interim data expected in the second half of 2024. This study is seeking to confirm the strong efficacy seen in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies. All three patients from the MOJAVE non-randomized cohort have been successfully treated with DSR and the DSMB approved the start of the randomized cohort of up to a further 30 patientsSequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Aix-en-Provence  29 January 2024 - 5:45 pm - Affluent Medical (ISIN: FR0013333077 – Ticker: AFME)  a French clinical-phase MedTech company specialising in the international development and industrialisation of innovative medical prostheses  today announced the closing of a €3.5 million bridge financing with its key existing shareholders. This has been completed in the format of a capital increase with cancellation of shareholders’ preferential subscription rights through an offer reserved for a category of beneficiaries. Participating shareholders are the followings: Truffle Capital  LCEA  Ginko Invest  Denos and Hayk Holding. Sébastien Ladet  Chief Executive Officer stated: “As Affluent Medical advances its three clinical programs  each with significant milestones anticipated in 2024  this bridge financing allows us to continue to explore options for securing long term financing for our company and provide us with the flexibility to execute our roadmap. It reflects the confidence from our key shareholders in the strategy and the management of the Company.” Allocation of funds The transaction will enable the Company to finance its operational requirements  specifically covering costs associated with regulatory support for interactions with the FDA concerning Kalios  initiating the pilot study in men for Artus and continuing the pilot study for Epygon. With the closing of the bridge  the financial runway is extended until May 2024 without impacting operational activities. Main terms and conditions of the transaction This capital increase was implemented with the decision of the Board of Directors on January 26  2024  in accordance with the delegation granted by the 6th resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of November 10  2023. The transaction resulted in the issuance of 2 243 588 new ordinary shares  constituting 7.26 % of the Company's current share capital  without preferential subscription right for the benefit of a category of beneficiaries  at a per-share price of €1.56 (including issue premium). This represents about a 10% discount to the volume-weighted average price of Affluent Medical shares on the Euronext Paris regulated market during the twenty trading days preceding the pricing of the offer  in compliance with the sixth resolution of the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting held on November 10  2023. Following this transaction  Affluent Medical share capital now consists of 33.145.236 shares  each with a nominal value of €0.10. For reference  a shareholder who held 1% of the company's share capital before the capital increase will see their interest reduced to 0.93% after the transaction. The settlement-delivery of the new ordinary shares issued in connection with this transaction  along with their admission to trading on the Euronext Paris regulated market under ISIN codeFR0013333077  Ticker: AFME is scheduled for January 31  2024. Company’s funding strategy beyond May 2024 With a view to the period after May 2024  the Company is proactively addressing the ongoing need for financing with active exploration of various options to secure additional funding in terms of equity  strategic partnership  and non-dilutive financing. This approach reflects the Company's commitment to ensuring the necessary resources for its future developments and sustaining its growth trajectory. Michel Therin  Chairman of the Board comments: “Affluent Medical is developing the next generation of medical devices designed to change the approaches towards repairing or replacing the mitral valve  and to cure urinary incontinence. As we move forward to the next step of the clinical program  we are more and more convinced of the value proposal of Kalios  the most advanced product that is the first mitral annuloplasty device that can be percutaneously adjusted for a beating heart  thereby avoiding repeat open-heart surgeries for patients. With the support of numerous renowned surgeons and considering the performance of the device compared to the existing therapeutic options  the board truly think we can bring a medical device to patients and the medical community in the short-term that is able to change and improve the lives of millions of patients.” Impact on the distribution of share capital and voting rights Distribution of share capital and voting rights pre-transaction Prior to the capital increase and on the basis of information available to Affluent Medical  Affluent Medical's share capital was distributed as follows: SHAREHOLDERS DISTRIBUTION OF SHARE CAPITAL AND VOTING RIGHTS ON A NON-DILUTED BASIS Number ofshares % ofshare capital Number ofvoting rights % ofvoting rights Truffle Capital managed funds and holding companies(1) 19 833 718 64.18% 31 666 471 67.56% LCEA 3 166 112 10.25% 3 166 112 6.76% Other financial investors(2) 3 826 371 12.38% 7 483 922 15.97% Co-founders  senior managers and members of the Board of Directors  the Advisory Board and of the Committees 951 715 3.08% 1 589 472 3.39% Including: Ginko Invest 440 391 1.43% 823 582 1.76% Treasury stock 161 275 0.52% 0 0.00% Employees 36 047 0.12% 36 251 0.08% Free float 2 926 410 9.47% 2 927 520 6.25% Including: Hayk holding 148 577 0.48% 148 577 0.32% Denos SA 53 461 0.17% 53 461 0.11% TOTAL 30 901 648 100.00% 46 869 748 100.00% (1) The funds and companies managed by Truffle Capital are : FCPI Fortune III  FCPI Truffle Fortune 4  FCPI Truffle Fortune 5  FCPI Truffle Fortune 6  FCPI UFF Innovation n°12  FCPI UFF Innovation n°14  FCPI UFF Innovation n°15  FCPI UFF Innovation n°16  FCPI UFF Innovation n°17  FCPI Innocroissance 2015  FCPI Innocroissance 2016  FCPI Innocroissance 2018  FCPI Innocroissance 2019  FCPI Truffle Biomedtech Crossover Fund  FCPI Truffle Innov FRR France  Truffle ISF PME 2017  Meningose  Corazan and Truffle Medeor.

Flutter shares were up 1.4% intraday on its first day of trading.Dublin  Ireland-based Flutter trades on the NYSE under the ticker FLUT  making it easier for U.S. investors to purchase a stake in the international sportsbook  which previously traded over-the-counter in the U.S. under the ticker PDYPY. The company will retain its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker FLTR and has suspended its secondary listing on Euronext Dublin.The news comes less than two weeks ahead of Super Bowl LVIII  one of the biggest sports betting events in the U.S.  and just days after Flutter reported strong Q4 earnings. Despite ""customer friendly"" outcomes in the quarter  expanding margins and strong revenue growth in the U.S. helped to offset headwinds.""This is a pivotal moment for the Group as we make Flutter more accessible to US based investors and gain access to deeper capital markets "" CEO Peter Jackson said in a news release. Jackson called the NYSE a ""natural home for Flutter "" citing Fanduel's ""#1 position"" in American markets.FanDuel is the top U.S. sportsbook by net revenue  occupying a hefty 51% of market share in Q4 of 2023. Measured by gross revenue  its market share of 43% slightly lags competitor DraftKings (DKNG)  which has performed better in New York  the biggest sports betting state in the country  and has recently taken the edge in iGaming overall  an umbrella category for online gambling that includes eSports  online casinos  and poker as well as sports betting. Prior to August 2023  FanDuel had been the industry leader in the iGaming segment for several years.While a major competitor landing on American shores could be a cause for concern  analysts aren't too worried about FLUT's listing hurting DKNG shares. “I don’t see [the risk] of folks rotating from DraftKings to Flutter purely off the listing ” Stifel analyst Jeffrey Stantial reportedly said last week. Stantial said the major differentiator for investors could be Flutter's international reach versus DraftKings's domestic focus. DraftKing investors may also be reassured by last week's news that the company is working on a partnership with Barstool Sports  a subsidiary of Penn Entertainment (PENN).",neutral,0.08,0.91,0.01,mixed,0.41,0.31,0.28,True,English,"['FanDuel Parent Flutter', 'NYSE', 'biggest sports betting events', 'biggest sports betting state', 'Stifel analyst Jeffrey Stantial', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'top U.S. sportsbook', 'U.S.-based investors', 'American sports betting market', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Super Bowl LVIII', 'customer friendly"" outcomes', 'deeper capital markets', 'FanDuel parent company Flutter', 'strong revenue growth', 'US based investors', 'strong Q4 earnings', 'CEO Peter Jackson', 'U.S. investors', 'The Flutter listing', 'Barstool Sports', 'international sportsbook', 'American markets', 'American investors', 'market share', 'American shores', 'net revenue', 'gross revenue', 'DraftKing investors', 'Key Takeaways', 'Ireland-based company', 'sizable share', 'first day', 'expanding margins', 'pivotal moment', 'umbrella category', 'online gambling', 'online casinos', 'industry leader', 'several years', 'major competitor', 'major differentiator', 'international reach', 'domestic focus', 'last week', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Ireland-based Flutter', 'primary listing', 'secondary listing', 'Euronext Dublin', 'iGaming segment', 'Penn Entertainment', 'rival DraftKings', 'competitor DraftKings', 'Flutter shares', 'news release', 'DKNG shares', 'NYSE', 'counter', 'analysts', 'stake', 'trading', 'ticker', 'PDYPY.', 'FLTR', 'quarter', 'headwinds', 'Group', 'access', 'country', 'edge', 'eSports', 'poker', 'August', 'cause', 'concern', 'risk', 'folks', 'partnership', 'subsidiary']",2024-01-29,2024-01-30,investopedia.com

It had over 11.1 million average monthly players in Q3 2023  with sports revenue of $1.1 million (€1.01 million) in the same quarter  as well as gaming revenue of $914 000.What’s driving European companies to US exchanges?Although the company announced that it would be moving to the NYSE almost a year ago  it has taken this time to scope out US investors and markets  as well as gauge existing shareholder thoughts about listing in the US. Flutter has reported that markets came across as quite supportive of this decision.As highlighted by CEO Peter Jackson in a press release on 29 January  “With our NYSE listing effective today  this is a pivotal moment for the group as we make Flutter more accessible to US-based investors and gain access to deeper capital markets.”Will Flutter keep its London and Dublin listings?So far  the company had its primary listing in London  on the London Stock Exchange (LSE)  as well as its secondary listing in Dublin  on Euronext Dublin. Its debut on the NYSE is seen as an additional listing. It also had a Euro Stoxx 50 membership  which was dependent on its Euronext Dublin listing.Thus  naturally  one of the main questions that has arisen from this move is what will happen to the company’s Dublin and London listings. Flutter has announced that it had cancelled its Euronext Dublin listing  which automatically also revokes its Euro Stoxx 50 membership. However  it has confirmed that Ireland will continue to be its country of incorporation  as well as headquarters and tax domicile.Flutter has also confirmed that it will continue its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange  via the FTSE 100 index  which is unlikely to change for the time being. However  down the line  Flutter has plans to potentially shift its primary listing to the US.Jackson pointed out: “We believe a US primary listing is the natural home for Flutter given FanDuel’s number 1 position in the US  a market which we expect to contribute the largest proportion of profits in the near future.”For now  the company wants to maintain only two listings  in New York and London  to simplify strategic and regulatory issues.Why is Flutter moving to the US?Flutter has revealed that some of its reasons for moving to the US was to improve the retention and hiring of US-based talent  as well as maximise the company’s profile and reputation in the country. Furthermore  the company believes that the US will provide much larger capital markets as well as several new and better investors.In turn  this will also ensure higher liquidity for the company’s shares. However  the main opportunity in the US lies in the company potentially moving its primary listing there someday and thus  being granted entry into some of the biggest US exchanges.John Tuttle  vice chair of the NYSE said to Euronews' Angela Barnes in Davos recently: “No matter how you look at the data  the United States is the deepest pool of liquidity and capital in the world  which has the broadest investor base. It has a lot of analysts and investors that are focused on growth  not just dividends and value"".As such  it is perhaps not surprising that Flutter Entertainment is hardly the first European company to think of moving across the pond.
