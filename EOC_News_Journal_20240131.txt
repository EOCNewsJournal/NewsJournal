Some €191 billion ($206 billion) out of €260 billion ($291 billion) of Russia’s immobilized reserves are currently held by Belgium’s Euroclear  a central security depository  generating billions as securities reach maturity and are reinvested.According to the draft seen by the FT  profits generated by Euroclear will be booked separately with no dividends to be paid to shareholders until members of the bloc unanimously opt to set up a “financial contribution to the [EU] budget that shall be raised on these net profits to support Ukraine.”The proposed measures are expected to only target future profits and won’t apply retroactively.Last week  sources close to the discussions told Bloomberg that EU foreign ministers had backed applying a windfall tax on Russia’s frozen assets. At the same time  Reuters reported that the EU was unlikely to confiscate the funds despite G7 plans to discuss the legality of doing so at a meeting in February.Moscow has repeatedly warned that any actions related to its assets by the US and its allies would amount to “theft ” stressing that seizure of the funds or any similar move would violate international law and undermine reserve currencies  the global financial system  and the world economy.In April  President Vladimir Putin signed a decree establishing a mechanism to temporarily take over foreign assets in Russia in the event that other countries seize Russian private or government property in their jurisdictions  or threaten the national  energy  or economic security of the country.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.07,0.8,0.13,negative,0.03,0.36,0.61,True,English,"['RT Business News', 'Russian assets', 'council presidency', 'EU', 'profits', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'The Financial Times', 'global financial system', 'EU member states', 'central security depository', 'EU foreign ministers', 'central bank reserves', 'financial contribution', 'economic security', 'EU Council', 'EU Ambassadors', 'EU envoys', 'foreign assets', 'a year', 'Belgian presidency', 'immobilized reserves', 'windfall tax', 'same time', 'G7 plans', 'similar move', 'international law', 'reserve currencies', 'other countries', 'Russian private', 'government property', 'national, energy', 'business section', 'windfall profits', 'frozen assets', 'net profits', 'future profits', 'world economy', 'bloc', 'income', 'Ukraine', 'agreement', 'Brussels', 'Kiev', 'principle', 'proposal', 'use', 'immobilised', 'reconstruction', 'country', 'representatives', 'post', 'Twitter', 'Monday', 'billions', 'euros', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'securities', 'maturity', 'draft', 'dividends', 'shareholders', 'members', 'proposed', 'measures', 'sources', 'discussions', 'Bloomberg', 'Reuters', 'funds', 'legality', 'meeting', 'February', 'Moscow', 'actions', 'allies', 'seizure', 'April', 'decree', 'mechanism', 'event', 'jurisdictions', 'stories', 'finance']",2024-01-30,2024-01-31,rt.com

35545,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/01/30/biden-russia-ukraine-assests-banks-senate/,The U.S. Is Considering Giving Russia’s Frozen Assets to Ukraine,The unprecedented move could offer a tidy way to make Moscow pay for Ukraine’s reconstruction.,What was seen as an outlandish idea two years ago—that frozen Russian assets could be used to pay for war-torn Ukraine’s reconstruction—is edging closer to becoming reality  in what could become a landmark precedent in international law.What was seen as an outlandish idea two years ago—that frozen Russian assets could be used to pay for war-torn Ukraine’s reconstruction—is edging closer to becoming reality  in what could become a landmark precedent in international law.Financial institutions in the United States and Europe hold about $300 billion worth of Russian state assets that were frozen at the start of the war and which  if seized  could go a long way toward paying for the damage wrought by the invasion. The World Bank last year estimated the cost of that damage to be over $400 billion  and it has only grown since.In the early days of the war  U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen dismissed the idea of seizing Russian assets as not “legally permissible.” But the notion has seen momentum recently  in part due to Russia’s continued assault on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and in part due to growing concerns over the near-term future of U.S. and Western aid for Kyiv.Last week  the U.S. Senate advanced legislation that would authorize the seizure of frozen Russian state funds  following a similar measure earlier in the House of Representatives. The Biden administration has backed the bill after carefully examining the legal ramifications.Canada already has such a law in the works. The European Union has agreed in principle to the idea of seizing at least the interest earned from frozen Russian assets for Ukraine’s reconstruction. The G-7 will further discuss using Russian money to rebuild Ukraine at a meeting next month. And a gaggle of foreign-policy luminaries made the case for such a move just last week.“We should be prepared to do some innovative thinking about how we use these resources to help Ukraine ” British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  this month.Such a move would be unprecedented in its scope  and it presents a complex set of legal challenges that critics fear could undermine the principle of state sovereign immunity and even erode confidence in Western financial institutions and currencies.But the fight over the move from freeze to seize is important not just for the future of Ukraine and the calculus of Russian President Vladimir Putin today. Leading scholars of international law argue that confiscation would set a positive precedent while failing to do so would constrain future efforts. “Whichever decision is made  it will become a defining precedent whenever future aggression is confronted—and a decisive factor in the frequency with which such aggression again threatens civilization ” Harvard University’s Laurence Tribe and colleagues wrote in a seminal paper last fall.Similar appropriations of state assets have happened before  most notably the United Nations-sanctioned U.S. seizure of billions of dollars of Iraqi funds that were earmarked for reparations for Kuwait in the wake of the 1990 invasion. The United States did something similar  on a much smaller scale  with a portion of frozen Afghan central bank funds after the Taliban took over Kabul in 2021.But the potential seizure of hundreds of billions of dollars—roughly half the total assets of the Russian Central Bank at the outbreak of war—would be a significant change in how countries respond to aggressor states  with the ability to reshape international law with an eye to future conflicts.“I don’t see a legal obstacle. There’s clearly a moral imperative. And any economic risk can be mitigated by countries doing this together ” said Harold Hongju Koh  a former State Department legal advisor in the Obama administration and professor at Yale Law School  who is advising Ukraine in its cases before the International Court of Justice at The Hague. “If everyone does it together  it creates a new precedent.“Every single attack  and every bit of damage  was exacerbated by Putin’s lack of restraint  so you want to create a system where there’s a deterrent—if there’s a future dictator who understands that every such decision adds to the amount of money they’re going to have to pay back  they might decide differently.”Russian officials are gearing up for a fight in the event the country’s assets are seized  threatening legal action in courts in Europe and the United States. Putin already signed a decree in December seizing the Russian assets of a number of European companies  including those of the Danish beer company Carlsberg and the French yogurt manufacturer Danone. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has warned that Moscow has a list of Western assets  reportedly nearly as large as the frozen Russian funds in the West  that could be seized in retaliation. A spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry dismissed the potential move as “21st-century piracy” this month.But even though momentum for asset confiscation is building  it’s not a done deal by any means. The United States holds only a small portion of the frozen Russian assets—with estimates of between $40 billion and $60 billion or so. The vast majority are held in Europe  especially in Belgium’s Euroclear financial clearing house  but the EU and most member states are lukewarm about the idea of moving to outright seizure of Russian funds  fearing retaliation by Moscow. Proponents of the asset seizure agree that the move would be much more effective if done collectively  rather than by one or two countries  both in terms of the dollar amounts involved but also in collectively defending against any potential retaliation.Debate around the seizure of Russian sovereign assets has mirrored that of many pivotal decisions taken by Ukraine’s Western partners during the course of the war—including decisions to send tanks and offensive weapons to the Ukrainian military. In a pattern that has played out many times before  Washington and London have come around on the question before cajoling an anxious Europe to join forces.Meanwhile  Ukraine worries about not just the cost of future reconstruction but also the continued flow of Western  especially U.S.  financial and military aid due to Republican obstructionism in the U.S. Congress.“We need to get to the moment where we can reconstruct the country  and unless we have the money to defend ourselves  we might not get to the point where we can reconstruct ourselves ” said Illia Chernohorenko  a former official at the Ukrainian Justice Ministry and former advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. His parents were bombed out of their apartment during the first month of the war and have been refugees ever since. Chernohorenko is now getting another doctorate in international law at the University of Oxford  researching issues such as moving from asset freeze to asset seizure.But before Ukraine can get its hands on that money needed for rebuilding  questions remain about the legality of such a seizure. The United States already has the authority  under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act  to confiscate state funds; the new legislation currently before Congress is just meant to clarify that authority and specifically earmark its use for Ukraine’s reconstruction. Other countries  such as the United Kingdom  would need to pass new legislation to be able to move from freezing assets to seizing them.One of the main objections to the plan  from both Moscow and some Western legal experts  is that such asset confiscation could violate Russia’s sovereign immunity. Seizing assets of individuals and private companies  such as those on designated sanctions lists  presents few legal issues. But seizing funds belonging to a sovereign state’s central bank could  critics say  run afoul of the idea that states are essentially immune from legal remedies and would itself be a violation of international law.Proponents dismiss those concerns. For starters  they say  sovereign immunity only applies to states facing judicial action by other nations  not executive or legislative remedies. More to the point  they say  Russia  by its illegal invasion of Ukraine and widespread and well-documented commission of war crimes  has essentially forfeited its right to be treated as a sovereign  the same way sovereign immunity is waived when state corporations engage in business fraud.“You can’t act like a private murderer and say  ‘I should be defended like a sovereign actor ’” Koh said.Others have argued that the line  such as it was  was crossed when the funds were frozen at the outset of the war. That’s one reason why many are sanguine about concerns of capital flight away from the Western financial system.“What are you talking about  ‘the sanctity of sovereign funds’? We’ve crossed that line  let’s not kid ourselves ” said Daniel Fried  a former U.S. ambassador to Poland. “The Chinese saw what we did  the Saudis saw what we did  and they didn’t pull their money out of our banks.”Another big issue is the so-called doctrine of countermeasures. In theory  a state that suffers a violation of international law—such as an illegal invasion—has the right to redress that wrong  even if that means temporarily violating international law itself. What’s more  if the aggressor state has violated universal norms  such as the U.N. Charter  all states have the right to resort to countermeasures. That’s the basic rationale that proponents point to for the move from collective asset freezes to outright seizures.The tricky part is that countermeasures are meant to be reversible. If Western countries do move to seize Russian funds and distribute them to Ukraine  the measure would clearly not be reversible. Critics say that’s one reason the move could be counterproductive: With the funds disposed of  Russia would have little incentive to end its war in Ukraine.But proponents of confiscation dismiss that concern as well  principally by arguing that any such distribution of funds to Ukraine can be seen essentially as a down payment by Russia on the war reparations that it would be legally obliged to pay in any event but likely never will voluntarily. Since the war damage already far exceeds the $300 billion or so in Western hands  giving the money to Ukraine is for all intents and purposes reversible because Russia would have been on the hook for that and more at some time in the future anyway.There are also practical considerations. The Russian funds are held in many different countries  in many different forms—securities  government bonds  and so on. That could complicate efforts to turn Russia’s frozen riches into usable funds for Ukraine. And unlike in 1991  when the United Nations organized a compensation fund for Kuwait  the Russian veto in the U.N. Security Council means there’s no chance of a similar entity being created this time around.That means the United States  if it goes ahead  and any other countries that join would have to establish some sort of ad hoc fund to administer monies for Ukraine; for the disbursement of $3.5 billion of Afghan reserves  the United States created a commission in Switzerland. Current legislation under consideration on Capitol Hill—the REPO Act—would  if passed  create a Ukraine Support Fund for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance.The lingering legal questions  fears over Russian retaliation  and concerns that asset seizure could undermine global confidence in widely used currencies such as the U.S. dollar  British pound  or the euro are just some reasons that Europe is moving more cautiously on this issue. The latest proposal  which could be finalized next month  involves taking only the proceeds of frozen Russian assets—interest accrues to about $3 billion a year—and using that for Ukraine. Proponents of outright confiscation say the EU compromise measure is too small to make a dent in Ukraine’s huge reconstruction bill and also faces the same potential legal challenges as more vigorous actions.As Russia’s war on Ukraine  the biggest challenge to the international order since World War II  staggers into its third year  it’s becoming clear that Moscow’s actions are reshaping more than frontiers and front lines: They are potentially laying the groundwork for a seismic change in international law. Sovereign impunity  after this  might be a thing of the past.“They started a war  and they’re going to hide behind law?

The perfect occasion for Sofitel to launch its Haute Croissanterie concept  which invites chefs around the world to reinvent the delicious French breakfast icon.One of the most delicious French symbols of them all. A crisp  flaky and piping hot croissant  straight from the oven. A distinctive pastry reinterpreted worldwide in the Sofitel hotels as the brand celebrates its 60th anniversary this year.Where croissants become Haute CoutureAn iconic French pastry treat  the butter croissant continues to delight anyone and everyone with a sweet or savory tooth – everywhere in the world. On January 30th  World Croissant Day  Sofitel unveils its brand-new concept: the Haute Croissanterie. Initially  this unprecedented experience is launched by ambassadors from three hotels of the brand: Sofitel Dubai The Obelisk in the United Arab Emirates  Sofitel Ambassador Seoul Hotel in South Korea  and Sofitel Legend Casco Viejo in Panama. Together  they perfected the recipe of their Pur Beurre croissant promising the best croissants in town. The ambassadors have collectively trained other pastry chefs in their region to spread their excellence and savoir-faire during a dedicated week in Dubai. Thanks to these 3 ambassadors  30 Sofitel properties will launch Haute Croissanterie. These emblematic destinations will introduce their local creations named “cultural link” croissants  to represent Sofitel  defined by its logo that is a symbol of the bond that connects cultures around the world.Sofitel’s consultant chef at Sofitel  Anne-Cécile Degenne  who has trained all over the planet  came up with this original concept. A devotee of upscale establishments  she searches out high-quality products and enhances them with her unique savoir-faire. In recent months  she worked closely with the kitchen staff of three hotels selected to showcase the Haute Croissanterie. Together  these culinary teams developed new sweet and savory recipes that will be available in our pastry shops from the end of January.Fascinated by French pastry since forever  it's a dream to deploy a concept internationally that unites the brigades of Sofitel hotels  turning the art of cooking into a universal language. Through our Haute Croissanterie concept  we've managed to bring together a community of passionate pastry chefs from around the world  who have enjoyed competing creatively together to surprise and delight our customers by reimagining the universal emblem of the French breakfast.

Aspirant Consulting will be consolidated from February 1  2024.Revenue growth of +26% in Q3 2023/24 – equivalent to +10% organic growthIn Q3 of the 2023/24 fiscal year (October 1 to December 31  2023)  Wavestone generated consolidated revenue of €175.6m  an increase of +26% compared with Q3 of the previous fiscal year.As a reminder  Wavestone has integrated the British firms PEN Partnership  since August 1  2022  andCoeus Consulting  since October 1  2022. In addition  since December 1  2023  Wavestone has consolidated Q_PERIOR  a German consulting firm.On a constant scope and forex basis  Q3 revenue was up +10%.At the end of the first nine months of the fiscal year  Wavestone's consolidated revenue amounted to €452.2m  an increase of +20% – equivalent to +12% at constant scope and on a constant forex basis. As a reminder  the working day impact was unfavorable over the period – standing at -1.5%[1].Excluding Q_PERIOR  nine-month revenue totaled €427.6m. Note that  excluding Q_PERIOR and Aspirant Consulting  Wavestone is targeting annual revenue of over €580m.Consultant utilization rate stabilized at 73% over the nine-month  good level of order bookOn Wavestone scope  excluding Q_PERIOR  after its recovery in the first half of 2023/24  the nine-month consultant utilization rate remained stable at 73%.The average daily rate for the nine months reached €898 – an increase of +1% compared with the average sales price for the whole of the previous fiscal year (€890). At constant exchange rates  the average daily rate was €900  slightly down compared with the €902 published for the 1st half of the year.On the sales side  order intake showed strong momentum at the end of the calendar year  as it is typically the case during this period. As a result  the firm's order book stood at 4.2 months of work at December 31  2023  compared with 3.6 months at the end of September 2023.These indicators relate to Wavestone's scope excluding Q_PERIOR while waiting to deploy consolidated operating indicators across the new firm.Stable staff turnover rate and moderate recruitment policy maintainedStaff turnover remained stable over the past quarter. At the end of December  it stood at 14% on a rolling 12-month basis (a figure calculated on the scope excluding Q_PERIOR)  compared with 16% over the whole of the previous fiscal year.Given the still uncertain economic environment and the reduction in staff turnover  Wavestone is maintaining a moderate rate of recruitment compared with the previous fiscal year.At December 31  2023  Wavestone had 5 764 employees  including 1 332 from the combination with Q_PERIOR since December 1  2023. This compares with 4 406 at the end of March – the end of the 2022/23 fiscal year.A solid business activity in Q3  both for Wavestone and Q_PERIORWavestone's activity in Q3 was solid as a result of intense business development efforts by the firm's teams  despite the deterioration in the economic environment.Business activity was also strong across Q_PERIOR's scope  with an increase in consultant utilization rate and a good level of order intake. In line with the rest of the firm  Q_PERIOR's recruitment policy was cautious  while the staff turnover rate remained at a low level of about 10%.Caution maintained for the start of 2024While the tougher business environment continues to impact global demand  in particular in several sectors  such as banking  retail  and the public sector  others such as insurance  energy  luxury  and transport remain more resilient.Q4 of the fiscal year is likely to see a marked slowdown in the firm's growth at constant scope and exchange rates. Consultant utilization rate will be down slightly  penalized by increased hesitancy among decision makers in proceeding with projects  especially at the start of the calendar year  as well as less favorable market conditions in the UK in recent months.Wavestone remains nevertheless confident that it can sustain its growth in the months ahead  maintaining intense business development activity focused on the best-positioned sectors.Q_PERIOR begins the 2024 calendar year with an utilization rate following its performance in the final months of 2023  but as for Wavestone  with a marked slowdown in growth.Strengthening position in the US with the acquisition of Aspirant ConsultingIn mid-January  Wavestone announced the acquisition of Aspirant Consulting[2] in the United States a consulting firm specializing in the digital transformation of businesses and consisting of about 100 employees.Founded in 2003 and based in Pittsburgh  Aspirant Consulting's clients include Global 500 companies as well as large US companies  across multiple sectors  and with a strong footprint in Life Sciences.Over its last fiscal year (ending December 31  2023)  Aspirant Consulting estimated consolidated revenue is $26.1m (€23.8m)  with an adjusted EBITDA margin expected to be over 10%.Aspirant Consulting will be consolidated into Wavestone's accounts from February 1  2024.Confirmation of 2023/24 financial objectives (excluding Q_PERIOR and Aspirant Consulting)At the end of the first nine months of the fiscal year and including the slowdown expected in Q4  Wavestone confirms its objective of achieving  for the 2023/24 fiscal year  organic growth at least equal to that of the 2022/23 fiscal year (+7%).With the consolidation of PEN Partnership and Coeus Consulting  Wavestone confirms its objective of achieving revenue of over €580m  which represents total growth of +9% for an EBIT margin of about 15%.These objectives are set at constant exchange rates  and  at this stage  do not include the contribution of Q_PERIOR (consolidated for four months)  and Aspirant Consulting (consolidated for two months).Next event: publication of Q4 2023/24 revenue – Monday  April 29  2024  after Euronext market closing.About WavestoneWavestone  a leading independent consultancy headquartered in France  and Q_PERIOR  a consulting leader in the Germany-Switzerland-Austria region  joined

An historic figure in the Guerbet Group  Michel Guerbet was the son of André  who founded the laboratory in 1926  and the grandson of Marcel  who co-developed Lipiodol® in 1901.When his father André died in 1964  Nicole Guerbet  Michel's sister and a pharmacist by training  temporarily took over the reins of the company at a time when such training was required to run a laboratory. Then the law changed and Michel Guerbet  a doctor and researcher  took over.That was in 1965. At that time  Guerbet had 150 employees and generated only 33% of its sales from exports. It was under Michel's impetus and strategic vision that Guerbet developed its industrial network and international footprint  with the construction of plants in Aulnay (1968)  Lanester (1981) and Rio (1991)  the purchase and development of Simafex  starting in 1987  and the creation of subsidiaries in Europe  Asia and Brazil.Twenty-five years later  in 1990  Guerbet had no fewer than 1 000 employees and sales of 700 million francs.Michel Guerbet was also the man who imbued the Group with a strong R&D culture  leading to a number of successes and a series of major innovations in medical imaging  including Hexabrix®  the first low-osmolality ionic product (1979)  and Dotarem®  the first macrocyclic gadolinium-based product (1989). He also gave a new lease of life to Lipiodol® in the early 1980s  extending its use to interventional imaging.After 1998  Michel Guerbet kept a foot in the Group for a long time  whether on the Board of Directors  of which he remained Chairman until 2001  or through his presence at numerous events celebrating the laboratory. The people of Aulnay fondly remember his last visit to Aulnay for the site's fiftieth anniversary  in 2018.The Group owes a great deal to Michel Guerbet  and will always bear the imprint of this man of exceptional ability  who maintained a straightforward attitude and a keen interest in the life of the company and its employees.The Guerbet family also reiterates its attachment to the stability of the eponymous Group's shareholding structure  characterized by the pact between all heirs and family members. The family is fully committed to supporting the Group in its operational development and the achievement of its medium- and long-term strategic objectives.About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better. That is our purpose.

The study has been conducted in Belgium with a total of 102 patients enrolled. Efficacy was evaluated by assessing the clinical outcome and mycological outcome to the treatment. A positive clinical outcome is a resolution of VVC signs and symptoms whereas the mycological outcome is determined by a vaginal swab indicating the absence of Candida species yeast.Top line results are summarized:At day 29 1   day 57 and day 85  the low dose (MCZ and 0.14% of DB) demonstrated superior efficacy compared to the active control (MCZ).  day 57 and day 85  the low dose (MCZ and 0.14% of DB) demonstrated superior efficacy compared to the active control (MCZ). At day 15  both doses administered demonstrated positive safety and tolerability without significant superiority over the active control.MCZ-DB was well tolerated in both dose cohorts  with no reported serious adverse events.Following the treatments  there was no indication of systemic exposure to Domiphen Bromide.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: “I am thrilled to announce promising outcomes for MCZ-DB  showcasing outstanding safety and tolerability in both cohorts. Additionally  the low dose demonstrated significant superiority over the active control by day 291. The primary objective of this trial was to identify the most effective dosage of DB (0.14% or 0.29%) for treating VVC. With these encouraging findings  we are now prepared to engage in discussions with relevant authorities for further clinical investigations”.About severe and recurring VVC and MCZ-DBVVC is a prevalent vaginal fungal infection primarily caused by the yeast Candida albicans  affecting as many as one in every two women during their life  with about 175 million units (treatments) sold annually worldwide2. Up to 20% of VVC patients develop severe to recurrent VVC characterized by reinfection occurring more than four times per year. These are long-term conditions that cause significant pain and distress  with an estimated economic burden from lost productivity projected up to $14.39 billion annually by 20303. There is a high unmet need for novel treatment options in severe and rVVC as current standard of care treatments have significant drawbacks  including lack of efficacy  the development of drug resistance due to continued use and liver toxicity4. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the activity of Miconazole (MCZ)  the current topical standard of care  when combined with the Miconazole potentiator Domiphen Bromide  can combat the occurrence and recurrence of mucosal biofilm-related vaginal Candida infections5. MCZ and DB work synergistically where DB increases the permeability of the plasma membrane and the vacuolar membrane of Candida spp.  and MCZ acting fungicidal  thereby destroying fungal activity and potentially preventing further fungal growth. The synergistic mode-of-action of topical MCZ-DB has the potential to be effective against azole-resistant infections  possibly addressing the high unmet needs in recurring VVC6.About Hyloris Pharmaceuticals SAHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.The Company’s development strategy primarily focuses on leveraging established regulatory pathways  such as the FDA’s 505(b)2 pathway in the U.S or equivalent regulatory frameworks in other regions which are specifically designed for pharmaceuticals for which safety and efficacy of the molecule have already been established.

In addition the year-to-date performance figure has been amended from +22.0% to +24.5%.Please note that this has not impacted the NAV as reported on 16 January 2024.This announcement also contains a link to the revised December 2023 Monthly Report which has been reissued to reflect the changes noted above.AXA IM has published the Volta Finance Limited (the “Company” or “Volta Finance” or “Volta”) monthly report for December 2023. The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).********PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYVolta Finance posted yet another positive monthly performance of +0.6% in December 2023 (+2.6% including the January dividend payment). This concluded a calendar year where Volta recorded a positive production each month of year to the exception of March (-1.5% MoM) and June (flat). All-in  the year-to-date performance settled at +24.5%  Volta’s strongest since 2013.Despite challenges stemming from geopolitical tensions and Central Bank policy anticipations  broader markets remained composed in December and managed to shrug volatility off as central banks indicated by mid-month that they would maintain rates unchanged. This essentially signaled a pause in the rate hikes cycle as the Federal Reserve acknowledged indications of softer economic growth  prompting traders to price three rate cuts for 2024. Fixed income markets rallied  for instance both Investment Grade and High Yield spreads tightened over the quarter.In the CLO space  market remained active both in Primary and Secondary. As Primary gradually slowed down into Christmas  spreads tightened significantly across all rated tranches and lifted valuations up. We saw notably a decent appetite on low mezzanine assets especially for tranches that had underperformed their peers price-wise due to worsening collaterals quality. A pivot in rates may provide relief to the weakest companies those CLOs are specifically exposed to  prompting bids up.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: +1.0% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +4.0% for CLO Equity tranches  +5.0% for CLO Debt tranches and -5.9% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS.In terms of fund management  while Volta’s 2015-3 Equity piece from Oak Hill Advisors was redeemed  USD 5.00mm of BB-rated risk (+885bps) as well as EUR 2.00mm of Single-B risk (+1125bps) were sourced  both from the Primary market since it offered better value and cleaner collateral pools compared to the Secondary offerings that were available.As of end of December 2023  Volta’s NAV was €245.1m  i.e. €6.70 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 7.16% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.72% as at 21 December 2023  5.44% as at 30 November.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A.

The patent  titled “Use of metal ions to potentiate the therapeutic effects of arsenic ” covers the use of ATO platform in combination with metal ions such as copper. This combination has shown the ability to significantly improve the treatment of autoimmune diseases and could be applied to the treatment of various forms of cancer conditions and infectious pathologies related to cytokine storms. Similar protection had been granted in Europe and Australia last year  together with a first patent acceptance in China  which opened the doors for further divisional applications in addition to the primary decision limited to graft-versus-host disease (GvHD).BioSenic is exploring the therapeutic use of ATO for a number of indications. The company has recently published peer-reviewed data from several preclinical studies elucidating ATO’s mechanisms for modulating immune responses  and the ability of certain metal ions to enhance this therapeutic potential. The actual growing portfolio of intellectual property rights is part of a strategy to build dense and meaningful protection for its lead product  paving the way for clinical and commercial developments by BioSenic and interested partners  particularly in the field of autoimmunity.The new patent  granted to BioSenic’s subsidiary company Medsenic  involves two main immediate areas of application. The first one is in immune- and autoimmune-related diseases – specifically  the BioSenic’s lead project in 2024  chronic GvHD and  later on  systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. The second is in oncology  where ATO has already demonstrated exceptional results for patients  including complete remission in acute promyelocytic leukaemia. These patents will support BioSenic’s plans for international clinical trials in pathologies with unmet medical needs  toward the company’s long-term goal of seeking market access approvals for its various formulations  optimizing the original properties of arsenic salts – alone or in combination.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and CEO of BioSenic said: “This newly granted patent in Canada further structures our intellectual property rights on the formulations and compositions of matter related to the extraordinary properties of arsenic salts  which we find to generally reorient organisms toward normal function and homeostasis in various cells and organs. We are happy to open new chapters in the continuous  worldwide effort in trying to control chronic or lethal diseases with no real cure.”The expected availability of an oral formulation that combines arsenic and copper puts BioSenic in a unique position to build on clinical successes in its fields of applications. As a result  BioSenic will be able to continue clinical development with proprietary original formulations containing arsenic and new active ingredients such as metal ions  increasing the potency of its products  and minimizing secondary side effects.The Canadian patent  corresponding to Application 3 138 472  was granted to Medsenic  a subsidiary of BioSenic. The similar patents were granted by European Union Intellectual Property Office (EP3972613) in April 2023  by China National Intellectual Property Administration in August 2023  and by Australia Patent Office in December 2023  respectively.About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company specializing in the clinical development of autoimmune disease therapies. Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning  key strengths and strong IP to develop products along two tracks  separately and in combination. The first platform leverages immunomodulatory properties of arsenic trioxide (ATO) for an entirely new arsenal of formulations  including oral delivery (OATO)  for anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune indications such as chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). In parallel  BioSenic develops innovative products through a second platform that includes cell therapies and strong IP protection for tissue repair technologies.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic's technology platformsThe ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in autoimmunity to treat in its chronic  established stage. Chronic GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)  a curative treatment for patients with serious blood diseases  including cancers.BioSenic’s intravenous ATO formulation  Arscimed®  has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA  and it has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy for skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract in an early Phase 2a study. The company is planning a confirmatory international Phase 3 study with its oral ATO (OATO) formulation. OATO will also target moderate-to-severe forms of SLE. BioSenic is also developing a new IP-protected OATO formulation for the treatment of SSc  a serious chronic disease that affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models support the launch of a Phase 2 clinical trial.ALLOB is an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated  bone marrow-sourced mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point-of-use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair  and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated MSCs from healthy donors into bone-forming cells at the site of injury. BioSenic is studying the results of a Phase 2 trial to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB by determining the best timing for therapeutic intervention and seeking partners to continue the development of the promising underlying therapy strategies.The company is also exploring partnerships at all levels for its JTA-004 viscosupplement for a severe inflammatory subtype of osteoarthritis  following a positive post hoc analysis of Phase 3 data demonstrating safety and efficacy in support of this licensing.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsMichelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ghislaine.gasparetto@seitosei-actifin.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

This good performance is fuelled by the growth in the slot machines GGR (+7.6%)  the GGR of electronic forms of traditional games in France (+20.3%) and the online games in Switzerland (+41.6%).The Net Gaming Revenue (NGR) increases to € 332.9 M over the whole year by +9.0%  benefiting from a favourable effect over the first part of the year.Turnover excluding NGR improves by +9.6% to € 94.3 M.Globally  the 2023 consolidated turnover increases by +9.0% reaching € 423.8 M.Goof financial performanceEBITDA appears generally stable at € 76.1 M (compared to € 75.6 M a year earlier) and represents 18.0% of turnover. However  restated for additional “closure” aids received in the previous financial year in the amount of € 4.9 M  2023 the EBITDA increases by +€ 5.4 M  demonstrating a significant improvement in operational performance.Current Operating Income (COI) increases reaching € 27.4 M (+18.3%)  thanks to the return to normal activity over the entire financial year  and mainly under the influence of the casino sector.Purchases & external expenses increases by +€ 20.6 M (+16.9%)  mainly impacted by:Purchases of materials up by +€ 7.4 M (+19.5%) resulting both from the surge in energy prices of +€ 4.8 M (+43.1%) and the increase in purchases of solids and liquids for +€ 2.0 M (+11.5%) thus reflecting the dynamics of the activity;Advertising & marketing costs and fees up respectively by +€ 8.0 M (+38.2%) and +€ 2.0 M (+9.9%) directly linked with the return to a normal activity and marketing operations related to the 50 year anniversary of Groupe Partouche (particularly through the free allocation of “promo credits” for games  an increase of +€ 4.7 M).In opposition  the Meyrin casino  whose concession renewal was obtained for a period of 20 years until 2045  reduces advertising expenses and communication fees related to its online activity (-€ 0.8 M  or -9.0%).Taxes and duties decrease from € 17.3 M in 2022 to € 16.9 M in 2023  i.e. -2.1%.Employees expenses reach € 177.2 M  up by +€ 9.3 M (+5.5%) mainly due to the effects of the increase in the legal minimum wage as at 1st January & 1st May 2023  the revaluation of 2023 salary scales and the end of the use of the partial activity regime from which the Group had benefited in the previous financial year.The change in amortization and depreciation of fixed assets  down by -4.9% to € 48.9 M  reflects the various ends of depreciation cycles as well as the limitation of renewal investments during the health crisis.The item “Other current operating income and expenses” represents a net expense of -€ 10.8 M  compared to +€ 6.9 M over the previous financial year. This is due to the fact that the Group no longer benefits from the Government additional ""closure"" aid amounting to € 4.9 M over the financial year in order to fight the consequences of the health crisis. Moreover  the expenses related to the casinos’ concessions specifications increase (+€ 0.5M)  correlatively to GGR. Conversely  we note a favourable trend in changes in the provisions.The 2023 Operating Income reaches € 27.4 M  after considering a non-current operating income (NCOI) almost at zero (+€ 0.04 M). It is to be compared to the 2022 operating income of € 40.7 M which took into account a NCOI of +€ 17.6M  principally composed of a result on the disposal of consolidated shares of +€ 14.1 M relating to the sale of 57% of the shares of the Crans-Montana casino.The financial income totalled -€ 2.9 M (compared to -€ 2.3 M in 2022). This increase is mainly due to the financial expenses linked to IFRS 16 rental debts (€ 1.2 M  including € 0.8 M for the Middelkerke casino alone). Furthermore  in the context of rising interest rates  the group's annual average cost of debt increases slightly (+€ 1.2 M) despite the further reduction in the Group's gross debt. This increase is  however  largely offset by investment income which is up by +€ 1.4 M.Tax expenses (CVAE included) is globally stable (-€ 1.1 M compared to € 1.2 M in 2022).Ultimately  Groupe Partouche generates a profit of € 23.4 M (of which the Group’s share amounts to € 18.9 M) compared to € 37.1 M in 2022.Healthy and solid financial structureWe can note an increase in the non-current assets of the consolidated balance sheet by +€ 20.5 M due to:The increase in “tangible fixed assets” (+€ 16.7 M) resulting  among other things  from ongoing investments in various establishment renovation projects  more particularly  an increase in the item fixed assets in progress of +€ 18.7 M (including mainly the works at the casinos of the Lyon Vert for € 9.1 M  Annemasse for € 4.5 M and Middelkerke for € 1.8 M) as well as the item advances and deposits on fixed assets for +€ 10.1 M (including  essentially  the works at the casinos of Saint-Amand for € 7.4 M and Divonne for € 1.6 M);The increase in shareholdings in equity-accounted companies due in particular to the acquisition of an additional 34% stake in the companies of the La Pensée Sauvage division (+€ 2.3 M).Conversely  we note a decrease in the current assets of -€ 14.4 M principally due to active cash consumption of -€ 17.5 M explained by investments during the period  mainly financed by issuing new bank loans and through the payment of dividends to the Group's shareholders  as well as to minority shareholders  amounting to € 6.7 M in total.On the liabilities side  the Group’s Equity  minority shareholders included  increases by +€ 12.8 M reaching € 366.9 M following the beneficiary income of the financial year that amounted to € 18.9 M (Group’s share).The financial debt decreases by -€ 8.4 M (current and non-current share) after taking into account:the settlement of the four quarterly instalments of the syndicated loan in the amount of -€ 10.8 M;the reimbursement of other bank loans for -€ 17.2 M;the setting up of new credits for +€ 21.5 M;as well as the net impact of lease contracts treatment according to IFRS 16 for -€ 1.2 M (notably up  the subscriptions of new real estate contracts found in an increase in non-current assets  and down  the payment of deadlines of the financial year).The financial debt amounts to € 53.9 M  up by € 7.6 M.The financial structure of the Group remains healthy with the ratios of leverage (Net Debt / EBITDA) and gearing (Net Debt/Equity) respectively of 0.8x and 0.1x (compared to 0.7x and 0.1x in 2022).OutlookMiddelkerke (Belgium)Since the partnership signed last June  between Groupe Partouche and Betsson  the Middelkerke casino has been granted the necessary license authorising the operation of attractive online casino games adapted to the Belgian regulated market  starting from the end of January 2024.Furthermore  the Middelkerke casino that was temporarily operated in an outlying hotel since its entry into the Group in July 2022  is to be transferred at the end of March  to the seafront  a privileged location.Dividends under financial year 2022/2023After the resumption last year of the distribution policy  Groupe Partouche plans to distribute a dividend again for the 2022/2023 financial year  the amount and payment terms of which will soon be specified and submitted to a shareholders’ vote during the General Meeting to be held on 20th March 2024.Continuation of the investments in the existing sitesConstantly aiming in its establishments for excellence in the customer experience  the Group continues to enrich its offering and renovates its casino fleet in order to improve its performance  in that respect:The Le Lyon Vert casino in La Tour-de-Salvagny is undergoing a major restructuring of its existing spaces with the creation of an important extension on two levels (ground floor and 1 st floor). The project should end in May 2024;floor). The project should end in May 2024; Extensive works continue at the Annemasse casino. The left wing and a first outdoor smoking room were opened at the end of December 2023. The second phase of work  which will be completed in the summer of 2024  will notably make it possible to create an extension to the front and a second outdoor room;The Divonne casino is undergoing a total renovation in order to regain its initial grandeur. This should be completed in September 2024;The Contrexéville casino will benefit from a reorganization: the games main room will be transferred under the theater decor and the restaurant will also be positioned on the park side with an adjoining kitchen. Initiated in November 2023  the project should be completed in December 2024;The Vichy casino is undergoing a complete renovation  which aims to increase the gaming areas  modernize and enhance the services offered by this emblematic establishment. Works are scheduled to end in June 2025;Other sites’ renovations will be initiated in the 2024 financial year  in particular for the Saint-Amand-les-Eaux casino.Upcoming events:- Turnover 1st quarter (Nov. 2023-Jan. 2024): Tuesday 12th March 2024 (after stock market closure)- General Meeting: Wednesday 20th March 2024Groupe Partouche was established in 1973 and has grown to become one of the market leaders in Europe in its business sector.

This good performance is fuelled by the growth in the slot machines GGR (+7.6%)  the GGR of electronic forms of traditional games in France (+20.3%) and the online games in Switzerland (+41.6%).The Net Gaming Revenue (NGR) increases to € 332.9 M over the whole year by +9.0%  benefiting from a favourable effect over the first part of the year.Turnover excluding NGR improves by +9.6% to € 94.3 M.Globally  the 2023 consolidated turnover increases by +9.0% reaching € 423.8 M.Goof financial performanceEBITDA appears generally stable at € 76.1 M (compared to € 75.6 M a year earlier) and represents 18.0% of turnover. However  restated for additional “closure” aids received in the previous financial year in the amount of € 4.9 M  2023 the EBITDA increases by +€ 5.4 M  demonstrating a significant improvement in operational performance.Current Operating Income (COI) increases reaching € 27.4 M (+18.3%)  thanks to the return to normal activity over the entire financial year  and mainly under the influence of the casino sector.Purchases & external expenses increases by +€ 20.6 M (+16.9%)  mainly impacted by:Purchases of materials up by +€ 7.4 M (+19.5%) resulting both from the surge in energy prices of +€ 4.8 M (+43.1%) and the increase in purchases of solids and liquids for +€ 2.0 M (+11.5%) thus reflecting the dynamics of the activity;Advertising & marketing costs and fees up respectively by +€ 8.0 M (+38.2%) and +€ 2.0 M (+9.9%) directly linked with the return to a normal activity and marketing operations related to the 50 year anniversary of Groupe Partouche (particularly through the free allocation of “promo credits” for games  an increase of +€ 4.7 M).In opposition  the Meyrin casino  whose concession renewal was obtained for a period of 20 years until 2045  reduces advertising expenses and communication fees related to its online activity (-€ 0.8 M  or -9.0%).Taxes and duties decrease from € 17.3 M in 2022 to € 16.9 M in 2023  i.e. -2.1%.Employees expenses reach € 177.2 M  up by +€ 9.3 M (+5.5%) mainly due to the effects of the increase in the legal minimum wage as at 1st January & 1st May 2023  the revaluation of 2023 salary scales and the end of the use of the partial activity regime from which the Group had benefited in the previous financial year.The change in amortization and depreciation of fixed assets  down by -4.9% to € 48.9 M  reflects the various ends of depreciation cycles as well as the limitation of renewal investments during the health crisis.The item “Other current operating income and expenses” represents a net expense of -€ 10.8 M  compared to +€ 6.9 M over the previous financial year. This is due to the fact that the Group no longer benefits from the Government additional ""closure"" aid amounting to € 4.9 M over the financial year in order to fight the consequences of the health crisis. Moreover  the expenses related to the casinos’ concessions specifications increase (+€ 0.5M)  correlatively to GGR. Conversely  we note a favourable trend in changes in the provisions.The 2023 Operating Income reaches € 27.4 M  after considering a non-current operating income (NCOI) almost at zero (+€ 0.04 M). It is to be compared to the 2022 operating income of € 40.7 M which took into account a NCOI of +€ 17.6M  principally composed of a result on the disposal of consolidated shares of +€ 14.1 M relating to the sale of 57% of the shares of the Crans-Montana casino.The financial income totalled -€ 2.9 M (compared to -€ 2.3 M in 2022). This increase is mainly due to the financial expenses linked to IFRS 16 rental debts (€ 1.2 M  including € 0.8 M for the Middelkerke casino alone). Furthermore  in the context of rising interest rates  the group's annual average cost of debt increases slightly (+€ 1.2 M) despite the further reduction in the Group's gross debt. This increase is  however  largely offset by investment income which is up by +€ 1.4 M.Tax expenses (CVAE included) is globally stable (-€ 1.1 M compared to € 1.2 M in 2022).Ultimately  Groupe Partouche generates a profit of € 23.4 M (of which the Group’s share amounts to € 18.9 M) compared to € 37.1 M in 2022.Healthy and solid financial structureWe can note an increase in the non-current assets of the consolidated balance sheet by +€ 20.5 M due to:The increase in “tangible fixed assets” (+€ 16.7 M) resulting  among other things  from ongoing investments in various establishment renovation projects  more particularly  an increase in the item fixed assets in progress of +€ 18.7 M (including mainly the works at the casinos of the Lyon Vert for € 9.1 M  Annemasse for € 4.5 M and Middelkerke for € 1.8 M) as well as the item advances and deposits on fixed assets for +€ 10.1 M (including  essentially  the works at the casinos of Saint-Amand for € 7.4 M and Divonne for € 1.6 M);The increase in shareholdings in equity-accounted companies due in particular to the acquisition of an additional 34% stake in the companies of the La Pensée Sauvage division (+€ 2.3 M).Conversely  we note a decrease in the current assets of -€ 14.4 M principally due to active cash consumption of -€ 17.5 M explained by investments during the period  mainly financed by issuing new bank loans and through the payment of dividends to the Group's shareholders  as well as to minority shareholders  amounting to € 6.7 M in total.On the liabilities side  the Group’s Equity  minority shareholders included  increases by +€ 12.8 M reaching € 366.9 M following the beneficiary income of the financial year that amounted to € 18.9 M (Group’s share).The financial debt decreases by -€ 8.4 M (current and non-current share) after taking into account:the settlement of the four quarterly instalments of the syndicated loan in the amount of -€ 10.8 M;the reimbursement of other bank loans for -€ 17.2 M;the setting up of new credits for +€ 21.5 M;as well as the net impact of lease contracts treatment according to IFRS 16 for -€ 1.2 M (notably up  the subscriptions of new real estate contracts found in an increase in non-current assets  and down  the payment of deadlines of the financial year).The financial debt amounts to € 53.9 M  up by € 7.6 M.The financial structure of the Group remains healthy with the ratios of leverage (Net Debt / EBITDA) and gearing (Net Debt/Equity) respectively of 0.8x and 0.1x (compared to 0.7x and 0.1x in 2022).OutlookMiddelkerke (Belgium)Since the partnership signed last June  between Groupe Partouche and Betsson  the Middelkerke casino has been granted the necessary license authorising the operation of attractive online casino games adapted to the Belgian regulated market  starting from the end of January 2024.Furthermore  the Middelkerke casino that was temporarily operated in an outlying hotel since its entry into the Group in July 2022  is to be transferred at the end of March  to the seafront  a privileged location.Dividends under financial year 2022/2023After the resumption last year of the distribution policy  Groupe Partouche plans to distribute a dividend again for the 2022/2023 financial year  the amount and payment terms of which will soon be specified and submitted to a shareholders’ vote during the General Meeting to be held on 20th March 2024.Continuation of the investments in the existing sitesConstantly aiming in its establishments for excellence in the customer experience  the Group continues to enrich its offering and renovates its casino fleet in order to improve its performance  in that respect:The Le Lyon Vert casino in La Tour-de-Salvagny is undergoing a major restructuring of its existing spaces with the creation of an important extension on two levels (ground floor and 1 st floor).
