The G7 is planning to begin discussions on the legality of such a move at a meeting in February.“There’s a good amount of work to do ” Johnson told the news agency during a visit to Washington where he discussed the issue with US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo “We’ve got to make sure that we get the detail right ... We’ve got to make sure these things are legally watertight.”The UK needs to protect its reputation as a “safe and stable” place to invest  according to Johnson  who highlighted the acute need to make sure that the rest of the world feels reassured that London is “sticking to the rule of law and property rights.”Shortly after the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine  the EU  US and allies froze around $300 billion of Russian central bank assets. Since then  the G7 nations have been debating seizing the assets and transferring them to Kiev.Most of the frozen reserves are currently sitting at Belgium’s Euroclear  a central security depository  generating billions as securities reach maturity and are reinvested. Belgium announced earlier this month that it would provide Ukraine with military aid to the tune of €611 million and that the source of those funds would be income from the frozen Russian assets.Only about $5-6 billion of the immobilized Russian reserves are being held in the US. Earlier this month  a US Senate committee approved legislation that would help set the stage for Washington to seize those assets.The Kremlin has warned that any step related to Russian reserves by the Western allies would amount to “theft ” highlighting that confiscation of the funds or any similar move would violate international law.Last year  President Vladimir Putin ordered the establishment of a mechanism to temporarily take over foreign assets in Russia in the event that other nations seize Russian private or government property in their jurisdictions  or threaten the national  energy  or economic security of the country.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.05,0.8,0.15,mixed,0.12,0.35,0.53,True,English,"['British investment minister', 'Russian assets', 'caution', 'US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo', 'Russian central bank assets', 'central bank reserves', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'central security depository', 'US Senate committee', 'frozen Russian assets', 'frozen reserves', 'Russian reserves', 'Russian private', 'economic security', 'foreign assets', 'central-bank reserves', 'strict accordance', 'investment minister', 'The G7', 'good amount', 'news agency', 'The UK', 'stable” place', 'acute need', 'property rights', 'military operation', 'G7 nations', 'military aid', 'The Kremlin', 'other nations', 'government property', 'national, energy', 'business section', 'international law', 'Dominic Johnson', 'EU Council', 'Western allies', 'similar move', 'Moscow', 'step', 'Britain', 'Tuesday', 'interview', 'Reuters', 'bloc', 'envoys', 'agreement', 'Brussels', 'income', 'Kiev', 'discussions', 'legality', 'meeting', 'February', 'work', 'visit', 'Washington', 'issue', 'detail', 'things', 'reputation', 'safe', 'rest', 'world', 'London', 'rule', 'launch', 'Ukraine', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'billions', 'securities', 'maturity', 'tune', 'source', 'funds', 'legislation', 'stage', 'confiscation', 'establishment', 'mechanism', 'event', 'jurisdictions', 'country', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2024-01-31,2024-02-01,rt.com

The board therefore proposes that Reidar Fougner (existing member of the board) is elected as new chairman of the board. The board of directors is otherwise proposed to remain unchanged.Shareholder Alden AS proposed resolution on directed issue of shares (item 8)The shareholder Alden AS (the “Shareholder”) proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves on a directed issue of no more than 7 954 546 shares  meaning an increase in the share capital with no more than SEK 2 590 910 in accordance with the following terms and conditions.The shares shall be subscribed for at a price of SEK 1.76  resulting in total subscription proceeds of SEK 14 million. The subscription price corresponds to the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) for the Company’s share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market from January 1  2024  up until January 31  2024. Any share premium shall be added to the unrestricted share premium account.The right to subscribe for shares in the directed share issue shall best vest in Fougner Invest AS  Alden AS  TTC Invest AS  Windchange Invest AB  Bimo Kapital AS  Baklid Invest AS  Helling Invest AS  Frenisa AS  Norse Partners AS  Trellevika Invest AS  Camelback Holding AS  KES AS  OneTwo3 AS  Skadi AS  Norse AS  Erling Johnsen A/S  Torsen Tankers  Robert Keith  Nucleus Life AG  Camelback Eiendom  Golhus AS and Fredrik Fougner. Prior to the directed share issue  the Shareholder has also considered the possibility to propose that the Company raises capital through a rights issue but has concluded that a rights issue would be significantly more time-consuming and entail significantly higher costs and increased exposure to potential market volatility compared to a directed share issue. Furthermore  the current climate on the stock market means that in the event of a rights issue  it is likely that the rights issue would not be subscribed to the required extent and that guarantee commitments must therefore be procured to ensure that the Company is provided with sufficient capital  which in turn risks incurring additional costs and/or further dilution depending on the type of consideration paid for such guarantee commitments. Other alternatives  including the raising of a long-term loan  have also been considered but have either been deemed to entail too high costs or not to generate sufficient working capital and thus not to be in the interest of the Company or the Shareholders. Provided this  the Shareholder has made the assessment that a directed new share issue on the proposed terms is the most favorable for the Company and its shareholders  especially because the Company is in need of immediate financing. The Shareholder also assesses that the Subscription price  which corresponds to the closing price of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq First North Growth Market for the last completed trading day  is to be on market terms.Subscription of the shares shall be made on a subscription list that is kept available to the subscribers. Subscription shall be made no later than one (1) week after the general meeting has resolved to carry out the directed share issue. However  the board of directors is entitled to extend the subscription period.Payment for the shares shall be made in cash no later than three (3) banking days after the last day of subscription. However  the board of directors is entitled to postpone the last day of payment.The new shares shall entitle to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately after the directed share issue has been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered in the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.A valid resolution pursuant to this item requires that the resolution be supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting.Resolution to authorise the board of directors to undertake minor adjustments of the resolutions (item 9)The board of directors proposes that the general meeting authorises the board  the CEO or the person otherwise designated by the board  to undertake such minor adjustments and clarifications of the decisions made at the general meeting to the extent required for registration of the resolutions.OTHERNumber of shares and votes in the CompanyAs of the date of this notice  the total number of shares and votes in the Company is 49 209 834 representing a total of 49 209 834 votes. The Company holds no own shares.Shareholders’ right to informationShareholders are informed of their right under Chapter 7  Section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act to request information about circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item of business on the agenda. The board and the CEO shall provide such information if the Board considers that this can be done without significant damage to the Company.DocumentsDocuments related to the resolutions proposed to the extraordinary general meeting as well as proxy form will be available at the Company’s head office and on the Company’s webpage  www.hoylu.com  no later than two (2) weeks prior to the extraordinary general meeting and will also be sent to those shareholders who so request and provide their postal address.

But it’s not guaranteed – some may vote for a rise. Sanjay Raja  their chief UK economist  writes: Our basecase is for a 9-0 vote  but there are risks on either side. Should one – or even two — members of the hawkish MPC contingent (Greene  Haskel  Mann) opt for a further Bank Rate hike  we’d see that as relatively hawkish.11h ago 12.22 CET Bank of England announcement will be made at noon today. Markets are expecting No Change to interest rates.First rate cut is priced in for June.Markets are expecting policy to ease by just over 100bps by end year. pic.twitter.com/smBWThFPRq — Jumana Saleheen (@JumanaSaleheen) February 1  202411h ago 12.11 CET Allan Monks  a UK economist for JP Morgan  said it is widely expected that rates will be kept the same on Thursday  but that the Bank will “almost certainly make a dovish pivot that puts future easing higher up on the agenda than before”. Monks adds: “The Bank of England’s updated narrative is likely to be that clear progress is being made on inflation  but that it is too early to declare victory and therefore caution must be exercised when thinking about when and how quickly policy can be normalised.11h ago 12.00 CET Bank of England interest rate decision nears Excitement is building in the City as the clock ticks towards noon  when the Bank of England will set UK interest rates. As flagged in the introduction  the Bank is expected to leave UK interest rates unchanged at 5.25% today  their highest level since 2008. But there’s a lot of interest in how soon the BoE will start cutting rates  given the falls in inflation in the last year and concerns that UK could drop into recession. Mike Riddell  Head of Macro Unconstrained at Allianz Global Investors  predicts that the Bank will start to cut interest rates by the summer. But  he warns  “the water is getting muddier”. Riddell says: Only a month ago  markets were convinced that the Bank of England would begin a rate cutting cycle in March  as the UK economy had stagnated and inflation was rapidly dropping. The next move in UK interest rates will almost certainly be down  but the timing has become more uncertain. The UK economy  and indeed much of the rest of Europe  has been showing some signs of life again. Businesses and consumers are saying they’re more confident about the outlook. The UK housing market is also picking up  perhaps buoyed by a fall in mortgage rates. It seems likely that the Bank of England will revise its growth forecast for this year higher as a result. Inflation optimism has faded a little too. The BoE will be relieved to see that the UK labour market has cooled further  but the reality is that wage growth remains elevated and at a level that is inflationary. Inflation itself is still running way too hot  and on some measures  surprisingly ticked higher in January. The recent escalation in the Middle East puts further upside risk to inflation.11h ago 11.50 CET Price rises have helped communications group BT to grow its revenues and profits. BT has reported that revenues grew 3% in the last nine months  due to price increases and the rollout of faster  “fibre to the premises” broadband. Average revenue per user at its Openreach division grew by 10% year-on-year  “due to price rises and increased volumes of FTTP’. BT’s pretax profits jumped 15% to almost £1.5bn. Last summer  the Guardian reported that the UK’s largest mobile and broadband companies were pushing through the biggest round of price hikes for more than 30 years  sparking accusations of “greedflation”. Mobile and broadband firms accused of fuelling UK ‘greedflation’ with major price hikes Read more11h ago 11.39 CET Rachel Reeves then told UK business chiefs that Labour’s pledge to cap corporation tax at 25% will give them confidence to invest. She says"": “That means businesses can plan investment projects today  with the confidence of knowing how their returns will be taxed for the rest of this decade. “To those you in this room who might be wondering – do we really mean what we say? Has Labour really changed? Will warm words today be matched by action in government? “Be in no doubt. We will campaign as a pro-business party – and we will govern as a pro-business party.”12h ago 11.29 CET Euroclear earns €4.4bn interest from frozen Russian assets Belgium-based financial services company Euroclear earned €4.4bn last year from Russian assets it is currrently holding which were frozen after the Ukraine war. In its annual results this morning  Euroclear says it made €5.5bn of net interest earnings in 2023  of which €4.4bn relate to interests linked to Russian sanctions. Subject to Belgian corporate tax  these earnings will generate over €1bn for the Belgian State in 2023. Western sanctions means Euroclear is unable to pass on coupon payments and redemptions to sanctioned entities  so cash is stacking up on its balance sheet – which had swelled by €38bn by the end of 2023 to €162bn. View image in fullscreen Photograph: Euroclear Euroclear says it incurred €62m of direct costs related to Russian assets  on top of €24m of lost business from sanctioned clients. Across the world  there are over $300bn of frozen Russian assets. In December  the US proposed that working groups from the G7 explore ways to seize this money  and use it to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine. UK foreign secretary David Cameroon ramped up the pressure at Davos last month  saying there was a “moral  political  legal  and economic case for using the money to repair Ukraine’s war damage. UK urges west to use frozen Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine’s economy Read more Euroclear says it will retain profits on Russian assets until it is provided with further guidance on the distribution or management of such profits. It says: 2023 also saw various parties contest the consequences of the application of sanctions  with a significant number of legal proceedings ongoing  almost exclusively in Russian courts. Claimants have initiated legal proceeding aiming mainly to access the assets blocked in Euroclear’s books. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised  the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions. Euroclear will continue to defend itself against all legal claims. In parallel  the Board notes that the European Commission is contemplating various options to use the profits generated by the reinvestment of sanctioned amounts held by financial institutions  including Euroclear  for the financing of Ukraine’s reconstruction.",neutral,0.18,0.55,0.28,mixed,0.1,0.32,0.58,True,English,"['England governor', 'right direction', 'interest rates', 'Bank', 'things', 'hold', 'Belgium-based financial services company', 'The UK housing market', 'England interest rate decision', 'First rate cut', 'rate cutting cycle', 'hawkish MPC contingent', 'Allianz Global Investors', 'UK business chiefs', 'last nine months', 'Belgian corporate tax', 'chief UK economist', 'Bank Rate hike', 'major price hikes', 'communications group BT', 'UK labour market', 'net interest earnings', 'CET Allan Monks', 'UK interest rates', 'CET Price rises', 'CET Deutsche Bank', 'corporation tax', '4bn interest', 'Belgian State', 'UK economy', 'price increases', 'The Bank', 'nine Bank', 'The BoE', 'mortgage rates', 'Sanjay Raja', '9-0 vote', 'two — members', 'No Change', 'Jumana Saleheen', 'JP Morgan', 'dovish pivot', 'clear progress', 'last year', 'Macro Unconstrained', 'next move', 'growth forecast', 'wage growth', 'recent escalation', 'Middle East', 'upside risk', 'faster, “fibre', 'premises” broadband', 'Average revenue', 'Openreach division', 'broadband companies', 'biggest round', 'broadband firms', 'Rachel Reeves', 'investment projects', 'warm words', 'pro-business party', 'Russian assets', 'Ukraine war', 'annual results', 'Russian sanctions', 'Western sanctions', 'coupon payments', 'balance sheet', 'View image', 'UK ‘greedflation', 'CET Bank', 'England policymakers', 'England announcement', 'basecase scenario', 'highest level', 'Mike Riddell', 'pretax profits', 'largest mobile', 'Inflation optimism', 'end year', 'hold', 'risks', 'one', 'Greene', 'Haskel', 'Mann', 'noon', 'Markets', 'June', '100bps', 'smBWThFPRq', 'JumanaSaleheen', 'February', 'Thursday', 'future', 'agenda', 'narrative', 'victory', 'caution', 'Excitement', 'City', 'clock', 'introduction', 'lot', 'falls', 'concerns', 'recession', 'Head', 'summer', 'water', 'muddier', 'March', 'timing', 'Europe', 'signs', 'life', 'Businesses', 'consumers', 'outlook', 'reality', 'measures', 'January', 'revenues', 'rollout', 'user', 'volumes', 'FTTP', 'Guardian', '30 years', 'accusations', 'pledge', 'confidence', 'returns', 'decade', 'room', 'action', 'government', 'doubt', 'Euroclear', 'interests', 'redemptions', 'entities', 'cash']",2024-02-01,2024-02-01,theguardian.com

35600,Euroclear,Bing API,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/business/frozen-russian-assets-ukraine/index.html?ref=biztoc.com,Russia’s frozen assets are generating billions. The EU is getting ready to send them to Ukraine,Russian assets frozen in European accounts are generating billions of dollars in interest payments that could be diverted to help repair Ukraine’s war-torn economy — and the European Union just took a step closer to doing that.,London CNN —Russian assets frozen in European accounts are generating billions of dollars in interest payments that could be diverted to help repair Ukraine’s war-torn economy — and the European Union just took a step closer to doing that.After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  Western countries froze nearly half of Moscow’s foreign reserves — some €300 billion ($327 billion). Around €200 billion ($218 billion) sits in the European Union — mostly at Euroclear  a financial institution that keeps assets safe for banks  exchanges and investors.EU leaders agreed a crucial $50 billion funding package for Ukraine on Thursday and came closer to finalizing a plan to use the profits piling up in Euroclear’s accounts.In a statement issued at the end of a summit  EU leaders said “potential revenues could be generated … concerning the use of extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from the immobilised Central Bank of Russia assets.”Belgium-based Euroclear disclosed Thursday that it has earned €5.2 billion ($5.6 billion) in interest on income generated by sanctioned Russian assets since they were frozen by EU and Group of Seven countries in 2022.“The number of sanctions and countersanctions that have been introduced since February 2022 are unprecedented and continue to have a significant impact on the daily operations of Euroclear ” the group said in a statement.The European Union and its allies are determined to make Russia foot part of the colossal bill for rebuilding Ukraine — estimated by the World Bank a year ago at $411 billion over the next decade.One proposal put forward by the European Commission would involve using a special levy to collect the windfall interest income  which would then be paid into the EU budget for the reconstruction of Ukraine.That plan has been delayed by legal and financial concerns  with some EU member states and the European Central Bank worried that even carefully targeted measures could fall foul of international law and shake confidence in the euro as the world’s second biggest reserve currency. The EU has been at pains to contrast the illegality of Russia’s invasion with its own strict adherence to the rule of law.EU member countries have now agreed in principle to tap this windfall interest income  although the details of how this will be done practically must still be ironed out  an EU diplomat told CNN. Lawyers are working on the text of the agreement before returning it to EU member states for final approval.In its earnings statement  Euroclear — which settles cross-border trades and safeguards more than $40 trillion in assets — said it was focused on “minimising potential legal and operational risks” that may arise from proposals by EU officials to hand the money to Ukraine.Euroclear said additional administrative costs relating to the sanctions cost it €62 million ($67 million) last year  “with considerable senior management and board focus on the topic.”It added that cash on its balance sheet soared €38 billion ($41 billion) year-on-year to €162 billion ($175 billion)  boosted by payments associated with frozen Russian assets  including bonds.These payments include  for example  interest paid on bonds  known as coupons  or the proceeds generated by securities that mature and are reinvested.Ordinarily  these payments would have been made to Russian bank accounts  but they have been blocked by the sanctions and are generating vast amounts of interest — even more so given the recent spate of rate hikes.Euroclear  for its part  is embroiled in several legal proceedings pertaining to the sanctions — almost exclusively in Russian courts — as claimants seek to access the assets blocked in its books.The company said it continues to retain profits related to these assets “until further guidance is provided on the distribution or management of such profits.”— James Frater contributed reporting.,neutral,0.13,0.78,0.09,negative,0.03,0.22,0.75,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'The EU', 'Russia', 'billions', 'Ukraine', 'crucial $50 billion funding package', 'biggest reserve currency', 'additional administrative costs', 'EU member states', 'considerable senior management', 'several legal proceedings', 'EU member countries', 'European Central Bank', 'The European Union', 'windfall interest income', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian bank accounts', 'Russian courts', 'European accounts', 'Western countries', 'Seven countries', 'European Commission', 'EU leaders', 'EU budget', 'EU diplomat', 'EU officials', 'war-torn economy', 'foreign reserves', 'financial institution', 'potential revenues', 'extraordinary revenues', 'private entities', 'significant impact', 'daily operations', 'colossal bill', 'World Bank', 'next decade', 'One proposal', 'special levy', 'financial concerns', 'strict adherence', 'final approval', 'cross-border trades', 'potential legal', 'operational risks', 'board focus', 'balance sheet', 'vast amounts', 'recent spate', 'rate hikes', 'James Frater', 'full-scale invasion', 'international law', 'earnings statement', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'interest payments', 'Russia assets', 'London', 'CNN', 'billions', 'dollars', 'Ukraine', 'step', 'February', 'half', 'Moscow', 'banks', 'exchanges', 'investors', 'Thursday', 'plan', 'profits', 'end', 'summit', 'use', 'Group', 'number', 'sanctions', 'allies', 'foot', 'part', 'reconstruction', 'measures', 'confidence', 'second', 'pains', 'illegality', 'rule', 'principle', 'details', 'Lawyers', 'text', 'agreement', 'proposals', 'money', 'topic', 'cash', 'year', 'bonds', 'example', 'coupons', 'proceeds', 'securities', 'claimants', 'books', 'company', 'guidance', 'distribution', 'reporting']",2024-02-01,2024-02-01,edition.cnn.com

Underlying earnings per share rose by 63% to EUR 312.1 per share  reflecting the continued increase in net profit.,"BRUSSELS  Feb. 1  2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Results for the year ending 31 December 2023Euroclear Logo (PRNewsfoto/Euroclear)Financial highlightsEuroclear continues to separate Russian sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results and retain these profits until further guidance is provided on the distribution or management of such profits.Underlying business income reached a record EUR 1 658 million  an increase of 3% year-on-year.Underlying net profit increased by 63% to almost EUR 1 billion  driven by a robust business performance and a high interest rates environment.Underlying operating expenses increased by 14% to EUR 1 290 million  on higher inflation and increased investments in line with our strategic ambition to develop digital capabilities and IT infrastructure. The impact of inflation on the group's workforce and non-payroll related costs accounted for an increase of around 5% compared to 2022.Net interest earnings amounted to EUR 5.5 billion  of which EUR 4.4 billion relate to interests linked to Russian sanctions.The Russian sanctions and countermeasures resulted in direct costs of EUR 62 million and a loss of business income of EUR 24 million.Group impairments were recorded in 2023 totalling EUR 125 million  principally related to the impairment of part of the goodwill of our Swedish CSD. The harsher economic conditions and reduced volumes combined with an increase in costs are expected to persist  leading to reduced long-term projections. This has resulted in an impairment of EUR 100 million of the goodwill of the group's Swedish CSD.Euroclear achieved an underlying EBITDA margin of 57.4%  an increase of 9.7 percentage points compared to 2022.Underlying earnings per share rose by 63% to EUR 312.1 per share  reflecting the continued inc rease in net profit.The Board proposes to pay a dividend per share of EUR 210 in the third quarter of 2024. This represents an increase of 82% and maintains the pay-out ratio at 60% of the underlying earnings.Story continuesLieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer of Euroclear Group  commented:""2023 was another turbulent year  with geopolitical tensions impacting our macro-economic reality and the global capital markets. In times of complexity and market uncertainty  it is rewarding to know that our diverse client base continues to rely on us for safety and efficiency in processing and safeguarding their assets.In 2023  we reached a record underlying business income of EUR 1 658 million and an underlying net profit of almost EUR 1 billion  driven by a robust business performance and a high interest rates environment. We also made solid progress in delivering on our strategic objectives  maintaining our focus on clients  while further developing ESG  data and digital capabilities  and continuing to grow our business internationally. Key achievements include the launch of the Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) service  the successful connection of Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Finland to the European Central Bank's T2S settlement system and the opening of a new Tech Hub in Krakow  allowing us to create 400 new jobs.As we recently announced a leadership transition and the selection of Valérie Urbain as my successor  this is my last set of full-year results as CEO of Euroclear.

In contrast with 2022  which was characterised by volatile markets following the invasion of Ukraine  2023 saw market activity slightly decrease while equities valuations recovered. Fixed-income issuance performed well. The diversification of Euroclear's business continues to provide resilience thanks to its subscription-like model as approximately three quarters of the group's business income is decoupled from financial market valuation.Eurobond and European assets performance resulted from solid issuance and partial recovery of equities valuations  in spite of lower levels of trading compared to last year in most markets.The investment funds business also suffered from lower activity mainly impacting mutual funds. ETF investment remained strong.Revenue emanating from the Collateral Highway increased despite reduced volumes for lending and borrowing.Global and Emerging Markets performance remained solid amid interest in new  emerging markets.Key business driversFY2022 FY2023 YoY evolution 3-year CAGR Assets under custody €35.5 trillion €37.7 trillion +6 % +4.8 % Number of transactions 304 million 299 million -2 % +2.8 % Turnover €1 066 trillion €1 072 trillion +1 % +6.1 % Fund assets under custody €2.8 trillion €3.1 trillion +10 % +6.5 % Collateral highway €1.79 trillion €1.67 trillion -7 % +2.7 % Underlying cash deposits (year average) €25.8 billion €23.7 billion -8 % +4.8 %Quarterly evolution of key business driversQ1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Assets under custody (in EUR billion) 36 586 36 830 36 952 37 714 Number of transactions (in million) 79.10 72.98 71.69 75.47 Turnover (in EUR billion) 281 091 265 108 266 905 259 382 Fund assets under custody (in EUR billion) 2 902 2 989 3 014 3 111 Collateral highway (in EUR billion) 1 747 1 678 1 668 1 670 Underlying cash deposits (in EUR billion) 25.5 25.4 22.1 22.0In 2023  Euroclear progressed the renewed Group Strategy announced in 2022  laying the foundations for the next phase of Euroclear's diversification and growth.Embracing digital assetsIn line with Euroclear's aspiration to become a digital and data-enabled financial market infrastructure  a D²-FMI  it launched its new Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) service in September 2023.The service enables the issuance  distribution and settlement of fully digital international securities - Digitally Native Notes (DNN) - on distributed ledger technology (DLT). The inaugural DNN was issued by the World Bank  raising EUR 100 million to support its sustainable development activities. The DNN is automatically linked to the traditional settlement platform of Euroclear for secondary market operations  ensuring investors full access to liquidity.Separately  in December 2023  Fnality  an international consortium of banks and financial institutions  including Euroclear  announced it had completed the first blockchain payments at the Bank of England. Fnality aims to bring central bank money in a digital tokenized form with near-real-time 24/7 settlement capability to allow banks to significantly reduce their intraday liquidity requirements.Growing the funds businessBuilding on its acquisitions of MFEX and Goji  Euroclear has continued to enhance its service offering in investment funds with the launch of a new service targeting private market funds. Leveraging Goji's capabilities and the FundSettle platform  the new service complements Euroclear's existing money market  mutual and alternative fund offerings. The launch of the new service also follows the gradual inclusion of MFEX's distribution and data services into the FundSettle platform.To further streamline Euroclear's funds offering and reflect its ambition to create a true one-stop-shop offering to clients across the full spectrum of funds products  Euroclear's funds offering transitioned to a new brand name  Euroclear FundsPlace.Euroclear also continued to deploy innovative services for fund distributors globally. In 2023  several clients from Europe and Asia chose Euroclear's fund platform for the onboarding of their investment funds. Euroclear provides a one-stop-shop solution for fund distribution and execution services via its extensive network  allowing these clients to have access to more than 100 000 funds.Forging stronger connectionsEuroclear fully supports the need for integrated  deep and liquid capital markets within the European Union. As a common settlement platform for Europe  the European Central Bank's TARGET2-Securities (T2S) system underpins this harmonised environment.Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Finland successfully completed the connection to the European Central Bank's T2S settlement system in late 2023. By joining this common infrastructure  the Finnish CSD can offer its users delivery-versus-payment settlement of securities and cash in euro and Danish krone central bank money.Euroclear also continues to grow its international ecosystem in Asia. Euroclear Bank and the Korea Securities Depository took further step in making the Korean market ""Euroclearable"" by signing an agreement to open an omnibus account structure in August 2023. The link will allow international investors efficient post-trade access to KTBs.Acting responsiblyIn 2023  Euroclear continued to build on its strong ESG foundations established in previous years. It has started work on implementing the principles laid out in its ESG Board policy and begun to measure progress against the ESG KPIs which were approved in early 2023. Euroclear has made progress against its commitments in many areas  meeting its supply-chain screening targets  receiving approval for its targets from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and broadening its training offer. Actions are ongoing to integrate ESG into its current service offering  together with its business partners Impact Cubed and Greenomy.Within its workplace  Euroclear aims to foster a healthy  performant and learning-orientated corporate culture. Last year  Euroclear onboarded 800 new employees and started to work with the World Economic Forum as one of its partners for 'The Good Work Alliance' which commits to building a more resilient  equitable  inclusive and just future of work.Shareholder evolutionIn recent years  Euroclear's shareholder base has evolved from its traditional ""user-owned"" model to include a greater proportion of longer-term institutional investors. In 2023  the group welcomed two new shareholders: New Zealand Super Fund and Novo Holdings  each holding 4.99% and 3.22% respectively.Furthermore  two of Euroclear's main shareholders reinforced their holding last year. Société Fédérale de Participations et d'Investissement (SFPI/FPIM) acquired 1.79% from various sellers  and now holds 12.92%  while Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (CDC) increased its holding by 4.19%  and now holds 10.91%.The long-term investment vision and commitment of this increasingly diversified shareholder base strengthens Euroclear's position as a neutral and open financial market infrastructure.CEO transitionAs announced on 15 January 2024  Valérie Urbain has been chosen by the Board as the successor to Lieve Mostrey as Chief Executive Officer of the Euroclear group. Having received the relevant regulatory approvals  Lieve Mostrey and Valérie Urbain will ensure a smooth and orderly transition period until the renewal of the Euroclear Board member mandates at the General Meeting on 3 May 2024.Lieve Mostrey has led Euroclear as group CEO since January 2017. Under her tenure  Euroclear grew its business  expanded its global footprint  enriched its funds offering notably through the acquisitions of MFEX and Goji and accelerated value creation for shareholders  while at the same time securing CSDR licenses for each of its operating entities.With over 30 years of experience at Euroclear in a variety of senior roles  including as Head of Human Resources of Euroclear Group  CEO of Euroclear Bank and most recently as Chief Business Officer  Valérie brings unparalleled knowledge of Euroclear  clients and market trends. She has been a key architect of its successful business strategy.Update on Russian sanctions and countermeasuresThe number of sanctions and countersanctions that have been introduced since February 2022 are unprecedented and continue to have a significant impact on the daily operations of Euroclear. While new sanctions were issued at a declining pace in 2023  these still resulted in more breakage of straight-through process and increased manual interventions.Well-established processes are in place which allow the group to implement the sanctions  while maintaining the normal course of business. However  one consequence of the sanctions is that blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities results in an accumulation of cash on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of 2023  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet had increased by EUR 38 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 162 billion.Euroclear's priority has been to manage the sanctions according to the spirit and letter of the law. As per Euroclear's standard procedures  Euroclear does not remunerate cash balances and such cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. Prudent management of such risks is a requirement under Euroclear's Risk Appetite and Policies and expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation. The interest received on the reinvestment of cash balances is net interest income earned by Euroclear.In 2023  interest arising on cash balances from Russia-sanctioned assets was approx. EUR 4.4 billion. Such interest earnings are driven by two factors: (i) the prevailing interest rates and (ii) the amount of cash balances that Euroclear is required to invest. Subject to Belgian corporate tax  these earnings will generate EUR 1 085 million tax revenue for the Belgian State in 2023. As such  future earnings will be influenced by the evolving interest rate environment and the size of cash balances as the sanctions evolve.Since considerable uncertainties persist  Euroclear considers it necessary to separate the estimated sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company's performance and resources.Euroclear is faced with a high level of complexity in managing both the wide-ranging package of sanctions and a set of countermeasures  which Russia has implemented to try to mitigate the impact of the sanctions. Euroclear allocates considerable time  resources and capital to manage market issues  potential risks and implications of these countermeasures  while maintaining regular dialogue with clients and other stakeholders.Overall  Euroclear incurred additional direct costs from the management of Russian sanctions of EUR 62 million in 2023  with considerable senior management and Board focus on the topic. Additionally  the international sanctions and Russian countermeasures have resulted in a loss of activities from sanctioned clients and Russian securities  which negatively impacted business income by EUR 24 million.2023 also saw various parties contest the consequences of the application of sanctions  with a significant number of legal proceedings ongoing  almost exclusively in Russian courts. Claimants have initiated legal proceeding aiming mainly to access the assets blocked in Euroclear's books. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised  the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions. Euroclear will continue to defend itself against all legal claims.In parallel  the Board notes that the European Commission is contemplating various options to use the profits generated by the reinvestment of sanctioned amounts held by financial institutions  including Euroclear  for the financing of Ukraine's reconstruction.Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients from the implementation of any proposals from the European Commission. The company continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved and to retain profits related to the international sanctions applicable on Russian assets until further guidance is provided on the distribution or management of such profits.Euroclear continues to monitor and assess the potential impact of post balance sheet events on its 2023 financial statements.AnnexesCash balances related to Russian sanctionsCash balances related to Russian sanctionsInfographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2331196/Euroclear_1.jpg""Business as usual"" cash balances""Business as usual"" cash balancesInfographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2331195/Euroclear_2.jpgEuroclear Bank and Euroclear Investments are the two group issuing entities.

Resolution on the number of members of the Board of DirectorsThe Shareholders' Nomination Board proposes to the AGM as announced on 10 January 2024 that the Board of Directors shall have eight (8) members.13. Election of Chair  Vice Chair and other members of the Board of DirectorsThe Shareholders' Nomination Board proposes to the AGM as announced on 10 January 2024 that of the current members of the Board of Directors  Håkan Buskhe  Elisabeth Fleuriot  Helena Hedblom  Astrid Hermann  Kari Jordan  Christiane Kuehne  and Richard Nilsson be re-elected members of the Board of Directors until the end of the following AGM and that Reima Rytsölä be elected new member of the Board of Directors for the same term of office.Antti Mäkinen has announced that he is not available for re-election to the Board of Directors.The Shareholders' Nomination Board proposes that Kari Jordan be elected Chair and Håkan Buskhe be elected Vice Chair of the Board of Directors.Reima Rytsölä  born in 1969  Finnish citizen with a Master's degree in Political Science (Economics)  is a senior investment and finance leader with extensive experience in Finnish financial institutions. He is currently acting as CEO of Solidium Oy since August 2022. Prior to his current position  Rytsölä acted as the deputy CEO and Chief Investment Officer at Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company (2014–2022) and worked in various positions in Pohjola Bank  amongst others as Senior Executive Vice President  Head of Banking (2008–2013). He is independent of the Company but not of its shareholders due to his position as CEO of Solidium. Currently  Rytsölä does not own shares in Stora Enso.With regard to the selection procedure for the members of the Board of Directors  the Shareholders' Nomination Board recommends that shareholders take a position on the proposal as a whole at the AGM. This recommendation is based on the fact that at Stora Enso  in line with a good Nordic governance model  the Shareholders' Nomination Board is separate from the Board of Directors. The Shareholders' Nomination Board  in addition to ensuring that individual nominees for membership of the Board of Directors possess the required competences  is also responsible for making sure that the proposed Board of Directors as a whole also has the best possible expertise and experience for the Company and that the composition of the Board of Directors also meets other requirements of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies.All candidates and the evaluation regarding their independence have been presented on the Company's website storaenso.com/agm.14. Resolution on the remuneration for the auditorThe Board of Directors proposes to the AGM that remuneration for the auditor be paid based on an invoice approved by the Financial and Audit Committee. For the sake of clarity it is noted that the elected auditor would also be paid remuneration for services rendered for sustainability reporting assurance services based on an invoice approved by the Financial and Audit Committee.15. Election of auditorOn the recommendation of the Financial and Audit Committee  the Board of Directors proposes to the AGM that PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy be elected as the auditor until the end of the Company's next AGM. PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy has notified the Company that in the event it will be elected as the auditor  Samuli Perälä  APA  will act as the principally responsible auditor.The recommendation of the Financial and Audit Committee concerning the auditor election is available on the Company's website storaenso.com/agm. The Financial and Audit Committee confirms that its recommendation on the election of the auditor is free from influence by any third party and that no clause as set out in Article 16  Section 6 of the EU Audit Regulation (537/2014) restricting the choice by the AGM or the Company's free choice to propose an auditor for election has been imposed on the Company.PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy would also act as the sustainability reporting assurance provider of the Company until the end of the Company's next Annual General Meeting.16. Authorising the Board of Directors to decide on the repurchase of the Company's own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes to the AGM that the Board of Directors be authorised to decide on the repurchase of Stora Enso R shares as follows:The amount of R shares to be repurchased based on this authorisation shall not exceed 2 000 000 R shares  which corresponds to approximately 0.25% of all shares and 0.33% of all R shares in the Company. Own R shares can also be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shareholdings of the shareholders (directed repurchase). Own R shares can be repurchased using the unrestricted equity of the Company at a price formed in public trading on the date of the repurchase or otherwise at a price determined by the markets.Own R shares may be repurchased primarily in order to use the shares as part of the Company's incentive and remuneration scheme. The repurchased R shares may be held for reissue  cancelled  or transferred further.The Board of Directors decides on all other matters related to the repurchase of own R shares. The authorisation is effective until the beginning of the next AGM  however  no longer than until 31 July 2025 and it revokes the authorisation given by the AGM on 16 March 2023.17.

The authorisation covers both the issuance of new R shares as well as the transfer of own R shares held by the Company.The issuance of R shares may be carried out in deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights for the purpose of using the R shares as part of the Company's incentive and remuneration scheme.The Board of Directors shall decide on other terms and conditions of a share issue. The authorisation is effective until the beginning of the next AGM  however  no longer than until 31 July 2025 and it revokes the authorisation given by the AGM on 16 March 2023.18.

35603,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.cfr.org/blog/mobilizing-russias-immobilized-reserves,Mobilizing Russia's Immobilized Reserves,Russia’s reserves generally were invested in relatively short-term securities  and when the immobilized securities mature  the funds roll into zero- or low-interest deposit accounts. They thus become – absent other guidance – a free source of financing for the institution that previously held the reserves.,Concerns over the impact of making full use of Russia’s immobilized reserves  on the reserve status of the dollar and  more importantly  the reserve status euro  always seemed a bit overstated to me.Reserves-related flows haven’t been driving the dollar or euro for a while now – most countries that could add to their existing reserves have concluded that they already have plenty and are making more adventurous use of them. The global stocks of foreign exchange reserves are big  true  but current flows are much more modest.More importantly  the big decision was the initial move to immobilize Russia’s reserves. That action was taken quickly  over a weekend. But I suspect that it mattered more than the current debate over formally seizing the reserves. It made it clear that the reserves of even big countries can be frozen. From the sanctioned country’s point of view  frozen reserves are already gone. President Putin knows he won’t get access to them without backing down.The big surprise of 2022 wasn’t that the United States froze Russia’s reserves – Russia had already anticipated that risk and diversified out of the dollar.* Rather the big surprise was that Europe joined the U.S. in applying muscular sanctions  and thus holding euro reserves didn’t offer any additional safety. I have noted (in private conversations) that so long as the G7 acts together  countries that diversify out of dollars into euros in an effort to reduce their sanction vulnerability effectively give up both yield and liquidity for no additional protection.So long as the G7 countries (and the G10 countries for that matter) act collectively  options for reserve diversification are limited. Holding reserves in Chinese yuan isn’t true protection from “economic coercion” or a full hedge against “weaponized interdependence” – it just creates a different source of vulnerability.Follow the Money Brad Setser tracks cross-border flows  with a bit of macroeconomics thrown in. View all newsletters >Perhaps most important  though  is the point made elegantly by Colin Weiss in an important research paper: if the global reserve pool fractures along geopolitical lines  it probably wouldn’t change much. Would Japan  Korea  Taiwan  and India really want to hold more reserves in yuan given that such reserves could be frozen every bit as easily? Most countries on Europe’s periphery are both aligned with Europe and naturally need to hold euros for their own currency management. China cannot simply diversify its reserves by putting money into China – its real option is holding fewer reserves  not diversification.The oil-exporting countries of the Gulf are the only big reserve holders with holdings that are somewhat at odds with their geopolitical alignment  and they presumably wouldn’t want to put all their eggs in a Chinese basket. A close examination of the issue points to more modest risks than often implied by breathless headlines around de-dollarization.But I also understand why European countries are slightly more cautious than the U.S. and Canada. The bulk of Russia’s money is legally trapped in Europe  not the United States. The stakes for Europe are therefore greater.And it is difficult for the U.S. to tell Europe not to worry about the reserve currency status of the euro when many senior policy makers in the U.S. do cheerlead for the dollar’s global role and sometimes agonize about threats to the dollar’s global position.But I am also not sure that the G7 has to actually seize the principal to deliver a hefty amount of support for Ukraine.There are options that don’t even require the transfer of ownership of existing securities and just use the proceeds from the investment of funds from “frozen” maturing securities that could yield significant funds for Ukraine.These options do require legislation  but don’t require formally seizing Russia’s reserves.According to the Financial Times  the Europeans have already agreed to have the holders of the identified frozen reserves (Euroclear  and perhaps other security depositories including those run by national central banks?) hold the proceeds from Russia’s maturing securities in segregated accounts:“Under the agreement struck on Monday  profits generated by Euroclear will be booked separately and not be paid out as dividends to shareholders until EU countries unanimously decide to set up a ‘financial contribution to the [EU] budget that shall be raised on these net profits to support Ukraine’”Russia’s reserves generally were invested in relatively short-term securities  and when the immobilized securities mature  the funds roll into zero- or low-interest deposit accounts. They thus become – absent other guidance – a free source of financing for the institution that previously held the reserves.We know this because Belgium reported a windfall profit from its ordinary income tax levied on Euroclear’s bank  which saw its profits soar as it made use of this free funding. See Martin Sandbu’s detailed examination of the issue.To generate real funds for Ukraine without formally seizing the assets  I think Europe needs to do two things:Direct institutions with essentially unclaimed funds from the maturing securities held in frozen accounts to invest those proceeds for income  not for liquidity (the funds are  after all  frozen). Introduce a very high (say 99.9 percent) tax on the interest income of all frozen reserves held in segregated accounts for immobilized reserves.The size of the frozen reserves hasn’t been authoritatively determined. $300 billion is a sum that is often tossed around; Martin Sandbu says the right number is $350 billion at the time of the seizure  though that will be a bit lower now thanks to currency moves. The Financial Times reports the European Union is using a slightly smaller number – €260 billion  with €190 billion of that held in Euroclear (a rather stunning fact in itself). That number  ironically  will include a portion of Russia’s reported dollars  as Russia held around $16 billion of its dollar securities in a Euroclear custodial account.But for the sake of argument  let’s assume the real number across the G7 is around $300 billion. That portfolio  conservatively managed  should generate interest income of at least $10 billion a year. The dollar portfolio can be held in bills (5.25 percent)  or higher yields can be locked in by investing in Agencies (6 percent plus). The euro portfolio would be invested in the interbank market (at close to 4 percent now)  or in Spanish government bonds at 3.15 percent. A portfolio that includes a mix of Spain  Italy (why not)  and the euro-denominated bonds of the European supra-nationals and multilaterals like African Development Bank (AfDB) would easily lock in a 3 percent return over time. The blended yield  including the proceeds on the dollar portfolio  should be a bit over 3 percent.**And this hypothetical portfolio only includes assets that would normally be part of the investment tranche of a standard reserve portfolio: emerging market and corporate bonds would generate a higher yield. Remember  this portfolio doesn’t need to be managed for liquidity.The €4 billion sum that the European Commission has suggested could be generated off the proceeds of the frozen reserves (per the Wall Street Journal) seems substantially too small; I consequently hope that the G7 countries are pushing the Europeans on this.$10 billion a year over multiple years is real money – so treating the frozen reserves as an endowment and only using in effect the income on the estate’s frozen assets generates a guaranteed $50 billion over 5 years. Ukraine needs more  but it is a start – and all this can be done in a way that only uses the windfall that would currently accrue largely to the institution that happens to be holding the frozen security when it matures. It should be all legally pretty straightforward.***The frozen assets themselves wouldn’t actually ever be seized – the principal would remain frozen  notionally owned by Russia and available to sweeten any eventual settlement. And the interest income would technically be taxed away rather than seized. Large taxes on intangible income have ample precedent  so prohibitively high taxes on the intangible income from frozen accounts actually seem fairly easy.Bottom line: there should be real money on the table even if the principal on Russia’s immobilized reserves isn’t seized. $10 billion a year is  in reality  probably a bit conservative … and $10 billion a year is over 5 percent of Ukraine’s GDP.That isn’t a small sum – especially when any negotiated settlement likely would include liberating additional funds to pay for Ukraine’s reconstruction. And the option of doing more remains.* Russia’s reported holdings of Treasuries with U.S. custodians fell sharply in spring of 2018  dropping from $96 billion to $15 billion. That coincided with a fall in the dollar share of Russia’s serves from around 40 percent to around 15 percent.** Several very safe Euro-denominated ten-year bonds yield just under 3 percent: AfDB (2.58 percent)  European Stability Mechanism (2.69 percent)  European Investment Bank (2.73 percent)  NextGeneration EU (2.6 percent).

In January 2024  2CRSi already announced the success of its AI solutions. Today  the presentation of the strategic plan foresees a gradual balance between its main sources of revenue  enabling much better overall profitability.Strasbourg (France)  January 31  2024 - 2CRSi (ISIN: FR0013341781)  an expert in the design and manufacturing of high-performance  eco-friendly compute servers  announces a three-year plan aiming for balance between server sales for AI  sales of complete solutions for data centers  and associated services. This plan focuses on the American market  representing the majority of 2CRSi's global sales.For nearly 20 years  2CRSi has demonstrated its expertise in designing and manufacturing high-performance  eco-friendly compute servers  and its mastery of air or liquid cooling systems. The quality of its products  the relevance of its innovations  and the loyalty of its customers firmly establish the 2CRSi brand in the realm of performance.Adapting to market changesThe rise of high-performance computing (HPC) and its most recognized branch  Artificial Intelligence (AI)  compels manufacturers to develop increasingly powerful  compact  and energy-consuming components. In the quest for the most eco-efficient infrastructure solutions  the contract signed on January 30 proves that 2CRSi possesses all the necessary qualities. To elevate our level of expertise further  it is also imperative to rethink the organizational structure of our group.Under the leadership of its management  the group will now organize itself around three clearly identified brands.2CRSi and its R&D team retain the ability to design and manufacture custom servers for our historical clientele with clearly calibrated requirements.Tranquil IT develops rugged servers and focuses its positioning on Edge Computing.Adimes remains the agnostic integrator of solutions from all of our strategic partners but also integrates the production and logistics teams serving the entire group. It ensures testing  after-sales service  and all IT services for a local clientele.This strategy is clearly aimed at increasing productivity while ensuring cost control for each of the entities.Furthermore  other negotiations are currently underway for machines dedicated to AI  primarily through 2CRSi Corp  which now represents the majority of the revenue generated by 2CRSi. Here are the projections for this sole subsidiary  2CRSi Corporation:The contract signed and announced yesterday with a data center operator demonstrates the success of innovations created by 2CRSi. Last year  2CRSi already positioned North America as the main driver of our growth. We are there now. For the current fiscal period  and particularly the upcoming semester  2CRSi has two priority areas:Development of sales focusing on servers for artificial intelligence.The contract with the data center operator that ensures steady revenues and margins for the next 4 years.2CRSi is experiencing and will continue to experience robust commercial and industrial development in the coming months and years.For the ongoing fiscal year  which will last for 16 months and close on June 30  2024  2CRSi Corporation is projected to have a turnover exceeding $100 million. The low margin on sales of servers specialized in AI is compensated by their significant volume. The goal of returning to profitability is anticipated for this year with an EBITDA forecast of over $3 million  for the sole American subsidiary.For the following fiscal years  the sale of solutions for data centers  coupled with a growing share of services  will significantly increase the group's results. For 2CRSi Corp  this will translate into an EBITDA exceeding 12% by 2026  with a turnover close to $300 million  of which approximately 60% is already covered by the contract with the American data center operator.Philippe STEINMETZ  CFO of the 2CRSi group  states  ""We will start all processes to ensure that 2CRSi has the financial resources necessary for the success of this contract.""As a reminder  2CRSi will present its objectives and strategy for the coming months and years today at 11:00 AM.

Twenty-six percent of those surveyed characterized their organizations’ readiness as between 75% to 100% in the January poll. The same question  posed during a Wolters Kluwer beneficial ownership webinar on November 15  2023  indicated a level of just 18% readiness among 4 200 attendees.“There is a noticeable uptick in the market  not only in terms of greater awareness but also in preparations among those who realize they are subject to the beneficial ownership reporting requirements ” said Rupak Venugopal  Vice President  Beneficial Ownership  for Wolters Kluwer’s Financial & Corporate Compliance division. “But despite this upward trend  there remains a considerable lack of awareness among impacted businesses  and we are working diligently to help change that dynamic through a growing ecosystem of partnerships that can provide secure and trustworthy resources to comply.”The prevalence of respondents who indicated a total lack of preparedness dropped seven points  from 38% in November’s webinar to 31% in January’s poll. Both polls  however  show substantial increases in readiness levels compared to a Wolters Kluwer survey from mid-2023  when 74% of respondents representing companies potentially subject to the reporting requirement indicated they had only become aware of the rule “by having taken the survey.”The U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) estimates that the rule will impact approximately 32.6 million reporting companies in 2024 alone  with five million new reporting companies formed and registered every year going forward. There are significant consequences for non-compliance  including fines of up to $10 000 and possible incarceration.Wolters Kluwer recently launched a Beneficial Ownership Platform solution to simplify filing and ongoing compliance for both single-entity as well as multiple-entity filers.More information is available on the dedicated Wolters Kluwer resources page  “Beneficial Ownership Information Compliance from CT Corporation.”About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG.

This increase is explained by the growth of the subscriber base linked to Telecom activities and by the integration of the Eclair companies.Non-recurring revenues  which include in particular the sale of Boxes and service activation fees  are down as anticipated mainly due to the exit from Hardware activities and the switch to Android technology.The recurring activity has a gross margin rate significantly higher than that of the non-recurring activity  ultimately resulting in a 10% growth in gross profit and a 7 points gain in growth margin rate  increasing from 55% to 62%.IFRS figurein million euros(not audited) FY 2023 FY 2022 Change Recurring revenues 22 3 14.4 +55% Non-recurring revenues 13.3 21.9 -39% Total revenues 35.6 36.3 -2% Total gross profit 22.0 20.1 +10%If the increase in recurring revenues  a growth driver for the future  did not fully offset the expected decline in non-recurring revenues in FY 2023  the embedded growth[1] is on a positive trajectory  as evidenced by the subscriber base growth (up by 33% for the fiscal year).Netgem concludes 2023 with a base of 677 000 netgem.tv subscribers  managed on behalf of around twenty fixed telecommunication operators in Europe  representing an annual growth of 33%.The newly acquired Eclair activities in July 2023 contributed €2.5 million to revenues in the second half  including €1.3 million in recurring revenues.As of the end of December  the group's gross cash position stood at €6.6 million.Outlook 2024Netgem anticipates a growth of approximately 10% in its recurring revenues for the year 2024.This growth will be supported by the entire group's activities  both in France and internationally  particularly driven by the prospects of gaining new operator customers through the new products launched in 2023 in the fields of cloud gaming and FAST channels[2] targeting telecom operators. Additionally  the group expects to acquire new media customers through the business units Eclair Preservation by Netgem and Eclair Valorisation by Netgem  which provide services to content publishers.The group also intends to continue simplifying its organization  especially following the changes in scope in 2023  leading to a significant reduction in its overhead costs in 2024.As a result  the group expects to improve its profitability and cash flow generation indicators in 2024.For Mathias Hautefort  CEO of Netgem  ""Our growth in 2024 is now driven by three key engines: our Media Services division  serving content publishers  our longstanding activity targeting telecom operators in France  and our international expansion  strengthened by our new products in the areas of cloud gaming and FAST channels.""Financial communications calendar 20242023 results Thursday March 28  2024 (*)Business update T1 2024 Thursday May 30  2024 (*)General assembly Thursday May 30  2024  14:30H1 2024 results Wednesday July 31  2024 (*)Business update T3 2024 Friday October 18  2024 (*)(*) before market.ContactsInvestor and Analyst RelationsBertrand Soleilbertrand.soleil@double-digit.com+33 (0)6.23.31.06.53 Press RelationsPatricia Ouakipatricia.ouaki@forcemedia.fr+33 (0)1.44.40.24.01About NetgemNetgem supports the audiovisual industry in its digital transformation and establishes itself as an essential partner for telecom operators and media groups in developing new immersive entertainment solutions.

The current installed production capacity of 1 MW will be increased to 2.5 MW (i.e. a maximum of 1 tonne of green hydrogen per day) in 2024. The on-site storage capacity  currently around 700 kg  will be increased to almost 5 tonnes.Progress of our sites in “Construction” stageFrance: inauguration of 2 sites  Lhyfe Occitanie (Bessières) and Lhyfe Bretagne (Buléon)In December 2023  Lhyfe successively inaugurated its Lhyfe Occitanie production unit in Bessièresand Lhyfe Bretagne unit in Buléon (in Brittany). These sites  which will produce each up to 2 tonnes of green hydrogen per day (i.e. an installed electrolysis capacity of 5 MW per site)  are the largest green and renewable hydrogen production sites in France.Both sites have been developed using the new “containerised"" format  which reduces the required footprint and makes it easier to scale up capacity. Progressive commercial start-up should take place in the coming months.France: two new bulk sites in “construction phase” in Croixrault and SorignyIn Croixrault  in the Hauts-de-France region  Lhyfe has obtained all the necessary permits and authorisations to launch the construction of a production unit aimed at producing up to 2 tonnes of green hydrogen per day (i.e. an installed electrolysis capacity of 5 MW) to supply local uses in mobility and industry. This production unit  the first in the Hauts-de-France region to make renewable hydrogen available to a wide market  is located on the Mine d'Or industrial area  alongside the A29 motorway.At Sorigny in Touraine  as part of the Hy'Touraine project  Lhyfe is also building a unit to produce up to 2 tonnes of green hydrogen a day (representing an installed electrolysis capacity of 5 MW) to supply local mobility and industrial uses.Germany: construction ongoing at the Schwäbisch Gmünd bulk site and launch of construction of the new Brake bulk siteIn Schwäbisch Gmünd  construction of Lhyfe's production unit (up to 4 tonnes of green hydrogen a day representing an installed electrolysis capacity of 10 MW) began in the second half of 2023 and is continuing in 2024.In Brake  in Lower Saxony  Lhyfe is launching the construction of a production unit to produce up to 4 tonnes of green hydrogen per day (representing an installed electrolysis capacity of 10 MW) to supply local mobility and industrial uses. This production unit  located in the harbour area of Niedersachsen Ports (NPorts)  Germany's largest public seaport operator  will be the first in the northern German region to make bulk green hydrogen available to the wider market. The groundbreaking ceremony will take place on 1 February 2024.Unprecedented advances in offshore green hydrogen productionAfter 14 months of testing  including in particularly tough conditions  the Sealhyfe platform was brought back to the dock in Saint-Nazaire with a wealth of insights that are already benefiting Lhyfe's onshore and offshore projects.The results of this experiment are already being incorporated into the HOPE project  which represents the second stage in Lhyfe's offshore ambitions by changing scale and aiming to commercialise green hydrogen produced offshore. This 10 MW project will be able to produce up to 4 tonnes per day of green hydrogen at sea  which will be exported ashore by pipeline  and then compressed and delivered to customers.On a larger scale  Lhyfe  CIP  the world's largest dedicated fund manager within greenfield renewable energy investments  and Flexens  jointly launched in November 2023 the Åland Energy Island project to develop hydrogen production on the Åland Islands in Finland  integrated with the installation of gigawatt scale offshore wind.Securing renewable electricity supplies: three CPPAs signed in recent monthsLhyfe has further reinforced its network of renewable electricity supplier partners while securing a long-term supply of green electricity for the development of its future sites.

BioSenic is planning a Phase 3 study of its first-in-class oral arsenic trioxide (OATO) therapy in patients with chronic GvHD (cGvHD)  a focus area for the company. The trial will test OATO as a first-line therapy for cGvHD and will begin enrolling the first of about 150 patients over three continents this year. After consulting several clinicians with extensive cGvHD experience in order to develop the protocol for its pivotal Phase 3 study in cGvHD  BioSenic decided to provide support for the biannual meeting  which is organized and hosted by the University Hospital Regensburg in Regensburg  Germany.BioSenic’s Chief Operating Officer and Chief Scientific Officer Carole Nicco  PhD  HDR and Chief Medical Officer Lieven Huysse  MD will attend the congress  focusing respectively on the biomarkers in cGvHD and fine-tuning of the outcome criteria for the upcoming cGvHD Phase 3 study. In addition  the pair will hold further discussions with international key opinion leaders in attendance.Lieven Huysse  said: “This is an excellent opportunity for us to meet important key opinion leaders in the GvHD field  as we finalize the protocol of our state-of-the-art clinical study. We understand how crucial it is to select the most appropriate criteria if we are to move toward a confirmatory outcome for the use of OATO as a first-line therapy  in addition to the standard of care. We are looking forward to learning from leaders in the GvHD field as we concentrate all our efforts on getting the Phase 3 trial up and running.”Carole Nicco adds: "" We have learned from ATO’s mechanisms of action that it could be a very specific and novel type of immunomodulator. We now have a patent pending on biomarkers that allow us to follow the efficacy of treatment in cGvHD. We will focus on this aspect in the Phase 3 trial and ensure that we follow the effect of our treatment using the best possible biomarkers  which happens to be one of the very interesting sessions planned for GvH-GvL Meeting. I can't wait for detailed discussions with other experts in order to reach a consensus for the best-suited set of biomarkers we can add to the companion diagnostics we have already identified.""François Rieger  President of the Board and CEO of BioSenic Group  concludes: "" Our Phase 2 study had promising results  including a 75% overall response rate in the full analysis set population and 82% in the per-protocol set patient population. At BioSenic  we believe that the international pivotal Phase 3 trial of our OATO treatment for cGvHD should provide a definitive indication of this new therapy’s value  and clearly define the duration and dosage of the treatment. ATO has the distinct advantage of being safe and effective over short cycles of administration  reducing the occurrence of potential side effects  all of which were reversible. We expect the risk/benefit balance to be quite favorable.""About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company specializing in the clinical development of autoimmune disease therapies. Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning  key strengths and strong IP to develop products along two tracks  separately and in combination. The first platform leverages immunomodulatory properties of arsenic trioxide (ATO) for an entirely new arsenal of formulations  including oral delivery (OATO)  for anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune indications such as chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). In parallel  BioSenic develops innovative products through a second platform that includes cell therapies and strong IP protection for tissue repair technologies.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic's technology platformsThe ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in autoimmunity to treat in its chronic  established stage. Chronic GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)  a curative treatment for patients with serious blood diseases  including cancers.BioSenic’s intravenous ATO formulation  Arscimed®  has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA  and it has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy for skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract in an early Phase 2a study. The company is planning a confirmatory international Phase 3 study with its oral ATO (OATO) formulation. OATO will also target moderate-to-severe forms of SLE. BioSenic is also developing a new IP-protected OATO formulation for the treatment of SSc  a serious chronic disease that affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models support the launch of a Phase 2 clinical trial.ALLOB is an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated  bone marrow-sourced mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point-of-use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair  and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated MSCs from healthy donors into bone-forming cells at the site of injury. BioSenic is studying the results of a Phase 2 trial to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB by determining the best timing for therapeutic intervention and seeking partners to continue the development of the promising underlying therapy strategies.The company is also exploring partnerships at all levels for its JTA-004 viscosupplement for a severe inflammatory subtype of osteoarthritis  following a positive post hoc analysis of Phase 3 data demonstrating safety and efficacy in support of this licensing.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsMichelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ghislaine.gasparetto@seitosei-actifin.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

This is the first announcement of its kind for Lhyfe.SAF+  world leader in clean energy for aviation  brings together cutting-edge technical expertise to provide sustainable fuel solutions (e-SAF) and help reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry  using available raw materials and renewable energies – like the green hydrogen produced by Lhyfe – in accordance with international and European regulations (CORSIA and RefuelEU).SAF+ brings together a coalition of leading international players from across the aviation value chain. In July 2023  the company announced the signature of a memorandum of understanding with the Air France-KLM Group for the supply of second-generation e-SAF fuel  with the first deliveries scheduled for 2030.Lhyfe produces green and renewable hydrogen through the electrolysis of water  at production units powered by renewable energy. The company’s first site has already been operational since the second half of 2021  and two further sites in France were inaugurated in December 2023. Several other sites are currently under construction or extension across Europe.As part of this memorandum of understanding  Lhyfe and SAF+ plan to assess the potential for developing e-SAF production in the Le Havre area and to sign a co-development agreement.The partners are aiming for a facility in the port region of Le Havre  where Lhyfe would build a green hydrogen production site with a capacity of more than 100 tonnes per day (300 MW of installed electrolysis capacity) to supply an e-SAF production site that SAF+ is planning to build. This industrial complex would be connected to the hydrocarbon transport network in order to transport the e-SAF obtained from Le Havre to airports in the Paris region  as well as in northern and eastern France via the existing infrastructure.The two partners are aiming for a market launch by 2030  to align with market expectations and the zero-emission targets set for 2050.“This agreement between Lhyfe and SAF+ shows our shareholders and stakeholders that our European strategy is well on track. Demand for SAF in the coming years will be exponential  so we now need to be able to demonstrate that viable solutions will be put in place in the short term. The partnership signed today between two leaders like Lhyfe and SAF+ is proof that we can achieve these objectives ” explained SAF+ CEO Jean Paquin.Matthieu Guesné  Founder and CEO of Lhyfe  said: “Through this ambitious agreement with SAF+  we are demonstrating our determination to help decarbonise not only industry and road transport  but also air transport  which in 2020 accounted for 2.9% of global CO2 emissions . Green and renewable hydrogen is now a mature solution that has established itself as one of the pillars of decarbonisation. It can and must now be deployed as quickly as possible  including in the aviation industry.”,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,neutral,0.1,0.88,0.01,True,English,"['SAF+ International', 'Lhyfe', 'memorandum', 'understanding', 'electro Sustainable Aviation Fuel', 'SAF+ CEO Jean Paquin', 'sustainable fuel solutions', 'available raw materials', 'global CO2 emissions', 'green hydrogen production site', 'second-generation e-SAF fuel', 'Air France-KLM Group', 'aviation value chain', 'leading international players', 'hydrocarbon transport network', 'Le Havre area', 'cutting-edge technical expertise', 'Several other sites', 'e-SAF production site', 'SAF+ International Group', 'air transport', 'first site', 'viable solutions', 'renewable hydrogen', 'road transport', 'aviation industry', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'first announcement', 'clean energy', 'carbon footprint', 'renewable energies', 'European regulations', 'first deliveries', 'production units', 'renewable energy', 'second half', 'port region', 'industrial complex', 'Paris region', 'existing infrastructure', 'market launch', 'market expectations', 'zero-emission targets', 'European strategy', 'coming years', 'short term', 'Matthieu Guesné', 'mature solution', 'world leader', 'development agreement', 'two leaders', 'ambitious agreement', 'eastern France', 'two partners', 'electrolysis capacity', 'LoadstarEditorial', 'Lhyfe', 'EURONEXT', 'pioneers', 'marketing', 'kind', 'accordance', 'CORSIA', 'RefuelEU', 'coalition', 'July', 'company', 'signature', 'memorandum', 'understanding', 'supply', 'water', 'December', 'construction', 'extension', 'potential', 'facility', '100 tonnes', 'day', '300 MW', 'order', 'airports', 'northern', 'shareholders', 'stakeholders', 'track', 'Demand', 'place', 'partnership', 'proof', 'objectives', 'Founder', 'determination', 'pillars', 'decarbonisation']",2024-02-01,2024-02-01,theloadstar.com
