There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2022 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  February 1  2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity”  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

35660,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/01/business/frozen-russian-assets-ukraine/index.html,Russia’s frozen assets are generating billions. The EU is getting ready to send them to Ukraine | CNN Business,Russian assets frozen in European accounts are generating billions of dollars in interest payments that could be diverted to help repair Ukraine’s war-torn economy — and the European Union just took a step closer to doing that.,London CNN —Russian assets frozen in European accounts are generating billions of dollars in interest payments that could be diverted to help repair Ukraine’s war-torn economy — and the European Union just took a step closer to doing that.After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  Western countries froze nearly half of Moscow’s foreign reserves — some €300 billion ($327 billion). Around €200 billion ($218 billion) sits in the European Union — mostly at Euroclear  a financial institution that keeps assets safe for banks  exchanges and investors.EU leaders agreed a crucial $50 billion funding package for Ukraine on Thursday and came closer to finalizing a plan to use the profits piling up in Euroclear’s accounts.In a statement issued at the end of a summit  EU leaders said “potential revenues could be generated … concerning the use of extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from the immobilised Central Bank of Russia assets.”Belgium-based Euroclear disclosed Thursday that it has earned €5.2 billion ($5.6 billion) in interest on income generated by sanctioned Russian assets since they were frozen by EU and Group of Seven countries in 2022.“The number of sanctions and countersanctions that have been introduced since February 2022 are unprecedented and continue to have a significant impact on the daily operations of Euroclear ” the group said in a statement.The European Union and its allies are determined to make Russia foot part of the colossal bill for rebuilding Ukraine — estimated by the World Bank a year ago at $411 billion over the next decade.One proposal put forward by the European Commission would involve using a special levy to collect the windfall interest income  which would then be paid into the EU budget for the reconstruction of Ukraine.That plan has been delayed by legal and financial concerns  with some EU member states and the European Central Bank worried that even carefully targeted measures could fall foul of international law and shake confidence in the euro as the world’s second biggest reserve currency. The EU has been at pains to contrast the illegality of Russia’s invasion with its own strict adherence to the rule of law.EU member countries have now agreed in principle to tap this windfall interest income  although the details of how this will be done practically must still be ironed out  an EU diplomat told CNN. Lawyers are working on the text of the agreement before returning it to EU member states for final approval.In its earnings statement  Euroclear — which settles cross-border trades and safeguards more than $40 trillion in assets — said it was focused on “minimising potential legal and operational risks” that may arise from proposals by EU officials to hand the money to Ukraine.Euroclear said additional administrative costs relating to the sanctions cost it €62 million ($67 million) last year  “with considerable senior management and board focus on the topic.”It added that cash on its balance sheet soared €38 billion ($41 billion) year-on-year to €162 billion ($175 billion)  boosted by payments associated with frozen Russian assets  including bonds.These payments include  for example  interest paid on bonds  known as coupons  or the proceeds generated by securities that mature and are reinvested.Ordinarily  these payments would have been made to Russian bank accounts  but they have been blocked by the sanctions and are generating vast amounts of interest — even more so given the recent spate of rate hikes.Euroclear  for its part  is embroiled in several legal proceedings pertaining to the sanctions — almost exclusively in Russian courts — as claimants seek to access the assets blocked in its books.The company said it continues to retain profits related to these assets “until further guidance is provided on the distribution or management of such profits.”— James Frater contributed reporting.,neutral,0.14,0.79,0.07,negative,0.03,0.22,0.75,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'The EU', 'CNN Business', 'Russia', 'billions', 'Ukraine', 'crucial $50 billion funding package', 'biggest reserve currency', 'additional administrative costs', 'EU member states', 'considerable senior management', 'several legal proceedings', 'EU member countries', 'European Central Bank', 'The European Union', 'windfall interest income', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian bank accounts', 'Russian courts', 'European accounts', 'Western countries', 'Seven countries', 'European Commission', 'EU leaders', 'EU budget', 'EU diplomat', 'EU officials', 'war-torn economy', 'foreign reserves', 'financial institution', 'potential revenues', 'extraordinary revenues', 'private entities', 'significant impact', 'daily operations', 'colossal bill', 'World Bank', 'next decade', 'One proposal', 'special levy', 'financial concerns', 'strict adherence', 'final approval', 'cross-border trades', 'potential legal', 'operational risks', 'board focus', 'balance sheet', 'vast amounts', 'recent spate', 'rate hikes', 'James Frater', 'full-scale invasion', 'international law', 'earnings statement', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'interest payments', 'Russia assets', 'London', 'CNN', 'billions', 'dollars', 'Ukraine', 'step', 'February', 'half', 'Moscow', 'banks', 'exchanges', 'investors', 'Thursday', 'plan', 'profits', 'end', 'summit', 'use', 'Group', 'number', 'sanctions', 'allies', 'foot', 'part', 'reconstruction', 'measures', 'confidence', 'second', 'pains', 'illegality', 'rule', 'principle', 'details', 'Lawyers', 'text', 'agreement', 'proposals', 'money', 'topic', 'cash', 'year', 'bonds', 'example', 'coupons', 'proceeds', 'securities', 'claimants', 'books', 'company', 'guidance', 'distribution', 'reporting']",2024-02-01,2024-02-02,cnn.com
35661,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/02/01/china-decoupling-derisking-technology-sanctions-trade-us-eu-west/,The West Did Not Invent Decoupling—China Did,Beijing has long sought to gain a free hand by untangling its economy from the West.,There is a story told among Kremlin watchers: Shortly after Western countries first imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014  Russian President Vladimir Putin summoned his economic advisors. His question was simple: How was Russia doing in terms of self-sufficiency for food? Not very well  came the reply. The country was dependent on imports to feed its citizens. Putin went pale and ordered that something be done  fearing that sanctions could curb Moscow’s access to food staples.There is a story told among Kremlin watchers: Shortly after Western countries first imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014  Russian President Vladimir Putin summoned his economic advisors. His question was simple: How was Russia doing in terms of self-sufficiency for food? Not very well  came the reply. The country was dependent on imports to feed its citizens. Putin went pale and ordered that something be done  fearing that sanctions could curb Moscow’s access to food staples.Fast-forward to Russia’s full-blown invasion of Ukraine in 2022  and Putin no longer had to worry about food. In only eight years  Russia had become almost self-sufficient  producing meat  fish  and even decent-quality cheese.Russia’s bid for food self-sufficiency long predates the currently fashionable debate over economic decoupling—recently rebranded as de-risking—both of which entail curbing economic reliance on unfriendly states. Contrary to what the political discourse might suggest  Western countries did not invent these policies. As the Russian example demonstrates  countries at odds with Western democracies have long been pursuing a de-risking policy to shield themselves from their potential foes.Compared to Russia  China has an even longer track record of reducing economic reliance on the West in technology  trade  and finance. If there is an inventor and world leader of decoupling and de-risking  it is by all accounts Beijing.Long before the United States imposed a flurry of controls on high-tech exports to China in recent years  Chinese leaders made technology the first pillar of their de-risking push. Beijing’s first investment plans in the semiconductor sector  for example  date back to the 1980s—with arguably mixed results  given that China never got beyond producing basic chips at the time.China’s calculus is simple: Technology forms the backbone of economic and military superiority. Technological self-sufficiency  to Beijing  is therefore an existential imperative to survive and thrive.China’s efforts to reduce its technological dependence deepened over the past decade. In 2015  two years before former U.S. President Donald Trump started bragging about cutting ties with China  Beijing released its “Made in China 2025” blueprint for self-sufficiency in key technology sectors—including semiconductors  artificial intelligence  and clean tech.China’s view of technological self-sufficiency as an existential imperative has led to impressive progress in only a few years. In many high-tech fields  Chinese firms and researchers are either the unchallenged world leaders (notably in clean tech  where Chinese firms dominate the market for solar panels  wind turbines  and electric vehicles) or roughly on a par with their Western competitors (including in artificial intelligence  quantum computing  and biotech).Semiconductors are an exception: When it comes to microchips  Western policymakers like to reassure themselves by noting that China still lags far behind the United States  Taiwan  and South Korea in the production of cutting-edge chips. While this is certainly true  Beijing may actually welcome the additional sense of urgency that U.S. export controls have fueled.Chinese leaders also know that export controls can easily backfire. History shows that in the long run  unilateral U.S. export controls have almost always damaged U.S. firms by restricting their export revenues—which  in turn  curbs the amounts that they can spend on research and development to remain at the cutting edge. In other words  Beijing is playing the long game  hoping that Washington’s aggressive strategy will eventually backfire—and further help China’s bid to reduce its reliance on Western technology.Finance is the second  long-established pillar of Beijing’s de-risking strategy. In that field  too  China’s efforts to cut ties with Western economies preceded U.S. and European plans to de-risk from Beijing. The most obvious example is that Beijing has never allowed significant foreign involvement in its domestic financial sector. The country’s financial markets are closed  with foreign investors owning only 4 percent of Chinese stocks and 9 percent of Chinese government debt. China has its own banking system that is almost entirely walled off from international finance  with non-Chinese investors controlling less than 2 percent of Chinese bank assets. And the capital controls that severely restrict the movement of funds in and out of the country are nowhere near being lifted.Yet Beijing’s de-risking efforts in the financial sphere go much further than just keeping foreigners away. China’s leaders face an inconvenient truth: Reliance on Western financial channels may well be Beijing’s Achilles’ heel. Europe and the United States own the world’s dominant currencies and control access to global financial infrastructure  such as SWIFT  the global payment system connecting all banks  and Euroclear  one of the most important global depositories for securities.Western financial dominance is what makes sanctions so powerful. Losing access to the dollar or to SWIFT is a virtual death sentence for most banks and companies  as Beijing saw after the Western decision to cut off Iran’s access to SWIFT in 2012.In a preemptive bid to vaccinate itself against financial sanctions  China has developed a three-pronged strategy.First  the country is pushing to develop cross-border payments in renminbi. The path will be steep  given the dominance of the dollar and euro for global trade. Yet China’s de-dollarization plans are making progress: The share of global payments settled in renminbi almost doubled in 2023  to nearly 4 percent—still a small number  but the direction of travel appears clear. Crucially  one-third of China’s foreign trade is now denominated in renminbi  offering Chinese firms some protection against Western sanctions. Despite all the chatter about a possible currency for the BRICS bloc—which comprises Brazil  Russia  India  China  South Africa  and five recently added nations—Beijing also hopes that the renminbi will become the currency of choice for trade among BRICS countries  similar to the way that it has become the most-used currency for Russia-China trade.China’s alternative to SWIFT  CIPS (the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System)  represents a second cornerstone of Beijing’s financial de-risking edifice. Launched in 2015  the payments network is much smaller than SWIFT. However  it connects most banks across the world and would provide a backup if SWIFT were to disconnect Chinese banks. Finally  China is also piloting cross-border transactions using digital currency with the United Arab Emirates  Thailand  and other countries. The road will be long for a Chinese digital currency to become global. But dominance may not be the point: China’s goal is to have alternative financial channels as a means of protection  which only requires them to be operational.The third and final pillar of China’s de-risking strategy entails reducing reliance on unfriendly states for trade and as destinations for Chinese investment. The reasoning is similar to that of Putin when he worried about Russia’s food security back in 2014: Beijing sees overreliance on any country for trade flows as a weakness  since conflicts  pandemics  or geopolitical tensions can curb economic ties or disrupt supply chains. For an export-oriented economy such as China  excessive dependence on any given country for the imports of critical inputs or as a key export destination could be fatal.China’s de-risking efforts in trade are more recent than those in tech and finance  roughly dating back to the first U.S.-China trade war in 2018. Yet a look at the latest statistics from Chinese customs shows that China has lately sped up trade de-risking  with a clear effort to diversify ties away from seemingly unfriendly Western states.In the first 11 months of 2023  Chinese exports to the United States decreased by 8.5 percent compared to the same period in 2022  while those to the European Union dropped by 5.8 percent. Meanwhile  China’s exports to most emerging markets—including India  Russia  Thailand  Latin America  and Africa—rose. China’s efforts to decrease trade reliance on Western economies are paying off: In 2023  the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations collectively became China’s biggest export destination  ahead of both the United States and EU.China’s de-risking efforts also extend to the investment sphere. Data from the American Enterprise Institute shows that in the decade to 2014  the G-7 economies plus Australia and New Zealand absorbed nearly half of China’s outbound investment flows  excluding Belt and Road Initiative funds. By 2022  this share dropped to a mere 15 percent  with emerging economies such as Indonesia  Saudi Arabia  and Brazil attracting the biggest inflows of Chinese direct investment.Similarly to China’s other efforts  the investment push toward emerging markets also predates the invention of Western de-risking plans. The shift became noticeable in the data in 2017  but the start was likely much earlier  since investment projects typically take several years to come to fruition.All of this underlines that China’s de-risking push is far older and more extensive than U.S. and European efforts in the field. Yet discussions of China’s own de-risking strategy are conspicuously absent from the Western debate.This is a serious flaw: Seen from Beijing  the Western push to decrease reliance on China is another reason to accelerate China’s long-established plans to prioritize technological self-sufficiency over reliance on cutting-edge U.S. technology  homegrown financial infrastructure over Western banking channels  and emerging markets over Western economies. Beijing’s long  systematic shift away from the United States and Europe is a prominent feature of Chinese economic policy  and it comes with huge consequences.De-risking is a two-way street. Economic ties give significant leverage to the United States and Europe over Beijing  even if some will argue that the idea of economic interdependence leading to cooperation and peace crashed and burned with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But the ongoing process of severing the links between China and the West will inevitably diminish the deterrence effect of Western sanctions threats  making the world—and the Taiwan Strait in particular—a less safe place.This is exactly China’s strategy  with Chinese ambitions to annex Taiwan being one of the key reasons behind China’s plans for self-sufficiency in the first place. The United States and Europe did not invent de-risking—China did. And it very much looks like the most skilled practitioner in the field.,neutral,0.04,0.81,0.15,mixed,0.06,0.28,0.66,True,English,"['The West', 'Decoupling', 'China', 'former U.S. President Donald Trump', 'unilateral U.S. export controls', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'U.S. firms', 'longer track record', 'many high-tech fields', 'significant foreign involvement', 'Chinese government debt', 'Chinese bank assets', 'first investment plans', 'domestic financial sector', 'unchallenged world leaders', 'key technology sectors', 'export revenues', 'Russian example', 'capital controls', 'Chinese leaders', 'Chinese firms', 'high-tech exports', 'first pillar', 'semiconductor sector', 'European plans', 'financial markets', 'foreign investors', 'Chinese stocks', 'Kremlin watchers', 'decent-quality cheese', 'fashionable debate', 'unfriendly states', 'political discourse', 'Western democracies', 'de-risking policy', 'potential foes', 'United States', 'de-risking push', 'mixed results', 'basic chips', 'military superiority', 'existential imperative', 'technological dependence', 'past decade', 'artificial intelligence', 'clean tech', 'impressive progress', 'solar panels', 'wind turbines', 'electric vehicles', 'Western competitors', 'quantum computing', 'Western policymakers', 'South Korea', 'cutting-edge chips', 'additional sense', 'cutting edge', 'other words', 'long game', 'aggressive strategy', 'established pillar', 'de-risking strategy', 'Western economies', 'banking system', 'non-Chinese investors', 'economic advisors', 'Western countries', 'eight years', 'recent years', 'obvious example', 'Western technology', 'food staples', 'economic reliance', 'Technological self-sufficiency', 'economic decoupling', 'international finance', 'food self-sufficiency', 'story', 'sanctions', 'response', 'invasion', 'annexation', 'Crimea', 'question', 'terms', 'reply', 'country', 'imports', 'citizens', 'something', 'Moscow', 'access', 'Ukraine', 'meat', 'fish', 'bid', 'policies', 'odds', 'China', 'trade', 'inventor', 'accounts', 'Beijing', 'flurry', '1980s', 'time', 'calculus', 'backbone', 'efforts', 'ties', 'Made', 'blueprint', 'semiconductors', 'view', 'researchers', 'par', 'biotech', 'exception', 'microchips', 'Taiwan', 'production', 'urgency', 'turn', 'amounts', 'development', 'Washington', '4 percent', '9 percent', 'less', '2 percent', 'movement', 'funds', '2025']",2024-02-01,2024-02-02,foreignpolicy.com

Cabka N.V.   a company specialized in transforming hard to recycle plastic waste into innovative Reusable Transport Packaging   listed at Euronext Amsterdam  announced its 2023 preli…,Amsterdam  Feb. 01  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amsterdam February 1  2024. Cabka N.V. (together with its subsidiaries “Cabka”  or the “Company”)  a company specialized in transforming hard to recycle plastic waste into innovative Reusable Transport Packaging (RTP)  listed at Euronext Amsterdam  announced its 2023 preliminary update today.The last quarter of 2023 showed a significant 35% Quarter-on-Quarter recovery in sales to €53 million (Q3 2023: €40 million). Total sales for the full year of 2023 amounted to €197 million  6% lower compared to the record sales achieved in 2022 of €209 million. Total 2023 sales ended €3 million below outlook  fully attributable to an agreed delayed new customer project launch. Consequently  this caused a 0.8% negative impact on the operational EBITDA margin for full year 2023.The company expects to reach an operational EBITDA of € 24.2m for full year 2023  and improvement of the operational EBITDA margin by 1.5pp to 12.3% in 2023  compared to 10.8% in 2022.The key strategic segment of Customized Solutions continued to perform well  showing a strong 20% growth in 2023. The positive momentum in the fourth quarter further accelerated with new products launched in close partnership with CHEP  Continental  and BMW. Cabka’s Eco business grew 7% following the completion of its capacity expansion earlier in the year.Sales in 2023 are to be considered in the context of challenging general market circumstances  with increasing interest rates leading to significant destocking and restricted capital investments from customers in most of Cabka’s end markets. This resulted in overall lower market demand and pricing pressure across the industry.Lower total sales were driven by the divestment of the PVC business  and declining sales in the non-strategic contract manufacturing segment. The continued focus on product innovations enabled Cabka to mitigate market headwinds  resulting in stable sales across strategic segments.Cabka will publish its full preliminary results 2023 on March 20  2024.Financial Reporting Calendar 2024March 20 Preliminary Results 2023April 18 Publication Annual Report 2023 and Trading Update 2024Q1May 30 Annual General Meeting of ShareholdersAugust 13 Half-Year Results and Half-Year Report 2024October 21 Trading Update 2024Q3For more information  please contact:Frank Roerink  CFOIR@cabka.com+49 152 04623490investors.cabka.comAbout CabkaCabka is in the business of recycling plastics from post-consumer and post-industrial waste into innovative reusable transport packaging (RTP)  like pallets- and large container solutions enhancing logistics chain sustainability.

This is the first announcement of its kind for Lhyfe.SAF+  world leader in clean energy for aviation  brings together cutting-edge technical expertise to provide sustainable fuel solutions (e-SAF) and help reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry  using available raw materials and renewable energies – like the green hydrogen produced by Lhyfe – in accordance with international and European regulations (CORSIA and RefuelEU).SAF+ brings together a coalition of leading international players from across the aviation value chain. In July 2023  the company announced the signature of a memorandum of understanding with the Air France-KLM Group for the supply of second-generation e-SAF fuel  with the first deliveries scheduled for 2030.Lhyfe produces green and renewable hydrogen through the electrolysis of water  at production units powered by renewable energy. The company's first site has already been operational since the second half of 2021  and two further sites in France were inaugurated in December 2023.Several other sites are currently under construction or extension across Europe.As part of this memorandum of understanding  Lhyfe and SAF+ plan to assess the potential for developing e-SAF production in the Le Havre area and to sign a co-development agreement.The partners are aiming for a facility in the port region of Le Havre  where Lhyfe would build a green hydrogen production site with a capacity of more than 100 tonnes per day (300 MW of installed electrolysis capacity) to supply an e-SAF production site that SAF+ is planning to build. This industrial complex would be connected to the hydrocarbon transport network in order to transport the e-SAF obtained from Le Havre to airports in the Paris region  as well as in northern and eastern France via the existing infrastructure.The two partners are aiming for a market launch by 2030  to align with market expectations andthe zero-emission targets set for 2050.“This agreement between Lhyfe and SAF+ shows our shareholders and stakeholders that our European strategy is well on track. Demand for SAF in the coming years will be exponential  so we now need to be able to demonstrate that viable solutions will be put in place in the short term. The partnership signed today between two leaders like Lhyfe and SAF+ is proof that we can achieve these objectives ” explained SAF+ CEO Jean Paquin.Matthieu Guesné  Founder and CEO of Lhyfe said: “Through this ambitious agreement with SAF+  we are demonstrating our determination to help decarbonise not only industry and road transport  but also air transport  which in 2020 accounted for 2.9% of global CO2 emissions[1]. Green and renewable hydrogen is now a mature solution that has established itself as one of the pillars of decarbonisation. It can and must now be deployed as quickly as possible  including in the aviation industry”.About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen. Its production sites and portfolio of projects intend to provide access to green and renewable hydrogen in industrial quantities  and enable the creation of a virtuous energy model capable of decarbonising entire sectors of industry and transport.In 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the first industrial-scale green hydrogen production plant in the world to be interconnected with a wind farm. In 2022  it inaugurated the first offshore green hydrogen production pilot platform in the world. In 2023  it inaugurated its second and third sites  and currently has several sites under construction or expansion across Europe. Lhyfe is represented in 12 European countries and had 195 staff at the end of December 2023. The company is listed on the Euronext market in Paris (ISIN: FR0014009YQ1 – LHYFE).

The assembly of the thermal compressor and the volumetric compressor  constituting the hybrid compressor  has been completed in the BOOSTHEAT laboratory  enabling the crucial testing phase to begin.The tests carried out in January confirmed that this new patented technology works perfectly. This success marks a significant turning point in the project  underlining BOOSTHEAT's ability to deliver cutting-edge innovations in the energy field.Rabah Ibsaine  BOOSTHEAT's thermodynamics expert  comments: ""This latest technological success illustrates the ability of BOOSTHEAT's technical teams to transform a patent-protected idea into a working prototype  demonstrating the technical feasibility of our concepts. It is a crucial step that validates previous research and justifies the investments made to date on hybrid compression technology  whose potential is immense.""Following on from our previous press releases  BOOSTHEAT is now preparing to enter the final phase of the project. In the coming weeks  performance tests will validate the 3 operating modes of the hybrid compressor  in order to confirm the theoretical potential of this patented compressor[2]:The possibility of flexible and smart combination of the 2 primary energies (gas and electricity) according to various criteria chosen by the customer (energy cost / availability / etc.). Heating or cooling production that can be coupled with modulating electricity production (micro-cogeneration application). The use of a ""booster"" effect combining the two primary energy sources simultaneously to increase the levels of heat or cold produced by the hybrid system.The Company will report on each of these operating modes and their performance as the tests progress.All these steps represent major advances and pave the way for commercial developments for innovative  high-performance industrial applications.

The technology uses proprietary materials  including inert anodes  first developed at the Alcoa Technical Center near Pittsburgh. That research and development work became the technological basis for ELYSIS™  a technology partnership that is working to ramp up the process to commercial scale.Several Nexans facilities in Western Europe and Scandinavia will use aluminum produced from the ELYSIS™ process to start qualifications for the metal’s use in various types of cables  from low  medium to high voltage. Aluminum rod produced with this breakthrough ELYSIS™ technology could eliminate a significant portion of carbon dioxide emissions in the future.This latest announcement further builds on the two companies’ historic long-term relationship. Alcoa already supplies Nexans with EcoLum™  a primary aluminum with a carbon footprint that is nearly three times lower than the industry average.1Since the launch of ELYSIS™ in 2018  the technology company has produced R&D quantities of the metal. Alcoa is marketing and selling its share of the ELYSIS metal  which has also been used for the wheels on the Audi eTron GT  the automaker’s first electric sports car. Apple is also an investor in the technology and has used ELYSIS metal for some of its products.ELYSIS is a key component in Alcoa’s technology roadmap of research and development projects that also includes projects such as the ASTRAEA™ metal purification process and the Refinery of the Future.This agreement fully highlights Nexans’ position at the forefront of the sustainable electrification of the world and regarding crucial issues such as low-carbon emissions.Renato Bacchi – Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Alcoa:“Alcoa is well positioned to supply low carbon aluminum for the world’s transition to renewable energy  as we know that the true impact of decarbonization will also include the choice of materials used to build the infrastructure for generation  transmission and distribution networks. While we are developing ELYSIS™ for the future  we are also supplying low-carbon aluminum today with our EcoLum™ metal  which can help customers meet their own sustainability goals and lower their carbon footprints.”Vincent Dessale – Nexans Chief Operating Officer Senior Executive VP:“In the fight against climate change  solutions that support the world’s energy transition make a real difference. By increasing our use of low-carbon aluminum  we want to lead the way toward a sustainable electrification of the world: the rod produced with this breakthrough technology could eliminate a significant portion of carbon dioxide emissions in the future. We are proud to be the world’s first cable manufacturer to use metal from the breakthrough technology ELYSIS™.”1: Alcoa’s EcoLum™ primary aluminum is produced with less than 4.0 metric tons of CO2e for every ton of metal  including both direct and indirect (Scope 1 and Scope 2) emissions from mining  refining  smelting and casting. EcoLum's emissions intensity vs. the global average per ton of per ton of CO2e/ton of aluminum is approximately three times better than the global average of 13.3  based on CRU emissions intensity data  2022About Alcoa CorporationAlcoa (NYSE: AA) is a global industry leader in bauxite  alumina and aluminum products with a vision to reinvent the aluminum industry for a sustainable future.

For more information  please visit www.nexans.comAbout ELYSIS™ELYSIS is a technology partnership created thanks to a ground-breaking partnership between two global industry leaders – Alcoa and Rio Tinto. ELYSIS’ goal is to revolutionize the way aluminum is produced across the globe  with technology that enables the production of metal without direct carbon dioxide emissions during the aluminum smelting process  instead emitting oxygen. The company uses inert anodes that replace the carbon anodes traditionally used during electrolysis  which is the process used to make primary aluminum. ELYSIS is currently working to scale up its zero-carbon smelting process so it can be licensed for either retrofits of existing smelters or the construction of new ones. It operates an Industrial Research & Development Center in Québec  Canada with support from Alcoa’s Technical Center outside Pittsburgh.Learn more at www.elysis.comView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240131324761/en/,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,positive,0.75,0.23,0.01,True,English,"['low-carbon aluminum', 'ELYSIS™ technology', 'Alcoa', 'Nexans', 'metal', 'two companies’ historic long-term relationship', 'first electric sports car', 'CRU emissions intensity data', 'direct greenhouse gas emissions', 'ASTRAEA™ metal purification process', 'global cable producer Nexans', 'Nexans Chief Operating Officer', 'Chief Commercial Officer', 'first cable manufacturer', 'R&D quantities', 'Audi eTron GT', 'Executive Vice President', 'Senior Executive VP', 'lower CO2 emissions', 'carbon dioxide emissions', 'Several Nexans facilities', 'traditional smelting process', 'Alcoa Technical Center', 'low carbon aluminum', 'global industry leader', 'low-carbon aluminum rod', 'EcoLum™ primary aluminum', 'low-carbon emissions', 'carbon footprint', 'commercial scale', 'low, medium', 'global average', 'revolutionary process', 'inert anodes', 'development work', 'technological basis', 'Western Europe', 'various types', 'high voltage', 'significant portion', 'latest announcement', 'key component', 'crucial issues', 'Renato Bacchi', 'renewable energy', 'true impact', 'distribution networks', 'Vincent Dessale', 'climate change', 'real difference', '4.0 metric tons', 'values-based approach', 'courageous leadership', 'Raw Potential', 'Real Progress', 'vital part', 'modern life', 'talented Alcoans', 'best practices', 'greater efficiency', 'stronger communities', 'a century', 'crucial role', 'safe, sustainable', 'decarbonized electricity', '6.7 billion euros', 'standard sales', 'aluminum industry', 'Nexans’ position', 'technology partnership', 'technology company', 'technology roadmap', 'sustainable electrification', 'ELYSIS™ process', 'proprietary materials', 'development projects', 'sustainability goals', 'energy transition', 'breakthrough innovations', 'The Group', 'aluminum products', 'ELYSIS™ technology', 'EcoLum™ metal', 'breakthrough technology', 'Alcoa Corporation', 'sustainable future', 'new world', 'ELYSIS metal', 'oxygen', 'byproduct', 'NYSE', 'AA', 'Pittsburgh', 'research', 'Scandinavia', 'qualifications', 'cables', 'launch', 'share', 'wheels', 'automaker', 'Apple', 'investor', 'Refinery', 'agreement', 'forefront', 'decarbonization', 'choice', 'infrastructure', 'generation', 'transmission', 'customers', 'fight', 'solutions', 'way', 'less', 'CO2e', 'indirect', 'Scope', 'mining', 'refining', 'casting', 'bauxite', 'alumina', 'vision', 'integrity', 'excellence', 'care', 'people', 'purpose', 'safety', 'information', 'planet', '42 countries', 'everyone', 'design', 'manufacturing']",2024-02-01,2024-02-02,marketscreener.com

Higher sales volumes in North America more than offset pricing declines in the region  and improved execution in South America drove sequentially higher EBITDA. Results also benefitted to a lesser extent from favorable iron ore pricing and sequentially improved EBITDA in Germany  which led to a slightly positive EBITDA contribution from Germany in 2023. Relative to Vallourec’s prior outlook  results exceeded expectations in both main segments  but particularly in the Tubes results in the Americas.Vallourec’s net debt declined substantially in the fourth quarter to less than €580 million. As expected  restructuring cash out was a significant headwind  but cash flow was supported by strong EBITDA and further working capital release. Vallourec expects to further deleverage its balance sheet and achieve zero net debt by year-end 2025 at the latest.Philippe Guillemot  Chairman and CEO of Vallourec  said: ""Our fourth quarter results bring a highly successful year for Vallourec to a close. In addition to efficiently executing multiple global workstreams related to the New Vallourec plan  the Group delivered its best EBITDA and cash generation in nearly 15 years. We have now completed the shutdown of our German operations  and I thank the team there for their commitment to delivering quality results and products throughout this operation’s final year. Moreover  I would like to thank all Vallourec employees for their tireless efforts to improve our business and execute the New Vallourec plan. While we are proud of our accomplishments  we see many more opportunities to enhance our profitability ahead. We remain on track to reach zero net debt by year end 2025 at the latest.

Currency variations had a negative impact on revenue growth of -6.9%  mainly due to the depreciation of the Russian ruble and  to a lesser extent  the US dollar.Activity by Geographical RegionTotal consolidated revenue(in millions of euros) 1st half year2023-2024 1st half year 2022-2023 Variation Reported figures Variation Like-for-like basis* 2nd quarter 2023-2024 2nd quarter 2022-2023 Variation Reported figures Variation Like-for-like basis* Europe Zone 786.4 739.1 6.4% 5.9% 411.1 390.5 5.3% 4.7% Non-Europe Zone 426.6 504.2 -15.4% 2.5% 233.5 281.6 -17.1% 4.9% Total 1 213.1 1 243.4 -2.4% 4.5% 644.6 672.1 -4.1% 4.8%Activity by Operating SegmentsTotal consolidated revenue(in millions of euros) 1st half year2023-2024 1st half year 2022-2023 Variation Reported figures Variation Like-for-like basis* 2nd quarter 2023-2024 2nd quarter 2022-2023 Variation Reported figures Variation Like-for-like basis* Canned 594.7 597.1 -0.4% 10.6% 343.5 357.0 -3.8% 9.8% Frozen 148.9 138.5 7.5% 9.3% 82.2 76.9 6.9% 9.4% Fresh processed 469.5 507.7 -7.5% -3.9% 218.8 238.2 -8.1% -4.2% Total 1 213.1 1 243.4 -2.4% 4.5% 644.6 672.1 -4.1% 4.8%Europe ZoneThe Europe Zone representing 64.8% of the business activity over the period  posted overall growth of +6.4% on reported figures and +5.9% on a like-for-like basis* over the 1st half year  with all technologies showing growth over the period.Variations for the 2nd quarter were respectively +5.3% on reported figures and +4.7% on a like-for-like basis*.The downturn in volumes remains limited in the region despite a significant weakness in food consumption. In canned and frozen retail activity  the private label category grew in both volume and value  while branded products (Bonduelle and Cassegrain) increased in value but fell back in volume.The food service activity continued to grow  in both volume and value.The fresh processed segment (bagged salads) was virtually stable in volume  but grew in value in retail. However  the situation varied from one region to another  with France affected by bad weather leading to a lower service rate. Germany is operating in a difficult market context while Italy is recording solid growth.Fresh prepared segment posted growth over the period  fueled by range renovations.Non-Europe ZoneThe Non-Europe Zone revenue representing 35.2% of the business activity over the period  posted an overall decline of -15.4% on reported figures and +2.5% on a like-for-like basis*.The activity was clearly penalized by the translation effects of the Russian ruble  which lost an average of 40% of its value between the 1st half of the 2023-2024 fiscal year and the same half of the previous fiscal year.Changes in the 2nd quarter amounted to -17.1% on reported figures and +4.9% on a like-for-like basis*.In the Eurasia region  the canned activity remained sustained in terms of volume and value  for both branded products (which are largely predominant in the region) and private label category. The frozen activity recovered significantly over the last quarter and now shows sustained growth in volume and value over the period as a whole.In North America  the decline in fresh processed products (bagged salads and meal solutions) remained more limited than in the same period last year  due to negative market trends. In this context  branded complete meal solutions based on salads as well as salad kits (salad bags with ingredients) posted significant market share gains.Other significant informationAnnual Shareholder’s Meeting held on Dec 7  2023The Bonduelle Group's Annual Shareholder’s Meeting held on December 7  2023 approved the payment of a dividend of 0.25 euro per share  with effective payment on January 4  2024  as well as the election of Rémi Duriez to replace Matthieu Duriez  whose mandate expired at this meeting  and the reappointment of Jean-Michel Thierry as members of the Supervisory Board.OutlookThe Bonduelle Group will announce its revenue and profitability outlook for the 2023-2024 fiscal year during the presentation of its first half year results on March 1  2024.* at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis.

In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2022 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov ). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  February 1  2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity”  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Germany is operating in a difficult market context while Italy is recording solid growth.Fresh prepared segment posted growth over the period  fueled by range renovations.Non-Europe ZoneThe Non-Europe Zone revenue representing 35.2% of the business activity over the period  posted an overall decline of -15.4% on reported figures and +2.5% on a like-for-like basis*.The activity was clearly penalized by the translation effects of the Russian ruble  which lost an average of 40% of its value between the 1st half of the 2023-2024 fiscal year and the same half of the previous fiscal year.Changes in the 2nd quarter amounted to -17.1% on reported figures and +4.9% on a like-for-like basis*.In the Eurasia region  the canned activity remained sustained in terms of volume and value  for both branded products (which are largely predominant in the region) and private label category. The frozen activity recovered significantly over the last quarter and now shows sustained growth in volume and value over the period as a whole.In North America  the decline in fresh processed products (bagged salads and meal solutions) remained more limited than in the same period last year  due to negative market trends. In this context  branded complete meal solutions based on salads as well as salad kits (salad bags with ingredients) posted significant market share gains.Other significant informationAnnual Shareholder’s Meeting held on Dec 7  2023The Bonduelle Group's Annual Shareholder’s Meeting held on December 7  2023 approved the payment of a dividend of 0.25 euro per share  with effective payment on January 4  2024  as well as the election of Rémi Duriez to replace Matthieu Duriez  whose mandate expired at this meeting  and the reappointment of Jean-Michel Thierry as members of the Supervisory Board.OutlookThe Bonduelle Group will announce its revenue and profitability outlook for the 2023-2024 fiscal year during the presentation of its first half year results on March 1  2024.* at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis.

Several of Justin Bieber’s videos on his page  including a live performance of him singing “Yummy ” are now silent.The update is the climax of a tense year of negotiating between UMG and TikTok over the two companies’ differing views on what constitutes a fair deal for use of the record company’s music on the platform.UMG set the stage for the sonic stripping when it posted an open letter Tuesday night saying its prior licensing deal with TikTok was set to expire Wednesday and that talks over a new deal had reached an impasse. The world’s largest music company — whose artists include Taylor Swift  Billie Eilish  Olivia Rodrigo  Drake  Kendrick Lamar  and Daddy Yankee — said it was making a stand “for the creative and commercial value of music.”(Excerpt) Read more at rollingstone.com ...TOPICS:KEYWORDS:internetlicensingmusicsocialmediataylorswifttaytaytiktokClick here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic  LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno  CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.Saw a post from an artist I follow and fond this article. Wiki background on UMG: Universal Music Group N.V. (often abbreviated as UMG and referred to as just Universal Music) is a Dutch–American multinational music corporation under Dutch law. UMG's corporate headquarters are located in Hilversum  Netherlands and its operational headquarters are located in Santa Monica  California. The biggest music company in the world  it is one of the ""Big Three"" record labels  along with Sony Music and Warner Music Group. Tencent acquired ten percent of Universal Music Group in March 2020 for €3 billion and acquired an additional ten percent stake in January 2021. Pershing Square Holdings later acquired ten percent of UMG prior to its IPO on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. The company went public on September 21  2021  at a valuation of €46 billion. The company's origins go back to the formation of the American branch of Decca Records in September 1934 and its name and company logo originates from Carl Laemmle's Universal Pictures.

The reason practically no one knows anything about him is that  after his death  Richard Wagner conducted one of his works  decided he didn’t like it  and refused ever to conduct an Onslow work again—and that was enough to keep Onslow’s music unheard for a century. No one has that kind of power today  not even TikTok or UMG. If you want to hear someone’s music  you can access any of a plethora of recording sources  and it’s only in places like North Korea or Tajikistan where the government is so authoritarian that music can be controlled—and even in these places there is an underground of resistance to the tyranny.by 11 posted onby chajin (""There is no other name under heaven given among people by which we must be saved.""

I don't think she's even a Biden ""groupie"". I think she's just playing the game  she has to be for Biden because she's in Hollywood. Even if she's for Biden  she's probably lukewarm about it.To: TornadoAlley3Why is she a POS? Because she votes differently than you. Is that all you see? I don't really get this growing loathing of Swift amongst some corners of conservatism (the MAGA populist right  to be specific). She's about as anodyne a celebrity as you could find. She isn't all pierced and tattooed. She's not flashing her tits in concert  dropping F-bombs. She's not dating a revolving door of scowling black rappers. I can think of about a thousand current acts far more degenerate than Taylor Swift is. Her romance with Travis Kelce is the kind of wholesome courtship that conservatives used to cheer. He seems like a decent guy. He did an ad for Pfizer? So what? Pfizer had no greater friend than President Trump so what's the big deal? Yes  she unenthusiastically endorsed Biden  and probably will again. As a rule  entertainers are Democrats. Again  so what? Celebrity endorsements don't mean squat. On this last point however  it doesn't help that we've thrown our lot behind a candidate who is absolutely repulsive to women. Anyways  go Taylor! Hope you get married and help to drive up the white birth rate!

Historically  DLs have been rare in the U.S.  but that has changed in recent years  starting with Spotify’s …,Initial public offerings (IPOs) and direct listings (DLs) offer two different mechanisms for a firm to obtain a listing in the public capital markets. Historically  DLs have been rare in the U.S.  but that has changed in recent years  starting with Spotify’s listing through a DL in 2018. Since then the number of DLs in the U.S. has increased rapidly. There are two key differences between IPOs and DLs: (1) IPO firms raise fresh capital  whereas traditionally  DLs have not  and (2) DLs do not employ an underwriter.The listing process for a DL is quite simple: The firm’s outstanding shares are simply listed on a stock exchange without a primary or secondary offering to raise fresh capital. The firm’s existing shareholders are then free to sell their shares in the public market. Prior to listing  the DL firm hires an investment bank to counsel the firm on filing its registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and preparing presentations to investors. Because DLs do not employ an underwriter  they are much cheaper than IPOs.The rising prevalence of DLs in the U.S. capital markets is driven  in part  by the growth in size and sophistication of the private capital markets over the last 20 years. Increasingly  new firms can raise much larger sums of capital in the private capital markets with the result that private firms can delay going public  and when they do eventually go public  they do not need to raise new equity capital to fund their investment plans. For such firms  DLs provide an attractive and much cheaper means of going public.However  regulators  including some SEC commissioners (see Lee and Crenshaw 2020)[1] have expressed concerns that  because they lack an underwriter  DLs might expose investors to more risk than similar IPOs do. This is because underwriters engage in a number of services in both the pre- (due diligence  book building  hosting roadshows) and post-listing (lockup periods  price stabilization  i.e.  Greenshoe option) periods that aid price discovery and  thus  ensure an orderly listing process. Absent an underwriter performing these services  in a DL  investor uncertainty has to be resolved via the price discovery process in the immediate post-listing process. Hence  we might expect to see that DLs have higher price volatility than IPOs in the immediate post-listing period. While some regulators have mentioned this possibility  to date  there has been no empirical evidence that examines it.Because DLs have historically been quite rare in the U.S.  for this study we use a sample of 362 IPOs and 69 DLs on the EU-regulated markets of the three largest stock exchanges in Europe  i.e.  the London  Frankfurt  and Euronext stock exchanges  from 2008 to 2019. For our sample period  all three of these markets were subject to the same regulatory framework  i.e.  the EU’s Prospective Directive regime  which mandates minimum prospectus disclosures for all firms admitted to trading on EU-regulated markets and the enforcement of these disclosure requirements. We undertake a comparison of IPOs and DLs on these three markets and examine two research questions. First  whether there are differences in the types of firms that list via DLs and IPOs. Second  whether DLs are riskier  i.e.  have higher price volatility  than IPOs in the immediate post-listing period  and  if so  how long any such excess volatility lasts.The first significant finding is that  on average  DL firms are significantly larger  more profitable  and less leveraged than IPO firms – all of which suggest that  on average  DL firms are less risky than IPO firms. Our second significant finding is that  when we compare the post-listing price volatility of DLs with similar IPOs  consistent with some regulators’ suspicions  we find that DLs are riskier than IPOs in the immediate post-listing period: DLs have higher price volatility than similar IPOs in the immediate post-listing period. However  we find that this excess price volatility dissipates rather quickly: On average  it lasts for only 20 trading days. We also find that  in industries with a richer “industry information environment” – i.e.  where the existing listed firms in that industry already provide relatively high-quality public disclosures – there is no difference in post-listing price volatility across DLs and IPOs.Our study provides a number of new insights regarding DLs that may be of interest to managers of firms seeking a public listing  investors  and regulators such as the SEC. First  we provide the first empirical evidence confirming that the types of firms that list via DLs are larger and more mature than IPO firms  on average. Second  our analysis confirms the suspicion of some regulators that  because of the absence of an underwriter  DLs are riskier  i.e.  have higher price volatility  than similar IPOs in the immediate post-listing period. However  while our results confirm this suspicion (providing evidence that underwriters’ services in the pre-listing period do indeed serve to ensure an orderly listing process)  our results also show that this excess price volatility is quite short-lived  i.e.  it last for approximately 20 trading days  on average. Our analysis also identifies settings where DL firms are less likely to experience excess price volatility in the immediate post-listing period and point to strategies managers of DL firms can take to mitigate the potential for heightened post-listing price volatility.ENDNOTE[1] Lee  A.  and C.

In my new role as Executive Chairman  I will organize the board's work encompassing  among others  strategy  governance  risks’ oversight and corporate social & environmental responsibility. I'll ensure the executive team enjoys the same freedom to pursue innovative strategies as I have had. Furthermore  I will collaborate with Pascal on strategy  research  and developing our connections with governments and longstanding clients.Over the years  my professional journey has been motivated by a constant commitment to inspiring significant transformations in the industry. While it has driven progress in crucial sectors such as health  mobility and energy  it now needs to adopt a reimagined approach that balances innovation with responsibility towards nature and society.

Today  we see that the Experience Economy – that we introduced in 2012 – and the Sustainable Economy are converging. We are entering an era defined by the principles of the 'Generative Economy’  centered on understanding and mirroring the magic of life's transformative method. This approach implies a metamorphosis of both the industry and society – a new equilibrium that prioritizes 'generation' over mere 'consumption’.For decades  we have guided innovation from design to manufacturing.

This performance reflects an increasing focus on accelerating growth in our core industries and domains. This is evidenced in our numbers: Transportation & Mobility up 12%  13% in Aerospace & Defense  23% in Home & Lifestyle. From a product standpoint  design  simulation  manufacturing and data-science enjoyed double-digit growth throughout the year.In addition  2023 highlights the momentum in subscription revenue  with 22% growth in the fourth quarter and 16% on a full year basis. As a result  the share of recurring revenue rose to 80% of total software revenue for this year from 78% in 2022. The 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud adoption increased 19% and 12% respectively for the year  acting as a catalyst and driver of the successful evolution towards a sustainable subscription model.The operating leverage strongly improved year-over-year as expected  by 160 basis points in Q4  achieving an operating margin of 35.9%. This puts us back on track to deliver consistent profit and cash flow expansion. Importantly  we have achieved a net cash balance of €0.6 billion after successfully deleveraging for the acquisition of MEDIDATA within 3 years.Clearly  all these elements constitute the foundations of our 5-year plan. Looking towards 2024  we are targeting revenue growth of 8% to 10%. Our objective for diluted earnings per share is €1.29 to €1.31.”Financial Objectives for 2024Dassault Systèmes’ first quarter and 2024 financial objectives presented below are given on a non-IFRS basis and reflect the principal 2024 currency exchange rate assumptions for the US dollar and Japanese yen as well as the potential impact from additional non-Euro currencies:Q1 2024 FY 2024 Total Revenue (billion) €1.490 - €1.515 €6.350 - €6.425 Growth 4 - 6% 7 - 8% Growth ex FX 7 - 8% 8 - 10% Software revenue growth * 7 - 9% 8 - 10% Of which licenses and other software revenue growth * (3) - 2% (1) - 3% Of which recurring revenue growth * 9 - 10% 10 - 11% Services revenue growth * 4 - 5% 9 - 10% Operating Margin 30.6% - 30.7% 32.5% - 32.8% EPS Diluted €0.29 - €0.30 €1.29 - €1.31 Growth 5 – 7% 7 - 10% Growth ex FX 10 - 11% 10 - 12% US dollar $1.10 per Euro $1.10 per Euro Japanese yen (before hedging) JPY 155.0 per Euro JPY 155.0 per Euro * Growth in Constant CurrenciesThese objectives are prepared and communicated only on a non-IFRS basis and are subject to the cautionary statement set forth below.The 2024 non-IFRS financial objectives set forth above do not take into account the following accounting elements below and are estimated based upon the 2024 principal currency exchange rates above: no significant contract liabilities write-downs; share-based compensation expenses  including related social charges  estimated at approximately €167 million (these estimates do not include any new stock option or share grants issued after December 31  2023); amortization of acquired intangibles and of tangibles reevaluation  estimated at approximately €369 million  largely impacted by the acquisition of MEDIDATA; and lease incentives of acquired companies at approximately €2 million.The above objectives also do not include any impact from other operating income and expenses  net principally comprised of acquisition  integration and restructuring expenses  and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets; from one-time items included in financial revenue; from one-time tax effects; and from the income tax effects of these non-IFRS adjustments.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 17  2023  as updated in the 2023 Half-Year Financial Report (‘Rapport Financier Semestriel’ as of June 30  2023) filed with the AMF on July 25  2023  both available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Economic Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within the automotive  aerospace  energy or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Systèmes’ business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of inflation could adversely affect the financial position of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and political crises in particular – could have consequences both for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees and for the Company. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing and supply capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.”In preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.10 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY155.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the first quarter 2024. The Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.10 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY155.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the full year 2024. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group’s results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations.

The Group believes it is helpful to evaluate its growth exclusive of currency impacts  particularly to help understand revenue trends in its business. Therefore  the Group provides percentage increases or decreases in its revenue and expenses (in both IFRS as well as non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values  particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen  relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed “in constant currencies”  the results of the “prior” period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year  and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year.While constant currency calculations are not considered to be an IFRS measure  the Group believes these measures are critical to understanding its global revenue results and to compare with many of its competitors who report their financial results in U.S. dollars. Therefore  Dassault Systèmes includes this calculation for comparing IFRS revenue figures as well non-IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods. All information at constant exchange rates is expressed as a rounded percentage and therefore may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.Information on Growth excluding acquisitions (“organic growth”)In addition to financial indicators on the entire Group’s scope  Dassault Systèmes provides growth excluding acquisitions effect  also named organic growth. In order to do so  the data relating to the scope is restated excluding acquisitions  from the date of the transaction  over a period of 12 months.Information on Industrial SectorsDassault Systèmes’ Industries develop Industry Solution Experiences  offerings specifically designed to deliver value to companies and users in a particular industry.

I am impressed by Pascal's engagement to increase the value we bring to the giant customer base that we have. In my new role as Executive Chairman  I will organize the board's work encompassing  among others  strategy  governance  risks’ oversight and corporate social & environmental responsibility. I'll ensure the executive team enjoys the same freedom to pursue innovative strategies as I have had. Furthermore  I will collaborate with Pascal on strategy  research  and developing our connections with governments and longstanding clients.Over the years  my professional journey has been motivated by a constant commitment to inspiring significant transformations in the industry. While it has driven progress in crucial sectors such as health  mobility and energy  it now needs to adopt a reimagined approach that balances innovation with responsibility towards nature and society. We have been  and will always be a key player in this ‘Industry Renaissance’. Our legacy  combining science and industrial knowledge  is crucial for upcoming metamorphoses focused on sustainable innovation.The genius of Dassault Systèmes lies in its ability to translate a dream into reality and to drive science-guided imagination. There is more to be invented to advance our mission. We will continue to build on our legacy  aiming to provide businesses and people with 3DEXPERIENCE universes to imagine sustainable innovations capable of harmonizing product  nature and life.”Dassault Systèmes’ Chief Executive Officer Commentary(EPS on a non-IFRS basis  in constant currencies)Pascal Daloz  Dassault Systèmes’ Chief Executive Officer  commented:“As the new CEO  I am honored to lead our company  alongside a talented team  into a new chapter – an evolution  not a revolution. Today  we see that the Experience Economy – that we introduced in 2012 – and the Sustainable Economy are converging. We are entering an era defined by the principles of the 'Generative Economy’  centered on understanding and mirroring the magic of life's transformative method. This approach implies a metamorphosis of both the industry and society – a new equilibrium that prioritizes 'generation' over mere 'consumption’.For decades  we have guided innovation from design to manufacturing. Today  we extend this journey into an infinite loop by seamlessly connecting the virtual and the real with real-world data. This opens up new possibilities  such as 'giving life to things' and 'generating multiple lives of things'  promoting sustainability and a circular economy. Consequently  we will expand our value propositions and audiences – reaching all business users and ultimately consumers  patients and citizens.Successfully delivering our 2018-2023 plan  we doubled our diluted EPS to €1.20  an increase mostly attributed to organic growth. This performance was achieved in five years as initially planned  despite the pandemic and geopolitical instability. During this period  we strengthened our positions in key industries  acting as a game-changer and supporting their transformation  thus laying a solid foundation for future success.Now  we are embarking on a new five-year plan to double our EPS by 2028. Strategically positioned  we can leverage a vast market creating new opportunities. Our scientific approach  industrial know-how  modeling and simulation capabilities coupled with AI and data science  set us apart to play a critical role in the ‘Generative Economy’.”Financial SummaryIn millions of Euros except per share data and percentagesIFRS IFRS Q4 2023 Q4 2022 Change Change in constant currencies YTD 2023 YTD 2022 Change Change in constant currencies Total Revenue 1 643.4 1 583.9 4% 8% 5 951.4 5 665.3 5% 9% Software Revenue 1 476.1 1 428.6 3% 8% 5 360.0 5 114.0 5% 8% Operating Margin 23.2% 24.7% (1.5)pt 20.9% 23.0% (2.1)pts Diluted EPS 0.25 0.25 (0)% 0.79 0.70 12%In millions of Euros except per share data and percentagesNon-IFRS Non-IFRS Q4 2023 Q4 2022 Change Change in constant currencies YTD 2023 YTD 2022 Change Change in constant currencies Total Revenue 1 643.4 1 583.9 4% 8% 5 951.4 5 665.5 5% 9% Software Revenue 1 476.1 1 428.6 3% 8% 5 360.0 5 114.3 5% 8% Operating Margin 35.9% 34.9% +1.0pt 32.4% 33.4% (1.0)pt Diluted EPS 0.36 0.34 6% 14% 1.20 1.13 5% 12%Fourth Quarter 2023 Versus 2022 Financial Comparisons(unaudited  IFRS and non-IFRS unless otherwise noted all revenue growth rates in constant currencies)Total Revenue: Total revenue and software revenue grew 8% to €1.64 billion and €1.48 billion respectively.

This performance reflects an increasing focus on accelerating growth in our core industries and domains. This is evidenced in our numbers: Transportation & Mobility up 12%  13% in Aerospace & Defense  23% in Home & Lifestyle. From a product standpoint  design  simulation  manufacturing and data-science enjoyed double-digit growth throughout the year.In addition  2023 highlights the momentum in subscription revenue  with 22% growth in the fourth quarter and 16% on a full year basis. As a result  the share of recurring revenue rose to 80% of total software revenue for this year from 78% in 2022. The 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud adoption increased 19% and 12% respectively for the year  acting as a catalyst and driver of the successful evolution towards a sustainable subscription model.The operating leverage strongly improved year-over-year as expected  by 160 basis points in Q4  achieving an operating margin of 35.9%. This puts us back on track to deliver consistent profit and cash flow expansion. Importantly  we have achieved a net cash balance of €0.6 billion after successfully deleveraging for the acquisition of MEDIDATA within 3 years.Clearly  all these elements constitute the foundations of our 5-year plan.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 17  2023  as updated in the 2023 Half-Year Financial Report (‘Rapport Financier Semestriel’ as of June 30  2023) filed with the AMF on July 25  2023  both available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Economic Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within the automotive  aerospace  energy or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Systèmes’ business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of inflation could adversely affect the financial position of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and political crises in particular – could have consequences both for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees and for the Company. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing and supply capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.”In preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.10 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY155.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the first quarter 2024. The Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.10 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY155.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the full year 2024. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group’s results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations. It is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for IFRS measurements. The supplemental non-IFRS financial information should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. Furthermore  the Group’s supplemental non-IFRS financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled “non-IFRS” measures used by other companies. Specific limitations for individual non-IFRS measures are set forth in the Company’s 2023 Universal Registration Document filed with the AMF on March 17  2023.In the tables accompanying this press release the Group sets forth its supplemental non-IFRS figures for revenue  operating income  operating margin  net income and diluted earnings per share  which exclude the effect of adjusting the carrying value of acquired companies’ deferred revenue  share-based compensation expense and related social charges  the amortization of acquired intangible assets and of tangibles reevaluation  certain other operating income and expense  net  including impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles  the effect of adjusting lease incentives of acquired companies  certain one-time items included in financial revenue and other  net  and the income tax effect of the non-IFRS adjustments and certain one-time tax effects. The tables also set forth the most comparable IFRS financial measure and reconciliations of this information with non-IFRS information.FOR MORE INFORMATIONDassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE platform  3D design software  3D Digital Mock Up and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions: http://www.3ds.comABOUT DASSAULT SYSTÈMESDassault Systèmes  the 3DEXPERIENCE® Company  is a catalyst for human progress.

The Group believes it is helpful to evaluate its growth exclusive of currency impacts  particularly to help understand revenue trends in its business. Therefore  the Group provides percentage increases or decreases in its revenue and expenses (in both IFRS as well as non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values  particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen  relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed “in constant currencies”  the results of the “prior” period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year  and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year.While constant currency calculations are not considered to be an IFRS measure  the Group believes these measures are critical to understanding its global revenue results and to compare with many of its competitors who report their financial results in U.S. dollars. Therefore  Dassault Systèmes includes this calculation for comparing IFRS revenue figures as well non-IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods. All information at constant exchange rates is expressed as a rounded percentage and therefore may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.Information on Growth excluding acquisitions (“organic growth”)In addition to financial indicators on the entire Group’s scope  Dassault Systèmes provides growth excluding acquisitions effect  also named organic growth. In order to do so  the data relating to the scope is restated excluding acquisitions  from the date of the transaction  over a period of 12 months.Information on Industrial SectorsDassault Systèmes’ Industries develop Industry Solution Experiences  offerings specifically designed to deliver value to companies and users in a particular industry.

Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning  key strengths and strong IP to develop products along two tracks  separately and in combination. The first platform leverages immunomodulatory properties of arsenic trioxide (ATO) for an entirely new arsenal of formulations  including oral delivery (OATO)  for anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune indications such as chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). In parallel  BioSenic develops innovative products through a second platform that includes cell therapies and strong IP protection for tissue repair technologies.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic's technology platformsThe ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in autoimmunity to treat in its chronic  established stage. Chronic GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)  a curative treatment for patients with serious blood diseases  including cancers.BioSenic’s intravenous ATO formulation  Arscimed®  has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA  and it has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy for skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract in an early Phase 2a study. The company is planning a confirmatory international Phase 3 study with its oral ATO (OATO) formulation. OATO will also target moderate-to-severe forms of SLE. BioSenic is also developing a new IP-protected OATO formulation for the treatment of SSc  a serious chronic disease that affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models support the launch of a Phase 2 clinical trial.ALLOB is an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated  bone marrow-sourced mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point-of-use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair  and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated MSCs from healthy donors into bone-forming cells at the site of injury. BioSenic is studying the results of a Phase 2 trial to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB by determining the best timing for therapeutic intervention and seeking partners to continue the development of the promising underlying therapy strategies.The company is also exploring partnerships at all levels for its JTA-004 viscosupplement for a severe inflammatory subtype of osteoarthritis  following a positive post hoc analysis of Phase 3 data demonstrating safety and efficacy in support of this licensing.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsMichelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685michelle@ibcomms.agencyFrench Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ghislaine.gasparetto@seitosei-actifin.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.
