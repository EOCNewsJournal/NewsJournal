35714,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/591669-russia-frozen-assets-euroclear-profit/,Euroclear discloses profits from frozen Russian assets,The Belgium-based clearing house revealed earning income totaling nearly $5 billion from Russia’s frozen assets in 2023 Read Full Article at RT.com,Nearly $5 billion in interest was generated last year  Euroclear has disclosedMajor EU clearinghouse Euroclear has revealed that it accrued almost $5 billion in profit from frozen Russian assets last year.In its financial results for 2023 published on Thursday  the Belgium-based company reported that net interest earnings amounted to €5.5 billion ($5.9 billion)  of which €4.4 billion “relate to interests linked to Russian sanctions.”The company explained that the profits were driven by factors such as the prevailing interest rates and the amount of cash balances that Euroclear is required to invest.It’s estimated that the clearing house is holding €196.6 billion (nearly $220 billion) worth of Russian assets  the vast majority of which belong to the country’s central bank. In total  the EU has frozen €207 billion (just over $231 billion) of Russian assets and reserves since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict.EU leaders have repeatedly called for using the funds “to rebuild Ukraine” and agreed last year to develop a scheme to use the windfall profits generated by the funds. However  a number of officials  including ECB President Christine Lagarde  have warned that a windfall tax could undermine the euro and cause concern among those keeping reserves in the currency.Underscoring the persisting uncertainties over attempts to implement profit-siphoning schemes  Euroclear said that it “considers it necessary to separate the estimated sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company’s performance and resources.”Earlier this week  the Belgian presidency of the EU Council announced that the bloc’s member states had reached an agreement that would allow Brussels to transfer the income generated by Russia’s frozen central bank reserves to Kiev.“EU Ambassadors just agreed in principle on a proposal on the use of windfall profits related to immobilised assets to support Ukraine’s reconstruction ” the Belgian presidency said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).The Financial Times  meanwhile  reported that EU envoys had approved a plan to set aside the profits generated from the frozen assets with no dividends to be paid to shareholders until members of the bloc unanimously opt to set up a “financial contribution to the [EU] budget that shall be raised on these net profits to support Ukraine.”Moscow has repeatedly warned that any actions taken against its assets by the US or its allies would amount to “theft ” stressing that seizure of the funds or any similar move would violate international law and undermine reserve currencies  the global financial system  and the world economy.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.03,0.94,0.03,negative,0.03,0.28,0.69,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Euroclear', 'profits', 'ECB President Christine Lagarde', 'Major EU clearinghouse Euroclear', 'The Financial Times', 'global financial system', 'prevailing interest rates', 'underlying financial results', 'net interest earnings', 'central bank reserves', 'financial contribution', 'sanction-related earnings', 'EU leaders', 'EU Council', 'EU Ambassadors', 'EU envoys', 'net profits', 'Russian sanctions', 'cash balances', 'clearing house', 'vast majority', 'windfall tax', 'persisting uncertainties', 'profit-siphoning schemes', 'Belgian presidency', 'member states', 'similar move', 'international law', 'reserve currencies', 'business section', 'windfall profits', 'Russian assets', 'world economy', 'Belgium-based company', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Thursday', 'interests', 'factors', 'amount', 'country', 'total', 'beginning', 'funds', 'number', 'officials', 'concern', 'currency', 'attempts', 'performance', 'resources', 'bloc', 'agreement', 'Brussels', 'income', 'Kiev', 'principle', 'proposal', 'immobilised', 'reconstruction', 'post', 'Twitter', 'plan', 'dividends', 'shareholders', 'members', 'Moscow', 'actions', 'allies', 'seizure', 'stories', 'finance']",2024-02-02,2024-02-03,rt.com
35715,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/591704-ukraine-russia-damage-compensation/,Ukraine seeks $1 trn from Russia – Zelensky aide,Frozen Russian assets won’t be enough to cover the damage Ukraine sustained in the ongoing conflict  Oleg Ustenko says Read Full Article at RT.com,The sum should compensate damage sustained by the country  the Ukrainian president’s top economic adviser has saidRussia’s assets frozen by the West won’t be enough to cover the damage Ukraine has sustained due to Russia’s military operation  the Ukrainian president’s top economic adviser  Oleg Ustenko  said on Friday during a national telethon  as cited by RBK news outlet.“We are not talking about the figure of $300–350 billion of their gold and foreign exchange reserves. According to estimates made in Kiev  we are talking about $750 billion in direct losses. If we add indirect losses  this could raise the figure to $1 trillion ” Ustenko was cited as saying.In mid-2022  Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal already named the amount that would be required to restore Ukraine  estimating it at $750 billion and saying at the time that the key source for the funds should come from the “confiscated assets that belong to Russia and Russian oligarchs.”President Vladimir Zelensky later noted that the necessary reparations were estimated at $600–$800 billion. In late 2023  the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice ruled out the possibility of concluding a peace deal with Russia without receiving reparations for the damages sustained from the conflict.Kiev and its Western allies have long been mulling ways to use Russian assets blocked abroad to restore Ukraine. On January 30  EU member states reached an agreement allowing Brussels to transfer the income generated by Russia’s frozen central bank reserves to Kiev  but have so far stopped short of tapping the assets themselves.It’s estimated that Belgium’s Euroclear  the bloc’s central security depository  holds €196.6 billion (nearly $220 billion) worth of Russian assets  the vast majority of which belong to the country’s central bank. In its financial results for 2023 published on Thursday  Euroclear revealed that it accrued almost $5 billion in profit from frozen Russian assets last year. It is assumed that Euroclear’s profits will not be paid to the owners of the assets but will later be transferred to a special EU fund to support Ukraine.In total  the EU has frozen €207 billion (just over $231 billion) of Russian assets and reserves since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict.Moscow has repeatedly warned that any actions related to its assets by the US and its allies would amount to “theft ” stressing that seizure of the funds or any similar move would violate international law and lead to a tit-for-tat response from Russia. Several Western officials  including European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde  have also warned that tapping frozen Russian funds would undermine trust in Western currencies and the economic system.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.06,0.91,0.03,negative,0.02,0.26,0.71,True,English,"['Zelensky aide', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', '$1', 'European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde', 'Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal', 'central bank reserves', 'central security depository', 'President Vladimir Zelensky', 'RBK news outlet', 'top economic adviser', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'EU member states', 'special EU fund', 'Several Western officials', 'frozen Russian funds', 'Ukrainian president', 'Ukrainian Ministry', 'economic system', 'Western currencies', 'Russian oligarchs', 'military operation', 'national telethon', 'direct losses', 'key source', 'peace deal', 'vast majority', 'financial results', 'similar move', 'international law', 'tat response', 'business section', 'Western allies', 'Russian assets', 'confiscated assets', 'Oleg Ustenko', 'necessary reparations', 'Ukraine conflict', 'sum', 'damage', 'country', 'Friday', 'figure', 'gold', 'estimates', 'Kiev', 'mid-20', 'amount', 'time', 'late', 'Justice', 'possibility', 'ways', 'January', 'agreement', 'Brussels', 'income', 'Belgium', 'bloc', 'Thursday', 'Euroclear', 'profit', 'owners', 'total', 'beginning', 'Moscow', 'actions', 'seizure', 'tit', 'trust', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance', 'RT']",2024-02-02,2024-02-03,rt.com

Sales were adversely affected by i) the cyclical slowdown in demand resulting from metal distributors' conservative expectations due to the weakness of the LME aluminium price  which reached a low point during the year  prompting them to keep their inventories at minimum levels  and ii) the loss of market share due to the emergence of a competitor in the European continuous anodising market. However  Q4 sales showed a turning point  with sales virtually stable compared with the same period last year.Package Sales: decline against strong comparativesPackage Sales (€4.4M)  which include pre-anodised metal supplied directly to the end customer  were down -25.0% against a high basis of comparison in 2022  which was up +14.8%. They accounted for 20.1% of annual sales in 2023  compared with 22.2% the previous year. This trend is attributable to the slowdown in demand in Europe  particularly in the second half of the year  after two years of dynamic growth in 2021 and 2022 due to the delivery of major orders. In 2023  to further support the diversification of its sales  the Company stepped up its sales drive in Asia. The slowdown in the Chinese economy does not appear to have had a major impact on major infrastructure projects.OutlookCOIL is maintaining a cautious approach for the first half of the 2024 financial year. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain  and the persistent weakness in demand is likely to continue to weigh on the recovery in subcontracting volumes in the short term. Nevertheless  the flexibility of its industrial facilities will enable it to react quickly to an improvement in demand during the course of the year. In parallel  the Company is pursuing its diversification strategy by strengthening its geographical presence in mature and emerging markets through the development of its Package offers.The Company is confident in its longer-term development prospects  capitalising on its broad portfolio of premium  sustainable products with a smaller carbon footprint to boost its business potential.Indicative 2024 calendar30 April 2024 2023 annual results and annual financial report 5 June 2024 Annual General Meeting 30 July 2024 First half 2024 sales 31 October 2024 First half 2024 results and half-year financial reportPress releases are issued after close of trading.About COILCOIL is the world's leading anodiser in the building and industrial sectors and trades under the ALOXIDE brand name.Anodising is an electrochemical process (electrolysis) which develops a natural  protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium and can be coloured in a range of UV-proof finishes. It gives the metal excellent resistance to corrosion and/or reinforces its functional qualities. Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion. The metal remains totally and repeatedly recyclable through simple re-melting. Anodised aluminium is used in a wide variety of industries and applications: architecture  design  manufacturing  and the automotive sector.COIL deploys an industrial model that creates value by leveraging its unique know-how  its operational excellence  the quality of its investments and the expertise of its people. COIL has around 110 employees in Belgium and Germany and generated a turnover of €21 8 million in 2023.Listed on Euronext Growth Paris | Isin: BE0160342011 | Reuters: ALCOI.PA | Bloomberg: ALCOI: FPFor more information  please visit www.aloxide.comContactCOILTim Hutton | Chief Executive Officertim.hutton@coil.be | Tel. : +32 (0)11 88 01 88 CALYPTUSCyril Combecyril.combe@calyptus.net | Tel. : +33 (0)1 53 65 68 681 Anodising and metal includedAttachment,neutral,0.03,0.84,0.13,mixed,0.16,0.22,0.62,True,English,"['Challenging Economic Environment', 'Coil', '2023 Sales', 'natural, protective oxide layer', ""metal distributors' conservative expectations"", 'European continuous anodising market', 'premium, sustainable products', 'smaller carbon footprint', 'ALOXIDE brand name', 'new architectural projects', 'uncertain economic climate', 'difficult market backdrop', 'half-year financial report', 'Annual General Meeting', 'slow post-COVID recovery', 'LME aluminium price', 'longer-term development prospects', 'major infrastructure projects', 'CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT', 'difficult economic environment', 'annual financial report', 'low aluminium price', 'First half 2024 results', 'First half 2024 sales', '2023 annual results', 'projects business', 'low point', 'COVID market', 'market share', 'second half', 'Annual total', 'major distortion', 'major orders', 'macroeconomic environment', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'aluminium anodising', 'annual sales', 'strong comparatives', 'Package Sales1', 'Significant events', 'two years', 'end markets', 'continuing rise', 'geopolitical uncertainties', 'distribution chain', 'variable costs', 'industrial front', 'limited number', 'Landen site', 'high-yield line', 'minimum levels', 'turning point', 'same period', 'pre-anodised metal', 'end customer', 'high basis', 'Chinese economy', 'cautious approach', 'subcontracting volumes', 'short term', 'industrial facilities', 'geographical presence', 'emerging markets', 'Package offers', 'broad portfolio', 'business potential', 'Indicative 2024 calendar', 'leading anodiser', 'industrial sectors', 'electrochemical process', 'UV-proof finishes', 'excellent resistance', 'functional qualities', 'ecological properties', 'high rigidity', 'excellent strength', 'weight ratio', 'magnetic properties', 'exceptional resistance', 'simple r', '2023 financial year', '2024 financial year', 'major impact', 'Sales evolution', 'sales drive', 'World leader', 'global growth', 'dynamic growth', 'previous year', 'persistent weakness', 'diversification strategy', 'Tolling Sales', 'The Company', 'sharp slowdown', 'cyclical slowdown', 'Q4 sales', '2023 SALES', 'Brussels', '2 February', 'COIL', 'decline', 'demand', 'services', 'quarter', 'activity', '2022 Variation', 'Q3', 'destocking', 'falloff', 'Asia', 'production', 'lines', 'Belgium', 'Germany', 'inventories', 'loss', 'emergence', 'competitor', 'comparison', 'trend', 'delivery', 'Outlook', 'flexibility', 'improvement', 'course', 'parallel', 'mature', '30 April', 'June', 'close', 'trading', 'building', 'trades', 'electrolysis', 'surface', 'range', 'corrosion', '17.6', '17.5', '25.', '2021', '22.']",2024-02-02,2024-02-03,globenewswire.com

The start of patient enrollment is expected in Q3 2024.Sheldon Sloan  MD  M Bioethics  CMO of Abivax  says: “The IND clearance by the FDA allows Abivax to move forward with the development of obefazimod for the treatment of Crohn’s disease. The revised trial design incorporates FDA feedback  which we believe provides a more efficient pathway to a future NDA submission. We are excited to begin the obefazimod CD program  which has the potential to provide a meaningful benefit to patients in a therapeutic area with a high unmet medical need.”The obefazimod Phase 2b clinical trial in moderately to severely active CD is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial  evaluating three obefazimod doses. The trial design consists of a 12-week induction period and a subsequent 40-week maintenance period.The revised trial design takes into account FDA recommendations provided in the frame of an initial Phase 2a IND submission. These adjustments to the obefazimod CD clinical program are not expected to have an impact on the overall program budget and projected supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) submission timeline.The corporate presentation on abivax.com has been updated to reflect these changes.*****About AbivaxAbivax is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics that harness the body’s natural regulatory mechanisms to stabilize the immune response in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

On the industrial front  the Company has streamlined production on a limited number of lines at its Landen site in Belgium and on its high-yield line 6 in Germany.Tolling Sales: slowdown in an uncertain economic climateAgainst a difficult market backdrop  Tolling Sales (€17.4M) were down by 15.3% compared with 2022  and accounted for 79.9% of 2023 annual sales  compared with 77.8% the previous year. Sales were adversely affected by i) the cyclical slowdown in demand resulting from metal distributors' conservative expectations due to the weakness of the LME aluminium price  which reached a low point during the year  prompting them to keep their inventories at minimum levels  and ii) the loss of market share due to the emergence of a competitor in the European continuous anodising market. However  Q4 sales showed a turning point  with sales virtually stable compared with the same period last year.Package Sales: decline against strong comparativesPackage Sales (€4.4M)  which include pre-anodised metal supplied directly to the end customer  were down -25.0% against a high basis of comparison in 2022  which was up +14.8%. They accounted for 20.1% of annual sales in 2023  compared with 22.2% the previous year. This trend is attributable to the slowdown in demand in Europe  particularly in the second half of the year  after two years of dynamic growth in 2021 and 2022 due to the delivery of major orders. In 2023  to further support the diversification of its sales  the Company stepped up its sales drive in Asia. The slowdown in the Chinese economy does not appear to have had a major impact on major infrastructure projects.OutlookCOIL is maintaining a cautious approach for the first half of the 2024 financial year. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain  and the persistent weakness in demand is likely to continue to weigh on the recovery in subcontracting volumes in the short term. Nevertheless  the flexibility of its industrial facilities will enable it to react quickly to an improvement in demand during the course of the year. In parallel  the Company is pursuing its diversification strategy by strengthening its geographical presence in mature and emerging markets through the development of its Package offers.The Company is confident in its longer-term development prospects  capitalising on its broad portfolio of premium  sustainable products with a smaller carbon footprint to boost its business potential.Indicative 2024 calendar30 April 2024 2023 annual results and annual financial report 5 June 2024 Annual General Meeting 30 July 2024 First half 2024 sales 31 October 2024 First half 2024 results and half-year financial reportPress releases are issued after close of trading.About COILCOIL is the world's leading anodiser in the building and industrial sectors and trades under the ALOXIDE brand name.Anodising is an electrochemical process (electrolysis) which develops a natural  protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium and can be coloured in a range of UV-proof finishes. It gives the metal excellent resistance to corrosion and/or reinforces its functional qualities. Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion. The metal remains totally and repeatedly recyclable through simple re-melting. Anodised aluminium is used in a wide variety of industries and applications: architecture  design  manufacturing  and the automotive sector.COIL deploys an industrial model that creates value by leveraging its unique know-how  its operational excellence  the quality of its investments and the expertise of its people.

The start of patient enrollment is expected in Q3 2024.Sheldon Sloan  MD  M Bioethics  CMO of Abivax  says: “The IND clearance by the FDA allows Abivax to move forward with the development of obefazimod for the treatment of Crohn’s disease. The revised trial design incorporates FDA feedback  which we believe provides a more efficient pathway to a future NDA submission. We are excited to begin the obefazimod CD program  which has the potential to provide a meaningful benefit to patients in a therapeutic area with a high unmet medical need.”The obefazimod Phase 2b clinical trial in moderately to severely active CD is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial  evaluating three obefazimod doses. The trial design consists of a 12-week induction period and a subsequent 40-week maintenance period.The revised trial design takes into account FDA recommendations provided in the frame of an initial Phase 2a IND submission. These adjustments to the obefazimod CD clinical program are not expected to have an impact on the overall program budget and projected supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) submission timeline.The corporate presentation on abivax.com has been updated to reflect these changes.*****About AbivaxAbivax is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics that harness the body’s natural regulatory mechanisms to stabilize the immune response in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

With effect from 22 March 2018  the Numis Smaller Companies plus AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index replaced the Numis Smaller Companies excluding AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index as the Company’s Benchmark Index. From 1 December 2013 to 21 March 2018  the Company’s Benchmark Index was the Numis Smaller Companies excluding AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index. Prior to 1 December 2013  the Company’s Benchmark Index was the Numis Smaller Companies plus AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index. The performance of the Benchmark Indices during these periods has been blended to reflect these changes.3 Alternative Performance Measures  see Glossary contained within the Annual Report and Accounts.4 Further details are given in the Glossary contained within the Annual Report and Accounts.Chairman’s statementFinancial year’s highlights· NAV outperformed the Benchmark Index over one year by 3.7 percentage points· Performance remains strong over the longer term; our NAV has outperformed the Benchmark Index by 17% over five years (share price by 29.0%) and by 72.5% over 10 years (share price by 95.8%)· NAV underperformed the Benchmark Index over three years by 4.3%  and outperformed over five years by 17% and over 10 years by 72.5%· Share price narrowed to a 3.6% discount to NAV at the year end and traded at an average discount of 5.2% to NAV during the financial year· Final dividend declared of 11.45p per share (2022: 8.50p)(All returns are in Sterling terms with dividends reinvested).OVERVIEWI am pleased to report that the Company outperformed our benchmark index by 3.7% during the twelve months to 30 November 2023. Although it is disappointing that in absolute terms our Net Asset Value fell by 2.3% for the year under review  over the longer term  performance remains strong  with the Company’s NAV return outperforming the benchmark index by 17.0% over five years and by 72.4% over ten years. At the share price level  the outperformance was 29.0% and 95.8% over the same periods.As you will read in the Investment Manager’s report which follows  our portfolio manager  Dan Whitestone  highlights that UK Smaller Company valuations are very low  both versus their own history and other asset classes. 2023 has once again been difficult to navigate  with significant market volatility and a widening gap between the fortunes of smaller and larger companies. However  given a macroeconomic backdrop of falling inflation  rising consumer confidence  and strong wage growth  these factors may well serve as a potential catalyst for a re-rating of the sector. Therefore  the outlook for our asset class may be brighter than many recognise.Trading and earnings across our portfolio remain robust and the level of revenue produced by our portfolio has increased by 27.9% This has enabled the Board to increase our total dividends for the year by an impressive 32.9% year-on-year.MARKET OVERVIEWIn my Half-Yearly statement in July  I described how the first six months of our financial year were dominated by powerful geopolitical and macroeconomic drivers. Markets were focused on the path of inflation and interest rates  seemingly above all else and this theme continued through the second half of the financial year to 30 November 2023.The rate of UK inflation  as measured by the Consumer Price Index  steadily reduced during the year  down from 10.7% at the start of our financial year to 3.9% as at 30 November 2023. This brought some welcome relief to UK consumers and corporates alike. The path of inflation had been driven by high energy and food prices and although these fell during the year  they remain far higher than in recent years. Ongoing structural issues in the UK labour market also kept wage demands high  somewhat offsetting the easing rate of food inflation and lower energy prices.The Bank of England (BOE) continued its policy of monetary tightening throughout most of the year with the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voting to hold the base rate at 5.25% in September 2023. This is the highest level since February 2008 and ended a run of fourteen consecutive rate increases since December 2021. It was well-received by the equity markets. In the US  the Central Bank held the base rate of interest steady at 5.25% signalling interest rate cuts were likely in 2024. This saw almost all asset classes rise significantly in a year-end rally in response. In contrast the BOE was more hawkish  flagging that UK wage growth remained elevated and that the MPC will continue to consider the economic data before a rate cut was contemplated. This supports a ‘higher for longer’ narrative and more recently  UK data has been mixed with wage growth softening but with inflation above expectations in December at 4.0%  potentially pushing back expectations of an interest rate cut in early 2024.Another feature of the year under review was the elevated geo-political risk  with the focus switching from the conflict in Ukraine to rising tensions in the Middle East. There is increasing concern around the inflationary impact of disruption to major shipping routes in the Red Sea and an escalation into a wider conflict in the region. Looking forward  there are also several significant elections in 2024  notably in the UK  US and Europe  with a range of outcomes  all of which could impact market volatility and sentiment.For a second year running the UK equity market continues to look cheap on a range of valuation metrics and this gives our portfolio manager cause for genuine optimism for UK smaller companies. He notes that the trading environment is more benign  with falling inflation  strong employment data and wage growth out-pacing inflation for the first time in many years. Importantly  sales growth and earnings remain robust for many of the companies within our portfolio  and the revenue generated by our portfolio this year rose by an impressive 27.9%. This has enabled the Board to increase the total dividend paid by the Company by 32.9% versus the prior financial year. In addition  the UK economy has displayed notable resilience  with household balance sheets and corporate earnings in better shape than many anticipated. In 2023 the UK avoided a much-feared economic recession and is forecasting modest growth in 2024. A ‘soft landing’ – a slowdown in economic growth that avoids a recession – may still be possible  although UK GDP growth was 0.3% in November 2023. In any case  the current cycle of monetary policy tightening appears to have peaked  and markets are focusing on if and when interest rates will be cut; an event that may be the catalyst for a broader change in market sentiment towards UK Smaller Companies and  in particular  the high-quality growth companies in which we invest.PERFORMANCEOver the twelve months to 30 November 2023  the Company’s NAV returned -2.3%  compared with a total return of -6.0% from the Company’s Benchmark Index  the Numis Smaller Companies plus AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index  an outperformance of 3.7 percentage points. At the share price level  the return was -0.8% as the Company’s share rating narrowed from a discount of 5.0% at the start of the financial year to a discount of 3.6% at the year end.The longer-term performance remains strong. The Company’s NAV return underperformed the Benchmark Index by 4.3% over three years  outperformed by 17.0% over five years and by 72.4% over ten years. The share price underperformed the Benchmark Index by 7.7% over three years  outperformed by 29.0% over five years and by 95.8% over ten years. (All percentages calculated in Sterling terms with dividends reinvested.)As at close of business on 31 January 2024  the Company’s NAV had increased by 8.8%  compared to the Benchmark Index which increased by 5.4%. The share price over the same period increased by 6.0%. Further information on portfolio performance  positioning and the outlook for the forthcoming year can be found in the Investment Manager’s report below.The Board and our Manager remain focused on achieving the Company’s objectives of providing shareholders with long-term capital growth and an attractive total return and remain confident in the investment approach and process. We thank shareholders for your loyalty and support.PERFORMANCE FEEFollowing an outperformance versus the benchmark during the financial year  a performance fee accrual of £2 014 000 has been accrued. Our performance fee is calculated over a two-year rolling period and therefore no fee is payable to the Manager for the current financial year. Further information on management fees can be found in Note 4 to the financial statements below.POLICY ON SHARE PRICE DISCOUNT/PREMIUMWe recognise that a widening of  and volatility in  the Company’s discount is viewed by some investors as a key disadvantage of investment trusts. The Board believes that the best way of addressing any discount volatility over the longer term is to generate good performance and to create demand for the Company’s shares in the secondary market through broadening awareness of the Company’s unique structure  strong investment team and robust investment process  and our long-term investment track record in an attractive sector that is difficult to navigate.The Board considers several factors in determining whether the premium/discount to NAV (the share rating) at which the Company’s shares trade is excessive or otherwise. These may include but are not limited to: whether the share rating is commensurate with the current demand for UK Smaller Companies and whether the Company’s shares are trading in normal market conditions; the ongoing attractiveness of the investment proposition  in particular the strength of the portfolio management team and process; and the strong long-term performance delivered for shareholders  both in absolute and relative terms.SHARE BUY BACK ACTIVITYDuring the year to 30 November 2023 the Company’s share rating ranged between a discount of 1.0% to 9.2% and ended the year at 3.6% (30 November 2022: discount of 5.0%). The 12-month average discount at 30 November 2023 was 5.2% (2022: average discount: 3.5%). During the financial year the Company bought back a total of 5 286 703 ordinary shares into treasury (2022: 2 015 000) for a total consideration of £29 807 000 (2022: £11 544 000). All shares were bought back at a discount to the prevailing NAV  were therefore accretive to existing shareholders  and were placed into treasury for future re-issue. The advantage of holding shares in treasury over cancelling them is that they remain listed. This means that where there is an opportunity to re-issue these shares  the Company does not have to pay additional fees for admission to trading as would be required with an issue of new shares. It is the Board’s policy that it will generally only take shares into treasury where it believes there is a reasonable likelihood of re-issue in the future.Since 30 November 2023 and up to the latest practicable date of 31 January 2024  a further 580 669 shares have been bought back for a total consideration of £3.519.000. As at this date  the Company’s shares were trading at a discount of 6.1%. No ordinary shares were issued during the period.The Board believes that the share buy back activity undertaken has been effective and has been in shareholders’ interests. Despite what has been a challenging and volatile year  it is pleasing that the Company’s share rating has been relatively stable and has traded within a fairly tight range for most of the year  and at a consistently tighter discount relative to the peer group average. As we navigate these more volatile and uncertain markets  your Board will continue to monitor the Company’s share rating and may deploy its powers to issue or buy back the Company’s shares where it believes that it is in shareholders’ long-term best interests to do so.As it does each year  the Board will once again seek at the Company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) to renew the authorities granted by shareholders to issue or buy back shares. We encourage shareholders to vote in favour of these resolutions which are described in more detail in the Director’s Report contained within the Annual Report and Accounts.REVENUE RETURN AND DIVIDENDSThe revenue return per share for the year amounted to 16.56 pence per share  compared with 12.95 pence per share for the previous year  an increase of 27.9%. The Board recognises that  although the Company’s objective is capital growth  shareholders value the dividends paid by the Company. The Directors are therefore pleased to declare a proposed final dividend of 11.45 pence per share for the year ended 30 November 2023 (2022: 8.50p). This  together with the interim dividend of 3.30 pence per share paid on 1 September 2023  gives a total dividend for the year of 14.75 pence per share  increasing the total dividend distributed to shareholders in the prior financial year by 32.9%. This dividend will be paid on 28 March 2024  subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM  to shareholders on the Company’s register on 23 February 2024.BOARD COMPOSITION AND DIVERSITYThe Board regularly considers its composition and that of its committees and has an ongoing succession plan in place designed to ensure that it retains an appropriate balance of skills  knowledge  experience  independence  and diversity that meets or exceeds relevant best practice and the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code  including guidance on tenure and the composition of the Board’s committees.We are cognisant of the benefits of a diverse range of skills on the Board and the Company is compliant with the Parker Review recommendation that FTSE 350 companies have at least one director from an ethnically diverse background by 2024. The Board is also compliant with the recommendations of the FTSE Women Leaders Review. The review set targets for FTSE 350 companies which are designed to achieve boards with 40% female representation (previously 33%) and at least one woman in the role of Chair or Senior Independent Director on the board by the end of 2025. We have also disclosed data on the breakdown of the Board by gender and ethnicity. The disclosure can be found within the Annual Report and Accounts.The Board is cognisant of the concept of “overboarding” and considers the time commitment required by the Directors’ other roles  taking into account their nature and complexity. The Board reviews this information annually  for each Director  including my own as Chairman of the Board  to ensure that all Directors have sufficient capacity to carry out their role effectively. Before recommending a Director for re-election  their independence  attendance record and ongoing commitment to the affairs of the Company is also considered. Further information on the Board’s assessment of Directors independence and other time commitments can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement contained within the Annual Report and Accounts.BOARD PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONAs a constituent of the FTSE 350  and as recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code  the Company undertook a comprehensive  externally facilitated  Board performance evaluation this financial year. The evaluation was carried out by a wholly independent third party  Stogdale St James Limited and included one-to-one interviews with the Board  representatives of the Manager and service providers  the completion of evaluation questionnaires and the observation of the Board and its interactions by the evaluator. A separate evaluation of my performance as Chairman was also undertaken by the independent evaluator  the results of which were considered by our Senior Independent Director and circulated to the Board. This process resulted in a small number of findings and recommendations that the Board will adopt  notwithstanding that the overall conclusion was very positive in terms of the effectiveness of the Board  its composition  and the skills  expertise and commitment of the Directors. We believe that the combination of our ongoing succession plan and structured search and selection process through which the Board identifies new appointments  coupled with the annual Board evaluation of their ongoing performance  allows the Board to confidently assert that its composition is appropriate for a Company of this size and complexity and that each Director is effectively discharging their role. Further information on the evaluation of the performance of the Board can be found within the Annual Report and Accounts.Further details of the background and experience the Board of Directors can be found in their biographies contained within the Annual Report and Accounts. The Board’s policy on Board diversity and associated disclosures can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement within the Annual Report and Accounts.OUR APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL  SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) INTEGRATIONConsideration of material ESG issues is built into our Manager’s investment process and climate risk is considered to be a key part of investment risk  an approach your Board supports. The style of our Investment Manager naturally steers away from companies with weak balance sheets and poor cash flow which is a common characteristic of the few resource stocks in the Benchmark Index. It should be noted that the Company does not have an explicit mandate for sustainable  ESG or impact-focused investment  nor has it adopted exclusionary screens. The Investment Manager’s integration of ESG factors into his analysis is  though  an important lens through which to identify long term winners  just as poor ESG outcomes provide a useful tool in establishing candidates for the short book.Further information on the Manager's approach to responsible investing can be found within the Annual Report and Accounts.ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGThe Board is pleased to announce that the Company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be held in person on Tuesday  19 March 2024 at 12.00 p.m. at the offices of BlackRock at 12 Throgmorton Avenue  London  EC2N 2DL.

Further information on the business of this year's AGM can be found in the Notice of the AGM contained within the Annual Report and Accounts.SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATION AND ENGAGEMENTWe appreciate how important access to regular information is to our shareholders. To supplement our Company website  we offer shareholders the ability to sign up to the Trust Matters newsletter which includes information on the Company as well as news  views and insights on the investment trust market. Information on how to sign up is included on the inside front cover of the Annual Report and Accounts.Following positive feedback and greater attendance and participation at the Company’s AGM last year  I have once again sought to engage with shareholders who hold their shares through an intermediary or platform via the provisions of Section 793 of the Companies Act 2006. The Board encourages all shareholders to either attend the AGM or exercise your right to vote by proxy.The Board is aware that certain execution only investment platforms are now providing shareholders with the ability to vote electronically. The Board encourages shareholders to take advantage of this functionality where it is available to you.The Board takes its responsibilities very seriously and is committed to exercising the highest standard of corporate governance. It also regularly considers the views of its major shareholders  offering to meet with them annually  and seeks to engage with all shareholders where possible. Should you wish to contact me  you can do so via our Company Secretary whose details are set out within the Annual Report and Accounts.OUTLOOKAs you will read in his report which follows  our portfolio manager is optimistic about the future. He highlights what he believes is a significant mis-pricing of UK Small Cap companies  evidenced by the disconnect between the growth in corporate sales and earnings and the valuations ascribed by the market. UK smaller companies are currently trading at valuations which look very cheap versus other asset classes  and compared with their historical averages. In addition  our portfolio highlights in his report the differential between the performance of UK small-cap and large cap equities  the widest since the Global Financial Crisis. With a gradually improving macroeconomic backdrop and several potential catalysts for a re-rating of the sector  not least a cut in interest rates  he believes the opportunity set presented by our asset class is highly compelling for the medium-term investor.Our Investment Manager’s fundamental philosophy remains unchanged  with a continued focus on financially strong companies with innovative business models and differentiated offerings which are capable of delivering sustained growth over time. This approach has served the Company well over many years and the Board remains fully supportive of our Investment Manager and his approach.CHRISTOPHER SAMUELChairman2 February 2024INVESTMENT MANAGER’S REPORT FOR YEAR ENDED 30 NOVEMBER 2023MARKET REVIEW AND OVERALL INVESTMENT PERFORMANCEInterest rate policy and inflation remained top of minds during the second half of the financial year  with markets heavily influenced on a month-by-month basis by the latest inflation figures and rhetoric from central banks around the world. Thankfully  inflation has been coming down throughout the year  and most recently we have seen a stark change in narrative from higher for longer to peak rates and imminent central bank pivot. This has not been a consistent narrative throughoutthe past six months  with spikes in volatility caused by concerns for the growth outlook for China  mixed economic data fuelling the “higher for longer” narrative  fears of the ‘inevitable’ hard recession  geopolitical conflict  and mixed earnings  to name a few. And whilst the most recent change in sentiment has provided a supportive backdrop for the Company  it does continue the trend of heightened volatility within markets.PERFORMANCE REVIEWFor the second half of 2023  the Company’s NAV outperformed the benchmark by +1.3%  falling by 2.4% in absolute terms versus our benchmark which fell by 3.7%. In terms of the underlying portfolio performance  the long book  before fees  lost 2.9% whilst the short book had a strong period generating 0.9% for the six months ended 30 November 2023 (for the full year  before fees  the long portfolio contributed -2.0% and the short portfolio contributed +0.4% respectively to NAV returns).This takes the Company’s total return for the financial year of 2023 to -2.3%  and although disappointing to report a loss it should be noted that the Company outperformed its benchmark by +3.7% over this same period  indeed outperforming in both the first half and the second half of our financial year.For the purposes of this performance review we think it more instructive to comment specifically on the second half to avoid repeating the detailed write up of the first half presented in our interim financial statements. More detail in respect of performance attribution is set out in the table in the glossary contained within the Annual Report and Accounts.The second consecutive year of losses for our benchmark reflects the significant negative sentiment that clouds UK and small and medium sized companies in particular. This is reflected in the fund flow data which shows November 2023 marked the 28th consecutive month of outflows in UK small and mid-caps. It is my view that this pervasive selling pressure has resulted in a significant mispricing within UK small and mid-caps  evidenced by the low price-to-earnings ratio for the small and mid-cap universe (FTSE 250 10.5x and FTSE Small Cap 8.3x) but also the extent of relative underperformance versus the FTSE 100. To put this into context  the FTSE 250 has underperformed the FTSE 100 in 17 of the last 24 months  and now is the largest and longest period of relative underperformance on record  far exceeding the Great Financial Crisis.However  despite the bearish views  persistently high inflation  a recession  and a collapse in corporate profitability  the second half of 2023 has given cause for more optimism reflecting falling inflation  strong employment and increasing consumer confidence. The underlying fundamentals (i.e. sales growth  margins  balance sheet strength  free cash generation) of many of the Company’s holdings remain robust and company updates on the whole have been supportive. Of course  in any given year there will be disappointments  and this year is no exception  but in aggregate  I think the earnings of the Company’s holdings and the broader small and mid-cap investment universe have proved far more resilient than many predicted.Focusing on the biggest contributors and detractors for the second half  the largest contributor was Ergomed which announced a recommended cash offer from the Private Equity firm Permira at a 28% premium to the previous day’s closing price. Whilst helpful to this period's performance we are incredibly disappointed to lose another of our genuinely differentiated and exciting UK mid-cap growth companies which we have had the privilege of owning for many years. We congratulate Miro Reljanovic (Founder and CEO) for all he has delivered and wish him the best. However  in our view Ergomed is a great example of the inherent value within the broader UK mid-cap complex (and our long book!)  where many predominantly international earners  with strong balance sheets continue to grow  yet trade on significant valuation discounts to their US listed peers.The second biggest contributor was our short position in a UK listed software company. After a meteoric rise  fuelled by news flow about very large contract wins  the shares were suspended earlier this year upon the detection of a fraud. After an independent investigation  it transpired most of those contract wins did not exist and 90% of bookings were fake. Revenues  rather than growing  were actually falling. After coming within days of running out of cash  the company completed a restructuring and rescue fund raising in July. We closed out our short in the placing 96% below the suspension price.The third biggest contributor was from our long position in Computacenter which has continued to trade well  reporting a 24% year-over-year increase in organic gross invoice income at their interims  reflecting strong end market dynamics (digital transformation  cyber security etc) and continued market share gains. Other notable contributors include Tatton AssetManagement  Games Workshop  Baltic Classified Group  and Hill & Smith  all of which delivered successive positive updatesthroughout the period and ended with earnings higher than predicted at the start of the year.Turning to the detractors  the biggest was from our long position in CVS Group  which fell sharply on the news that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) are launching an inquiry into how “veterinary services are bought and sold amid concerns that pet owners may not be getting a good deal or receiving the information needed to make good choices”. Whilst we have spoken to management at length and also have experience of CMA inquiries into other industries  due to the sensitivity of this we feel it imprudent to comment now. We still own this stock  which at the time of writing  accounts for around 2.5% of NAV.The second largest detractor was WH Smith which despite reporting continued solid trading throughout the period  fell back either due to the lack of an upgrade to full-year guidance or just general aversion to UK mid-cap growth companies. WH Smith remains a top 10 holding at the time of writing. The third largest detractor was SigmaRoc which also continued to deliver solid trading results throughout the period  reporting like-for-like revenue growth of 13% and a double-digit profit increase  yet the shares languished on 7x current year's earnings.PORTFOLIO POSITIONING AND OUTLOOK2023 saw a continuation of many themes of uncertainty carried forward from 2022  and the market continued to grapple with the interplay between inflation  monetary and fiscal policy and corporate earnings. The overall positioning of the Company reflects our outlook which has not changed significantly over the last six months. As discussed in our interim report  my view remains that interest rates had peaked and inflation would fall markedly. As the year-on-year impact on inflation rolled over  the impending fall in utility bills would offer some meaningful shelter to those still to re-mortgage to a new higher priced fixed deal. Over a third of homeowners mortgage free  and a large percentage of the mortgage book having re-mortgaged earlier in 2023  there are many who will benefit from strong employment  falling utility costs and higher interest on cash. Indeed  many banks have upgraded their household cash flow forecasts through 2023 as a consequence and consumer confidence continues to remain robust. Generally speaking  financial conditions are not too stretched; corporates and consumers are reasonably well capitalised  and banks have plenty of capital. As such  the path of employment will dictate the consumer outlook  but we continue to expect the trough to be shallower than in previous downturns.For UK domestic focused PLCs  2024 will likely see growing dispersion in financial returns as those with strong market share stories (digital  trading down  new product verticals  etc) will outperform and grow despite a more challenging backdrop. Input costs have now reversed for many and so the attention will focus on top line and in particular underlying volume growth as price will become a far less significant lever to flex. The converging valuations of many UK consumer shares has been a source of immense frustration for us  with well-capitalised market share winners  with high gross margins trading on similar price to earnings ratios and free cash flow yields to their far inferior peer group. We hope 2024 will mark the year of more dispersion in valuations between winners and losers which should benefit this Company well.Housebuilding and RMI (Repair  Maintenance and Improvement) has had a tough 2023  but I continue to believe the outlook is far better than it was in September 2022  despite valuations in a similar place. In recent weeks I have added to housebuilders as well as RMI related plays  as in my view valuations are close to trough on earnings that are also close to trough so the recovery potential in both earnings and multiple is substantial. With positioning so extreme  we have seen only in recent days and weeks what implications that can have on these types of shares as falling borrowing costs  a steadying housing market and strong employment have forced a reappraisal.We retain a significant exposure to industrials and our approach remains selective. Though industrial activity moderated in 2023  there have been many cross currents and dispersion between companies and sub-sectors and geographies. Destocking has been a big theme in the sector  with supply chain issues initially leading to overordering  and then in turn overstocking (as supply chain issues resolved); this then led many businesses to destock  cutting orders and resulting in a slowdown in revenues. The stop-start nature of these supply chain issues throughout the year has impacted a range of geographies and sub-sectors differently  as they are all at different points in the cycle. We got some of these dynamics right and some wrong in 2023.Within General Industrial we noticed that quite a few of our companies flagged a recent pick up in their book-to-bill ratios in November and December 2023. Perhaps there is some genuine emerging evidence that several have turned a corner and growth can accelerate through 2024. Reshoring in the US  as well as several Government programmes (Chips  IRA) continues to provide additional tailwinds of growth for quite a few US focused  but UK listed  small and mid-caps we have exposure to e.g. Hill & Smith.There is much that can be debated about the economic outlook  but we think the valuation of UK small and mid-cap companies is compelling. It is therefore with some sadness  that the great de-equitization of UK public sector continues. Non-market participants are seemingly taking a very different view on the value of company equity and thereby their associated cash flows  and this is evidenced by i) corporate share buy-backs (the majority of our investments are buying back their equity)  ii) Corporate M&A (e.g. Deutsche's cash-bid for Numis)  and iii) Private Equity (e.g. Permira’s acquisition of Ergomed  and EQT's acquisition of Dechra Pharmaceuticals). These were 3 holdings of the Company we were very sorry to see depart  and in the case of Ergomed and Dechra are the loss of holdings this Company has owned for many years. Alas  we expect this is a trend that will continue; private equity continues to sit on near record levels of cash (we estimate circa US$438 billion in Europe) which they are keen to deploy. A challenge for us will be to ensure we don’t let the significant disconnect in valuations away from strong fundamentals and future cash flow growth enable others to realise the inherent value available in our home market  denying us of compelling future returns just for a cash bid today. My hope is that this focuses the market on the opportunities in front of us and catalyses a re-rating.Looking ahead to 2024  market volatility is unlikely to abate  and 2024 will mark a significant year for Elections worldwide which may well inject further turbulence into the macro backdrop. However  there are reasons for optimism. We enter 2024 with inflation and mortgage rates falling  whilst productivity and factory construction and corporate profits are rising. Labour markets are showing signs of softness but remain robust  and with low levels of unemployment many are experiencing the benefits of real wage growth for the first time in years  which should in time lead to higher services PMIs. Inventory balances are low after a prolonged period of destocking and so our hope is that manufacturing PMIs turn upwards which will boost the outlook for growth. As for inflation  we believe pressure will ease this year with deflationary pressures gaining traction during the course of 2024. Oil and gas prices are low (at the time of writing) amidst concerns of oversupply which will continue to alleviate pressure on corporate input costs and consumer wallets. In the US  the indications over recent weeks are that the Fed is likely to hold rates (with a bias to cut). As we’ve seen in the last couple of months  we think this has the potential to catalyse a broadening out of market leadership away from some very narrow areas of outperformance  both in the US and the UK  which overall should be a net positive for our positioning. In summary  the picture we see is one of a gradual recovery  and in our view this is not reflected in valuations of UK small and medium sized companies which we think offer compelling value in both absolute and relative terms. Indeed  the Company now possesses many companies on single digit price to earnings ratios  with double digit Free Cash Flow yields  but unlike so many archetypical “value” sectors  have far superior growth prospects. As a result  the net market exposure of the Company is slowly increasing and is now around 106%  while the gross is c.114%.DAN WHITESTONEBlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited2 February 2024PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS1 ▲ Breedon (2022: 12th)Construction & MaterialsMarket value: £18 919 000Share of net assets: 3.3% (2022: 2.4%)Supplier of construction materials2 ▲ Gamma Communications* (2022: 7th)Mobile TelecommunicationsMarket value: £17 506 000Share of net assets: 3.0% (2022: 2.8%)Provider of communication services to UK businesses3 ▼ Oxford Instruments (2022: 2nd)Electronic & Electrical EquipmentMarket value: £15 989 000Share of net assets: 2.8% (2022: 3.1%)Designer and manufacturer of tools and systems for industry and research4 ▲ Grafton Group (2022: 13th)Support ServicesMarket value: £15 915 000Share of net assets: 2.8% (2022: 2.1%)Builders’ merchants in the UK  Ireland and Netherlands5 ▲ YouGov* (2022: 11th)MediaMarket value: £15 642 000Share of net assets: 2.7% (2022: 2.4%)Provider of survey data and specialist data analytics6 ▼ 4imprint Group (2022: 3rd)MediaMarket value: £15 344 000Share of net assets: 2.7% (2022: 3.1%)Supplier of promotional merchandise in the US7 ▲ Rotork (2022: 23rd)Electronic & Electrical EquipmentMarket value: £14 498 000Share of net assets: 2.5% (2022: 1.6%)Manufacturer of industrial flow equipment8 ▲ WH Smith (2022: 9th)General RetailersMarket value: £14 285 000Share of net assets: 2.5% (2022: 2.6%)Retailer of books  stationery  magazines  newspapers and confectionary9 ▲ Computacenter (2022: 16th)Software & Computer ServicesMarket value: £13 978 0001Share of net assets: 2.4% (2022: 2.0%)Computer services10 ▼ CVS Group* (2022: 5th)General RetailersMarket value: £13 924 000Share of net assets: 2.4% (2022: 2.9%)Operator of veterinary surgeries* Traded on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange.1 Includes long derivative positions.Percentages shown are the share of net assets.The market value shown is the gross exposure to the shares through equity investments and long derivative positions.

Gross and Net Gearing are Alternative Performance Measures  see Glossary contained within the Annual Report and Accounts.1 Fair value is determined as follows:– Long equity investment positions are valued at bid prices where available  otherwise at latest market traded quoted prices.– The exposure to securities held through long derivative positions directly in the market would have amounted to £85 241 000 at the time of purchase  and subsequent movement in market prices have resulted in unrealised losses on the long derivative positions of £(1 120 000) resulting in the value of the total long derivative market exposure to the underlying securities decreasing to £84 121 000 as at 30 November 2023. If the long positions had been closed on 30 November 2023  this would have resulted in a loss of £(1 120 000) for the Company.– The notional exposure of selling the securities gained via the short derivative positions would have been £(22 454 000) at the time of entering into the contract  and subsequent movement in market prices have resulted in unrealised gains on the short derivative positions of £368 000 resulting in the value of the total short derivative market exposure of these investments increasing to £(22 086 000) at 30 November 2023. If the short positions had been closed on 30 November 2023  this would have resulted in a gain of £368 000 for the Company.2 Gross market exposure for equity investments is the same as fair value; bid prices are used where available and  if unavailable  latest market traded quoted prices are used. For both long and short derivative positions  the gross market exposure is the market value of the underlying shares to which the portfolio is exposed via the contract.3 The gross market exposure column for cash and cash equivalents has been adjusted to assume the Company traded direct holdings  rather than exposure being gained through long and short derivative positions.DISTRIBUTION OF INVESTMENTS AS AT 30 NOVEMBER 2023Sector % oflong portfolio % ofshort portfolio % ofnet portfolio Oil  Gas & Coal 1.6 0.0 1.6 Oil Equipment and Services 0.8 0.0 0.8 --------------- --------------- --------------- Oil & Gas 2.4 0.0 2.4 ========= ========= ========= Chemicals 0.7 0.0 0.7 Industrial Metals & Mining 2.0 0.0 2.0 --------------- --------------- --------------- Basic Materials 2.7 0.0 2.7 ========= ========= ========= Aerospace & Defence 4.4 0.0 4.4 Construction & Materials 7.0 (0.4) 6.6 Electronic & Electrical Equipment 10.1 0.0 10.1 Industrial Engineering 2.7 0.0 2.7 Industrial Support Services 1.8 (0.2) 1.6 Industrial Transportation 1.4 (0.3) 1.1 Support Services 7.0 (0.2) 6.8 --------------- --------------- --------------- Industrials 34.4 (1.1) 33.3 ========= ========= ========= Food Producers 1.0 0.0 1.0 Personal Goods 1.7 0.0 1.7 --------------- --------------- --------------- Consumer Staples 2.7 0.0 2.7 ========= ========= ========= Healthcare Equipment & Services 0.4 0.0 0.4 Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology 2.9 (0.2) 2.7 --------------- --------------- --------------- Health Care 3.3 (0.2) 3.1 ========= ========= ========= Automobiles & Parts 0.5 0.0 0.5 Consumer Services 0.0 0.0 0.0 General Retailers 8.2 (0.7) 7.5 Home Improvement Retailers 0.6 0.0 0.6 Household Goods and Home Construction 2.6 0.0 2.6 Leisure Goods 1.0 0.0 1.0 Media 9.0 0.0 9.0 Travel & Leisure 2.1 0.0 2.1 --------------- --------------- --------------- Consumer Discretionary 24.0 (0.7) 23.3 ========= ========= ========= Banks 0.6 0.0 0.6 Closed End Investments 0.0 (0.2) (0.2) Financial Services 9.4 (0.6) 8.8 Investment Banking & Brokerage 1.6 (0.4) 1.2 Non-life Insurance 0.8 0.0 0.8 --------------- --------------- --------------- Financials 12.4 (1.2) 11.2 ========= ========= ========= Real Estate Investment & Services 1.6 0.0 1.6 Real Estate Investment Trusts 3.6 0.0 3.6 --------------- --------------- --------------- Real Estate 5.2 0.0 5.2 ========= ========= ========= Software & Computer Services 12.9 (0.4) 12.5 Technology Hardware & Equipment 0.8 0.0 0.8 --------------- --------------- --------------- Technology 13.7 (0.4) 13.3 ========= ========= ========= Mobile Telecommunications 2.8 0.0 2.8 --------------- --------------- --------------- Telecommunications 2.8 0.0 2.8 ========= ========= ========= Total Investments 103.6 (3.6) 100.0 ========= ========= =========The above percentages are calculated on the net portfolio as at 30 November 2023.

The Board is collectively responsible to shareholders for the long-term success of the Company and is its governing body. There is a clear division of responsibility between the Board and the Manager  BlackRock Fund Managers Limited (BFM). Matters for the Board include setting the Company’s strategy  including its investment objective and policy  setting limits on gearing (both bank borrowings and the effect of derivatives)  capital structure  governance  and appointing and monitoring of performance of service providers  including the Manager.The Company’s business model follows that of an externally managed investment trust; therefore the Company does not have any employees and outsources its activities to third party service providers  including the Manager who is the principal service provider.The management of the investment portfolio and the administration of the Company have been contractually delegated to BFM. The Manager  operating under guidelines determined by the Board  has direct responsibility for the decisions relating to the day-to-day running of the Company and is accountable to the Board for the investment  financial and operating performance of the Company.Other service providers include the Depositary and the Fund Accountant  The Bank of New York Mellon (International) Limited  and the Registrar  Computershare Investor Services PLC. Details of the contractual terms with third party service providers are set out in the Directors’ Report contained within the Annual Report and Accounts.INVESTMENT POLICYThe Company’s performance is measured against the Numis Smaller Companies plus AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index (the Benchmark Index). The Investment Manager  BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited (BIM (UK))  may invest in companies outside the Benchmark Index without restriction  subject to the following limits.The Company may hold up to 15% of its gross assets  at the time of acquisition  in securities of companies which are listed or traded on a stock exchange outside the UK.In addition to the normal long only portfolio  the Company will likely hold a mixture of long and short contracts for difference (CFDs) and/or comparable equity derivatives that would result in a typical net market exposure of between 100% and 115%. In extremis  the Company could deploy the full 30% of permissible leverage into short CFDs and/or comparable equity derivatives  thereby reducing its overall net market exposure to 70%.The Company may also invest up to 2.5% of its net assets (measured at the time of investment) in unquoted securities  including securities issued by companies incorporated outside the United Kingdom. However  the Company may invest more than 2.5%  but no more than 3.75%  of its net assets (both measured at the time of investment)  in unquoted securities in circumstances where such investment is in an existing investee company and  in the Investment Manager’s opinion  a failure of the Company to make such investment would have a material adverse effect on the value of the Company’s investment in such investee company.In addition  the Company is permitted to employ leverage up to 30% of net assets  which it does primarily through the use of CFDs and/or comparable equity derivatives  rather than bank borrowings  therefore enabling the Company to have a maximum net market exposure of 130%.In normal circumstances the Company will likely hold a mixture of long and short CFDs and/or comparable equity derivatives that would result in a typical net market exposure of between 100% and 115%*.Portfolio risk will be mitigated by investment in a diversified portfolio of holdings. No more than 5% of the Company’s gross assets  at the time of acquisition  may be invested in any one single holding  excluding holdings in cash or money market funds  where up to 10% of the Company’s gross assets may be held. The Company may also invest in collective investment vehicles. However  the Company will not invest more than 10% of its gross assets  at the time of the acquisition  in other listed closed-ended investment funds  unless such companies have a stated investment policy not to invest more than 15% of their gross assets in other listed closed-ended investment funds  in which case the limit is 15% of gross assets.The Board’s policy is that net gearing  borrowings less cash  should not exceed 20% of gross assets. The Company expects to employ any leverage primarily through its use of CFDs and/or comparable equity derivatives.No material change will be made to the investment objective and policy without shareholder approval.INVESTMENT PROCESSA unique feature of the Company is that it has the ability to go both long and short up to approximately 30% of the Company’s net assets.Notwithstanding recent positive returns from UK small and mid-capitalisation companies  while the sector has generated positive returns over the long term  there can be significant volatility. Such an environment provides an attractive opportunity to add value via both long and short positions which can exploit share price moves whether up or down. As the maximum short portfolio exposure through derivatives is 30% of net assets  the Company will at all times retain an exposure to the market  as shown in the chart contained within the Annual Report and Accounts. In the course of their research the investment management team comes across companies which they judge are likely to underperform; the ability to take short positions therefore enhances the opportunity to make money for shareholders. This is not possible in a conventional or long only portfolio.When markets are expected to rise in the medium term  the long/short strategy is used to generate additional market exposure through ensuring that the long exposure exceeds the short exposure in a range between 0% to 15% of the net assets of the Company. Rising or ‘bull’ markets have historically (in the UK) persisted for longer than falling or ‘bear’ markets. A typical net market exposure might therefore be between 100% and 115%. This is lower than the ‘gross exposure’  which is the combination of the long equity positions  plus the net of long and short derivative positions expressed as a percentage of net assets.ESG INTEGRATIONThe Manager defines Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG) integration as the practice of incorporating material ESG information and consideration of sustainability risks into investment decisions in order to enhance risk-adjusted returns. This statement does not imply that the Company has an ESG-aligned investment objective  but rather describes how ESG information is considered as part of the overall investment process.Of course  ESG information is not the sole consideration for investment decisions; instead  the Manager assesses a variety of economic and financial indicators which include ESG considerations in combination with other information in the research phase of the investment process to make investment decisions appropriate to their client’s objectives. This may also include relevant third party insight  as well as internal engagement commentary and input from BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) on governance issues. The Investment Manager conducts regular portfolio reviews with the BlackRock Risk and Quantitative Analysis (RQA) team. These reviews include discussion of the portfolio's exposure to material ESG risks  as well as exposure to sustainability-related business involvements  climate-related metrics  traditional financial risks and other factors.The Manager’s approach to ESG integration is to broaden the total amount of information its investment professionals consider in order to improve investment analysis  seeking to meet or exceed economic return and financial risk targets. ESG factors can be useful and relevant indicators for investment purposes and can help portfolio managers with their decision-making through identifying potentially negative events or corporate behaviour. The Investment Manager works closely with BIS to assess the governance quality of companies and understand any potential issues  risks or opportunities.The Manager’s research team monitors differing levels of risk throughout the process and believes that avoiding major downside events can generate significant outperformance over the long-term. Inputs from the RQA team are an integral part of the investment process. The RQA team analyse market and portfolio risk factors including stress tests  correlations  factor returns  cross-sectional volatility and attributions. The Manager’s evaluation procedures and financial analysis of the companies within the portfolio also take into account environmental  social and governance matters and other business issues.The Company does not meet the criteria for Article 8 or 9 products under the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and the investments underlying this financial product do not take into account the EU criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities. The Investment Manager has access to a range of data sources  including principal adverse indicator (PAI) data  when making decisions on the selection of investments. However  whilst BlackRock considers ESG risks for all portfolios and these risks may coincide with environmental or social themes associated with the PAIs  the Company does not commit to considering PAIs in driving the selection of its investments.Further information on the Manager’s approach to ESG and sustainability can be found in the report on Responsible Investing contained within the Annual Report and Accounts.* The AIC measures gearing at gross level  rather than net market exposure level (i.e. gearing is calculated as borrowings + long CFDs and/or comparable equity derivatives + short CFDs and/or comparable equity derivatives) and therefore the published gearing figures will be higher than the typical net market exposure of between 100% and 115%.PERFORMANCEThe Investment Manager’s report above includes a review of the main developments during the year  together with information on investment activity within the Company’s portfolio.RESULTS AND DIVIDENDSThe results for the Company are set out in the Statement of Comprehensive Income below. The total loss for the year  after taxation  was £15 749 000 (2022: a loss of £295 888 000) of which the revenue return amounted to £16 510 000 (2022: £13 257 000) and a capital loss of £32 259 000 (2022: loss of £309 145 000).Details of the dividends declared in respect of the year are set out in the Chairman’s Statement above.KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORSAt each Board meeting  the Directors consider a number of performance measures to assess the Company’s success in achieving its objectives. The key performance indicators (KPIs) used to measure the progress and performance of the Company over time  and which are comparable to those reported by other investment trusts  are set out in the table below. These KPIs fall within the definition of ‘Alternative Performance Measures’ (APMs) under guidance issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)  and additional information explaining how these are calculated is set out in the Glossary contained within the Annual Report and Accounts.The Board monitors the KPIs at each meeting. Additionally  it regularly reviews a number of indices and ratios to understand the impact on the Company’s relative performance of the various components such as asset allocation and stock selection. This includes an assessment of the Company’s performance and ongoing charges against its peer group of investment trusts with similar investment objectives.Year ended30 November 2023 Year ended30 November 2022 Net asset value total return1 2 (2.3)% (31.1)% Share price total return1 2 (0.8)% (35.5)% Benchmark Index total return3 (6.0)% (17.5)% Discount to cum income net asset value2 3.6% 5.0% Revenue return per share 16.56p 12.95p Total dividend per share 14.75p 11.10p Ongoing charges2 4 0.54% 0.54% Ongoing charges including performance fees2 5 0.87% 0.54%1 This measures the Company’s share price and NAV total return  which assumes dividends paid by the Company have been reinvested.2 Alternative Performance Measures  see Glossary contained within the Annual Report and Accounts.3 The Company's Benchmark Index is the Numis Smaller Companies plus AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index.4 Ongoing charges represent the management fee and all other operating expenses  excluding the performance fee  finance costs  direct transaction costs  custody transaction charges  VAT recovered  taxation  prior year expenses written back and certain non-recurring items as a % of average daily net assets.5 Ongoing charges represent the management fee  performance fee and all other operating expenses  excluding finance costs  direct transaction costs  custody transaction charges  VAT recovered  taxation  prior year expenses written back and certain non-recurring items as a % of average daily net assets. Further information on the management fees paid by the Company can be found in Note 4 to the financial statements below.SHARE PRICE DISCOUNT/PREMIUMThe Directors recognise that it is in the long-term interests of shareholders that the Company’s shares do not trade at an excessive discount or premium to their prevailing NAV for any material length of time. In the year under review the discount/premium to NAV of the ordinary shares on a cum income basis has ranged between a discount of 9.2% and 1.0%  with the average being a discount of 5.2%. The shares ended the year at a discount of 3.6% on a cum income basis. As at 31 January 2024 the discount was 6.1%.As it does each year  the Board will also be seeking to renew the authority from shareholders at the AGM to issue new shares (or to reissue shares held in treasury) and to buy back shares. Further information on these powers and the Board's policy in this respect can also be found in the Chairman’s Statement above.PRINCIPAL RISKSAs required by the UK Code of Corporate Governance  the Board has in place a robust  ongoing process to identify  assess and monitor the principal and emerging risks of the Company  including those that they consider would threaten its business model  future performance  solvency or liquidity. Emerging risks are considered by the Board as they come into view and are incorporated into the Company’s risk register where applicable. Additionally  the Manager considers emerging risks in numerous forums and the Risk and Quantitative Analysis team produces an annual risk survey. Any material risks of relevance to the Company identified through the annual risk survey will be communicated to the Board.A core element of this process is the Company’s risk register  which identifies the risks facing the Company and the likelihood and potential impact of each risk  together with the controls established for mitigation. A residual risk rating is calculated for each risk  which allows the effect of any mitigating procedures to be reflected in the register. The current risk register includes a range of risks spread between investment performance risk  income/dividend risk  legal & regulatory risk  counterparty risk  operational risk  market risk  political risk and financial risk.The risk register  its method of preparation and the operation of key controls in the Manager’s and third party service providers’ systems of internal control are reviewed on a regular basis by the Audit Committee. In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the Manager’s and other third party service providers’ risk management processes and how these apply to the Company’s business  the Audit Committee periodically receives presentations from BlackRock’s Internal Audit and Risk & Quantitative Analysis teams. Where produced  the Audit Committee also reviews summaries of the Service Organisation Control (SOC1) reports from the Company’s service providers.The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Company during the financial year  together with the potential effects  controls and mitigating factors  are set out below.INVESTMENT PERFORMANCEPrincipal riskThe Board is responsible for:· setting the investment policy to fulfil the Company’s objectives; and· monitoring the performance of the Company’s Investment Manager and the strategy adopted.An inappropriate policy or strategy may lead to:· poor performance compared to the Company’s Benchmark Index  peer group or shareholder expectations;· a widening discount to NAV;· a reduction or permanent loss of capital; and· dissatisfied shareholders and reputational damage.Mitigation/ControlTo manage these risks the Board:· regularly reviews the Company’s investment mandate and long-term strategy;· has set  and regularly reviews  the investment guidelines and has put in place appropriate limits on levels of gearing and the use of derivatives;· receives from the Investment Manager a regular explanation of stock selection decisions  portfolio gearing and any changes in gearing and the rationale for the composition of the investment portfolio;· receives from the Investment Manager regular reporting on the portfolio’s exposure through derivatives  including the extent to which the portfolio is geared in this manner and the value of any short positions;· monitors the maintenance of an adequate spread of investments in order to minimise the risks associated with particular sectors  based on the diversification requirements inherent in the Company’s investment policy; and· monitors the share price discount or premium to NAV.MARKET RISKPrincipal riskMarket risk arises from changes to the prices of the Company’s investments. It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding investments and derivatives. Market risk includes the potential impact of events which are outside the scope of the Company’s control  such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine  the hostilities in the Middle East  and the impacts of climate change.Mitigation/ControlThe Board carefully considers the diversification of the portfolio  asset allocation  stock selection  unquoted investments and levels of gearing on a regular basis and has set investment restrictions and guidelines which are monitored and reported on by the Investment Manager. The Board monitors the implementation and results of the investment process with the Investment Manager  and key market risk factors are discussed.The Board also recognises the benefits of a closed-end fund structure in extremely volatile markets such as those experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the potential impact of the hostilities in the Middle East on the global economy. Unlike open-ended counterparts  closed-end funds are not obliged to sell down portfolio holdings at low valuations to meet liquidity requirements for redemptions. During times of elevated volatility and market stress  the ability of a closed-end fund structure to remain invested for the long-term enables the Investment Manager to adhere to disciplined fundamental analysis from a bottom-up perspective and be ready to respond to dislocations in the market as opportunities present themselves.INCOME/DIVIDEND RISKPrincipal riskThe amount of dividends and future dividend growth will depend on the performance of the Company’s underlying portfolio holdings. Changes in the composition of the portfolio and any change in the tax treatment of the dividends or interest received by the Company may reduce the level of dividends received by shareholders.Mitigation/ControlThe Board monitors this risk through the receipt of detailed income forecasts and considers the level of income at each meeting. The Company also has a revenue reserve and powers to pay dividends from capital which could potentially be used to support the Company’s dividend if required.FINANCIAL RISKPrincipal riskThe Company’s investment activities expose it to a variety of financial risks that include market risk  foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. At 30 November 2023  the Company had approximately 29.5% of its gross asset value invested in AIM traded equity securities and 4.5% of its gross assets in international markets  and  by the very nature of its investment objective  largely invests in smaller companies. Liquidity in these securities can from time to time become constrained  making these investments difficult to realise at or near published prices.Mitigation/ControlThe Company is not materially exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risk. For mitigation of market risk  see above. There are also risks linked to the Company’s use of derivative transactions including long and short investment positions. Details are disclosed in note 11 of the Annual Report and Accounts  together with a summary of the policies for managing and controlling these risks in note 16 of the Annual Report and Accounts.OPERATIONAL RISKPrincipal riskIn common with most other investment trust companies  the Company has no employees. The Company therefore relies upon the services provided by BlackRock (the Manager and AIFM) and The Bank of New York Mellon (International) Limited (the Depositary and Fund Accountant) who maintain the Company’s accounting records.Failure by any service provider to carry out its obligations to the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s performance. Disruption to the accounting  payment systems or custody records  as a result of a cyber-attack or otherwise  could impact the monitoring and reporting of the Company’s financial position.The security of the Company’s assets  dealing procedures  accounting records and maintenance of regulatory and legal requirements  depend on the effective operation of these systems.Mitigation/ControlThe Board reviews the overall performance of the Manager  Investment Manager and all other third party service providers and compliance with the investment management agreement on a regular basis.The Fund Accountant’s and the Manager’s internal control processes are regularly tested and monitored throughout the year and are evidenced through their Service Organisation Control (SOC 1) reports  which are subject to review by an Independent Service Assurance Auditor. The SOC 1 reports provide assurance in respect of the effective operation of internal controls.The Company’s financial instruments held in custody are subject to a strict liability regime and in the event of a loss of such financial instruments held in custody  the Depositary must return assets of an identical type or the corresponding amount  unless able to demonstrate that the loss was a result of an event beyond its reasonable control.The Board considers succession arrangements for key employees of the Manager and the Board also considers the business continuity arrangements of the Company’s key service providers on an ongoing basis and reviews these as part of its review of the Company’s risk register. In respect of the unprecedented risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of the ability of service providers to function effectively  the Board has received reports from key service providers setting out the measures that they have put in place to address the crisis  in addition to their existing business continuity framework. Having considered these arrangements and reviewed service levels since the crisis has evolved  the Board is confident that a good level of service has and will be maintained.The Board also receives regular updates from BlackRock’s internal audit function and the Company’s Audit Committee Chairman attends an annual briefing from the head of BlackRock’s internal audit function once a year. This is supplemented by a written report which describes the progress made against the current internal audit plan  any issues identified and the plan for the forthcoming year.LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKPrincipal riskThe Company has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs as an investment trust  subject to continuing to meet the relevant eligibility conditions  and operates as an investment trust in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 24 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. As such  the Company is exempt from capital gains tax on the profits realised from the sale of its investments.Any breach of the relevant eligibility conditions could lead to the Company losing its investment trust status and being subject to corporation tax on capital gains realised within the Company’s portfolio. In such event the investment returns of the Company may be adversely affected. Any serious breach could result in the Company and/or the Directors being fined or the subject of criminal proceedings or the suspension of the Company’s shares which would in turn lead to a breach of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.Mitigation/ControlThe Investment Manager monitors investment movements  the level of forecast income and expenditure and the amount of proposed dividends  if any  to ensure that the provisions of Chapter 4 of Part 24 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not breached  and the results are reported to the Board at each meeting.Following authorisation under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers’ Directive as retained and onshored in the UK (AIFMD)  the Company and its appointed Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM) are subject to the risks that the requirements of the AIFMD are not correctly complied with. The Board and the AIFM also monitor changes in government policy and legislation which may have an impact on the Company.Compliance with the accounting standards applicable to quoted companies and those applicable to investment trusts are also regularly monitored to ensure compliance.RISK OF REGULATORY CHANGEPrincipal riskAmongst other relevant laws and regulations  the Company is required to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006  the Alternative Investment Fund Managers’ Directive (as retained and onshored in the UK)  the Market Abuse Regulation (also as retained and onshored in the UK)  the UK Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.Mitigation/ControlThe Company Secretary and the Company’s professional advisers monitor developments in relevant laws and regulations and provide regular reports to the Board in respect of the Company’s compliance.The Market Abuse Regulation came into force across the EU on 3 July 2016 and has been retained and onshored in the UK following Brexit. The Board has taken steps to ensure that individual Directors (and their Persons Closely Associated) are aware of their obligations under the regulation and has updated internal processes  where necessary  to ensure the risk of non-compliance is effectively mitigated.COUNTERPARTYPrincipal riskThe potential loss that the Company could incur if a counterparty is unable (or unwilling) to perform on its commitments. The Company’s investment policy also permits the use of both exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives (including contracts for difference).Mitigation/ControlDue diligence is undertaken before contracts are entered into and exposures are diversified across a number of counterparties. The Board reviews the controls put in place by the Investment Manager to monitor and to minimise counterparty exposure  which include intra-day monitoring of exposures to ensure that these are within set limits.The Depositary is liable for restitution for the loss of financial instruments held in custody  unless it is able to demonstrate that the loss was due to an event beyond its reasonable control.VIABILITY STATEMENTThe Directors have assessed the prospects of the Company over a longer period than the 12 months referred to by the “Going Concern” guidelines.The Board conducted this review for the period up to the AGM in 2029  being a five-year period from the date that this Annual Report will be approved by shareholders. This is generally the investment holding period investors consider while investing in the smaller companies’ sector. The Board is cognisant of the uncertainty surrounding the potential duration of the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the hostilities in the Middle East  their impact on the global economy  and the prospects for the Company’s portfolio holdings. In making its assessment the Board has also considered the following factors:· the Company’s principal risks as set out above;· the impact of a significant fall in UK equity markets on the value of the Company’s investment portfolio in the light of the heightened volatility resulting from the ongoing Russia/Ukraine conflict  the hostilities in the Middle East  and any potential impact on the global economy  and the path of inflation and interest rates in the UK;· the ongoing relevance of the Company’s investment objective; and· the level of demand for the Company’s shares.The Directors have also considered the Company’s revenue and expense forecasts and the fact that expenses and liabilities are relatively stable. The Company also has a portfolio of investments which provides a level of cash receipts in the form of dividends and which are considered to be relatively realisable if required.The Directors reviewed the assumptions and considerations underpinning the Company’s existing going concern assertion (please see the disclosure in the Directors’ Report contained within the Annual Report and Accounts)  which are based on:· processes for monitoring costs;· key financial ratios;· evaluation of risk management and controls;· compliance with the investment objective;· the Company’s ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due;· portfolio risk profile;· share price discount to NAV;· gearing;· counterparty exposure and liquidity risk;· the operational resilience of the Company and its key service providers and their ability to continue to provide a good level of service for the foreseeable future; and· the effectiveness of business continuity plans in place for the Company and key service providers.The Company has a relatively liquid portfolio and largely fixed overheads (excluding any applicable performance fees) which comprise a very small percentage of net assets 0.54% excluding performance fees  0.87% including performance fees in 2023. The effective performance fee cap in the event that the NAV return exceeds the Benchmark Index return over the performance period is circa 0.90% of the average gross assets over the two years and the applicable percentage to be applied to the outperformance of the NAV total return over the Benchmark Index return is 15%. In addition  the maximum cap on total management and performance fees is 1.25% of average gross assets (measured over a rolling two-year period). Therefore  the Board has concluded that the Company would be able to meet its ongoing operating costs as they fall due.The Directors have also considered the impact of potential changes in law  regulation and taxation and the matter of foreign exchange risk. They have determined that although there are a number of potential risks associated with the legal  fiscal and regulatory landscape they do not believe that this represents a material threat to the Company’s strategy and business model  nor do they believe that the Investment Manager will be materially impeded in achieving the Company’s investment objective.Based on the results of their analysis  the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment.SECTION 172 STATEMENT: PROMOTING THE SUCCESS OF BLACKROCK THROGMORTON TRUST PLCThe Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 require directors to explain more fully how they have discharged their duties under Section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 in promoting the success of their companies for the benefit of members as a whole. This enhanced disclosure covers how the Board has engaged with and understands the views of stakeholders and how stakeholders’ needs have been taken into account  the outcome of this engagement and the impact that it has had on the Board’s decisions.As the Company is an externally managed investment company and does not have any employees or customers  the Board considers the main stakeholders in the Company to be the shareholders and the key service providers (being the Manager and Investment Manager  the Custodian  Depositary  Registrar and Broker). The reasons for this determination  and the Board’s overarching approach to engagement  are set out in the table below:STAKEHOLDERSShareholdersContinued shareholder support and engagement are critical to the continued existence of the Company and the successful delivery of its long-term strategy. The Board is focused on fostering good working relationships with shareholders and on understanding the views of shareholders in order to incorporate them into the Board’s strategy and objectives in delivering long-term growth and income.In turn  portfolio holdings are ultimately shareholders’ assets  and the Board recognises the importance of good stewardship and communication with investee companies in meeting the Company’s investment objective and strategy.Manager and Investment ManagerThe Board’s main working relationship is with the Manager  who is responsible for the Company’s portfolio management (including asset allocation  stock and sector selection) and risk management  as well as ancillary functions such as administration  secretarial  accounting and marketing services. The Manager has sub-delegated portfolio management to the Investment Manager. Successful management of shareholders’ assets by the Investment Manager is critical for the Company to successfully deliver its investment strategy and meet its objective. The Company is also reliant on the Manager as AIFM to provide support in meeting relevant regulatory obligations under the AIFMD and other relevant legislation.Other key service providersIn order for the Company to function as an investment trust with a listing on the premium segment of the official list of the FCA and trade on the London Stock Exchange’s (LSE) main market for listed securities  the Board relies on a diverse range of advisors for support in meeting relevant obligations and safeguarding the Company’s assets. For this reason  the Board considers the Company’s Custodian  Depositary  Registrar and Broker to be stakeholders. The Board  either directly or through the Manager  maintains regular contact with its key external providers and receives regular reporting from them through the Board and Committee meetings  as well as outside of the regular meeting cycle.A summary of the key areas of engagement undertaken by the Board with its key stakeholders in the year under review and how Directors have acted upon this to promote the long-term success of the Company are set out in the table below.INVESTMENT MANDATE AND OBJECTIVEIssueThe Board is committed to promoting the role and success of the Company in delivering on its investment mandate to shareholders over the long-term. The Board also has responsibility to shareholders to ensure that the Company’s portfolio of assets is invested in line with the stated investment objective and in a way that ensures an appropriate balance between spread of risk and portfolio returns.EngagementThe Board works closely with the Investment Manager throughout the year in further developing our investment strategy and underlying policies  not simply for the purpose of achieving the Company’s investment objective but in the interests of shareholders and future investors.The Board is kept advised in respect of the Manager’s consideration of ESG factors as part of the investment process; a summary of BlackRock’s approach to ESG matters is set out within the Annual Report and Accounts.ImpactDetails regarding the Company’s NAV and share price performance can be found in the Chairman’s Statement and in the Strategic Report above.The portfolio activities undertaken by the Manager can be found in the Investment Manager’s Report above.MANAGEMENT OF THE SHARE RATINGIssueThe Board believes that the best way of addressing the discount over the longer term is to continue to generate good performance and to create demand for the Company’s shares in the secondary market through broadening awareness of the Company’s unique structure. The Board believes that it is in shareholders’ interests that the share price does not trade at an excessive premium or discount to NAV. Therefore  where deemed to be in shareholders’ long-term interests  it may exercise its powers to issue shares or buy back shares with the objective of ensuring that an excessive premium or discount does not arise.EngagementThe Manager reports total return performance statistics to the Board on a regular basis  along with the portfolio yield and the impact of dividends paid on brought forward distributable reserves.The Board reviews the Company’s discount/premium to NAV on a regular basis and holds regular discussions with the Manager and the Company’s broker regarding the discount/premium level.The Board believes that the best way of maintaining the share rating at an optimal level over the long-term is to create demand for the shares in the secondary market. To this end the Investment Manager is devoting considerable effort to broadening the awareness of the Company  particularly to wealth managers and to the wider retail shareholder market.The Manager provides the Board with feedback and key performance statistics regarding the success of the Company’s marketing initiatives.ImpactThe average discount for the year to 30 November 2023 was 5.2%. During the year the Company’s share price has traded between a discount of 9.2% and 1.0%.SERVICE LEVELS OF THIRD PARTY PROVIDERSIssueThe Board acknowledges the importance of ensuring that the Company’s principal suppliers are providing a suitable level of service including: the Manager in respect of investment performance and delivering on the Company’s investment mandate; the Depositary in respect of its duties towards safeguarding the Company’s assets; the Registrar in its maintenance of the Company’s share register and dealing with investor queries and the Company’s Brokers in respect of the provision of advice and acting as a market maker for the Company’s shares.EngagementThe Manager reports to the Board on the Company’s performance on a regular basis. The Board carries out a robust annual evaluation of the Manager’s performance  their commitment and available resources.The Board performs an annual review of the service levels of all third party service providers and concludes on their suitability to continue in their role.The Board has received updates in respect of business continuity planning from the Company’s Manager  Depositary  Fund Administrator  Brokers  Registrar and Printers  and is confident that arrangements are in place to ensure that a good level of service will continue to be provided.ImpactPerformance evaluations were performed on a timely basis and the Board concluded that all third party service providers  including the Manager  Depositary and Fund Administrator were operating effectively and providing a good level of service.BOARD COMPOSITIONIssueThe Board is committed to ensuring that its own composition brings an appropriate balance of knowledge  experience and skills  and that it is compliant with best corporate governance practice under the UK Corporate Governance Code  including guidance on tenure and the composition of the Board’s committees.EngagementDuring the year the Board undert,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.23,0.26,0.51,True,English,"['BlackRock Throgmorton Trust Plc', 'Annual Financial Report', 'BlackRock Throgmorton Trust plc', 'income net asset value3', 'UK Smaller Company valuations', 'other asset classes', 'Legal Entity Identifier', 'Article 5 Transparency Directive', 'rising consumer confidence', 'strong wage growth', 'Numis Smaller Companies', 'first six months', 'Annual Results Announcement', '3 Alternative Performance Measures', 'significant market volatility', 'Ordinary share price3', 'Investment Companies) Index', 'Annual performance figures', 'share price level', 'Net assets', 'Net profit', 'larger companies', 'twelve months', 'Investment Manager', 'ordinary activities', 'share issues', 'share buybacks', 'Annual Report', 'Sterling terms', 'Further details', '3.7 percentage points', 'longer term', 'Final dividend', 'absolute terms', 'Dan Whitestone', 'widening gap', 'macroeconomic backdrop', 'falling inflation', 'potential catalyst', 'Benchmark Index2', 'Benchmark Index1', 'Benchmark Indices', 'Performance record', 'ten years', 'five years', 'three years', 'The Company', 'Average discount', 'portfolio movements', 'same periods', 'portfolio manager', 'Half-Yearly statement', 'Financial year', 'one year', 'year end', 'MARKET OVERVIEW', 'NAV return', 'total dividends', 'Revenue earnings', '10 years', '3.6% discount', '5493003B7ETS1JEDPF59', 'Information', 'accordance', 'DTR', '30 November', 'pence', 'share3', 'year3', 'taxation', 'Interim', 'Sources', 'Datastream', 'change', 'AIM', 'effect', '22 March', '1 December', '21 March', 'Glossary', 'Accounts', 'Chairman', 'highlights', '11.45p', 'returns', 'review', 'outperformance', 'history', 'fortunes', 'factors', 'rating', 'sector', 'outlook', 'Trading', 'Board', 'July', '29.', '95', '4.3', '5.2']",2024-02-02,2024-02-03,marketscreener.com
