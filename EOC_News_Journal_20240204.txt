Proponents believe that any settlement to the conflict under international law would find Russia liable to pay for the damage it has caused its neighbor. Should Russia refuse  claims could be made on the frozen assets  the people said.Discussions are currently taking place at a technical level  meaning a political decision has not yet been taken  said the people  who spoke on condition of anonymity. One of the people said some countries want to move faster than others.The G-7 has pledged to make Russia pay to rebuild Ukraine and to keep sanctioned assets frozen until it does. Several G-7 nations  including France and Germany  have so far resisted the option of confiscating the frozen assets outright because of legal concerns and the potential consequences on the stability of the euro.The plan could allow for the creation of a special purpose vehicle that would issues zero-coupon bonds backed by callable collateral  one of the people said. A hierarchy would be established on the collateral that would use the assets held by Euroclear as well as banks  the person said.The option to use the assets as collateral in the meantime  which was first reported by the Financial Times  is seen as an alternative to that route  said the people. Russia has vowed to legally challenge any attempt to seize assets.Any move would come on top of EU plans to apply a windfall tax to the profits generated by the frozen central bank assets. Though slowly  that plan is progressing  Bloomberg previously reported. The vast majority of the sanctioned assets are held by the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear  where they generated €4.4 billion in 2023  according to financial results published last week. Several Russian firms have contested the sanctions and a number of legal proceedings are ongoing  almost exclusively in Russian courts.The discussions focus on Kyiv’s longer-term needs and are separate from a drive to support Ukraine’s economy in the immediate term. Last week the EU approved a €50 billion multi-annual aid package  while talks in the US over $60 billion in assistance remain stuck in Congress.Milestone Alert!
