Proponents believe that any settlement to the conflict under international law would find Russia liable to pay for the damage it has caused its neighbor. Should Russia refuse  claims could be made on the frozen assets  the people said.Discussions are currently taking place at a technical level  meaning a political decision has not yet been taken  said the people  who spoke on condition of anonymity. One of the people said some countries want to move faster than others.The G-7 has pledged to make Russia pay to rebuild Ukraine and to keep sanctioned assets frozen until it does. Several G-7 nations  including France and Germany  have so far resisted the option of confiscating the frozen assets outright because of legal concerns and the potential consequences on the stability of the euro.The plan could allow for the creation of a special purpose vehicle that would issues zero-coupon bonds backed by callable collateral  one of the people said. A hierarchy would be established on the collateral that would use the assets held by Euroclear as well as banks  the person said.The option to use the assets as collateral in the meantime  which was first reported by the Financial Times  is seen as an alternative to that route  said the people. Russia has vowed to legally challenge any attempt to seize assets.Any move would come on top of EU plans to apply a windfall tax to the profits generated by the frozen central bank assets. Though slowly  that plan is progressing  Bloomberg previously reported. The vast majority of the sanctioned assets are held by the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear  where they generated €4.4 billion in 2023  according to financial results published last week. Several Russian firms have contested the sanctions and a number of legal proceedings are ongoing  almost exclusively in Russian courts.The discussions focus on Kyiv’s longer-term needs and are separate from a drive to support Ukraine’s economy in the immediate term. Last week the EU approved a €50 billion multi-annual aid package  while talks in the US over $60 billion in assistance remain stuck in Congress.Milestone Alert!

The EU is getting ready to send them to UkraineThe European Union agreed on a funding deal worth more than $50 billion for Ukraine that comes at a pivotal moment in the war.The European Union agreed on a funding deal worth more than $50 billion for Ukraine that comes at a pivotal moment in the war.The European Union agreed on a funding deal worth more than $50 billion for Ukraine that comes at a pivotal moment in the war.The European Union agreed on a funding deal worth more than $50 billion for Ukraine that comes at a pivotal moment in the war.LONDON -- Russian assets frozen in European accounts are generating billions of dollars in interest payments that could be diverted to help repair Ukraine's war-torn economy - and the European Union just took a step closer to doing that.Please note: The above video is from a previous  related reportAfter Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  Western countries froze nearly half of Moscow's foreign reserves - some 300 billion ($327 billion). Around 200 billion ($218 billion) sits in the European Union - mostly at Euroclear  a financial institution that keeps assets safe for banks  exchanges and investors.EU leaders agreed a crucial $50 billion funding package for Ukraine on Thursday and came closer to finalizing a plan to use the profits piling up in Euroclear's accounts.In a statement issued at the end of a summit  EU leaders said ""potential revenues could be generated ... concerning the use of extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from the immobilised Central Bank of Russia assets.""READ MORE: Senate unveils $118B package to secure border  aid Israel and UkraineBelgium-based Euroclear disclosed Thursday that it has earned 5.2 billion ($5.6 billion) in interest on income generated by sanctioned Russian assets since they were frozen by EU and Group of Seven countries in 2022.""The number of sanctions and countersanctions that have been introduced since February 2022 are unprecedented and continue to have a significant impact on the daily operations of Euroclear "" the group said in a statement.The European Union and its allies are determined to make Russia foot part of the colossal bill for rebuilding Ukraine - estimated by the World Bank a year ago at $411 billion over the next decade.RELATED: EU agrees on $50B funding deal for UkraineOne proposal put forward by the European Commission would involve using a special levy to collect the windfall interest income  which would then be paid into the EU budget for the reconstruction of Ukraine.That plan has been delayed by legal and financial concerns  with some EU member states and the European Central Bank worried that even carefully targeted measures could fall foul of international law and shake confidence in the euro as the world's second biggest reserve currency. The EU has been at pains to contrast the illegality of Russia's invasion with its own strict adherence to the rule of law.EU member countries have now agreed in principle to tap this windfall interest income  although the details of how this will be done practically must still be ironed out  an EU diplomat told CNN. Lawyers are working on the text of the agreement before returning it to EU member states for final approval.In its earnings statement  Euroclear - which settles cross-border trades and safeguards more than $40 trillion in assets - said it was focused on ""minimising potential legal and operational risks"" that may arise from proposals by EU officials to hand the money to Ukraine.Euroclear said additional administrative costs relating to the sanctions cost it 62 million ($67 million) last year  ""with considerable senior management and board focus on the topic.""It added that cash on its balance sheet soared 38 billion ($41 billion) year-on-year to 162 billion ($175 billion)  boosted by payments associated with frozen Russian assets  including bonds.These payments include  for example  interest paid on bonds  known as coupons  or the proceeds generated by securities that mature and are reinvested.Ordinarily  these payments would have been made to Russian bank accounts  but they have been blocked by the sanctions and are generating vast amounts of interest - even more so given the recent spate of rate hikes.Euroclear  for its part  is embroiled in several legal proceedings pertaining to the sanctions - almost exclusively in Russian courts - as claimants seek to access the assets blocked in its books.The company said it continues to retain profits related to these assets ""until further guidance is provided on the distribution or management of such profits.""- James Frater contributed reporting.Copyright 2024 Cable News Network.

The Belgium-based company reported net interest earnings of EUR5.5 billion  with EUR4.4 billion attributed to interests linked to Russian sanctions. The profits were reportedly influenced by prevailing interest rates and the cash balances Euroclear is mandated to invest.It is estimated that Euroclear is holding approximately EUR196.6 billion (almost USD220 billion) worth of Russian assets  the majority of which belong to the Russian central bank. Since the onset of the conflict in Ukraine  the European Union has frozen a total of EUR207 billion (just over USD231 billion) in Russian assets and reserves. European Union leaders have consistently advocated for utilizing these funds to aid in the reconstruction of Ukraine. A scheme to deploy the windfall profits generated by these frozen assets was agreed upon last year; however  concerns about potential negative effects on the euro and reserve holders have been raised by officials  including European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.Despite calls for deploying the funds  uncertainties persist regarding the implementation of profit-siphoning schemes. Euroclear emphasized the necessity of segregating estimated sanction-related earnings from underlying financial results when assessing the company's performance and resources.In a recent development  the Belgian presidency of the European Union Council announced that member states have reached an agreement allowing Brussels to transfer the income generated by Russia's frozen central bank reserves to Kiev. This decision brings to the forefront the ongoing debate on the ethical and economic considerations surrounding the use of profits derived from frozen assets  adding another layer of complexity to the multifaceted dynamics of international financial relations.MENAFN05022024000045015687ID1107810187,neutral,0.01,0.92,0.07,mixed,0.08,0.28,0.64,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU-positioned incomes', 'European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde', 'Russian central bank', 'central bank reserves', 'major European clearinghouse', 'European Union leaders', 'European Union Council', 'net interest earnings', 'prevailing interest rates', 'potential negative effects', 'estimated sanction-related earnings', 'international financial relations', 'underlying financial results', '2023 financial results', 'Russian assets', 'Russian sanctions', 'substantial profit', 'past year', 'cash balances', 'frozen assets', 'reserve holders', 'profit-siphoning schemes', 'recent development', 'Belgian presidency', 'member states', 'ongoing debate', 'economic considerations', 'multifaceted dynamics', 'Belgium-based company', 'windfall profits', 'MENAFN', 'Euroclear', 'Thursday', 'interests', 'majority', 'onset', 'conflict', 'Ukraine', 'total', 'funds', 'reconstruction', 'concerns', 'officials', 'calls', 'uncertainties', 'implementation', 'necessity', 'performance', 'resources', 'agreement', 'Brussels', 'income', 'Kiev', 'decision', 'forefront', 'ethical', 'layer', 'complexity']",2024-02-05,2024-02-05,menafn.com
