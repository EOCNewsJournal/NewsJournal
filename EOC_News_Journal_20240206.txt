VEON’s commitment to invest in Ukraine  including the 600 million USD plan that covers the three-year period from 2024-2026  was the focus of a visit last week by a high-level delegation to Kyiv. Former U.S. Secretary of State Michael R.

I am inspired to see the incredible dedication of VEON and Kyivstar  and of the other private sector companies that continue to serve Ukrainians with commitment and perseverance ” said Mike Pompeo  Former U.S. Secretary of State and Kyivstar Board member.“In the first days of the war  we at VEON made a decision and chose to serve Ukraine. I would like to thank our international investors for supporting us through our exit from Russia  which we completed in October 2023  and our continued focus on investing in Ukraine  including the 600 million USD commitment which we are setting in motion starting with this year. VEON and Kyivstar will be a part of Ukraine’s future  and we will continue to work day and night to make the future victorious  successful and inspiring.” said Kaan Terzioglu  VEON Group CEO.“This year marks the beginning of an ambitious journey for Kyivstar  as we launch the investments within the scope of our three-year commitment to invest 600 million USD. With the support of our parent company VEON  the guidance of Kyivstar Board of Directors  which is now stronger than ever with Secretary Pompeo  the unwavering dedication of our 4000-strong team  and the continued appreciation of our 24 million customers  Kyivstar is a leading example of a company that rises to the challenge of rebuilding Ukraine today – overcoming all odds and never losing the focus ” said Oleksandr Komarov  Kyivstar CEO.VEON is the parent company and the 100% owner of Kyivstar  the largest telecoms operator in Ukraine  that serves 24 million customers with mobile and fixed connectivity and digital services  keeping Ukrainians connected at home and abroad through very challenging conditions.

It also includes additional savings of around €700 million from new projects launched in all Group entities to streamline information systems  optimise purchasing processes  or simplify the organisation.In this context  several French head office entities are considering organisational changes that require specific social support measures. The objective is to group and pool certain activities and functions  remove hierarchical layers to streamline decision-making  and resize certain teams due to reviews of projects or processes.This reorganisation project  which would represent a major step in achieving the additional savings envisaged  is being submitted today for consultation with the staff representative bodies. Following the completion of the consultation scheduled for the second quarter of 2024  the implementation of these organisational changes would result in approximately 900 job cuts at head office without forced departures (i.e. approximately 5% of head office staff). As a responsible employer  Societe Generale would deploy all the support measures as part of its social pact through internal transfers  end-of-year support or voluntary departures.Press contacts:Jean-Baptiste Froville_+33 1 58 98 68 00_ jean-baptiste.froville@socgen.comAmandine Grison_+33 1 41 45 92 40_amandine.grison@socgen.comSociete GeneraleSociete Generale is a top tier European Bank with 117 000 employees serving 25 million clients in more than 60 countries across the world.

The mandataire ad hoc is an independent third party whose mission would be to assist the Company in its discussions  in order to converge on an appropriate financial solution as soon as possible  in the Company’s corporate interests.The mandat ad hoc is an amicable procedure allowing negotiations to be conducted within a confidential framework. The mandat ad hoc would only concern the financial debt of the Company and would have no impact on the employees  customers and suppliers of the group.Furthermore  as announced on January 3  2024  the first 6-month extension of the €1.5 billion term loan A took effect on January 29  2024.Contemplated disposals and capital increaseAs indicated at the Market Update on January 3  2024:Discussions with EPEI on the sale of Tech Foundations continue (including required conditions to release their commitment to participate in a reserved capital increase)  there is no certainty that these negotiations will result in an agreement.The Company is in due diligence phase with Airbus in connection with the potential sale of its BDS (Big Data & Security) business.Also  and given the changes in market environment  the conditions of the initially planned €720m rights issue are no longer applicable and the standby underwriting commitment provided by BNP Paribas and J.P. Morgan is no longer in effect.Atos will inform the market in due course of the progress of the discussions with its banks  its new refinancing plan  its contemplated disposals  as well as the possible changes in its capital structure which could result in a dilution of the existing shareholders  depending on the agreement on the refinancing structure.***About AtosAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with c. 105 000 employees and annual revenue of c. € 11 billion.

Revenue for 2024 are currently expected to be satisfactory  even if there is no guarantee that they will be higher than in 2023.Revenue at 31 December 2023 break down as follows:in k€ FY 2023 %CA FY 2022 %CA Var. % change TOTAL Revenue 19 499 17 607 1 892 11% Licenses 8 092 41% 8 937 51% -844 -9% Maintenance 5 172 27% 4 139 23% +1 033 +25% Services 6 235 32% 4 531 26% +1 703 +38% Platforms business 14 254 73% 12 339 70% +1 915 +16% Legacy business 5 245 27% 5 268 30% -23(*) The audit procedures for the 2023 annual revenue are underway._ SOLID GROWTH IN 2023 AND INCREASE IN RECURRING REVENUEDevelopment and growth of new solutions : the team on mission critical communications and team on the run critical activities platforms  whose annual revenue (€14.3m) are up 16%  now account for 73% (+3 points compared with 2022) of the Group's total revenue.This growth (+1.9 M€) is mainly due to the continued deployment of the PCSTORM project (multi-year maintenance contract  large-scale operational deployment during the Rugby World Cup 2023 and development and delivery of version 4.0 of team on mission at the end of 2023)  but also to new private contracts (transport and energy) and projects with municipal authorities.Revenue from the partnership with Airbus Secure Land Communications continue to be significant  notably following the contractual renegotiation at the end of 2023 covering the next 3 years.By nature  revenue from the ""platforms"" business of €14.3m in 2023 are made up of:licence revenue (€6.9m)  down €1.2mservice revenue (€5.7m)  up €2mmaintenance revenue (€1.7m) up €1.1mThe change in licence revenue is due to a significant base effect in 2022  with major orders booked for the PCSTORM and Société du Grand Paris projects  only partially offset by orders in 2023 for licences resulting from the partnership with Airbus.The increase in revenue from maintenance and services is also mainly due to the PCSTORM project and a new multi-year contract signed in May 2022. While revenue from services are non-recurring  those from maintenance are  and will continue to grow over the coming months as the various platforms we support are rolled out.Legacy business maintained at €5.2m : the legacy business (solutions for telecoms operators)  which requires little or no capital investment  accounts for 27% of annual revenue  after contracting slightly in 2022 (€0.5m). Licence revenue  which are non-recurring by nature  increased by €0.3m over the period (new market won in North America)  rising to €1.2m in 2023. Recurring maintenance revenue remained stable at €3.5m  while revenue from legacy services (€0.5m) fell by €0.3m  following platform upgrades carried out in 2022 for customers in the United States and the United Kingdom  which are by their nature non-recurring.OUTLOOK: PROFITABLE GROWTH AND DIVERSIFICATION OF REVENUE STREAMSRevenue growth in the second half of the year (up €1.6m to €11.1m  or +17%) was higher than in the first half (up €0.2m to €8.4m  or +3%)  confirming another year of profitable growth  with high and significant levels of operating margin  cash flow and earnings in 2023.The revenue momentum at the end of 2023 and beginning of 2024 is encouraging  and has led to the completion of several projects  both in France and in Europe  including the first order received in December 2023 in connection with the preparation of the MCx project in Italy. Other major orders linked to this project should be booked during 2024.Several other  smaller-scale projects were completed by the end of 2023  both in the public sector  with the team on mission solution  and in the private sector with the team on the run solution.New technical and commercial partnerships are also being negotiated or finalised  demonstrating that the platform technology developed by the Group has become indispensable for a majority of major players in the sector.Recurring revenue generated by the legacy business should remain stable in 2024. However  a number of platform migration projects in Europe and the United States could come to fruition in the coming months  with a positive impact on business.The Group has the financial resources to further increase the technological lead of its solutions  and major human and technical investments will be made in the coming months to further strengthen the sovereignty  security  standards compliance (particularly 3GPP) and scalability of the solutions offered. All these technical and functional developments will further enhance the operational value of our solutions. Providing 'all-in-one'  modular and functional solutions  enabling customers/prospects to free themselves from the technical and organisational constraints they currently face.While the adoption of communications solutions and mission-critical activities should accelerate over time  time remains an unknown variable  and revenue cycles remain long  which means that we still need to be relatively cautious.

This contract provides for the purchase of Ecoslops SA's shares and shareholder loan in Ecoslops Provence by TotalEnergies for €8.0 million  payable in full at the closing of the transaction  scheduled for the end of February 2024  after the lifting of conditions precedent. To date  nothing has come to light that would call this timetable into question.Ecoslops PortugalEcoslops Portugal turnover fell by 28%  from €14.4 million in 2022 to €10.3 million in 2023. Port Services sales rose by 14% to €2.4 million  while Refined Products sales fell to €7.9 million in 2023 from €12.3 million in 2022. This decline can be broken down into: -20% of volume effect  -19% of price effect (average Brent price having fallen from 94.3€/bbl in 2022 to 76.1€/bbl in 2023) and +3% of product mix effect. Over the period  the unit produced 20 071 tonnes of refined products (in line with the latest target communicated)  compared with 24 509 tonnes in 2022  and sold 17 693 tonnes  compared with 22 165 tonnes the previous year. In 2024  Ecoslops Portugal forecasts production of 24 500 tonnes  representing sales of around €13 million (including port services) based on current prices (Brent at $80/bbl).Scarabox®The Scarabox business is the mainstay of the Group's development. It responds to a recognized need to process used oils in an environmentally-friendly way. The local production of basic energy products through a circular process provides a sustainable outlet for this harmful waste. For Ecoslops  this activity as a supplier of turnkey technical solutions is a highly complementary one to Ecoslops Portugal  as it requires little capital and generates a good level of margin.In 2024  Ecoslops will have the financial and human resources needed to complete the work in Cameroon with Valtech Energy  a full-scale demonstrator of the technology  and to develop its pipeline of new business. In Ivory Coast  the aim is to proceed with the sale of a Scarabox this year  following the positive results of the local market study.Cash positionAt December 31  2023  before closing of the Ecoslops Provence disposal  the Group had cash and cash equivalents of €3.2 million  of which €2.4 million was available (taking into account a €0.8 million conditional advance on investment grants)  and net debt of €18.7 million (vs. €23.2 million at December 31  2022).Post closing of the Ecoslops Provence disposal  the Group's net debt will be reduced to 10.7 M€.Corporate Social ResponsibilityAs a player in the circular economy  Ecoslops attaches major importance to environmental issues  in addition to societal and governance issues. In this context  the Group published its fourth sustainable development report on June 2  2023.The Group's commitment to continuous improvement is illustrated by the further rise in its 2023 ESG rating  which was derived from the Ethifinance ESG Campaign (formerly Gaïa Research) for the year 2022. The company confirms its performance  now ranked 24th/310 (vs. 39th/371 in the previous campaign) in the general panel  10th/416 in the panel of companies with turnover of less than €150 million (vs. 14th/126 in the previous campaign) and 4th/272 in the industry panel (vs. 7th/76 for 2021).In addition  the Solar Impulse Foundation's ""Efficient Solution"" label  focused on promoting efficient  cost-effective solutions to protect the environment  was successfully renewed in January 2024.Next appointmentPublication of 2023 annual results on April 11  2024 after close of tradingA PROPOS D’ECOSLOPSEcoslops est cotée sur Euronext Growth à ParisCode ISIN : FR0011490648 - Mnémonique : ALESA / éligible PEA-PME.Contact Relations investisseurs : info.esa@ecoslops.com - +33 (0)1 83 64 47 43Ecoslops fait entrer le pétrole dans l’économie circulaire grâce à une technologie innovante  permettant de produire du carburant et du bitume léger à partir de résidus pétroliers.

The Company was awarded a tropical…,"Saint-Herblain (France)  February 5  2024 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today announced it sold the Priority Review Voucher (PRV) it received from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for $103 million (€95 million).The Company was awarded a tropical disease PRV in November 20231 following U.S. FDA approval of IXCHIQ®  Valneva’s single-dose  live-attenuated vaccine indicated for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. With this approval  IXCHIQ® became the world’s first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need.Valneva will invest proceeds from the sale of the PRV into its R&D projects  including the co-development of its Phase 3 vaccine candidate against Lyme disease  additional clinical trials for its chikungunya vaccine IXCHIQ® and the expansion of the Company’s clinical pipeline.Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  said  “This non-dilutive capital provides an important source of additional funding to advance the continued development of our clinical pipeline. As shown with the recent approval of our chikungunya vaccine  we remain committed to growing our portfolio of vaccines addressing unmet medical needs which have the potential to transform people’s lives.”Under the tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program  FDA awards priority review vouchers to sponsors of tropical disease product applications that meet certain criteria. The program is intended to encourage development of new drugs and biologics for the prevention and treatment of tropical diseases. PRVs can be redeemed to receive priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product  sold or transferred.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite2. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20323. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries4. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas5 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Before IXCHIQ®  there were no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About IXCHIQ®In the U.S.  IXCHIQ® is a live-attenuated vaccine indicated for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. As for all products approved under FDA’s accelerated approval pathway  continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.Please click here for full Prescribing Information for IXCHIQ®.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Sanofi today launches ‘Cancer & Work: Acting Together’  a globa…,Peer support  flexible work arrangements  salary for a year: Sanofi launches global program for employees affected by cancer and critical illnessesParis  February 5  2024. Sanofi today launches ‘Cancer & Work: Acting Together’  a global program to support Sanofi employees whose lives are impacted by cancer and other critical illnesses. This program covers all Sanofi employees in the world if they are diagnosed with cancer or critical illnesses*. It provides social  emotional and financial support and secures the job  salary and benefits of any employee for up to twelve months  no matter the role or geographical location.Natalie BickfordChief People Officer  Sanofi“Many of us will face cancer one way or another in our lives. The last thing you want to be thinking about when you are diagnosed with cancer  or going through treatment  is work. And yet  half of people who receive a cancer diagnosis are frightened to tell their workplace. That is not right. I am delighted that Sanofi has gone further  guaranteeing job security and salary continuation for at least a year after diagnosis. Today  we also support every Sanofi employee facing cancer by training a global network of affinity groups who can provide safe spaces  and by helping managers understand the challenges their team members may be facing  and how best to approach them for reassurance and support.”On top of financial support  employees will be able to incorporate further flexible work arrangements to better navigate cancer and work. The program also addresses the emotional wellbeing of Sanofi employees impacted by cancer and other critical illnesses. They will have access to a network of volunteer colleagues trained to help them navigate from initial diagnosis through the treatment journey and return to work.Many of the volunteers in the network have experienced cancer; connecting with them creates a safe space for sharing experiences  discussing accessible resources and building supportive relationships. Impacted employees have also access to an external psychological support in all countries 24/7 through the Employee Assistance Program.In addition  throughout 2024  Sanofi intends to implement coverage of miscellaneous non-medical expenses. Moreover  Sanofi permanent employees will become eligible for an unpaid caregiver leave which allows them to carry out caregiving duties for their close family member suffering from a critical illness*.The program is also designed to better equip managers to support members of their team who are affected by cancer. It connects them with the knowledge they will need to take that first step in helping a colleague navigate their local benefit and support programs.A global program inspired by an employee initiativeIn 2017  several volunteer employees in France  with complementary expert skills and experience as patients  caregivers or managers  started the initiative. They first created space for affected employees to share their experience  ask questions  and hear from colleagues who have been through similar situations and found ways to reconcile work and illness. Importantly  they helped develop the right support the affected employee needs within their team. These groups can be called upon at any time  when learning the diagnosis  during treatment  during leaves  upon return to work  and in the years that follow.The program has since grown to a network of 27 partner teams with one team at each Sanofi site in France  with 150 members who share feedback and best practice. More than 350 employees have benefited (42% sick employees  30% caregivers  28% managers).The global program announced today echoes the original approach and makes Sanofi an ever more inclusive culture where everyday experiences matter for every employee worldwide. This wraps the program into a wider DE&I cultural transformation at Sanofi as the company drives Diversity  Equity  and Inclusion (DE&I) in and beyond the workplace.Global impact of cancer and workOf all chronic conditions  cancer had the highest prevalence of work loss. Research shows that the risk of losing a person's job in the EU increases 1.4 times after a cancer diagnosis1. According to an article published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute  cancer-related employment changes are experienced by more than 40% of cancer survivors who were employed at or after diagnosis in the US2.Worldwide  the number of people diagnosed with cancer who are of working age is significant. For example  around 45% of people diagnosed in the U.S. in 2020 were between 20–64 years old3. In France  around 160  000 of the 400 000 people newly diagnosed with cancer were of working age and in the UK  around 900 000 people of working age are living with cancer.In a recent Harris poll conducted last year in the U.S. by Cancer & Careers  35% said that in general  those with cancer face stigma in the workplace. Yet  that same study revealed 78% felt that people who have been diagnosed with cancer and receive support from their employer are more likely to thrive in the workplace.About Sanofi DE&I strategySanofi’s ambitious DE&I strategy was launched in June 2021 with set objectives toward 2025  built around three key pillars: building representative leadership  creating a work environment where employees can bring the best of their whole selves and engaging with the company’s diverse communities.Read more information on Sanofi’s DE&I strategy here .About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Although the Group's commercial achievement has been slowed by a market that is still structuring  it has signed its first significant contracts in industry  one of the most promising fields of application for green hydrogen  as evidenced by the large-scale innovative projects that McPhy has won. The fall in order intake is offset by a wider portfolio of opportunities  both of which can be largely explained by the coming of larger projects  implying longer lead times. Meeting this demand calls for major efforts: in innovation  to increase the power of equipment; in industrialization  to move to mass production and gain in competitiveness; as well as financial efforts  to support investment and expansion in programs that require substantial amount of capital. That is why we launched the construction of our Gigafactory  soon completed  and are now proceeding with the sale of our station business to a reference partner capable of realizing the full potential of this appealing industrial asset we have built up.”Revenue within expected rangeRevenue for the 2023 financial year amounts to €18.8 million  up +17% versus 2022  in line with the double-digit growth range given at the half-year results publication. Sales accelerated in the 2nd half  compared with the 1st half  driven mainly by the consumption of the backlog. The annual 2023 revenue for the continued electrolyzer business reaches €13.7 million  up +25%. Electrolyzer sales are divided between the supply of either large capacity McLyzer (74%) or from the Piel range (26%).Growth was fueled by major projects currently under execution  and the initial benefits of contracts signed in the industrial sector  such as the ""green metal"" project with the Plansee Group3 and the low-carbon steel production project with ArcelorMittal and VEO4. In addition  as part of its partnership with L&T  McPhy recorded the first revenues related to the initial acquisition price of its pressurized alkaline electrolysis technology. Regarding the station business in the process of sale  McPhy recorded stable revenue  linked to a slowdown in subsidized programs in the mobility sector.Update on current business and projectsIn € million 2023 2022 Change Firm Oder Intake 13.0 29 4 -56% Total Backlog5 23.8 30.6 -22% Backlog – Electrolyzers 20.1 22.2 -9%McPhy records a -56% drop in firm order intake  which amounts to €13.0 million. This noticeable decline  beyond the induced backlog consumption  is mainly due to the postponement of the major 20 MW Djewels project  for which the contract has been signed with HyCC during the second half of 2023  but the final investment decision has not yet been taken. As a result  and in line with its strict definition  McPhy was unable to book this contract as part of its firm order intake as initially anticipated  and the total backlog therefore stood at €23.8 million at December 31  2023  compared with €30.6 million at December 31  2022.However  McPhy has noted a significant increase in tenders for the supply of large-scale electrolyzers over the course of 2023. While this increase in project size has slowed implementation and final investment decisions in 2023  it gives McPhy a tender portfolio of 2.2 GW by 2030  a two-fold increase on last year.As an example  McPhy recently signed a major contract with the Oil & Gas division of the Berlin-based HMS GmbH Group  for the supply and commissioning between 2025 and 2027 of four McLyzer 3200-30  with a total capacity of 64 MW. With this contract  McPhy plans to start manufacturing the McLyzer 3200-30 at its newly constructed Gigafactory in Belfort with the design and engineering of very-high-capacity electrolysis systems. This contract has not been included in the firm order intake either  pending the final investment decision.The electrolyzer backlog  on which the Company will now focus its efforts  stands at €20.1 million  representing 84% of the total backlog.Termination of framework partnership with Technip Energies and continued collaboration on the Djewels projectFollowing a review of their respective business models  McPhy and Technip Energies have decided to cease their partnership by amicably terminating the Memorandum of Understanding signed when Technip Energies acquired a stake in the Company in 2020. The termination of this partnership will not affect the continued collaboration between McPhy and Technip Energies on the Djewels project.Continuing industrial scale-upWork on commissioning the future Gigafactory at the Belfort site is progressing according to plan  with the opening scheduled for the 2nd quarter of 2024  within budget. The opening of this site will enable McPhy to ramp up over time its production capacity to 1 GW per year.At the same time  McPhy has increased its production capacity to 300 MW (in two shifts) at its San Miniato site  enabling the production of stacks for the Djewels and HMS projects.During the 2023 financial year  McPhy continued to accelerate investments linked to the development of its business and to expand its teams up to 265 employees  with 72 new employees hired.Outlook and financial situationThe Group's cash position should be around €62 million at December 31  2023.McPhy has undertaken to strengthen its financial liquidity  with the implementation of the first steps in its financing plan. In addition to the potential proceeds from the sale of its station business and the establishment of an equity financing line with Vester Finance6  the Group is in the process of finalizing a lease financing for its Belfort Gigafactory with a banking pool  representing a financing of around €16 million.This will give McPhy the financial resources it needs to deliver another year of growth in 2024 on its future perimeter and establish itself as a key European manufacturer of electrolyzers for low-carbon hydrogen production.Next financial event:Publication of 2023 full-year results: March 7  2024  after market closeABOUT MCPHYSpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

The designation was granted based on results from the Phase II clinical trial  NIPU  evaluating UV1 in patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma  which were presented at the ESMO Congress 2023.“We are pleased that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for UV1 in two separate advanced indications  which underlines the potential of our cancer vaccine approach. UV1 demonstrated a positive safety profile and encouraging signs of improvement in overall survival in combination with the checkpoint inhibitors  ipilimumab  and nivolumab  in malignant mesothelioma  a hard-to-treat cancer indication with significant unmet need ” said Carlos de Sousa  CEO of Ultimovacs. “We expect to announce topline results from our randomized Phase II trial INITIUM in the coming month of March  and we are looking forward to reporting important data from our broad UV1 Phase II clinical trial program with UV1 over the course of 2024 and beyond.”As defined by the FDA  Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions with the goal of bringing important new drugs earlier to patients. The Fast Track designation enables Ultimovacs to have more frequent interactions with the FDA to discuss the UV1 development path for the treatment of mesothelioma. For more information on the Fast Track process  please visit the FDA’s official website.The impact of UV1 vaccination in patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma has been evaluated in a randomized Phase II clinical trial  NIPU. In the study  UV1 was combined with checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab and nivolumab and compared to ipilimumab and nivolumab alone as a second-line treatment  after first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The results from the study demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival for UV1 with no added toxicities. The NIPU study is sponsored by Oslo University Hospital with support from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ultimovacs.Mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive form of cancer with a high mortality rate and few therapeutic options. Patients with mesothelioma commonly have a history of occupational or environmental exposure to asbestos  and it typically takes decades for this specific form of cancer to develop.In October 2023   UV1 received Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of mesothelioma. In December 2021   the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for UV1 for the treatment of stage IIB-stage IV melanoma. In October 2021   the FDA granted Fast Track designation for UV1 as an add-on therapy to ipilimumab or pembrolizumab for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma.==ENDS==About NIPUNIPU ( N ivolumab and I pilimumab P lus/minus U V1 vaccination) is a randomized  multi-center phase II trial in which Ultimovacs’ universal cancer vaccine  UV1  is evaluated in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s checkpoint inhibitors  nivolumab and ipilimumab  as second-line treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. The trial sponsor is Oslo University Hospital  supported in the preparation and execution of the trial by Ultimovacs and Bristol-Myers Squibb. The 118 patients are randomized 1:1 into two treatment arms. All participants receive treatment with nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks) until disease progression  unacceptable toxicity  or for a maximum of 2 years. Patients randomized to the experimental arm received 8 intradermal injections of UV1 vaccine during the first three months of treatment. The objective of the study was to achieve a clinically meaningful progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) after progression on first-line standard platinum doublet chemotherapy. Subsequent events emerging in patients in both arms of the NIPU study will continue to be monitored beyond the read-out of the primary endpoint. The ipilimumab and nivolumab combination has been approved as first-line treatment for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma in Europe and the U.S.About MesotheliomaMesothelioma is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that occurs in the thin layer of tissue that surrounds the lungs and inside of the chest. Mesothelioma accounted for 30 870 new cancer cases and 26 278 cancer deaths worldwide in 2020  according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (Globocan 2020). Pleural mesothelioma is a disease with a high unmet medical need  especially in industrialized countries. The median overall survival is approximately 1 year. Occupational asbestos exposure is the No. 1 cause of the disease  and several occupations  like firefighters  military veterans  construction  and industry workers  are at risk. This cancer usually takes several decades to develop after a person’s first exposure to asbestos. Most patients are diagnosed after age 70 because of the long latency period. Even though the use of asbestos  to a large extent  is banned in many countries today  new incidences of mesothelioma will continue to be a medical and public health challenge because of the long latency period typical of the illness. For patients with inoperable disease  few treatment options are available after first-line chemotherapy. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab has recently shown increased survival compared to standard chemotherapy  but most patients do not respond  and improvements are called for. Telomerase is expressed in mesothelioma cells and is  therefore  a relevant target for therapeutic vaccination.About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines with broad applicability. Ultimovacs’ lead candidate  UV1  is an off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccine directed against human telomerase (hTERT)  an antigen present in 85-90% of cancers in all stages of tumor growth. A broad clinical program  with Phase II trials in five cancer indications enrolling more than 670 patients  aims to demonstrate UV1’s impact in combination with other immunotherapies in multiple cancer types expressing telomerase and where patients have unmet medical needs. UV1 is a patented technology owned by Ultimovacs.In addition  Ultimovacs holds all rights to the proprietary TET technology platform for any possible future use of formulations in various solid tumor indications. The Company is listed on the Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE: ULTI).About the UV1 Phase II programThe immunotherapeutic off-the-shelf cancer vaccine UV1 is investigated in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in patients with various cancer indications with diverse tumor biology. The diversity of the UV1 Phase II program places Ultimovacs in a favorable position to capture the cancer vaccine’s potential broad applicability when combined with checkpoint inhibitors:INITIUM : Evaluating UV1 in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab as first-line treatment for patients with malignant melanoma.

The investigator-initiated trial is led by Vestre Viken (Drammen Hospital) and supported by Ultimovacs.About UV1UV1 is an off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to induce a specific T cell response against telomerase. UV1 consists of long  synthetic peptides representing a sequence in the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase (hTERT)  shown to induce CD4+ T cells. These CD4+ T cells have the potential to provide inflammatory signals and T cell support believed to be critical for triggering a strong anti-tumor immune response. Following intradermal injection  antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin are exposed to the vaccine peptides. These APCs will process the peptides and present vaccine epitopes on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules to naïve T cells in the lymph nodes. Activated vaccine-specific T cells will then enter the circulation and search for cells displaying their cognate antigen in the context of HLA molecules.The UV1 peptides contain several epitopes  shown to be non-restrictive in terms of (HLA) alleles for presentation. It is therefore not required to perform HLA pre-screening of patients  which potentially enables broad population utilization of the vaccine. UV1 is administered over three months with eight intradermal injections and the immune-modulator GM-CSF.For further information  please see www.ultimovacs.com or contact:Carlos de Sousa  CEOEmail: carlos.desousa@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 908 92507Anne Worsøe  Head of IREmail: anne.worsoe@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 90686815This information is considered to be inside information pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 in the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.

This observation perfectly mirrors the results of Artprice by Artmarket's historical research and much of its work and publications over recent decades. Artprice's econometric and index tools are essential for building investment funds on the Art Market.Having confirmed our shared observations  we were not surprised to find that our projections for the future are also very similar.Invest in ArtOlivier Bourdelas: “In an unpredictable world where true value is hard to find  savers are increasingly looking for something meaningful to invest in. A long-term investment in art produces and supports cultural and educational values that are different from traditional investments. Investing in art is therefore not just an investment in a ‘tangible' asset  it is also a fun and ‘presentable' investment in our collective future.”Artprice: “Art is today widely considered as an alternative investment which not only offers high returns but also a low correlation to typical financial assets. Investing in works by the greatest artists (like Pablo Picasso  Claude Monet  or Georgia O'Keeffe for example) can therefore be both personally and financially enriching  as long as we pay attention to the specificities of the art market  and notably  the time it can take to sell a unique artwork”.Olivier Bourdelas: “Our love affair with Contemporary art began ten years ago. Since 2013  we have supported the French creative scene by acquiring one work per quarter. And we support several institutions such as the The Maison Européenne de la Photographie in Paris and the Franciscaines project in Dauville.At a personal level  I have been collecting works by artists of all origins for 20 years. But I also give money to the Centre Georges Pompidou and I am a board member for various cultural bodies such as the Maison Européenne de la Photographie and the Neuflize OBC Corporate Foundation  and my wife is a photographer.For the creation of FrenchArtFund  we set up a team of five highly qualified individuals  including two managers  an operations director  and a marketing and communications manager  with myself in support. We have recruited a truly top-notch team to give the fund every chance of success.Our two managers each have nearly twenty years of experience in the art market  have worked with the largest international auction houses  and enjoy excellent reputations. Sharing common values and extraordinary knowledge this team will be in charge over the long term by my side.We will mainly focus on artists from the Artprice Global Top 500 (in terms of annual auction turnover). These works will be mainly paintings produced by Post-War and Contemporary artists in a price range between €150 and €500 000.To minimize risk  we will concentrate our purchases on works created in the 20th and 21st centuries by renowned artists  represented by large international galleries  with solid track records in the secondary market via international auction houses.To maximize the value potential of our fund  we will also invest in emerging artists represented by galleries with strong influence and enjoying recurring museum news.We will avoid investing in works by young artists who are not yet popular in the secondary market and are not yet part of major institutional collections.All investments will be conducted after a thorough analysis involving detailed scrutiny of the auction results for comparable works by the artist and using a proprietary multi-criteria rating matrix  integrating around twenty parameters.The works will be kept in an ultra-secure and confidential storage location with one of the main players in the French art market.Once or twice a year  our customers and partners will have the opportunity to discover part of the collection in a friendly place where they will be invited with family and friends. On these occasions  a speaker  a museum director  or even an exhibition curator  will speak to explain the practice of an artist or even lead a debate or conference around an artistic movement for example. The field of possibilities is so wide in this area  that we will be spoiled for choice.Given the specificity of this asset class  we wish to establish a special relationship with subscribers to our fund. As part of our objective  we hope to establish an educational  initiatory approach with some of them  giving them access to information and events that they would never have attended without us.”Art as a safe havenOlivier Bourdelas sees art as “a safe haven during periods of crisis and inflation”. Artprice by Artmarket strongly endorses this approach which has been regularly spelled out in its communications and Annual Art Market Reports  such as the one published in 2023: “During the past 22 years  the art market has shown it is capable of making life-saving corrections to prevent its weakening in the face of financial  economic  public health and geopolitical crises.”A very large marketOlivier Bourdelas: “With 53 million millionaires and 2 153 billionaires in the world (up 53% over 5 years)  there has never been so much capital invested in the art market. Art  and especially Contemporary Art  allows you to differentiate yourself while diversifying your heritage.Since 2007  nearly 750 museums have been created each year around the world. In seventeen years  that's more than 10 000.”thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and President of Artmarket.com: “In 2017  during our conceptualized study of the global museum industry  we noted that more museums were created in the world between 2000 and 2014 than throughout the 20th century and that the 21st century would see the opening of 700 new art museums of an international character every year that will naturally legitimize and absorb artworks  which  in turn  by remaining in the museum collections will strengthen the art market.”Art Market PerformanceArtprice100© vs. S&P 500 vs. STOXX Europe 50 – Base 100 in January 2000[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2024/02/image1-Artprice100copyright-vs-SP500-vsSTOXX50-2000-2023.png ]Olivier Bourdelas  founder of FrenchArtFund  the first investment fund in Art regulated by the AMF  relies heavily on data from Artprice by Artmarket  and notably on the performance of the Artprice100© index launched five years ago on 02/02/2018. The Artprice100®'s mission is to observe and quantify the value accretion of the art market  focusing on its most stable segment. This new scientific index joins all the other decision-making tools developed by Artprice. The Artprice100® constitutes a new and essential benchmark for the world of finance which is looking for new investments in efficient markets.The creation of the Artprice100® index was a response to demand from Artprice's financial and banking clients  particularly in Private Banking  who wanted a reliable and long-lasting index.The AMF-regulated FrenchArtfund looks set to outpace its competitors (other art investment funds) on the Paris market.Investment strategyOlivier Bourdelas has told Artprice by Artmarket that this mixed Specialized Professional Art Fund will invest 60% in works of art created during the 20th and 21st centuries by artists who rank in the world's Top 500. It will also invest 30% in shares of listed international companies  rigorously selected and generating all or part of their turnover in art. This dual strategy will optimize the liquidity of the fund. To this will be added a maximum of 10% in bond UCITS and monetary investments.The data collected and produced by Artprice by Artmarket will play a vital role in the FrenchArtFund's investment strategy with  for example  price evolutions by art market segment from 1998 to 2022 based on our Contemporary Art Price Index vs. Artprice Global Index (Base 100 in January 1998).Lastly  Olivier Bourdelas has confirmed what was announced in the LES ECHOS article by Martine Robert and Anne-Sophie Vion  namely  that the FrenchArtFund will allocate part of its funds to the acquisition of shares in companies linked to art such as Artprice  LVMH  and Groupe Chargeurs.Olivier Bourdelas:“We thought a lot about all of this for four years and we have never detected any incompatibility with our historical businesses. Moreover  we have not encountered any particular difficulty linked to the rise since 2015 of our Private Management activity. It gradually became integrated into the company thanks to numerous synergies enriching the whole. It will be exactly the same with the “Art” activity  believe me!Furthermore  our five new recruits for this fund have all the skills required to carry out its mission successfully. Everyone will benefit from the implementation of this new activity.”Olivier Bourdelas is supported by KPMG and Oddo Bank.“If we experience great success – and we will do everything we can to ensure this – we might consider separating our activities and creating a structure completely dedicated to this art investment. Inocap Gestion would of course remain the reference shareholder  but we are not there yet.”thierry Ehrmann:“I congratulate Olivier Bourdelas for the creation of the FrenchArtFund  the first Art Investment fund regulated by the AMF. This launch corroborates in all respects our observations and predictions: the financialization of the art market  investment in art as an alternative investment and safe haven  and the interest of financial institutions. All this would not have been possible without the standardization of the art market and the production of reliable and long-term indices produced by Artprice by Artmarket since 1997  and which now provides value-added data & indices to FrenchArtFund.We will be closely monitoring the progress of FrenchArtFund with keen interest. Given the founder's extensive knowledge of the Art Market and their remarkable success in the world of finance through Inocap Gestion  which oversees €700 million in assets  the impressive launch only adds to our anticipation.The Parisian financial marketplace should welcome this intelligent initiative which confirms the rise of France in the global Art Market over recent years  becoming number 1 among European countries in 2023 with more than a billion dollars in turnover.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today announced that its subsidiary Beeline Kazakhstan has deployed Orman-AI - an artificial intelligence-based monitoring system to detect forest fires.Both naturally and due to climate change  Kazakhstan is prone to devastating blazes  that spread fast across vast areas  are impossible to stop once started and take the lives of both humans and animals every year. Orman-AI reports the outbreak of fires by automatically detecting the first signs of smoke and enables rapid action to stop the proliferation of forest fires. It combines Beeline’s towers as monitoring platforms  video surveillance systems with 360 degree computer vision  and Beeline’s mobile connectivity  uploading data real time into an AI analytics engine capable of detecting smoke appearances.The system works in weather from -50 to +50 degrees Celsius  which is especially important in the extreme continental climate of the country.In an era of rapid climate change  forest fires are an increasingly common problem and caused damage to 103 thousand hectares of land in Kazakhstan in 2022 alone  nearly 40% the land area of Luxembourg. If detected too late  they are hard to extinguish and pose a serious threat to rural communities.“Detection of fires through augmented intelligence is a pragmatic approach  and this could be extended to agricultural and other community applications ” comments Evgeniy Nastradin  the CEO of Beeline Kazakhstan. “This initiative shows Beeline and VEON's commitment to the country  using cutting edge technology to create solutions to real problems  including safeguarding the population against natural disasters ” he adds.Orman-AI has been launched through a partnership between Beeline Kazakhstan and the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Management of the Akimat of the Kostanay Region. During the first test period  some 34 cameras managed to generate alerts for 50 fires in the region. In the future  the system could also be deployed to assist farmers and improve agricultural yields by using AI to determine when crops require watering or fertilizer  and to keep track of livestock.Story continuesThis is yet another major AI-based solution from Beeline Kazakhstan. Last year  Beeline’s information technologies subsidiary QazCode launched BeeBert AI module  training AI in Kazakh language for customer experience applications.About VEONVEON is a digital operator that provides converged connectivity and digital services to nearly 160 million customers.
