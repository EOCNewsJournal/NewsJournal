It said yesterday that it has reached a provisional deal to try and end the bloc’s reliance on London for clearing Euro derivatives. Clearing makes sure a stock  bond  or derivatives trade is completed - even if one side of the transaction goes bust. The majority of clearing in interest rate swaps (IRS) in Euros is done by the London Stock Exchange Group  by US exchange operator ICE. Brussels however wants to bring the oversight to EU regulators where euro clearing for banks and asset managers in the bloc are concerned.Stay up-to-date with the latest Politics news Join us on WhatsApp Our community members are treated to special offers  promotions  and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More infoEven after Brexit  around 94 percent of Euro denominated swaps took place at London Clearing House (LCH)  according to figures from Clarus. The new agreement establishes an “active account requirement” for firms. This means banks must have an account with an EU-based clearing house to clear contracts. Vincent Van Peteghem  finance minister for current EU president Belgium  said: “This will bring more clearing services to Europe and enhance our strategic autonomy.” Several exchanges - including US Nasdaq  Deutsche Boerse and Swiss SIX Group's Madrid Exchange are already aiming to attract businesses away from London.London's financial district dominates the market for trade clearing“It will also contribute to stabilising the market and make sure it functions efficiently  which is a prerequisite for a fully-fledged capital markets union ” he added. But it has not been met with full consensus. Markus Ferber  a German centre-right member of the parliament  said the City of London actually won out from the agreement because the amount of “preconditions  exemptions and review clauses” meant it was just a “tiny step”. He said: “The big winner of last night's agreement is the City of London that benefits from the status quo. In particular  the French government has once again not taken a European perspective  but has done the bidding of large US investment banks.” Other critics have claimed the plans will raise costs for banks and asset managers  as they will have to establish multiple pools of liquidity.Become an Express Premium member Support fearless journalismSupport fearless journalism Read The Daily Express online  advert freeRead The Daily Express online  advert free Get super-fast page loading Start 30-dayFREE trial,negative,0.04,0.41,0.56,mixed,0.37,0.42,0.21,True,English,"['post-Brexit rule', 'EU', 'bid', 'London', 'grip', 'market', 'fledged capital markets union', 'large US investment banks', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'Swiss SIX Group', 'interest rate swaps', 'US exchange operator', 'latest Politics news', 'Vincent Van Peteghem', 'German centre-right member', 'Express Premium member', 'super-fast page loading', 'key financial mechanism', 'The Daily Express', 'Euro denominated swaps', 'current EU president', 'active account requirement', 'EU-based clearing house', 'Support fearless journalism', 'London Clearing House', 'stock, bond', 'US Nasdaq', 'Madrid Exchange', 'The EU', 'financial district', 'Euro derivatives', 'euro clearing', 'EU regulators', 'significant influence', 'provisional deal', 'derivatives trade', 'one side', 'asset managers', 'community members', 'special offers', 'More info', 'finance minister', 'clearing services', 'strategic autonomy', 'Several exchanges', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'trade clearing', 'full consensus', 'Markus Ferber', 'review clauses', 'tiny step', 'big winner', 'last night', 'status quo', 'French government', 'European perspective', 'Other critics', 'multiple pools', 'FREE trial', 'post-Brexit London', 'new agreement', 'bloc', 'control', 'reliance', 'transaction', 'majority', 'IRS', 'Euros', 'Brussels', 'oversight', 'WhatsApp', 'promotions', 'adverts', 'partners', 'time', '94 percent', 'place', 'LCH', 'figures', 'Clarus', 'firms', 'contracts', 'Belgium', 'businesses', 'prerequisite', 'parliament', 'City', 'amount', 'preconditions', 'exemptions', 'bidding', 'plans', 'costs', 'liquidity', '30-day']",2024-02-08,2024-02-08,express.co.uk

These results were confirmed by a post-hoc analysis of brain imaging at 0 and 24 hours using artificial intelligence (Brainomix  UK). This independent analysis confirmed the reduction in the number and volume of intracerebral lesions in patients treated with glenzocimab.The efficacy of glenzocimab is now being analyzed in an international Phase 2/3 study  ACTISAVE  with clinical results expected in Q2 2024.In July 2022  Acticor Biotech was granted ""PRIME"" status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for glenzocimab in the treatment of stroke. This designation will allow the company to strengthen its interactions and obtain early dialogues with regulatory authorities.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Mediolanum farmaceutici  Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Anaxago  and the Armesa foundation).

It aims at accelerating Worldline's transformation in response to changes in macroeconomic environment and payment industry trends  in order to support the Group’s structural mid-term profitable growth profile.Power24 builds upon the ongoing transformation initiatives  while finalising the integration efforts following the Group’s transformative acquisition cycle. It also includes an upgrade of Worldline's operational model to capture further achievable benefits through a better organisation and new transformation levers.This planned transformation is expected to deliver c. €200 million run-rate cash costs savings from 2025. The overall implementation costs should be c. €250 million.It relies on four main pillars: product transformation  technology optimisation  organisational simplicity and streamlined sourcing.Contemplated changes in all these areas would turn Worldline into a more client-centric company  improve employee working methods and collaboration  enhance the Group's operational efficiency and position the Group for stronger future growth and margin improvement.In the context of Power24 launch  and as this programme would lead to a reduction of Worldline global workforce of approximately 8% maximum  Worldline confirms that it has initiated social processes with the relevant employee representative bodies within the Worldline group.Power 24: a tailor-made post-integration transformationPower24  announced in October 2023 is the acceleration of Worldline’s existing post-integration transformation ambition. It has been carefully designed and calibrated to enhance operational efficiency and is based on four main pillars:Transformation in product and platform development to reinforce Worldline as a product-driven organisation. This would include widespread adoption of more agile working methods as well as the completion of standardisation and simplification of our platforms to improve time-to-market and generate productivity gains.Modernization and technological development initiatives (e.g.  automation of key processes) to support the Group's innovations.Simplification of the organisation to address unnecessary complexity from our business so that the Group’s managers would increase their supervisory responsibilities and Worldline’s teams would be more empowered and have greater end-to-end accountability for the solutions they deliver.Sourcing cost reduction initiatives based on optimization of procurement contracts and better leverage our Global competence centres in India  Poland and Romania.A response to enhance operational efficiency and reinforce the company’s structural competitivenessWorldline is one of the global leaders in digital payments with strong positions in major pan European markets  cutting-edge technologies and prominent retailer and bank customers.As a leader  Worldline needs to constantly adapt to industry and environment trends. The payment industry moves extremely rapidly with fast-paced technological innovation in the product space coupled with a macro-environment slowdown that led to rapid changes in consumers’ behaviours across Europe.This context has resulted in a slow-down in spending volumes and a reallocation of spending towards products and services generating lower margins for Worldline. In response to this evolving environment  Worldline had already initiated a series of transformation efforts to strengthen its position and market competitiveness on all businesses:Uncovering the full synergies and economies of scale induced by the acquisition of Ingenico.Bringing together technology production activities with business functions to enhance collaboration and end-to-end project management.Building strong internal Global Competence Centres with solid offshoring capabilities.Next stepsWorldline intends to give priority to the social dialogue and has launched social processes with relevant employee representative bodies in the Group on Power24 and its potential impacts that could result in the reduction of the global workforce of approximately 8% maximum  while underlying its wish to allow voluntary departures wherever possible  in accordance with local regulations. The timetable and details of such contemplated plan will be discussed with the employee representative bodies in the coming weeks.FORTHCOMING EVENTSFebruary 28  2024 FY 2023 resultsINVESTOR RELATIONSLaurent MarieE laurent.marie@worldline.comGuillaume DelaunayE guillaume.delaunay@worldline.comCOMMUNICATIONSandrine van der GhinstE sandrine.vanderghinst@worldline.comHélène CarlanderE helene.carlander@worldline.comABOUT WORLDLINEWorldline [Euronext: WLN] helps businesses of all shapes and sizes to accelerate their growth journey – quickly  simply  and securely.

This reflects a 12% decline at constant exchange rates and perimeter3 and a negative currency impact of 1%.Pierre Barnabé  Soitec’s CEO  commented: “After the very strong sequential rebound achieved in the second quarter  we maintained our third-quarter revenue at a similar level  in line with our expectations. As we indicated during our last communication  the correction of RF-SOI inventories by our customers continues to weigh on revenue  offsetting the continued strong performance of FD-SOI  POI and Power-SOI  strong growth in Automotive & Industrial  and a solid level of revenue in Smart Devices.We anticipate to continue to face challenging market dynamics on RF-SOI for another couple of quarters. While confirming that we expect a solid Q4’24  we are adjusting our revenue guidance for the full-year  with an organic decline of around 10% year-on-year and an EBITDA margin forecast of around 34%. Expansion into new products remains a key pillar of our strategy  and we are very satisfied with the successes we have achieved.In Mobile Communications  FD-SOI penetration continues to progress  with the latest flagship smartphones embedding increasingly more content. POI activity accelerates  with two new customers in production in the quarter and more than ten in the qualification phase.On SmartSiCTM  our roadmap is on track on all aspects: technology  industrial  supply and commercial. We have secured a second customer  with production scheduled to start in the second part of calendar year 2024.The ongoing deployment of our strong megatrends across our three strategic end markets and our expanding product portfolio support our sustainable growth story. We now expect our $2.1bn revenue outlook to be postponed by around a year.”Third quarter FY’24 consolidated revenue (unaudited)Q3’24 Q3’23 Q3’24/Q3’23 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile communications 130 170 -23% -23% Automotive & Industrial 44 37 +20% +21% Smart devices 65 67 -4% -3% Total revenue 240 274 -13% -12%After the sharp 56% sequential growth excluding currency impact achieved in the second quarter of FY’24 (compared to the first quarter of FY’24)  third quarter revenue was almost flat compared to the second quarter of FY’24  at 240 million Euros.On a year-on-year basis  third quarter revenue recorded a 12% decline at constant exchange rates and perimeter against the third quarter of FY’23. This decrease reflects a negative mix effect as well as an unfavorable volume impact  which came as a result of mixed performances across Soitec’s three end markets: in particular  volumes were lower in Mobile communications but higher in Automotive & Industrial.Mobile communicationsIn the third quarter of FY’24  Mobile Communications revenue reached 130 million Euros  down 23% at constant exchange rates compared to the third quarter of FY’23.Despite some early signs of recovery in the global smartphone market and a growing penetration of high-end smartphones  inventory adjustments across the supply chain continued to weigh on RF-SOI revenue in the third quarter of FY’24  as evidenced by lower volumes compared to the third quarter of FY'23.This year-on-year decrease in RF-SOI sales was  however  partly offset by:significantly higher sales of FD-SOI   designed to equip front end modules integrated in both 5G Sub-6 GHz and 5G mmWave smartphones   designed to equip front end modules integrated in both 5G Sub-6 GHz and 5G mmWave smartphones  strong growth in POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) sales  which benefited from higher volumes from both existing and new customers using Soitec’s POI technology for RF filters in 5G smartphones.Automotive & IndustrialAutomotive & Industrial revenue reached 44 million Euros in the third quarter of FY’24  a 21% year-on-year growth at constant exchange rates compared to the third quarter of FY’23.Soitec continues to leverage strong demand for Automotive  powered by increasing semiconductor content embedded in the latest generations of vehicles to enable more digitization - autonomous and assisted driving  functional safety  infotainment - and electrification with growing penetration of electric vehicles.As this has been the case for several quarters  third-quarter Power-SOI sales showed significant year-on-year growth  essentially driven by higher volumes. Power-SOI address growing demand for infotainment  functional safety and Battery Management Systems.FD-SOI sales continue to benefit from adoption for automotive microcontrollers.Contribution from revenue generated by Soitec’s SmartSiCTM technology dedicated to the future generations of electric vehicles has further increased compared with the first half of FY’24. Inaugurated last September  Soitec’s new plant dedicated to SmartSiC™ substrates is expected to ramp-up in FY’25.Smart DevicesSmart Devices revenue reached 65 million Euros in the third quarter of FY’24  representing a sharp sequential rebound against the second quarter of FY’24  and a 3% decline at constant exchange rates compared to the third quarter of FY’23  with contrasted performance among the different products.Sales of FD-SOI continue to be supported by structurally growing demand for Edge Computing devices across consumer and industrial sectors. Revenue reached a much higher level than in the first two quarters of FY’24.After low sales in the first two quarters of FY’24  sales of Imager-SOI for 3D imaging applications  recorded a strong rebound in the third quarter of FY’24 and were much higher than in the third quarter of FY’23.Conversely  in the third quarter of FY’24  sales of Photonics-SOI were lower than in the third quarter of FY’23  impacted by a more challenging data center environment in 2023.First nine months FY’24 consolidated revenue (unaudited)9m’24 9m’23 9m’24/9m’23 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile communications 388 510 -24% -24% Automotive & Industrial 119 94 +27% +27% Smart devices 133 140 -5% -5% Total revenue 641 745 -14% -14%Overall  consolidated revenue reached 641 million Euros in the first nine months of FY’24  down 14% both on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to 745 million Euros in the first nine months of FY’23. The general trends recorded in each of the three end markets were pretty similar to the performance achieved in the third quarter of FY’24  with a decrease in Mobile communications  strong growth in Automotive & Industrial and almost stable revenue in Smart devices.FY’24 outlookFY’24 revenue guidance is revised: revenue is expected to be down around 10% year-on-year at constant exchange rates and perimeter as opposed to a mid-single digit decrease previously expected  and EBITDA4 margin5 at around 34% as opposed to around 35%.FY’26 financial modelGoing forward  Soitec continues to see significant growth across its three end markets  where the Group is strengthening its leadership in SOI and successfully executing on its expansion into compound semiconductors.In the current challenging environment  the RF-SOI inventory correction across the value chain is longer than expected. In this context  while the ambition of a $2.1bn revenue previously expected in FY’26 is still valid  the time horizon will be postponed by around one year.The Group continues to leverage powerful megatrends across its three strategic end markets to address a growing number of customers with its expanding product portfolio. The rebound in RF-SOI  the increasing penetration of other SOI products (FD-SOI  Power-SOI and Photonics-SOI)  and the successful expansion into Compound engineered substrates (POI  SmartSiCTM  and GaN) support its sustainable growth story.Soitec will provide more information during the disclosure of its FY24 results on May 22nd  2024.Post closing eventsSoitec presents its vision of the role of engineered substrates as AI enablersIn January 2024  Soitec released an in-depth presentation entitled “Enabling Artificial Intelligence with engineered substrates”. This document highlights AI fundamentals  reviews AI adoption across Soitec end markets and describes the role of Soitec’s engineered substrates as enablers of AI adoption. The presentation is available on Soitec website: click hereSoitec introduces new water reuse process  first of its kind in EuropeOn January 15th  2024  Soitec announced the launch of a new industrial installation allowing substrate rinse water to be partially reused in the production of ultra-pure water for cleanrooms at its French manufacturing facilities  an important milestone in its continuous improvement of resource management. Thanks to this innovation  the first of its kind in Europe at this scale  Soitec intends to significantly increase the proportion of water that can be reused in its industrial processes. The wastewater reuse rate at its historic site in Bernin (Isère) is thereby expected to rise from 19% in 2023 to over 35% in 2024.At the same time  Soitec continues to reduce its water consumption. The 30% reduction per unit produced achieved between 2021 and 2023 will be complemented by a further 30% reduction by 2030.Signature of IPCEI 2 grant contractOn January 26  Soitec signed a contract regarding financial support from 2022 to 2026 from the French State through the France 2030 program. This project has been validated by the European Commission as part of the Important Project of Common European Interest Microelectronics and Connectivity (IPCEI ME/TC) 2026. In line with the objectives set out in the European Chips Act Communication  the measure will strengthen Europe’s security of supply and sovereignty in semiconductor technologies.This funding will mainly be used to support Research & Development and will contribute to the ramp-up of the Bernin 4 (SmartSiC™) and Bernin 3 (POI) factories.# # #Analysts conference call to be held in English on Thursday 8th February at 8:00 am CET.To listen this conference call  the audiocast is available live and in replay at the following address: https://channel.royalcast.com/soitec/#!/soitec/20240208_1# # #AgendaQ4’24 revenue and FY’24 results are due to be published on May 22nd  2024  after market close.# # #DisclaimerThis document is provided by Soitec (the “Company”) for information purposes only.The Company’s business operations and financial position are described in the Company’s 2022-2023 Universal Registration Document (which notably includes the 2022-2023 Annual Financial Report) which was filed on June 14th  2023 with the French stock market authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers  or AMF) under number D.23-0482  as well as in the Company’s 2023-2024 half-year report released on November 15th  2023.

The Company's strong sales growth ahead of the beauty market  profit growth  and operating and EBITDA margin expansion in Q2 marked the 14th consecutive quarter of results in-line to ahead of expectations.Coty's strong Q2 sales growth of 13% as reported and 11% LFL  with first half reported sales growth of 16% and LFL growth of 14%  exceeded guidance of +11-13% LFL for the first half. These strong first half results once again reflected the Company's focus on balanced growth  with strong LFL growth in both Prestige and Consumer Beauty; robust LFL growth across Americas  EMEA and APAC; and LFL expansion in each of its core categories of fragrances  cosmetics and skincare. At the same time  Coty delivered a healthy growth mix with low-single-digit percentage volume growth  estimated high-single-digit percentage pricing contribution  and estimated low-single-digit percentage benefit from mix and other.Prestige revenue growth remained robust  expanding 17% as reported and 15% LFL in Q2  and 20% as reported and 18% LFL in the first half. Even when taking into account several points of benefit year-on-year from the fragrance service level recovery  Coty's low teens percentage sell-out growth in Prestige exceeded the underlying market  which grew closer to 10%. Burberry Goddess continued to set new records  becoming the #1 fragrance launch in multiple markets  and together with Burberry's other hero icons  Hero and Her  propelled strong market share gains and brand rank improvements globally for Burberry. The continued momentum in the prestige fragrance market and Coty's strong execution fueled double-digit percentage LFL revenue growth in the Company's leading prestige fragrance brands  including Hugo Boss  Calvin Klein  Gucci  Chloé  Marc Jacobs and Davidoff in the first half of FY24. As a result of strong consumer demand  retailers exited the holidays with healthy inventory levels. In Q2  Coty also saw double-digit percentage LFL revenue expansion in prestige cosmetics  with strong momentum in Kylie  Burberry and Gucci. And  in prestige skincare  focus brands Lancaster and philosophy continued their positive momentum since the spring CY23 relaunch.Coty's Consumer Beauty Q2 revenues grew by 7% as reported and 5% LFL  growing in-line with the global mass beauty market. For the first half  Consumer Beauty revenues grew 8% as reported and 7% LFL. During the quarter  the Company saw strength in its color cosmetics  mass fragrances  and mass skin & bodycare sales. The company continued to lean into its social media strategy  leading to improvements in earned media value and propelling viral CY23 Consumer Beauty launches such as CoverGirl Yummy Gloss and Rimmel Thrill Seeker mascara.E-commerce was a stand-out growth driver in first half FY24  with over 20% e-commerce revenue growth for both Prestige and Consumer Beauty  resulting in e-commerce penetration in the low 20s percentage. This represents a strong penetration increase of approximately 180 basis points compared to last year. During the quarter  Coty gained e-commerce market share in both Prestige and Consumer Beauty  fueled by strong improvements in e-commerce fundamentals and service levels  social media activations  and close collaboration with e-retail partners.Geographically  all regions generated double-digit percentage LFL revenue growth in the quarter and year-to-date. EMEA sales expanded 16% as reported and 10% LFL in Q2  driven by double-digit percentage growth across most markets and Travel Retail. Americas sales rose 10% as reported and 11% LFL in Q2  driven by strong momentum across most markets and Travel Retail. Asia Pacific sales grew 15% as reported and 16% LFL in Q2  with strength in most Asian countries and Travel Retail.The strong Q2 sales momentum fueled significant operating and EBITDA growth and margin expansion. While gross margins declined as anticipated  Coty's Q2 reported operating income of $236.7 million grew 19% year-over-year and adjusted operating income of $309.3 million grew 18% year-over-year  resulting in 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion to 17.9%. Adjusted EBITDA of $366.4 million grew 15%  with the adjusted EBITDA margin up 40 basis points to 21.2%.During Q2  Coty's free cash flow totaled $363.0 million. The combination of the company's solid 1H24 free cash flow of approximately $487.0 million and proceeds of approximately $340 million from the share issuance as part of its Paris dual listing drove a reduction in Financial Net Debt of over $700 million from the end of FY23 to $3.3 billion exiting CY23  and a financial leverage ratio of approximately 3.1x. The value of Coty's retained 25.9% Wella stake increased moderately to $1.08 billion at quarter-end  supporting Coty's Economic Net Debt at approximately $2.2 billion.Coty also continued to progress its sustainability agenda. During the quarter  the Company published its FY23 Sustainability Report  which included key milestones  such as exceeding goals set for 2030 on emissions from its own operations1  energy reduction and recycling rate. At the same time  Coty has committed to setting emissions reduction targets in-line with the science based net zero framework. On the social side  Coty expanded its gender-neutral parental leave policy  established in 2022. The company set a global minimum of 14 fully paid weeks for all employees  regardless of gender or location.Commenting on the operating results  Sue Nabi  Coty's CEO  said:""The strength of our Q2 and first half results reinforce several of our convictions  including the attractiveness of the beauty market  the continuing momentum of the fragrance index  the power of our brands  Coty's transformed and industry-leading capabilities  our new ability to create blockbuster fragrance launches  and our disciplined financial execution.First  the momentum of the global beauty market in the midst of geopolitical and macroeconomic disruptions confirms that consumers continue to gravitate to and prioritize beauty as a fundamental pillar of their well-being. Worldwide  consumers continue to purchase fragrances  cosmetics  skin and body care both as affordable luxuries and forms of self-expression. This is particularly true for mid to higher income consumers  resulting in the continued outperformance of luxury beauty. And they continue to engage with beauty both in-store and online  emphasizing the key role both channels play in the consumer journey.Our amazing brands and industry-leading capabilities are enabling Coty to bring exceptional innovations to the market  further strengthening consumers' desire for beauty. While we had expected Burberry Goddess to be a major blockbuster  the launch results are exceeding all our expectations and setting new records  fueled by a winning juice and disruptive market activations across all touchpoints. Burberry Goddess is the biggest launch in Coty's history  becoming the #1 fragrance launch in many markets and resonating with consumers across all regions.Importantly  strong momentum across our other key fragrance launches including Boss Bottled Elixir  Gucci Flora Gorgeous Magnolia  and additions to the Chloé Atelier des Fleurs collection  drove each of our Top 7 fragrance brands to grow at a double-digit percentage in the first half FY24.We are seeing outstanding results in our cosmetics innovations as well  including CoverGirl Yummy Gloss and Rimmel Thrill Seeker mascara  which supported solid revenue growth in our Consumer Beauty business  in-line with the underlying mass beauty market. And we are starting Q3 on strong footing  as our disruptive innovation  CoverGirl Simply Ageless Essence foundation  activated by a large and multi-tier influencer campaign  is already seeing great momentum in the first month of the launch including being named the #1 makeup release on Amazon.All together  we are continuing to deliver on our balanced growth agenda  with LFL growth in both Prestige and Consumer Beauty  in each of our regions  in each of our categories of fragrances  cosmetics  skincare and bodycare  and across volumes  price and mix. As a result  we are once again outperforming the beauty market.Importantly  this growth is accompanied by strong and disciplined financial delivery  as we generate robust profit growth  operating and EBITDA margin expansion  and deleveraging progress. Our All In To Win Savings program has been a key driver of our financial and operational improvement in the last few years  having delivered over $660 million of savings life-to-date  which have gone to fuel both the reinvestment in our growth engines and our profit delivery. With the transformation now largely complete and as we enter the next phase of our sustainable growth agenda  our Chief Transformation Officer  Gordon von Bretten  will be joining Coty’s controlling shareholder  JAB  as partner and will also be joining Coty's Board of Directors. We are extremely grateful to Gordon for his leadership in driving this extremely successful transformation over the last 4 years.Coty's leadership team is further strengthened by this week's announcement that Jean Holtzmann has been promoted to Chief Brands Officer  Prestige. Jean has been with Coty for seven years and has been instrumental in driving the momentum we are seeing in Hugo Boss as well as our ultra-premium fragrance collections. He is the right leader to drive the next phase of growth in our Prestige business.As we continue to advance our six pillar strategy  we are further strengthening our portfolio. We are excited to further enhance our Prestige fragrance portfolio through our new license agreement with Marni  an Italian brand renowned for its artistic collections and strong brand appeal with young consumers across Asia and Europe. And in the past week  we've announced long term extensions of two of our key Consumer Beauty licenses  bruno banani and Mexx  as we continue to expand these leading European lifestyle fragrance brands.In sum  as we celebrate the 120th anniversary of Coty as a beauty pioneer  we are proud of the progress we have made and are energized by the many opportunities in front of us.""1 For Scope 1 and 2 emissions *Adjusted financial metrics used in this release are non-GAAP. See reconciliations of GAAP results to Adjusted results in the accompanying tables.Highlights2Q24 net revenues increased 13% as reported and 11% LFL  driven by double-digit percentage LFL growth in Prestige and mid-single-digit percentage LFL growth in Consumer Beauty. Year-to-date net revenues increased 16% as reported and 14% LFL  supported by double-digit percentage growth in Prestige and high-single-digit percentage growth in Consumer Beauty.2Q24 reported operating income grew 19% to $236.7 million and year-to-date reported operated income totaled $434.2 million.2Q24 adjusted operating income increased 18% to $309.3 million  with an adjusted operating margin of 17.9% reflecting 70 basis points of margin expansion. Year-to-date adjusted operating income increased 20% to $611.5 million  with an adjusted operating margin of 18.2%  reflecting 70 basis points of margin expansion.2Q24 adjusted EBITDA grew 15% to $366.4 million  with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.2%  and year-to-date adjusted EBITDA grew 16% to $726.7 million  driving a year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.6%  up 10 basis points year-over-year.2Q24 reported EPS was $0.20 and year-to-date reported EPS was $0.20.2Q24 adjusted EPS totaled $0.25  which includes a non-operating EPS benefit of $0.06 from the mark-to-market on the equity swap due to the stock price increase in the second quarter. The year-to-date adjusted EPS of $0.34 did not have a net contribution from the equity swap mark-to-market.Savings totaled approximately $30 million in Q2 and approximately $65 million year-to-date. Coty now expects savings of $110-120 million in FY24  an increase from its previous target of over $100 million in FY24  with the additional savings fueling reinvestment in structural growth capabilities and teams  particularly digital and skincare.2Q24 free cash flow totaled $363.0 million bringing the year-to-date total to $487.0 million.Financial Net Debt was $3.3 billion and Economic Net Debt totaled $2.2 billion at quarter end  resulting in financial leverage of approximately 3.1x  with Coty meeting its target to end CY23 with leverage of approximately 3x.During Q2 Coty entered a third tranche of equity swap agreements with several banks to hedge a targeted share buyback program of approximately 25 million shares in FY26. The Company remains on track to execute the first tranche of its previously announced equity swap agreement by the end of February 2024  resulting in a share count reduction of 27 million at a cash cost of about $200 million  equating to an effective weighted average price of approximately $7.40 per share.OutlookEntering the second half of FY24  the beauty market remains a strong and outperforming category  even as the exceptional double-digit percentage growth of the past two years normalizes closer to medium term trends including mid-to-high single-digit percentage growth in prestige fragrances and low-to-mid single-digit percentage growth in mass beauty  consistent with Coty's medium term expectations. Coty continues to benefit from this attractive market dynamic  with momentum across its core categories  strong launch results  and early wins in key white spaces. The Company continues to expect FY24 LFL revenue growth of +9-11%  which includes expectations for +6-8% LFL revenue growth in second half FY24  consistent with its medium term growth algorithm  despite facing an estimated low-to-mid single-digit percentage headwind in its Prestige business from retailer inventory restocking which occurred in the prior year as Coty's fragrance service levels recovered. Reported revenues in the second half are expected to include a 1-2% headwind from FX and an approximately 2% scope headwind from the divestiture of the Lacoste license.Coty continues to target FY24 adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 10 to 30 basis points and FY24 adjusted EBITDA of $1 080 to $1 090 million based on current FX rates. Coty expects strong year-over-year gross margin expansion in the second half  even as the Company manages the moderate impact from the Red Sea conflict. In total  the Company continues to expect modest FY24 gross margin expansion year-over-year. Coty continues to target FY24 adjusted EPS  excluding the equity swap  of $0.44 to $0.47  implying strong +16-25% year-over-year growth.Having reached its leverage target of approximately 3x exiting CY23  Coty remains fully on track to reach its targeted leverage of approximately 2.5x exiting CY24 and approximately 2x exiting CY25  driven by its free cash flow generation and EBITDA expansion. Coty continues to target the divestiture of its Wella stake by end of CY25.Financial Results*Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release; reconciliations from reported to adjusted results can be found at the end of this release.Revenues:2Q24 reported net revenues of $1 727.6 million increased 13% year-over-year  including a positive foreign exchange (FX) impact of 3%.

means  unless the context otherwise indicates  “including without limitation”. More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company’s business and financial results is included under the heading “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30  2022 and other periodic reports the Company has filed and may file with the SEC from time to time.All forward-looking statements made in this release are qualified by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this release  and the Company does not undertake any obligation  other than as may be required by applicable law  to update or revise any forward-looking or cautionary statements to reflect changes in assumptions  the occurrence of events  unanticipated or otherwise  or changes in future operating results over time or otherwise.Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance unless expressed as such  and should only be viewed as historical data.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company operates on a global basis  with the majority of net revenues generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect results of operations. Therefore  to supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP  certain financial information is presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how the underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations (“constant currency”). Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period  with the current period’s results calculated at the prior-year period’s rates. The Company calculates constant currency information by translating current and prior-period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company discloses the following constant currency financial measures: net revenues  organic like-for-like (LFL) net revenues  adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income.The Company presents period-over-period comparisons of net revenues on a constant currency basis as well as on an organic (LFL) basis. The Company believes that organic (LFL) better enables management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's net revenues performance from period to period. For the periods described in this release  the term “like-for-like” describes the Company's core operating performance  excluding the financial impact of (i) acquired brands or businesses in the current year period until we have twelve months of comparable financial results  (ii) the divested brands or businesses or early terminated brands  generally  in the prior year non-comparable periods  to maintain comparable financial results with the current fiscal year period and (iii) foreign currency exchange translations to the extent applicable. For a reconciliation of organic (LFL) period-over-period  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Revenues to Like-For-Like Net Revenues”.The Company presents operating income  operating income margin  gross profit  gross margin  effective tax rate  net income  net income margin  net revenues  EBITDA  and EPS (diluted) on a non-GAAP basis and specifies that these measures are non-GAAP by using the term “adjusted” (collectively the Adjusted Performance Measures). The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in tables below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for or superior to  financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Moreover  these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies  including companies in the beauty industry  may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do  limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.Adjusted operating income/Adjusted EBITDA from Coty Inc. excludes restructuring costs and business structure realignment programs  amortization  acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts  stock-based compensation  and asset impairment charges and other adjustments as described below. For adjusted EBITDA  in addition to the preceding  we exclude the adjusted depreciation as defined below. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size  nature and significance. They are primarily incurred to realign our operating structure and integrate new acquisitions  and exclude divestitures  and fluctuate based on specific facts and circumstances. Additionally  Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. and Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share are adjusted for certain interest and other (income) expense and deemed preferred stock dividends  as described below  and the related tax effects of each of the items used to derive Adjusted net income as such charges are not used by our management in assessing our operating performance period-to-period.Adjusted Performance Measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:Costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities: The Company has excluded acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and the accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction. Additionally  for divestitures  the Company excludes write-offs of assets that are no longer recoverable and contract related costs due to the divestiture. The nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and divestitures  and the maturities of the businesses being acquired or divested. Also  the size  complexity and/or volume of past transactions  which often drives the magnitude of such expenses  may not be indicative of the size  complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions or divestitures.Restructuring and other business realignment costs: The Company has excluded the costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition  the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from the non-GAAP financial measures  management is able to further evaluate the Company's ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore  our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of operating performance.Asset impairment charges: The Company has excluded the impact of asset impairments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Amortization expense: The Company has excluded the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets  as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Although we exclude amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses  our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.Gain on sale and early license termination: We have excluded the impact of gain on sale and early license termination as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the size of the sale and early license termination.Costs related to market exit: We have excluded the impact of direct incremental costs related to our decision to wind down our business operations in Russia. We believe that these direct and incremental costs are inconsistent and infrequent in nature. Consequently  our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Gains on sale of real estate: The Company has excluded the impact of Gains on sale of real estate as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the size of the sale. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Stock-based compensation: Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees  we have excluded the effect of these expenses from the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA. This is due to their primarily non-cash nature; in addition  the amount and timing of these expenses may be highly variable and unpredictable  which may negatively affect comparability between periods.Depreciation and Adjusted depreciation: Our adjusted operating income excludes the impact of accelerated depreciation for certain restructuring projects that affect the expected useful lives of Property  Plant and Equipment  as such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. Further  we have excluded adjusted depreciation  which represents depreciation expense net of accelerated depreciation charges  from our adjusted EBITDA. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Other (income) expense: We have excluded the impact of pension curtailment (gains) and losses and pension settlements as such events are triggered by our restructuring and other business realignment activities and the amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. Further  we have excluded the change in fair value of the investment in Wella  as well as expenses related to potential or actual sales transactions reducing equity investments  as our management believes these unrealized (gains) and losses do not reflect our underlying ongoing business  and the adjustment of such impact helps investors and others compare and analyze performance from period to period. We have excluded the gain on the exchange of Series B Preferred Stock. Such transactions do not reflect our operating results and we have excluded the impact as our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Noncontrolling interest: This adjustment represents the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests based on the relevant noncontrolling interest percentage.Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from Adjusted net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred. Additionally  adjustments are made for the tax impact of any intra-entity transfer of assets and liabilities.Deemed Preferred Stock Dividends: The Company has excluded preferred stock deemed dividends related to the First Exchange and the Second Exchange from our calculation of adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. These deemed dividends are non-monetary in nature  the transactions were entered into to simplify our capital structure and do not reflect our underlying ongoing business. Management believes that this adjustment helps investors and others compare and analyze our performance from period to period.The Company has provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measures and the financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of adjusted gross profit to gross profit  adjusted EPS (diluted) to EPS (diluted)  and adjusted net revenues to net revenues  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported to Adjusted Results for the Consolidated Statements of Operations.” For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to operating income and adjusted operating income margin to operating income margin  see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income (Loss) to Adjusted Operating Income” and ""Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income (Loss) to Adjusted Operating Income by Segment."" For a reconciliation of adjusted effective tax rate to effective tax rate  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates to Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes and Adjusted Effective Tax Rates.” For a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income margin to net income (loss)  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income.”The Company also presents free cash flow  adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization (""adjusted EBITDA"")  immediate liquidity  Financial Net Debt and Economic Net Debt. Management believes that these measures are useful for investors because it provides them with an important perspective on the cash available for debt repayment and other strategic measures and provides them with the same measures that management uses as the basis for making resource allocation decisions. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures; adjusted EBITDA is defined as adjusted operating income  excluding adjusted depreciation and non-cash stock-based compensation. Net debt or Financial Net Debt (which the Company referred to as ""net debt"" in prior reporting periods) is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents  and Economic Net Debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents less the value of the Wella Stake. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow ” for adjusted EBITDA  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income to Adjusted EBITDA” and for Financial Net Debt and Economic Net Debt  see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Total Debt to Financial Net Debt and Economic Net Debt.” Further  our immediate liquidity is defined as the sum of available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (please see table ""Immediate Liquidity"").These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.To the extent that the Company provides guidance  it does so only on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation  including adjustments that could be made for restructuring  integration and acquisition-related expenses  amortization expenses  non-cash stock-based compensation  adjustments to inventory  and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers  the amount of which  based on historical experience  could be significant.- Tables Follow -COTY INC.SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULES INCLUDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESRESULTS AT A GLANCEThree Months Ended December 31  2023 Six Months Ended December 31  2023 (in millions  except per share data) Change YoY Change YoY COTY  INC.

This was all achieved while maintaining strong sales growth momentum in excess of 29%.We now boast a portfolio of technological solutions recognized as market leaders by the world's major consulting firms. We have established a robust network of VARs and VADs in 90 countries and strengthened our strategic partnerships for deployment in both IT environments  with Bastion  and in operational environments  with OT.security by WALLIX.The launch of the WALLIX One platform this year will enable us to support the growth of digital practices among our clients  with a SaaS platform that brings together all of our solutions  providing an even better response to the demands of companies look ing for savings  operational efficiency and simplicity. This new offering is fully in line with our strategy of focusing on recurring business  which now accounts for 65% of our revenues  compared with 52% at the start of the Unicorn 25 plan. Our ability to satisfy and retain our clients   and the development of innovative new offers  constitute the foundations of our future growth.We are approaching 2024 with optimized organization at all levels in order to continue increasing our market share in PAM  IAM and OT.security. We are structured to better support our reseller and integrator networks in the deployment of solutions to clients of all sizes  and to better cover the additional needs of our existing clients. Within an uncertain macroeconomic environment  we are confident in our ability to maintain high growth rates in recurring business and to achieve operating breakeven in 2024.With the implementation of the NIS 2 directive in October 2024  the need for cybersecurity solutions adapted to the security of digital environments (IT) and industrial networks (OT) will increase  particularly in regulated sectors. This year is therefore set to be particularly intense in terms of new projects in a segment that already accounted for over 14% of our order intake in 2023  two years after the launch of our OT.Security brand. WALLIX is well positioned to fully support the digital transformation of our cities  hospitals  buildings  plants and all businesses seeking to make their activities both more user-friendly and more resilient in the face of cyber risks.”Accelerated growth in recurring revenue  solid business growth maintainedAt December 31  2023  monthly recurring revenue (MRR) amounted to €1.6 million  with growth continuing to accelerate  up 32.9% compared with the previous year.On an annual basis  recurring business amounted to €19.7 million as of December 31  2023  representing 65.2% of 2023 consolidated turnover  up 6.3 percentage points over one year.Hypergrowth achieved across all strategic regions:Unaudited data (€000) 31 December 2022 31 December 2023 Change France 760 989 +30.1% EMEA excl. France 439 617 +40.6% Outside EMEA 36 36 -1.1% Total MRR 1 235 1 641 +32.9%In France  MRR rose 30.1% over the year. ARR represented 62.9% of 2023 turnover  up 5.9 percentage points year-on-year. Sales momentum largely remained brisk among small and medium-sized businesses  particularly in the most sensitive sectors such as healthcare and industry.The Europe  Middle East  Africa (EMEA) segment  excluding France  remained buoyant  driving MRR growth with an increase of 40.6%. ARR accounted for 69.7% of 2023 turnover  up 6.1 percentage points year-on-year. The Middle East-Africa region  the second largest after France  delivered an excellent performance  driven in particular by the success of the Group's OT solutions.Business outside EMEA remains insignificant for the time being (2% of MRR).Consolidated turnover at December 31  2023 totaled €30.2 million  up 19.9%. The Group has therefore demonstrated its ability to maintain a solid base of license sales to existing clients  while increasing subscription revenue by winning new clients. Consolidated since May 16  2023  Kleverware contributed turnover of €0.5 million for the 2023 financial year.Over the year as a whole  the pace of business acquisition remained very brisk  with the number of active contracts up 29% and 656 contracts won during the year. At December 31  2023  the Group held a portfolio of over 2 900 active contracts  with a retention rate of over 95%.Launch of the second phase of the Unicorn 25 plan and confirmation of a return to profitability in 20242023 was marked by significant growth in new client contracts in France and abroad  with strong momentum in cybersecurity projects in healthcare  sensitive sectors and companies with assets or industrial resources requiring protection due to their inter-connectedness with IT networks or the cloud.It was also a pivotal year in the Group's development  with the reorganization of the sales and marketing teams and significant enhancement of its technological solutions  now extended to Identity and Access Governance following the acquisition of Kleverware.The reorganization of the sales and marketing teams has allowed for the adoption of a more efficient “three-tier” model  better suited to client size and partner requirements  aligning all departments involved in revenue generation around shared objectives. Priority is given to the deployment of solutions and services that generate recurring revenue and to enhancing the value of the client base through the sale of additional products (up-selling and cross-selling). To achieve these objectives  the Group will continue to rely on its network of over 300 partners worldwide and will focus its sales efforts on its core segment of medium-sized companies and key accounts by favoring a “Land and Expand” strategy  consisting of growing the client base and expanding the use of services among clients (number of users  new functions  geographical areas  etc.).The launch of the WALLIX One SaaS platform in January 2024 was fully in line with the Group's business strategy by facilitating access to IAM and PAM solutions within organizations  particularly in the SME segment  and among major groups' subcontractors  who represent a weak link requiring protection. By offering all of its Identity and Access Management and Compliance Governance solutions in SaaS  via a single point of access  WALLIX One is responding to the economic and digital challenges of companies seeking simplification and flexibility to protect their digital environments and interconnect them with networks and industrial systems. The roll-out of WALLIX One will also boost the Company's recurring revenue.WALLIX is entering a phase in which the investments made during the first stage of the Unicorn 25 strategic plan in 2022 and 2023 will pay off. With nearly 3 000 active contracts  a retention rate of over 95%  the ramp-up of subscriptions and continued solid momentum in the licensing segment  WALLIX is well positioned to maintain hypergrowth rates in recurring business and achieve operating breakeven in 2024.Next publication: Full-year 2023 results  March 21  2024ABOUT WALLIXWALLIX is a European cybersecurity software developer and world leader in the Identity and Access Management market.

The impact represented €0.6 million in Q4 2023. At constant consolidation scope and exchange rates  the Bogart Fragrances & Cosmetics division achieved growth of +2.3% in Q4 2023.Over the full 2023 financial year  the Bogart Fragrances & Cosmetics division generated turnover of €56.9 million  up +3.6%. At constant scope and exchange rates  growth amounted to +8.8%.In Q4 2023  the Bogart Beauty Retail division generated turnover of €72.4 million  representing a limited drop of -3.5% compared with the same period last year. While business in directly-operated stores was brisk in Germany and Slovakia  the Group continued to suffer the effects of changes in consolidation scope (closure of 26 stores in France and Belgium in 2022) and exchange rates in Israel (impact of -€4.6m). Note also that the Group had some disruption to its commercial activity as a result of the conflict in Israel (temporary closure of 42 stores for one week in October 2023  followed by a gradual resumption of business with modified opening hours). At constant consolidation scope and exchange rates  growth amounted to +1.5%.Turnover by the Bogart Beauty Retail division amounted to €236.3 million as at 31 December 2023  stable compared with last year  and up +4.7% at constant consolidation scope and exchange rates.At the end of the 2023 financial year  Group sales thus came in at €293.2 million (up +0.7% versus 31 December 2022 and +5.5% at constant consolidation scope and exchange rates).EBITDA improvement confirmed in 2023 - Growth targeted in 2024 and continued development of the European networkFor the 2023 financial year  Bogart confirms its outlook for an improvement in EBITDA (which came to €38.8 million in 2022).In 2024  Bogart intends to pursue its strategy of profitable growth  driven in particular by its Bogart Fragrances & Cosmetics business. Meanwhile  Bogart is pursuing its strategy to develop its network of stores in Europe.After recently announcing the acquisition of the ""Rose et Marius"" house of fine perfumery and art de vivre in Aix en Provence[2]  BOGART announces that it has acquired 9 independent perfumeries in Germany  which will be integrated into the HC Parfumerie network as of 1 March 2024.HC Parfumerie will thus consolidate its position in Germany and will own 91 stores with more than 500 employees.Next publicationBOGART Group will publish its full-year results on 29 April 2024 (after market close)Group website www.groupe-bogart.comCONTACTSBOGARTcontact@jbogart.comTel.: +33 (0)1 53 77 55 55ACTUS FINANCE & COMMUNICATIONInvestor RelationsAnne-Pauline Petureauxapetureaux@actus.frTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 72Media RelationsManon Clairetmclairet@actus.frTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 73[1] Revenues from licences and advertising rebillings for brands which are distributed to BOGART's own-brand networks.[2] See the press release dated 15 January 2024------------------------This publication embed ""Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key:l3CfaZdnYm+bmWmdZcqbaGOZaZthmpKZZWSaxmdvaZrFbW9gl5dibJudZnFllmln- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com.------------------------© Copyright Actusnews WireReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com  it's freeFull and original release in PDF format:https://www.actusnews.com/documents_communiques/ACTUS-0-84141-pr_bogart_turnover2023_final.pdf",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,negative,0.01,0.17,0.83,True,English,"['GROUPE BOGART', 'FULL-YEAR 2023 TURNOVER', 'CONSTANT SCOPE', 'EXCHANGE RATES', 'EBITDA IMPROVEMENT', '3.2 MILLION', 'Paris La Nuit fragrance duo', 'Parfums Jacques Bogart brand', 'Bogart Beauty Retail division', 'The Carven brand', 'Silver Scent Aqua', 'art de vivre', 'Anne-Pauline Petureaux apetureaux', 'Actusnews SECURITY MASTER', 'Copyright Actusnews Wire', 'Other 12-month revenues1', 'indirect sales model', 'constant consolidation scope', 'next press releases', 'SECURITY MASTER Key', 'Total 12-month revenues', 'full 2023 financial year', 'double-digit sales growth', 'HC Parfumerie network', 'Other Q4 revenues', 'Change Q4 turnover', 'constant scope', 'brand networks', 'Euronext Paris', 'Cosmetics division', 'Group sales', '12-month turnover', 'last year', 'business model', 'Compartment B', 'luxury fragrances', 'strategic reorganisation', 'Spanish subsidiary', 'exchange rates', 'Bogart Fragrances', 'limited drop', 'market share', 'retroactive effect', 'same period', 'commercial activity', 'one week', 'gradual resumption', 'opening hours', 'continued development', 'Rose et', 'Marius"" house', 'fine perfumery', '9 independent perfumeries', 'Next publication', 'full-year results', 'market close', 'Investor Relations', 'Media Relations', 'Manon Clairet', 'advertising rebillings', 'European network', 'high level', 'BOGART Group', 'Group website', 'full-year 2023 turnover', 'consolidated turnover', 'temporary closure', 'profitable growth', 'ACTUS FINANCE', 'Cosmetics business', 'EBITDA improvement', '8 February', 'JBOG', 'creation', 'manufacture', 'account', 'effects', 'changes', 'France', 'Belgium', 'refocusing', 'Israel', 'women', 'launch', 'reminder', 'Spain', '1 April', 'impact', 'stores', 'Germany', 'Slovakia', 'disruption', 'conflict', 'October', '31 December', 'outlook', 'strategy', 'acquisition', 'Aix', 'Provence', '1 March', 'position', '500 employees', '29 April', 'CONTACTS', 'Tel.', 'COMMUNICATION', 'mclairet', 'licences', 'brands', 'l3CfaZdnYm', 'bmWmdZcqbaGOZaZthmpKZZWSaxmdvaZrFbW9gl5dibJudZnFllmln', 'email', 'company', 'registeri', '€', '33', '1 53']",2024-02-06,2024-02-08,finanznachrichten.de

While trading volumes improved compared to Q3  they remained down meaningfully compared to the same period a year ago. Market volatility  on the other hand  was down in the period vs. both the last quarter and the same period last year despite a temporary increase in October and reached the lowest point of the year in December.The Americas saw a rebound in trading volumes in the quarter  both compared to last quarter and the same period a year ago. However  volatility was roughly flat quarter-on-quarter and down significantly year-on-year.Asia saw volumes decline in the quarter compared to last quarter  driven in part by declines in Hong Kong and China  and was flat compared to the same period a year ago.Volumes and volatility from an asset class perspective followed the same pattern  improving on a quarter-on-quarter basis  but saw a meaningful decline vs. the same period a year ago. The exception was cryptocurrencies  which saw a strong improvement compared to last quarter given the resurgence in interest in the quarter.Share Buyback€3.2m worth of shares were repurchased in Q423 as part of the €15m share buyback program announced in October 2022. A portion of the shares to be repurchased under this program could be allocated to employee incentive plans as needed.OutlookNormalized Fixed Operating Expenses for FY23 came in at €174m vs. the €175-185m guidance. The firm remains fully focused on operational and cost efficiencies across the business while implementing its growth and diversification strategies. For FY24  Normalized Fixed Operating Expenses are expected to be in the same range as FY23 for the full year as headcount is expected to be flat to down for the year  offset by continued technology investments and inflationary pressures.CEO statementMike Kuehnel  CEO""We saw a slightly improved trading environment in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter  though volumes and volatility were still down compared to the same period last year. The brief increase in volatility in October was met with the lowest levels of volatility for the year in November and December. For full year 2023  we are pleased to see our diversification strategy yielded solid results despite the slowdown in market activity as we were able to benefit from the recent increase in activity within the CCC segment  which somewhat offset the lower market activity in equity and fixed income when compared to a year ago.In Europe  given the continued increase of institutional and retail interest in digital assets  we announced the formation of AllUnity  a Euro-stablecoin partnership with DWS Asset Management and Galaxy Digital. AllUnity furthers aligns with Flow Traders' focus on contributing to the development of innovation within the digital asset space. We also spearheaded a concerted effort and leveraged our expertise to act as lead market maker and liquidity provider for our partners during the recent spot Bitcoin ETF launches in the U.S.. We are pleased to see significant developments within the digital asset space as we strongly believe it brings increased maturity and adoption.In the Americas  we continued to expand our regional presence in Chicago  our second location in the U.S.  as well as growing our product coverage by providing liquidity in ADRs. In Asia  we are encouraged by the already positive contribution from our nascent operation in China in the first year after receipt of our QFII license and look forward to further building relationships with the issuers  counterparties and other stakeholders to support the growth of the ETP ecosystem.Looking at our operations  we continue to focus on cost and operational efficiencies while balancing our key growth initiatives. In 2023  our Fixed Operating Expenses came in slightly below our guidance and we expect a similar projection in 2024 but remain vigilant  given continued investments in technology and inflationary pressures.In 2024  we will continue to focus on executing our strategy to strengthen and diversify our business and contribute to driving transparency and efficiency across global financial markets in collaboration with our partners. As we come up on the 20th anniversary of Flow Traders this year  we continue to pride ourselves on fostering our talent  which underpins the success of the company and remains as important as ever as we execute our strategy across our regions and asset classes.""Normalized PerformanceFlow Traders makes certain adjustments to various IFRS expense and profit measures in order to derive Alternative Performance Measures (APM). The policy is to exclude or adjust items that are considered to be significant in both nature or size and where the treatment as an adjusted item provides stakeholders with useful information to assess the year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter underlying performance. On this basis  the following items were adjusted or excluded for the Q423 results: Removal of IFRS 2 treatment of share-based payments which include the deferral of a portion of the current year share plans as well as recognition of prior years' share plans. This adjustment provides insights into the relationship between the current year variable employee expenses and current year trading performance. Other income line includes all the realized and unrealized results on Flow Traders' long-term equity investments whether accounted for as Fair Value Other Comprehensive Income (FV OCI)  Fair Value Profit and Loss (FVPL) or Results of Equity Accounted Investments. Exclusion of one-off expenses related to the completed corporate holding structure update and balance sheet review work. These are not considered to be part of the underlying operating expenses of the business. Tax expenses are adjusted based upon the pre-tax adjustments and/or excluded items above.IFRS Financial Overview€million Q423 Q422 Change FY23 FY22 Change Total income 74.3 115.5 (36%) 303.9 458.7 (34%) Net trading income 72.7 115.7 (37%) 300.3 460.2 (35%) Other income 1.6 (0.2) - 3.6 (1.5) - Employee expenses3 39.6 46.6 (15%) 134.0 176.8 (24%) Technology expenses 15.3 16.4 (6%) 64.4 61.2 5% Other expenses 7.6 7.9 (4%) 33.7 27.3 23% One-off expenses6 - 1.5 - 4.3 14.1 - Adjusted total operating expenses8 62.5 72.4 (14%) 236.3 279.3 (15%) EBITDA 11.8 43.2 (73%) 67.5 179.3 (62%) Profit before tax 7.4 38.0 (80%) 44.7 161.7 (72%) Net profit 6.4 29.5 (78%) 36.2 126.8 (72%) Basic EPS4 (€) 0.15 0.68 (78%) 0.84 2.92 (71%) Fully diluted EPS7 (€) 0.14 0.65 (78%) 0.81 2.76 (71%) EBITDA margin 16% 37% (58%) 22% 39% (43%)Normalized EBITDA and margin are based on the relevant profit share percentage of operating result for the relevant financial period without any IFRS 2 adjustments for share-based payments.
