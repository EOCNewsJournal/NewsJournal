This also applies to efforts to monitor compliance with unilateral restrictive measures against our country. As of January 11  the financial assets of individuals and legal entities in the amount of over 660 million euros have been frozen here "" Tarabrin told the Rossiya 24 broadcaster.Following the start of Russia's special military operation  the US-led West slapped widespread sanctions on Moscow  including freezing Russian assets worth approximately 300 billion euros ($329 billion). The bulk of this sum  approximately 200 billion euros ($221 billion)  is being held in the European Union  predominantly in accounts at Euroclear  a European central securities depository.Moscow has maintained that such an attempt goes in violation of the international law. The Russian Foreign Ministry has dismissed the freezing of Russian assets as theft.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said last week that the EU plan to seize Russian central bank assets was an ""escalation of economic aggression"" and a trade war  and warned that Russia would respond in a correspondingly harsh manner. She said that any attempt to confiscate Russian assets would be a gross violation of the West's own law  international rules and bilateral obligations.""Those who are trying to initiate this  and those who will implement it  must understand that Russia will never leave those who did this alone. And it will constantly exercise its right to a legal battle  internationally  nationally or otherwise. And this  of course  will have â€” both Europeans and Americans understand this very well â€” it will have legal consequences for those who initiated and implemented it "" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov cautioned commenting on the issue.Last year  Russian President Vladimir Putin dubbed the West's asset seizure as ""unseemly business "" and stressed that ""stealing other people's assets has never brought anyone good"".Â© SputnikNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,negative,0.03,0.28,0.69,True,English,"['Russian Assets', 'Netherlands', 'January', 'Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov', 'GlobalSecurity.org mailing list', 'European central securities depository', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Russian Ambassador Vladimir Tarabrin', 'Russian central bank assets', 'unilateral restrictive measures', 'special military operation', 'Russian Assets', 'European Union', 'The Netherlands', 'legal entities', '660 million euros', 'anti-Russian initiatives', 'financial assets', 'Rossiya 24 broadcaster', 'widespread sanctions', '200 billion euros', 'economic aggression', 'trade war', 'harsh manner', 'international rules', 'bilateral obligations', 'legal battle', 'legal consequences', 'asset seizure', 'other people', 'NEWS LETTER', 'Email Address', 'international law', 'EU plan', 'gross violation', 'Sputnik News', 'US-led West', 'January', 'MOSCOW', 'individuals', 'Thursday', 'forefront', 'efforts', 'compliance', 'country', 'amount', 'start', 'bulk', 'sum', 'accounts', 'Euroclear', 'attempt', 'freezing', 'theft', 'escalation', 'right', 'Europeans', 'Americans', 'issue', 'business']",2024-02-09,2024-02-10,globalsecurity.org

Net sales decreased by 4.4%.Adjusted operating profit for the final quarter was EUR 7.2 million (9.6) and operating profit was EUR 6.7 million (12.9). The operating profit for the comparison period was improved by a gain of EUR 4.3 million from the sale of the renewable energy sources business. Earnings per share were EUR 0.14 (0.29).Net sales for 2023 amounted to EUR 802.1 million (844.1). The comparison period included EUR 35.4 million of net sales from the renewable energy sources business. Adjusted operating profit was EUR 39.0 million (40.9) and operating profit was EUR 38.4 million (42.9). The operating profit for the comparison year was improved by a gain of EUR 4.3 million from the sale of the renewable energy sources business. Earnings per share were EUR 0.79 (0.83).Net cash flow from operating activities after investments was strong at EUR 50.9 million (41.1) and net cash flow from operating activities after investments per share was EUR 1.33 (1.08).The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 0.49 per share.Outlook for the year 2024Net sales in 2024 are estimated to be at the same level as in the previous year  and operating profit is estimated to be at the same level or better compared to the previous year.PRESIDENT AND CEO EERO HAUTANIEMI:“Net sales for 2023 amounted to EUR 802.1 million (844.1). The comparison period included EUR 35.4 million of net sales from the renewable energy sources business. Adjusted operating profit was EUR 39.0 million (40.9). Net cash flow from operating activities was strong at EUR 93.6 million (71.8)  as was the Group’s financial position. In 2023  the increase in production costs affected all of L&T’s divisions  as did the labour market decisions reached in the late spring  which included one-off items.In the Environmental Services division  the decline in general economic activity was reflected in lower waste volumes and the prices of recycled raw materials throughout the year. The decrease in the prices and volumes of recycled raw materials burdened the net sales of the division and had a negative effect of EUR 4.5 million on the operating profit.The Finnish Waste Act was amended in July 2021. Under the reform  municipalities take on a larger role in organising the collection of packaging material waste and biowaste from housing properties. As a consequence of the reform  L&T’s direct customer agreements with residential properties on the separate collection of packaging waste and biowaste are transferred to municipalities for competitive bidding gradually between 1 July 2022 and 1 July 2025.As a result of municipalisation  EUR 40 million of the value of the Finnish waste management market was moved out of the scope of free competition to municipal waste companies during 2022-2023. The effects of this change were fully visible on the division starting from the latter half of 2023. L&T estimates that based on decisions made by the end of year 2023  a further EUR 30 million will be moved out of the scope of free competition to municipal waste companies between 2024 and 2026.In the latter half of the year  the collection of packaging waste from residential properties was transferred to municipal waste companies in several geographical areas that are significant to L&T. L&T participates in the competitive tendering of municipal contracts. During 2023 competitive tendering of municipal contracts is estimated to have amounted to EUR 15-20 million and the Group won municipal contracts amounting to EUR 8 million. Nevertheless  the change transferred the ownership of the waste material collected from these residential properties  decreased additional sales and reduced the efficiency of L&T’s waste collection logistics increasing production costs. The change had a total negative impact of approximately EUR 2.5 million on operating profit in 2023.L&T aims to compensate for the impacts of municipalisation by growing the corporate customer business and continuing to improve the efficiency of operations during the next three years. In the division  measures to improve operational efficiency and profitability were initiated during the latter half of the year. The employment relationship of approximately 50 salaried employees are terminated as a result of change negotiations and other jointly agreed measures latest by the end of the first quarter of 2024.The Industrial Services division achieved a good result. Net sales increased in all of the division’s business lines. We carried out several large projects in the market for demanding industrial soil remediation projects in particular. Business operations in Sweden developed favorably despite the challenging market environment.The operating profit of Facility Services Finland improved significantly in 2023. Measures to streamline the cost structure and improve operational efficiency continued. Progress was achieved in digitalisation with the number of sites within the scope of data-driven cleaning increasing in 2023. In building technology services  the demand for energy efficiency services increased during the period under review.The customer agreements in Facility Services Sweden are mostly fixed-price contracts  and the division has not been able to pass the increased production costs on to customer prices. The division has a programme under way to simplify operating models and adapt them to the changed business environment. The results are expected to become visible by the end of 2024.In October 2023  Lassila & Tikanoja plc’s Board of Directors approved the company’s renewed strategy. Under the renewed strategy  the Environmental Services and Industrial Services divisions will seek new growth especially by focusing on business opportunities related to the circular economy of materials. Growth will be sought through organic development and potential selective acquisitions. In connection with the strategy review  the Board of Directors decided to evaluate the strategic alternatives for Facility Services Finland and Facility Services Sweden as part of the company’s business portfolio development. The sale of operations is one possible option. This strategic evaluation progressed according to plan in the fourth quarter.”GROUP NET SALES AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEOctober–DecemberNet sales for the fourth quarter amounted to EUR 200.9 million (210.1)  representing a year-on-year decrease of 4.4%.

Earnings per share were EUR 0.14 (0.29).Net sales increased in Industrial Services and decreased in the other divisions. Operating profit improved in Industrial Services and Facility Services Finland  and declined in Environmental Services and Facility Services Sweden.The result for the fourth quarter was affected positively by L&T’s EUR 1.1 million (0.9) share of the profit of the joint venture Laania Oy.

The renewable energy sources business was reported as a part of the Environmental Services division until the end of the second quarter of 2022.The focus of the Environmental Services division is heavily on corporate customers and producer responsibility organisation customers  and their number grew in the beginning of the year and stabilised in the fourth quarter. In the Environmental Services division  the decline in general economic activity was reflected in lower waste volumes and the prices of recycled raw materials throughout the year. The decrease in the prices and volumes of recycled raw materials burdened the net sales of the division and had a negative effect of EUR 4.5 million on the operating profit.The Finnish Waste Act was amended in July 2021.

Related assessments were initiated in the latter part of the year.There is a significant systems renewal project under way in Environmental Services  which will also include the deployment of a new ERP system. The systems renewal project increased the division’s fixed costs in 2023. The supplier of the ERP system was changed in 2022 and  during the period under review  the previous supplier paid a one-off compensation relating to the termination of the co-operation. Expenses capitalised during the co-operation with the previous supplier were written down on the balance sheet during the review period. The one-off compensation and the related costs and write-down did not have a significant effect on the division’s operating profit. The system is scheduled to enter the deployment stage in the second half of 2024. The total investment in the system projects is estimated at approximately EUR 16.9 million  of which approximately EUR 14 2 million was realised by the end of 2023.Industrial ServicesOctober–DecemberThe division’s net sales for the final quarter were EUR 37.9 million (36.3). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 3.8 million (3.1) and operating profit was EUR 3.6 million (2.3). Operating profit was reduced by a change of EUR 0.2 million in the fair value of the deferred consideration related to the acquisition of Sand & Vattenbläst i Tyringe AB (“SVB”) recognised in the fourth quarter of 2023. The change in the fair value is due to SVB’s improved result which increases the final acquisition price recognised as liability. In the comparison period  the fair value change recognised in the deferred consideration related to the acquisition reduced operating profit by EUR 0.8 million.Year 2023The Industrial Services division’s full-year net sales in 2023 grew to EUR 141.0 million (132.0). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 14.0 million (13.6). Operating profit was EUR 13.8 million (12.7). Operating profit was reduced by a change of EUR 0.2 million in the fair value of the deferred consideration related to the acquisition of Sand & Vattenbläst i Tyringe AB (“SVB”) recognised in the fourth quarter of 2023. The change in the fair value is due to SVB’s improved result which increases the final acquisition price recognised as liability. In the comparison period  the fair value change recognised in the deferred consideration related to the acquisition reduced operating profit by EUR 0.8 million.Demand was strong in all of the Industrial Services division’s business lines. The environmental construction business line was highlighted as a focus area in L&T’s renewed strategy in the autumn  and several large customer projects  especially in demanding soil remediation  were carried out in the business line during the period under review. The customer volume increased in hazardous waste services. In process cleaning in Finland  the demand related to annual maintenance breaks was strong  and the resource allocation was successful.

The rising costs caused by high inflation were  for the most part  passed on to customer prices.Facility Services SwedenOctober–DecemberThe division’s net sales for the final quarter decreased to EUR 34.5 million (39.8). Operating profit was EUR -0.9 million (0.5). Operating profit before the amortisation of purchase price allocations of acquisitions was EUR -0.6 million (0.8).Year 2023The net sales of Facility Services Sweden amounted to EUR 133.2 million (140.4) in 2023.

Operating profit before the amortisation of purchase price allocations of acquisitions was EUR -2.5 million (2.2).Customer agreements in the Swedish business are mostly fixed-price contracts  and the division has not been able to pass the increased production costs on to customer prices. In the fourth quarter  the uncertainty in the business environment was reflected in customer demand  and fewer new projects were started than in the comparison period. The division has a programme under way to simplify operating models and adapt them to the changed business environment. The results are expected to become visible by the end of 2024.FINANCINGIn 2023  net cash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR 93.6 million (71.8).

The new bank loan is in the amount of EUR 40 million and will mature in the third quarter of 2026. In addition to the usual financial covenants  the new bank loan is linked to sustainability targets  namely L&T’s carbon footprint and accident frequency. The interest rate swap used by the company to convert part of the EUR 50 million bank loan into a fixed interest loan was terminated in connection with the refinancing of the bank loan. The fair value of the interest rate swap  EUR 1.3 million  was recognised in financial income in the second quarter. The company had no interest rate swaps at the end of the financial year. In the third quarter  the company repaid the remaining amount of EUR 17.7 million of the bond issued in 2018.The EUR 100.0 million commercial paper programme was unused at the end of the financial year  as was the case in the comparison period.

Net financial expenses were increased by the rise in the general interest rate level  which was compensated by the fair value of EUR 1.3 million of an interest rate swap being recognised due to the termination of the interest rate swap. The effect of exchange rate changes on net financial expenses was EUR -0.0 million (-0.2). Net financial expenses were 0.8% (0.7%) of net sales.The equity ratio was 36.8% (34.3%) and the gearing ratio was 69.3% (75.9%). The Group’s total equity was EUR 232.2 million (220.4). Cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 32.9 million (49.5) at the end of the financial year.DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONThe Annual General Meeting held on 23 March 2023 resolved that a dividend of EUR 0.47 per share  totalling EUR 17.9 million  be paid on the basis of the balance sheet that was adopted for the financial year 2022.

Acquisitions accounted for approximately EUR 21 million of the gross capital expenditure in the comparison period.SUSTAINABILITYEnvironmental responsibilityClimate benefits for customers created by L&T2023 2022 TargetCarbon handprint (tCO 2 e)-453 000-534 500 growth faster than net salesThe carbon handprint illustrates the climate benefits of a product  process or service  i.e. the emission reduction potential for the user. L&T’s carbon handprint reduces the customer’s carbon footprint. Our services generated emission reductions for customers through  for example  customers replacing virgin raw materials with secondary raw materials  and fossil fuels with solid recovered fuels. The decline in L&T’s carbon handprint was due to the decline in waste material volumes  particularly in the construction segment  that reduces the amount material directed to recycling.The carbon handprint of the renewable energy sources business and the joint venture Laania is not reported as part of L&T’s carbon handprint for 2022. The renewable energy sources business was transferred to Laania joint venture in July 2022.Progress towards science-based emission reduction targets  using 2018 as the baseline2023 2022 Target Target to be achieved byCarbon footprint (tCO 2 e)31 20034 20024 4002030L&T’s strategic objective is to halve the carbon footprint of its operations by 2030  using 2018 as the baseline  and to reduce the indirect emissions generated by its supply chain. The emission reduction target set by L&T has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. The achievement of this objective will be promoted by switching to zero-emission transport technologies and fuels and by opting for renewable energy at L&T’s properties. Transport operations account for 95 per cent of the emissions generated by L&T’s own operations. The use of renewable fuels increased significantly year-on-year  particularly in the Industrial Services division’s fleet of heavy vehicles.The fuel distribution obligation was adjusted in 2022 by reducing the biofuel component by 7.5 percentage points. The change was not taken into account in the emissions calculations reported in L&T’s annual report published in March 2023  as Statistics Finland had not yet updated its fuel classification data in accordance with the change. Statistics Finland published the updated fuel classification data later in spring 2023  and they have been taken into account in the emission calculations in this report.Recycling rate and material recovery2023 2022 Target Target to be achieved by Recycling rate of material flows managed by L&T  % 57.8 59.4 65 2026The recycling rate is the weighted average of our customers’ recycling rates. It also includes materials that cannot yet be recycled. To increase our reuse and recycling rate  we actively look for new material streams whose refining rate we can increase. Reporting covers municipal waste collected from corporate customers  hazardous waste  industrial waste and construction waste in Finland. Slurry  contaminated soil and ash are excluded from reporting.Social responsibilityTotal recordable incident frequency (TRIF)2023 2022 Target Target to be achieved by Total recordable incident frequency2323152030L&T eliminates hazards and improves its own safety as well as the safety of customers and other stakeholders through effective proactive measures  such as risk assessments  safety observations  Safety Walks and occupational safety sessions. L&T has provided training on building workplace safety culture to over 80% of the company’s supervisors in Finland as part of the Safety under the helmet training initiative.Well-being at work2023 2022 Target Target to be achieved by Occupational health rate (proportion of employees with no sickness-related absences)4140572026Sickness-related absences (%)5.15.642030The objective of L&T’s personnel policies and plans is to ensure that the number  competence and retention of personnel are at the level required for effective performance. For a labour-intensive company  employees’ ability to work and function and maintain it throughout their careers until retirement on old-age pension is important.CURRENT ISSUES RELATED TO SUSTAINABILITYL&T updated its environmental sustainability target in October 2023. The goal is to halve the emissions of L&T’s own operations by 2030 from the level in 2018 and to reduce indirect (Scope 3) emissions by 18% by 2030 from the level in 2022. The company has set a target of net-zero emissions by 2045.L&T was awarded Gold  which is the second-best rating  in the international EcoVadis sustainability assessment. Each year  EcoVadis assesses approximately 90 000 globally operating companies  of which only 5% reach the Gold level.The sustainability results presented in this report have not yet been verified.

The aim of the new plans is to align the objectives of the company  shareholders and key employees in order to increase the value of the company in the long term  to retain the key employees at the company and to offer them competitive reward plans that are based on earning and accumulating the company’s shares as well as on appreciation of the share price. The Performance Share Plan 2023–2027 comprises three (3) three-year (3) performance periods covering the calendar years 2023–2025  2024–2026 and 2025–2027.During the performance period 2023–2025  the earning of rewards is based on the following performance criteria: return on capital employed (ROCE)  total shareholder return (TSR) and reduction of the carbon footprint (ESG). The target group of the Performance Share Plan during the performance period 2023–2025 consists of approximately 38 key employees  including the Group’s President and CEO and the Group Executive Board.During the performance period 2024–2026  the earning of rewards is based on the following performance criteria: return on capital employed (ROCE)  total shareholder return (TSR) and reduction of the carbon footprint (ESG). The target group of the Performance Share Plan during the performance period 2024–2026 consists of approximately 50 key employees  including the Group’s President and CEO and the Group Executive Board.The transitional share-based incentive scheme 2023–2026 consists of two (2) earnings periods of one (1) year each  corresponding to the calendar years 2023 and 2024. The earnings period is followed by a two-year retention period. The aim of the scheme is to support the transition from the old share-based incentive scheme to the new share-based incentive scheme. The earning of rewards for the 2023 and 2024 earnings periods is based the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the reduction of the carbon footprint (ESG). The target group of the transitional share-based incentive scheme for the earnings periods 2023 and 2024 consists of approximately 10 key employees  including the Group’s President and CEO and the Group Executive Board.ShareholdersAt the end of the review period  the company had 24 959 (24 556) shareholders.

Under the updated strategy  the Environmental Services and Industrial Services divisions will seek new growth especially by focusing on business opportunities related to the circular economy of materials. Growth will be sought through business development and potential complementary acquisitions.The Environmental Services division’s strong market position  broad customer base and significant material volumes provide a good basis for growing the materials business. As for material streams  the division will continue to focus on plastic  wood waste and metals  but opportunities related to other streams are also being explored.In the Industrial Services division  new business opportunities are emerging around the processing and value increase of industrial flows  as well as the restoration of the built environment. Growth is also sought in the Swedish market in industrial services and material value chains.Facility Services Finland and Facility Services Sweden will focus on improving profitability. In October 2023  Lassila & Tikanoja announced that the company’s Board of Directors had decided to evaluate the strategic options for Facility Services Finland and Facility Services Sweden as part of the company’s business portfolio development. The sale of operations is one possible option. The review is expected to be completed by the end of 2024. The review will not necessarily lead to any measures  and Lassila & Tikanoja will disclose more information on the matter as necessary.The company discussed its updated strategy in more detail at a Capital Markets Day organised on 23 November 2023.

A presentation of Juuso Maijala is available on L&T’s website. In addition  the Nomination Board proposes that Jukka Leinonen be elected as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Sakari Lassila as Vice Chairman.NEAR-TERM RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIESGeneral economic uncertainty may affect the level of economic activity among customers  which may reduce the demand for L&T’s services.Higher costs  such as the rising prices of fuel and energy  and potential changes in interest rates may have an impact on the company’s financial performance.The Finnish Waste Act was amended in July 2021. Under the reforms to the Waste Act  municipalities take on a larger role in organising the collection of packaging waste materials and biowaste from residential properties. As a consequence of the reform  L&T’s direct customer agreements with residential properties on the separate collection of packaging waste and biowaste will be transferred to municipalities for competitive bidding gradually between 1 July 2022 and 1 July 2025. As a result of municipalisation  approximately EUR 30 million of the Finnish waste management market will be moved out of the scope of free competition and to municipally owned companies between the years 2024-2026. The Environmental Services division participates in competitive tendering for municipal contracts and is a significant player in municipal contracts  but the Group estimates that the overall impact of the change will be negative.The company has several ERP system renewal projects under way. Temporary additional costs arising from system deployments and establishing the operating model may weigh down the company’s result.Production costs may be increased by challenges related to employee turnover and labour availability.The geopolitical situation involves continued uncertainty due to Russia’s war of aggression. The indirect impacts on overall economic activity in Finland and Sweden may have a negative impact on net sales and profit.The Group company Lassila & Tikanoja FM AB is a claimant and a defendant in legal proceedings in Sweden concerning unpaid receivables invoiced from a former customer of the Group. In June 2022  Lassila & Tikanoja FM AB took legal action in the District Court of Solna against the former customer company of L&T  demanding payment for unpaid receivables. At the balance sheet date  the carrying amount of the receivables in the Company’s balance sheet was approximately EUR 1.5 million. L&T’s former customer company in question has rejected Lassila & Tikanoja FM AB’s claims and the payment obligation  and brought a counterclaim demanding compensation totalling approximately SEK 116 million from Lassila & Tikanoja FM AB. The dispute is still pending. Lassila & Tikanoja considers the counterclaim to be without merit and has not recognised any provisions in relation to it.More detailed information on Lassila & Tikanoja’s risks and risk management is provided in the 2022 Annual Review and in the Report by the Board of Directors and the consolidated financial statements.PROPOSAL FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF PROFITAccording to the financial statements  Lassila & Tikanoja plc’s unrestricted equity amounts to EUR 51 335 173.21  with the profit for the period representing EUR 7 420 038.45 of this total. There were no substantial changes in the financial standing of the company after the end of the period  and the solvency test referred to in Chapter 13  Section 2 of the Companies Act does not affect the amount of distributable profits.The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 0.49 per share be paid for the financial year 2023. The dividend will be paid to shareholders entered in the company’s shareholder register maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy on the record date  25 March 2024. The Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the dividend be paid on 3 April 2024.No dividend shall be paid on shares held by the company on the record date of the dividend payment  25 March 2024.On the day the proposal for the distribution of profit was made  the number of shares entitling to dividend was 38 154 102  which means the total amount of the dividend would be EUR 18 695 509.98. The Group’s earnings per share amounted to EUR 0.79. The proposed dividend  EUR 0.49 per share  is 62.1% of the Group’s earnings per share.Lassila & Tikanoja’s Annual Report  which includes the Report by the Board of Directors and the financial statements for 2023  will be published in week 9 at vuosikertomus.lt.fi/en .Helsinki  8 February 2024LASSILA & TIKANOJA PLCBoard of DirectorsEero HautaniemiPresident and CEOFor additional information  please contact:Eero Hautaniemi  President and CEO  tel. +358 10 636 2810Valtteri Palin  CFO  tel. +358 40 734 7749Lassila & Tikanoja is a service company that is putting the circular economy into practice.

The problems faced by the sector during the reporting year also affected SATO and had an impact on the company’s business. The high interest rates and high inflation that continued until the end of the year raised costs and impacted consumers’ purchasing power. Competition continued to be tough on the rental markets and new construction of rental apartments remained brisk  especially in the Helsinki metropolitan area. Despite this  SATO’s financial position remained strong and SATO’s customer experience continued its positive development.As proof of its owners’ confidence in SATO  a share issue of up to EUR 200 million started up in December  the goal of which is to bolster the company’s equity ratio and balance sheet and to reduce interest-bearing liabilities. The share issue offers us more extensive financing options and strengthens our financial position. The company's majority shareholder  Balder Finska Otas AB (Fastighets AB Balder)  has announced that it will support the issue ending on 14 February 2024.Economic uncertainty continued in Finland in 2023. The high inflation finally turned downward at the end of the year  especially once energy prices fell. However  underlying inflation remained persistently high and exceeded the central banks’ goal of 2%. The European Central Bank continued to raise the key interest rate during the reporting year  as a result of which inflation gradually slowed down throughout Europe. The markets forecasted after all that the peak would be reached in late 2023.Urbanisation continues  and dense urban living is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. There will continue to be demand for rental apartments in growth centres near good public transport connections and services also in the future. Of the major cities  the Helsinki metropolitan area and Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy robust growth. The Helsinki metropolitan area is expected to grow by over 200 000 new residents by 2040. Close to 80% of the area’s residents already live in one- to two-person households  and the number of small households continues to rise. The proportion of immigrants living in the capital area is predicted to grow from the current 17% to 25% by 2030.Despite the downturn  plenty of new apartments were under construction  particularly in the Helsinki metropolitan area. A record number (7 000–8 000) of apartments intended solely for rent were completed in the Helsinki metropolitan area during the reporting year.In 2024  approximately another 4 000 rental apartments will be completed.SATO has focussed its operations on the Helsinki metropolitan area and its surrounding municipalities  and Tampere and Turku. During the reporting year  an era came to an end when we finalised the sale of our Russian business in April. Since the sale  SATO no longer has any business operations in Russia.During the reporting year  close to a thousand new and about 500 renovated rental apartments were completed for SATO in Espoo  Helsinki  Tampere  Turku and Vantaa. As a result of dramatically increased costs and higher financing prices  we decided in October 2022 that we would not initiate new investments for the time being. In 2024  only just over 400 new and renovated rental homes will be completed for SATO.High inflation has also impacted consumers’ purchasing power  which  together with a high cost of living  affects the rental apartment markets. The employment situation became weaker in Finland during the reporting year  and the situation is expected to weaken further in 2024. Finns have less and less income to spend  which means that they have to primarily focus on their necessary expenses  such as housing  as their extra leisure spending decreases.Since the Covid years  competition between housing providers has been tight with the extensive offering of apartments exceeding demand. Housing providers have competed over good tenants and  as a result  rent increases have fallen behind real costs. Inflation and rising costs of financing may show up in higher rents when the housing supply decreases.Regardless of the real estate sector’s challenges  SATO has continued to focus on development work to increase and improve our presence near customers. We have received good feedback on our house experts and service managers who work in our buildings. We have developed and modernised our digital operating environment and operational information systems that enable us to work more efficiently and serve our customers better at all times of the day and night. As a result of our development efforts  our Net Promote Score (NPS) measuring customer satisfaction improved and was 23  and the NPS measuring different customer interactions was 53. Our tenant turnover fell during the reporting year and our economic occupancy rate was 94.9% (95.2).Sustainability is at the core of our operations. Our task is to meet  in particular  the needs of our residents and personnel. We have also discussed how we could collaborate with cities to improve development work around housing. With regard to our building portfolio  our focus is on achieving carbon neutrality in in-use energy consumption by the end of 2030. We continue to increase the use of geothermal heat and we completed the installation of solar power plants in 24 residential buildings around the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. The calculated solar power output generated locally at our properties in 2023 corresponds to the annual power consumption of roughly 250 apartments.We will report in more detail on our sustainability work in our Sustainability Report  which will be published on 16 February.In January 2023  SATO was awarded the Great Place To Work® certificate and ranked tenth in the list of Finland’s Best Workplaces in the large company category. I am extremely proud and grateful for this recognition as the entire organisation has worked long and hard to develop SATO’s culture. A total of 85% of SATO employees feel that SATO as a whole is a great place to work. Diversity  equality and inclusion are key factors through which we will continue to strengthen our understanding and competence among both our personnel and residents.This year has taught us a lot. Despite the sector’s challenges  SATO’s objective is to reinforce its foothold in the markets and achieve sustainable growth.I would like to thank all SATO employees  our partners and the residents living in SATOhomes for our successful co-operation during the past year.Antti Aarnio  President and CEOReport of the Board of Directors 1 January–31 December 2022Operating environmentFor SATO  2023 was marked by a tightened situation in the sector  Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine  higher interest rate costs  an inflation-driven rise in costs and the continued high supply of rental housing in relation to housing demand. The sharp rise in energy prices resulting from the war in Ukraine was reflected in the Finnish economy. Although an energy crisis was avoided  economic momentum remained weak throughout the reporting year as a result of prolonged inflation and high interest rates. The Finnish economy remained in a downturn in 2023  and according to the Bank of Finland’s December projection  the gross domestic product contracted by 0.5% in 2023.In 2023  headline inflation was at a high level  at around 4.4%. Core inflation persistently remained above the two per cent mark  which is why central banks continued their policy to tighten interest rates throughout the year. In late 2023  energy prices fell to a seasonally normal level and inflation began to fall. Consumers’ confidence in their own finances remained low  which translated into cautious spending. The employment rate stopped rising and declined as economic growth stalled. The employment situation is expected to weaken further in 2024. On the other hand  inflation has slowed  interest rate costs are expected to fall and households’ purchasing power is expected to increase. These developments are anticipated to have a positive impact on Finland’s economy.The housing sector was impacted by economic uncertainty  a high interest rate level and a rise in living costs. The outlook for housing construction darkened to an exceptional degree in 2023 as a result of rising costs and weaker demand. The record-low demand for housing also had a significant impact on housing starts for both owner-occupied and rental apartments. According to the Confederation of Finnish Construction Industries  housing starts contracted dramatically in 2023  although previously started projects kept the supply high in the Helsinki metropolitan area during 2023.Strong demographic growth is expected to continue in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku  while growth in the whole country will likely start to decline in 2031. The population of the Helsinki metropolitan area is expected to grow by over 200 000 new residents by 2040. Close to 80% of the area’s residents already live in one- to two-person households  and the number of small households continues to rise. The proportion of immigrants living in the capital area is predicted to grow from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. Ageing populations typically move closer to growth centres and the services they offer  and they also increasingly expect housing-related services. The change in the population structure and development in the prices of owner-occupied apartments create a stable foundation for demand for rental housing especially in the capital area and in Tampere and Turku.Despite positive internal migration  competition for good tenants remained tight during the reporting year  and rent increases remained moderate. Housing providers have not been able to pass the actual cost rises on to rents. The increased cost level creates pressure to increase rents in the upcoming years.Economic uncertainty may have a positive impact on the demand for rental apartments. Some of those looking for an owner-occupied apartment may also consider rental housing as an option.Recovery from the downturn is expected to happen slowly. Prices have risen and consumers’ confidence is weak. The Bank of Finland projected  already in December 2023  that economic growth in 2024 would be negative 0.2%. The employment situation is expected to weaken slightly further in 2024. Economic growth is forecast to improve in 2025  as a result of which the employment situation will also take an upward turn.StrategySATO is a housing investment company operating in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku.

The proportion of unsecured loans was 85.4% of all loans. At the end of the year  the proportion of unencumbered assets was 87.7% of the balance sheet.Issue of sharesMaintenance costs have increased due to persistently high inflation  and the dramatically risen interest rate level has simultaneously led to a significant rise in financing costs. In the current market situation  it has not been possible to pass the costs on to apartment rents in full. Supply has exceeded demand in the Finnish housing market as a result of intense construction activity in recent years.In an effort to improve the company’s financial position  the company’s Board of Directors launched  based on the authorisation granted by the General Meeting in December 2023  a share issue of up to EUR 200.0 million. The share issue is aimed at strengthening the company’s equity ratio and balance sheet and at reducing interest-bearing liabilities. The company’s largest shareholder  Balder Finska Otas AB (Fastighets AB Balder)  has announced that it will support the issue ending on 14 February 2024.Group structureSATO Corporation is the parent company of SATO Group. At the end of the reporting year  the parent company had a total of 13 subsidiaries (21) engaged in business operations. Mergers were completed during the year in order to clarify the Group structure.SATO Corporation’s majority shareholder is Balder Finska Otas AB  whose parent company is Fastighets AB Balder  which is quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.Housing businessOur housing business consists of rental activities  customer service  life-cycle management and maintenance. We strive to provide home-seekers with a quick access to a home  a steady cash flow for the Group through effective rental activities and smooth digital services. High-quality property maintenance ensures the comfort of residents and that the apartments stay in good condition and retain their value. Customer focus and good service are the foundation for our interactions with our customers.During the year under review  apartment rental activities slowed and competition among housing providers tightened especially in growth centres. A large number of new rental apartments were completed in Espoo  Helsinki  Tampere and Turku  giving residents a wider choice.SATO had approximately 43 000 customers at the end of the year under review. The economic occupancy rate decreased compared to the previous year. Our occupancy rate was 94.9%. We boosted the organisation’s activities by improving the service processes  among other things. We also developed customer experience measurement and reporting. Our goal going forward is to further reinforce our presence in our customers’ daily lives and to offer them the best possible service.At the end of the year  67 house experts and 7 team leaders worked in SATO’s house expert organisation. Their primary task is to ensure  together with the maintenance company  that SATO’s buildings are comfortable and well-maintained. The house expert model is now in use to its full extent in the properties wholly owned by SATO in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku.We serve our customers through various channels  also during the weekend. In addition to personal service  our customer service can be reached via the chat service at sato.fi/en  where our customers receive help from our service experts and the SATObot  which is on duty 24/7. Multiculturalism is part of our daily life  and we can serve our customers in about 20 languages. We constantly work on improving our digital services together with our customers.Improved customer service and development measures carried out in different service processes improved the customer experience in many respects. In the beginning of the reporting year  we launched the concept of good encounters for all SATO employees  describing the way we interact with one another  our customers  partners and stakeholders. We want to interact with our customers with the same warmth in both digital channels and face-to-face service situations and settings. We ask our customers for their feedback on how we have succeeded in our interactions through various transactional surveys  and we monitor customer feedback using an indicator measuring interaction.SATO’s customer experience is made up of multiple factors  such as how well the customer’s home meets their needs  home removal situations and digital and face-to-face interaction with SATO employees. The concept of good encounters serves as a tool for all SATO employees and helps us ensure a familiar and consistent service experience. In 2023  we measured the company’s customer satisfaction using the Net Promoter Score (NPS) index. Our NPS during residency was 23 and the NPS for various transactional situations was 53. The latter is based on feedback from customers in various encounters  such as customer service phone calls  maintenance services provided by house experts  apartment offers and apartment viewings.Economic occupancy rate was 94.9% on average (95.2). The external tenant turnover rate for rental apartments was 26.8% (28.4). Rental income decreased 1.0% and was EUR 288.4 million (291.2). The average monthly rent of SATO’s rental apartments at the end of the reporting year was EUR 18.07 (17.84) per m2. Net rental income for apartments was EUR 198.7 million (200.4).Investment propertiesOn 31 December 2023  SATO owned a total of 25 468 apartments (24 999). During the reporting year  978 rental apartments (191) were completed for SATO  and a total of 349 rental apartments (1 327) were under construction. The number of divested rental apartments was 530.EUR 99.1 million (93.9) was spent on repairing and upgrading apartments. During the reporting year  renovation was completed for 545 apartments and renovation was underway in 56 apartments.On 14 April 2023  we completed the divestment of our Russian business. SATO operated in St. Petersburg as of 2007  and the company owned 522 rental apartments there. After the sale  SATO has no business operations in Russia.Fair valueThe development of the value of rental apartments is a key factor for SATO. The housing stock is focussed on areas and apartment sizes that are expected to grow in demand in the long term. The allocation of building repairs is based on life-cycle plans and repair need specifications.The fair value of investment properties on 31 December 2023 totalled EUR 4 885.7 million (5 044.2). The change in the value of investment properties  including investments and divestments in the financial year  was EUR -158.5 million (11.4).The value of properties funded with ARAVA loans or interest-subsidised loans would be EUR 260 million higher when valuated with income value method.The external expert JLL Finland Oy (JLL) issues a biannual statement on the valuation methods applied by SATO  the appropriateness of sources of information used and the quality and credibility of the valuation for Finnish investment properties. JLL’s latest statement was issued on the valuation carried out on 31 December 2023. The criteria for the determination of the fair value are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.The change in value was mainly influenced by the increase in yield requirements.At the end of the year  the Helsinki metropolitan area’s commuting area accounted for some 86.9%  Tampere for some 7.5% and Turku for 5.6% of the value of apartments.Investments  divestments and property developmentInvestment activities are used to manage the housing portfolio and prepare the ground for growth. SATO’s investments in the 2000s in non-subsidised rental apartments total more than EUR 3 billion. SATO acquires and builds entire rental buildings and single rental apartments. Property development allows for new investments in rental apartments. The rental potential and value of rental apartments owned by SATO are developed through repair activities  which help increase comfort and improve energy efficiency.In response to continued strong urbanisation  SATO invests  in addition to Helsinki  Espoo and Vantaa  also in their surrounding municipalities and in Tampere  Turku and their surrounding municipalities. Investments in rental apartments were EUR 150.0 million (190.5). Investments in the Helsinki metropolitan area represented 89.1% of all investments in the reporting year. Investments in new apartments represented 46.1% of the investments. In addition  SATO’s binding purchase agreements in Finland on 31 December 2023 totalled EUR 17.4 million (114.3). During the reporting year  530 rental apartments (2 021) were divested. These totalled EUR 52.6 million (210.6).The book value of plot reserves totalled EUR 44.3 million (40.8) at the end of the reporting year. The value of new plots acquired by SATO by the end of December 2023 totalled EUR 0.8 million (18.4).The permitted building volume for approximately 1 200 apartments is being developed for the plots in the company’s housing portfolio. The aim is to utilise the existing infrastructure  create a denser urban structure and bring more residents close to services and good public transport connections.We engage in urban development together with cities and other operators in the sector. Developing urban districts benefits not only the future residents of new apartments  but also the existing residents  as services improve and the urban environment develops. As a long-term property owner  housing investor and housing provider  SATO has the will to build nice homes  residential areas and pleasant urban areas for decades to come.During the reporting year  we continued the development of  among other areas  Itäkeskus in Helsinki  Soukka in Espoo and Tohloppi  Tampere. In Helsinki  we are involved in developing the Puotila metro station area and the Puhos and Stoa area into a new centre for East Helsinki. In Espoo’s Soukka  we are developing  together with the city  the Soukka centre area through complementary construction of SATO’s residential buildings located in the immediate vicinity of the metro station.In the spring  we launched a complementary planning project in Tohloppi  Tampere  aimed at building two new residential buildings owned by SATO in West Tampere. SATO also has several development projects underway in Espoo  Helsinki  Järvenpää  Kirkkonummi  Tampere  Turku and Vantaa.During the reporting year  plots in areas developed by SATO were sold to construction companies and other partners. This enables the construction of approximately 120 owner-occupied apartments and one grocery store  thus promoting the diverse development of the residential areas.During the reporting year  close to a thousand new rental apartments were completed for SATO. In the Helsinki metropolitan area  apartments were completed in Espoo (Vermonniitty and Karakallio)  in Helsinki (Veräjämäki) and in Vantaa (Hakunila and Keimolanmäki). New rental apartments were also completed in Tampere (Hervantajärvi) and Turku (Skanssi).We renovate the rental homes and properties we own according to the life-cycle principle. Renovations were completed in more than 500 apartments in Helsinki (Etelä-Haaga  Pitäjänmäki  Kallio  Etu-Töölö and Pohjois-Haaga). In Vantaa  renovations were completed at the property located in Martinlaakso.Housing starts have been at an all-time low in the entire sector. The supply of new rental apartments will strongly decrease over the next few years. In autumn 2022  we decided not to initiate any new investments for the time being. Behind the decision were higher financing costs and the rise in construction and maintenance costs driven by dramatically increased inflation. In 2024  SATO will see the completion of a total of 349 new rental apartments in Tuusula (Hyrylä) and Espoo (Finnoo). Renovations will be completed in a 56-apartment property located in Kallio  Helsinki.We are committed to improving the energy efficiency of our properties and we are increasing local production of renewable energy at our properties. More information about our energy efficiency work can be found in the sustainability section.SustainabilityDuring the reporting year  our sustainability work was governed by SATO’s strategy and our sustainability programme for 2023–2026  according to which our goal is to be a forerunner in sustainable rental housing. The themes of our sustainability programme are sustainable housing (environmental responsibility)  the well-being of communities (social responsibility) and profitable business sustainably (financial and administrative responsibility). Our programme’s policies are linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). During the year  we advanced sustainability work in line with the targets in all areas.In line with our sustainability programme  we focussed on the following themes in the area of environmental responsibility: carbon neutrality and energy efficiency  circular economy and biodiversity. SATO’s goal is to be carbon neutral by the end of 2030 when it comes to in-use energy consumption. During the reporting year  we drew up a carbon roadmap  which specifies our interim targets and actions to achieve our carbon neutrality goal. In addition to continuous measures to improve energy efficiency  we invest in locally produced renewable energy. For example  by the end of 2030  we will switch over to geothermal heat in all our homes located in Helsinki wherever possible and where it also makes financial sense. We continuously collaborate with energy suppliers in order to save energy and increase carbon neutral energy solutions  among other things.SATO’s goal is to promote material efficiency and the circular economy both during building use and in new building construction and renovation projects. We participated in the circular economy project of the City of Helsinki  aimed at bringing together construction sector parties to discuss ways to promote circular economy.During the reporting year  we prepared SATO’s first biodiversity roadmap for 2024–2026  which is based on charting the current state and a materiality analysis. Our goal is to slow down biodiversity loss and improve biodiversity in housing development and in the areas where our existing buildings are located. We take biodiversity into consideration in everything we do  initiate actions to improve biodiversity in our properties and develop our competence in biodiversity issues.An external  independent sustainability panel consisting of experts in sustainable production and consumption selected eight of SATO’s renovated buildings for the Ostavastuullisesti.fi website in autumn 2023: Ansaritie 1A and 2–4 (Etelä-Haaga  Helsinki)  Graniittitie 8 and 13 (Pihlajamäki  Helsinki)  Kannelkuja 6 (Itä-Hakkila  Helsinki)  Piispantie 3 and 5 as well as Rikhard Nymanintie 3 (Pitäjänmäki  Helsinki) and Porttikuja 11 (Kontula  Helsinki). For the time being  SATO is the only rental housing provider in the Ostavastuullisesti.fi service. The products or services selected for the website are more sustainable than other available options.We participated for the ninth time in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) assessment. SATO received three stars on a scale of one to five. SATO’s score in the Standing Investments Benchmark (existing properties) rose to 76 from the 73 points received in the previous year and in the Development Benchmark (construction projects)  SATO’s score rose to 79 points from 75 points in the previous year. In its peer group  SATO’s result represents the average of northern European housing investors. SATO’s strengths in the GRESB assessment were  for example  sustainability management  risk management  diverse stakeholder co-operation  a comprehensive health and well-being programme and measures for personnel  and issues related to tenants’ health and safety. Furthermore  based on the GRESB assessment  SATO’s improvement areas are describing processes and documentation related to material selection and monitoring in construction projects in more detail.Some of our sustainable housing measures are described below under “Impacts on the environment and society”.In the area of social responsibility  we focussed not only on supporting our employees’ well-being at work and competence development  but also on improving the comfort and well-being of our residents and promoting diversity and equality. In spring 2023  we launched the concept of good encounters  describing how we interact with other people. The concept creates a consistent approach to all interactions and serves as a tool for SATO employees. Its objective is to ensure that our customers can enjoy a consistent service experience regardless of the situation and the SATO employee and to improve the customer experience  which is a key element of our strategy. The concept was cascaded among SATO employees during spring and early summer  and the related work will continue as an integral part of our daily activities.During the reporting year  we initiated diversity  equity and inclusion work (DEI) at SATO. Our goal is to increase and reinforce SATO employees’ understanding of the topic to even better understand our diverse customer base  promote our personnel’s well-being and achieve better results together. We started the work by conducting a self-evaluation of diversity management and by providing coaching to the Corporate Management Group  supervisors and SATO employees with a interest in DEI work. We launched a DEI plan in a diversity coaching session for the entire personnel in November 2023  conducted theme discussions during the rest of the year in each team and started in-depth supervisor coaching. We will continue building understanding through coaching sessions and discussions also in 2024. We will also  among other things  look into our HR practices  renew our recruitment process to increase diversity and develop indicators for assessing and monitoring the DEI work.In the area of administrative and financial responsibility  we continued to develop consistent and transparent ways of working during the reporting year. In the reporting year  we started the identification and description of our core processes. We completed a compliance charting and renewed our Code of Ethics for employees and co-operation partners. We updated the framework for green financing  which is focussed on energy-efficient properties and improving their energy efficiency. We expanded the remuneration criteria to cover  in addition to customer experience and economic occupancy rate  also sustainability by making the realisation of the annual targets specified in the sustainability programme part of the remuneration paid to all SATO employees.SATO has a First Whistle channel in place  through which SATO employees and external stakeholders can confidentially report detected or suspected misconduct or other inappropriate conduct.We report on our sustainability annually in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) reporting guidelines  and the environmental sustainability and procurement figures presented in the report have been verified by an independent third party  i.e. KPMG Oy Ab.During the reporting year  we continued collaboration with the non-profit organisation No Fixed Abode and the Rehabilitation Foundation in their project to help participants in the project find the two essentials of life – a home and a job. By the end of 2023  10 people who had participated in the project were living in a SATOhome.In 2020  we committed to reporting in accordance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. In the framework  the risks are divided into four main categories: transition risks  acute and chronic physical risks and social risks. During the reporting year  risks caused by climate change were part of SATO’s general risk assessment that is conducted internally each year. Climate-related risks and opportunities and their impact on the company’s operations were addressed in the Corporate Management Group and reported to the Board of Directors twice during the reporting year.The Corporate Governance Statement  SATO’s Code of Ethics and the Group’s sustainability programme are available at sato.fi/en.Impacts on the environment and societyAccording to the Ministry of the Environment  construction and buildings cause approximately one third of Finland’s greenhouse gas emissions. Our most significant climate impacts arise from energy consumption during residency and the construction and repair of our homes. Mitigating climate change and responding to it are at the core of our sustainability work. We aim to reduce the emissions caused by our operations  and our goal is to reach carbon neutrality for in-use energy consumption by the end of 2030.Our objective is to systematically reduce the negative impacts of our operations on the environment. We reduce the load on the environment by regularly and proactively taking care of and repairing homes and properties according to the life-cycle principle  and by building properties primarily in existing urban environments and near good public transport connections.The design of SATO’s new rental apartments always takes into account energy efficiency and solutions that will last for decades. In new properties  SATO’s goal is energy class A (energy performance indicator 75 or below)  which is significantly better than that required by the building code (energy performance indicator 90). All of the buildings that were completed during the reporting year were energy class A. In 2023  we did not start any new construction projects.During the reporting year  we continued to invest in energy efficiency improvements in SATOhomes in connection with renovations. In renovations  our goal is to improve energy efficiency by some 30% compared to earlier. A total of 545 homes were renovated in 2023.We are committed to the Energy Efficiency Agreement targets for the property sector  aiming for a reduction in the total consumption of electricity and heat of 10.5% from the 2015 baseline by 2025. The use of renewable energy in heating significantly reduces the in-use emissions of homes. Our goal is for 80% of our energy consumption to be renewable or carbon neutral by the end of 2026. We increase local energy production and always look into the possibility of using geothermal heat and other locally produced energy and heat recovery. We implement these wherever possible and where it also makes financial sense. In 2023  we added a solar power plant to 24 properties located in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. At the end of the reporting year  among the properties fully owned by SATO  1 820 homes had geothermal heat and 247 homes had hybrid heating with district heat and heat pumps. Thirty properties housing 2 999 SATOhomes had a solar power plant. In 2023  building electricity consisted entirely of emission-free electricity.During the reporting year  specific energy consumption fell by 2.0%  specific electricity consumption rose 8.2% and specific water consumption fell by 1.0% compared to 2022. Specific emissions from SATO’s apartments fell by 10.6% compared to 2022 and were 25.2 carbon dioxide equivalent kilograms per square metre (28.2). Emissions are calculated according to the absolute consumption of district heating. Due to the rise in heating and electricity prices  energy costs rose overall.In addition to the climate  the built environment also has a significant impact on nature  and the construction supply chains also have identified nature impacts. Biodiversity is one of the environmental themes of SATO’s sustainability programme  and our goal is to slow down biodiversity loss and improve biodiversity in housing development and in the areas where our existing buildings are located. The measures to promote biodiversity are described in the biodiversity roadmap 2024–2026 in our Sustainability Report 2023. We are continuously improving our actions to promote biodiversity as our understanding  competence and resources increase.Our business is long-term  transparent and sustainable. For us  sustainability means concrete actions that can be seen in everything we do. We regularly assess and predict the social  economic and environmental risks related to our operations. We strive to systematically reduce the identified negative impacts  for example by following our Code of Ethics  by combating the grey economy  by approving only companies registered with the Reliable Partner service as our co-operation partners  conducting audits and internal control  and by continuously developing our operations.We generate a steady financial benefit for our stakeholders  including shareholders  employees  customers  municipalities  the state  and goods suppliers and service providers and their employees. We support growth opportunities in business and industry by offering rental apartments in Finland’s largest growth centres  in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku.We enable sustainable housing for our residents and encourage them to make sustainable choices in their daily lives. We are a long-term and responsible housing provider for our residents.Development activitiesOur operating model is based on the idea that any needs for improvement and change in the organisation are best identified by the employees whose daily work involves the matters in question. One of the spearheads of SATO’s strategy are SATO employees  and our intent is for each SATO employee to develop and build the SATO of the future.SATO has in place a continuous improvement model for business. We develop our operations as smaller components rather than large units  which speeds up development work and allows processes to be improved effectively. In connection with development work  we identify  prioritise and carry out strategically important actions.SATO’s development activities in 2023 focussed on several aspects that improve the key businesses. Solutions that harmonise business information management were deployed in the property data system KoTI. In KoTI  we are able to manage the key areas of property management centrally and based on consistent data  which makes it easier  for example  to make long-term plans. As a result of the development work  KoTI can be used for identifying and evaluating different repair needs  targeting repairs  as well as for identifying divestment needs.In rental housing  we will continue the harmonisation of processes also during the next reporting year. We invested in developing digital services  as well as our presence near to the customers  and in building a uniform and seamless service experience. Our goal is to serve our customers in the best way possible  regardless of time or place. Customers can  for example  book an apartment viewing digitally whenever they want.During the year under review  we moved the majority of our digital services to cloud service platforms. This has made service maintenance more effective and brought the company savings. This has also saved us time  which we have been able to allocate to developing our core businesses. By making effective use of cloud services  we have also improved the company’s information security  scalability and operational flexibility. An increasing number of business areas can now be managed directly on the property together with the resident.We have improved our collaboration by developing our partner channel in terms of  for example  key management for the properties. In addition  we have developed a parking spot rental process  which improves the overall management of rental activities and enables better service four our customers.OmaSATO  the digital service targeted at residents  turned five during the reporting year. Our goal is to make OmaSATO a better digital rental housing service that makes life easier for residents and encourages them to make more sustainable choices. In 2023  a customer survey was conducted among OmaSATO users  based on which we identified new development areas. We made the user interface more customer friendly using service design. The renewed OmaSATO will be released in early 2024  and its development will be continued.Modern systems make it easier to automate processes and respond to the different needs of the businesses. As part of the work to develop financial administration  SATO introduced a new accounts ledger system in April 2023. In this connection  we outsourced customer invoicing in its entirety to our external partner as of 1 April 2023.A total of EUR 2.3 million (3.2) was spent on development  corresponding to approximately 0.8% of net sales.Risk managementRisk management is used to ensure that risks impacting the company’s business are identified  managed and monitored. The main risks of SATO’s business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.SATO’s most significant risks are related to prolonged inflation and the resulting rise in interest rates. As a result of the war in Ukraine  the prices of energy  food  materials and commodities have increased dramatically and interest rates have risen. Higher cost of living can have a negative impact on consumers’ purchasing power and ability to meet their obligations. If the strong growth in the cost of financing and maintenance costs continues and the market situation does not provide an opportunity to transfer the higher costs into rents in full  this can have a negative impact on the fair value of investment assets and the company’s ability to meet its obligations and to finance investments  which means that new investments and renovations will have to be postponed.The most significant risks in the renting of apartments are related to economic cycles and fluctuations in demand and supply. High new housing construction activity can increase the supply of rental housing to a point that it exceeds demand. This leads to rental housing vacancies and pressure to even out or lower the rent level  especially for the old housing portfolio.A weakening in the housing market and a higher interest rate level could have a negative impact on the market value of SATO’s housing portfolio. In accordance with its strategy  SATO focusses its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing its existing housing portfolio  thus ensuring the rental potential of its apartments and the development of their value.Changes in official regulations and legislation  as well as the uncertainty stemming from them  may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and thus on SATO’s business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group’s treasury policy  which has been approved by SATO’s Board of Directors. Our financial risk management principles are defined in the treasury policy. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other long-term financing commitments. The company has a valid EUR 2.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme.The means for managing the liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  committed credit facilities of EUR 600 million and a commercial paper programme of EUR 400 million. We increase the amount of reserves as the financing requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans form an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by issuing fixed rate loans or by interest rate hedges. According to our treasury policy  our objective is to keep the ratio of fixed rate loans at over 60% of debt portfolio after interest hedging. At the end of the review period  the fixed rate portion of the loan portfolio after hedging was 66.3% (excluding short-term loans).A more detailed description of risks and risk management is available on the Group’s website www.sato.fi/en.Pending legal actionsSATO has no official procedures  legal actions or arbitration proceedings pending that would have a significant impact on the company’s financial standing or profitability  and SATO is not aware of any threat of such proceedings.SharesOn 31 December 2023  the share capital of SATO Corporation was EUR 4 442 192.00 and there were 56 783 067 shares.

The auditor’s term in office is the financial year  and the auditor’s duties end at the closing of the next Annual General Meeting.Members of the Management GroupDuring the financial year 2023  the Corporate Management Group consisted of Antti Aarnio  President and CEO  Arto Aalto  EVP  Investments  Markku Honkasalo  CFO  Janne Ojalehto  CCO (until 27 January 2023)  Laura Laamanen  CCO (as of 11 May 2023) and Elina Vaurasalo  EVP  Housing Business.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO’s business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  the development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  the general competitive situation and interest rates.Finland’s economic growth was negative in 2023. According to the Bank of Finland’s December projection  increased prices  higher interest rates and the consumers’ weak confidence in the economy will slow economic growth also in 2024.Inflation slowed strongly in late 2023 as a result of lower energy prices  tightened monetary policy and easing of supply bottlenecks. Core inflation has remained above the European Central Bank’s (ECB) target  but the markets expect the ECB to start interest rate cuts during 2024. The slowing inflation and falling interest rates  coupled with households’ decent income development  will increase households’ purchasing power. Employment is expected to weaken slightly in 2024 but to improve as of 2025.The continued high level of new housing production has kept competition for good tenants tight and rent increases moderate  and it has not been possible to pass the higher maintenance and financing costs on to rents in full. Higher material costs and interest rates have led to housing starts decreasing almost without interruption since early 2022. The construction of new housing has been in a steep fall in 2023 and the fall will continue in 2024.There is demand for housing in growth centres thanks to immigration and internal migration. According to Statistics Finland  the Helsinki metropolitan area’s net positive migration rate in 2023 was clearly higher than in the previous year  whereas the number of people moving out was smaller. Of the municipalities in the area  Helsinki and Espoo experienced the highest net positive migration rates.Decreasing new housing production and population growth in growth centres will reduce supply and increase demand for rental apartments  which will likely translate into higher rents in the future.As tenants have a wider array of choices  a successful customer experience is more important than ever. SATO is investing strongly in increasing its customer presence and developing digital services.In line with its majority shareholder’s operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2024 earnings.

Net sales decreased by 4.4%.Adjusted operating profit for the final quarter was EUR 7.2 million (9.6) and operating profit was EUR 6.7 million (12.9). The operating profit for the comparison period was improved by a gain of EUR 4.3 million from the sale of the renewable energy sources business. Earnings per share were EUR 0.14 (0.29).Net sales for 2023 amounted to EUR 802.1 million (844.1). The comparison period included EUR 35.4 million of net sales from the renewable energy sources business. Adjusted operating profit was EUR 39.0 million (40.9) and operating profit was EUR 38.4 million (42.9). The operating profit for the comparison year was improved by a gain of EUR 4.3 million from the sale of the renewable energy sources business. Earnings per share were EUR 0.79 (0.83).Net cash flow from operating activities after investments was strong at EUR 50.9 million (41.1) and net cash flow from operating activities after investments per share was EUR 1.33 (1.08).The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 0.49 per share.Outlook for the year 2024Net sales in 2024 are estimated to be at the same level as in the previous year  and operating profit is estimated to be at the same level or better compared to the previous year.PRESIDENT AND CEO EERO HAUTANIEMI:“Net sales for 2023 amounted to EUR 802.1 million (844.1). The comparison period included EUR 35.4 million of net sales from the renewable energy sources business. Adjusted operating profit was EUR 39.0 million (40.9). Net cash flow from operating activities was strong at EUR 93.6 million (71.8)  as was the Group’s financial position. In 2023  the increase in production costs affected all of L&T’s divisions  as did the labour market decisions reached in the late spring  which included one-off items.In the Environmental Services division  the decline in general economic activity was reflected in lower waste volumes and the prices of recycled raw materials throughout the year. The decrease in the prices and volumes of recycled raw materials burdened the net sales of the division and had a negative effect of EUR 4.5 million on the operating profit.The Finnish Waste Act was amended in July 2021. Under the reform  municipalities take on a larger role in organising the collection of packaging material waste and biowaste from housing properties. As a consequence of the reform  L&T’s direct customer agreements with residential properties on the separate collection of packaging waste and biowaste are transferred to municipalities for competitive bidding gradually between 1 July 2022 and 1 July 2025.As a result of municipalisation  EUR 40 million of the value of the Finnish waste management market was moved out of the scope of free competition to municipal waste companies during 2022-2023. The effects of this change were fully visible on the division starting from the latter half of 2023. L&T estimates that based on decisions made by the end of year 2023  a further EUR 30 million will be moved out of the scope of free competition to municipal waste companies between 2024 and 2026.In the latter half of the year  the collection of packaging waste from residential properties was transferred to municipal waste companies in several geographical areas that are significant to L&T. L&T participates in the competitive tendering of municipal contracts. During 2023 competitive tendering of municipal contracts is estimated to have amounted to EUR 15-20 million and the Group won municipal contracts amounting to EUR 8 million. Nevertheless  the change transferred the ownership of the waste material collected from these residential properties  decreased additional sales and reduced the efficiency of L&T’s waste collection logistics increasing production costs. The change had a total negative impact of approximately EUR 2.5 million on operating profit in 2023.L&T aims to compensate for the impacts of municipalisation by growing the corporate customer business and continuing to improve the efficiency of operations during the next three years. In the division  measures to improve operational efficiency and profitability were initiated during the latter half of the year. The employment relationship of approximately 50 salaried employees are terminated as a result of change negotiations and other jointly agreed measures latest by the end of the first quarter of 2024.The Industrial Services division achieved a good result. Net sales increased in all of the division’s business lines. We carried out several large projects in the market for demanding industrial soil remediation projects in particular. Business operations in Sweden developed favorably despite the challenging market environment.The operating profit of Facility Services Finland improved significantly in 2023. Measures to streamline the cost structure and improve operational efficiency continued. Progress was achieved in digitalisation with the number of sites within the scope of data-driven cleaning increasing in 2023. In building technology services  the demand for energy efficiency services increased during the period under review.The customer agreements in Facility Services Sweden are mostly fixed-price contracts  and the division has not been able to pass the increased production costs on to customer prices. The division has a programme under way to simplify operating models and adapt them to the changed business environment. The results are expected to become visible by the end of 2024.In October 2023  Lassila & Tikanoja plc’s Board of Directors approved the company’s renewed strategy. Under the renewed strategy  the Environmental Services and Industrial Services divisions will seek new growth especially by focusing on business opportunities related to the circular economy of materials. Growth will be sought through organic development and potential selective acquisitions. In connection with the strategy review  the Board of Directors decided to evaluate the strategic alternatives for Facility Services Finland and Facility Services Sweden as part of the company’s business portfolio development. The sale of operations is one possible option. This strategic evaluation progressed according to plan in the fourth quarter.”GROUP NET SALES AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEOctober–DecemberNet sales for the fourth quarter amounted to EUR 200.9 million (210.1)  representing a year-on-year decrease of 4.4%. Adjusted operating profit was EUR 7.2 million (9.6)  representing 3.6% (4.6%) of net sales. Operating profit was EUR 6.7 million (12.9)  or 3.3% (6.2%) of net sales. Earnings per share were EUR 0.14 (0.29).Net sales increased in Industrial Services and decreased in the other divisions. Operating profit improved in Industrial Services and Facility Services Finland  and declined in Environmental Services and Facility Services Sweden.The result for the fourth quarter was affected positively by L&T’s EUR 1.1 million (0.9) share of the profit of the joint venture Laania Oy. The operating profit for the comparison period was improved by a gain of EUR 4.3 million from the sale of the renewable energy sources business.Year 2023Net sales for 2023 amounted to EUR 802.1 million (844.1)  a decrease of 5.0% year-on-year. Excluding the effect of the renewable energy sources business  net sales were on a par with the comparison period and the rate of organic growth was -0.9%. Adjusted operating profit was EUR 39.0 million (40.9)  representing 4.9% (4.8%) of net sales. Operating profit was EUR 38.4 million (42.9)  or 4.8% (5.1%) of net sales. Earnings per share were EUR 0.79 (0.83).Net sales increased in Industrial Services and decreased in the other divisions. Operating profit improved in Industrial Services and Facility Services Finland  and declined in Environmental Services and Facility Services Sweden.The result for the financial year was affected positively by the fair value of EUR 1.3 million of an interest rate swap being recognised in financial items due to the termination of the interest rate swap. The result for the period was also affected positively by L&T’s EUR 3.6 million (0.7) share of the profit of the joint venture Laania Oy. The operating profit for the comparison year was improved by a gain of EUR 4.3 million from the sale of the renewable energy sources business.Financial summary10–12/2023 10–12/2022 Change % 1–12/2023 1–12/2022 Change % Net sales  EUR million 200.9 210.1 -4.4 802.1 844.1 -5.0 Adjusted operating profit  EUR million 7.2 9.6 -25.4 39.0 40.9 -4.7 Adjusted operating margin  % 3.6 4.6 4.9 4.8 Operating profit  EUR million 6.7 12.9 -48.6 38.4 42.9 -10.6 Operating margin  % 3.3 6.2 4.8 5.1 EBITDA  EUR million 20.5 26.5 -22.7 95.8 98.3 -2.6 EBITDA  % 10.2 12.6 11.9 11.6 Earnings per share  EUR 0.14 0.29 -54.0 0.79 0.83 -4.6 Net cash flow from operating activitiesafter investments per share  EUR 0.60 1.05 -43.3 1.33 1.08 23.7 Return on equity (ROE)  % 13.3 14.6 Capital employed  EUR million 425.9 437.2 -2.6 Return on capital employed (ROCE)  % 10.3 10.4 Equity ratio  % 36.8 34.3 Gearing  % 69.3 75.9NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT BY DIVISIONEnvironmental ServicesOctober–DecemberThe division’s net sales for the fourth quarter decreased to EUR 68.9 million (71.1).

The renewable energy sources business was reported as a part of the Environmental Services division until the end of the second quarter of 2022.The focus of the Environmental Services division is heavily on corporate customers and producer responsibility organisation customers  and their number grew in the beginning of the year and stabilised in the fourth quarter. In the Environmental Services division  the decline in general economic activity was reflected in lower waste volumes and the prices of recycled raw materials throughout the year. The decrease in the prices and volumes of recycled raw materials burdened the net sales of the division and had a negative effect of EUR 4.5 million on the operating profit.The Finnish Waste Act was amended in July 2021.

Related assessments were initiated in the latter part of the year.There is a significant systems renewal project under way in Environmental Services  which will also include the deployment of a new ERP system. The systems renewal project increased the division’s fixed costs in 2023. The supplier of the ERP system was changed in 2022 and  during the period under review  the previous supplier paid a one-off compensation relating to the termination of the co-operation. Expenses capitalised during the co-operation with the previous supplier were written down on the balance sheet during the review period. The one-off compensation and the related costs and write-down did not have a significant effect on the division’s operating profit. The system is scheduled to enter the deployment stage in the second half of 2024. The total investment in the system projects is estimated at approximately EUR 16.9 million  of which approximately EUR 14 2 million was realised by the end of 2023.Industrial ServicesOctober–DecemberThe division’s net sales for the final quarter were EUR 37.9 million (36.3). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 3.8 million (3.1) and operating profit was EUR 3.6 million (2.3). Operating profit was reduced by a change of EUR 0.2 million in the fair value of the deferred consideration related to the acquisition of Sand & Vattenbläst i Tyringe AB (“SVB”) recognised in the fourth quarter of 2023. The change in the fair value is due to SVB’s improved result which increases the final acquisition price recognised as liability. In the comparison period  the fair value change recognised in the deferred consideration related to the acquisition reduced operating profit by EUR 0.8 million.Year 2023The Industrial Services division’s full-year net sales in 2023 grew to EUR 141.0 million (132.0). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 14.0 million (13.6). Operating profit was EUR 13.8 million (12.7). Operating profit was reduced by a change of EUR 0.2 million in the fair value of the deferred consideration related to the acquisition of Sand & Vattenbläst i Tyringe AB (“SVB”) recognised in the fourth quarter of 2023. The change in the fair value is due to SVB’s improved result which increases the final acquisition price recognised as liability. In the comparison period  the fair value change recognised in the deferred consideration related to the acquisition reduced operating profit by EUR 0.8 million.Demand was strong in all of the Industrial Services division’s business lines. The environmental construction business line was highlighted as a focus area in L&T’s renewed strategy in the autumn  and several large customer projects  especially in demanding soil remediation  were carried out in the business line during the period under review. The customer volume increased in hazardous waste services. In process cleaning in Finland  the demand related to annual maintenance breaks was strong  and the resource allocation was successful. Business operations in Sweden developed favorably despite the challenging market environment.Facility Services FinlandOctober–DecemberThe division’s net sales for the final quarter were EUR 61.4 million (64.6). Operating profit was EUR 1.1 million (0.8).Year 2023The full-year net sales of the Environmental Services division decreased to EUR 250.0 million (256.3) in 2023. Operating profit improved to EUR 4.4 million (-0.5).In Facility Services Finland the measures initiated in the second half of 2022 to streamline the cost structure and improve operational efficiency continued in the division throughout the period under review.In 2023  the efficiency of production improved and personnel turnover decreased in cleaning services. Good progress was achieved in digitalisation with the number of sites within the scope of data-driven cleaning increasing in 2023. In building technology services  the demand for energy efficiency services increased during the period under review. The rising costs caused by high inflation were  for the most part  passed on to customer prices.Facility Services SwedenOctober–DecemberThe division’s net sales for the final quarter decreased to EUR 34.5 million (39.8). Operating profit was EUR -0.9 million (0.5). Operating profit before the amortisation of purchase price allocations of acquisitions was EUR -0.6 million (0.8).Year 2023The net sales of Facility Services Sweden amounted to EUR 133.2 million (140.4) in 2023. The decrease in net sales was due to the depreciation of the Swedish krona. Net sales denominated in the Swedish krona increased. Operating profit declined to EUR -3.7 million (0.4). Operating profit before the amortisation of purchase price allocations of acquisitions was EUR -2.5 million (2.2).Customer agreements in the Swedish business are mostly fixed-price contracts  and the division has not been able to pass the increased production costs on to customer prices. In the fourth quarter  the uncertainty in the business environment was reflected in customer demand  and fewer new projects were started than in the comparison period. The division has a programme under way to simplify operating models and adapt them to the changed business environment. The results are expected to become visible by the end of 2024.FINANCINGIn 2023  net cash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR 93.6 million (71.8). Net cash flow after investments totalled EUR 50.9 million (41.1). In the comparison period  net cash flow after investments was reduced by acquisitions  which had a total impact of approximately EUR 13 million. A total of EUR 5.1 million in working capital was released (EUR 6.2 million committed).At the end of the financial year  interest-bearing liabilities amounted to EUR 193.7 million (216.8). Net interest-bearing liabilities totalled EUR 160.9 million (167.3). The average interest rate on long-term loans  excluding lease liabilities  with interest rate hedging  was 4.0% (2.5%). In the second quarter  the company refinanced a EUR 50 million bank loan that would have matured in the third quarter of 2024. The new bank loan is in the amount of EUR 40 million and will mature in the third quarter of 2026. In addition to the usual financial covenants  the new bank loan is linked to sustainability targets  namely L&T’s carbon footprint and accident frequency. The interest rate swap used by the company to convert part of the EUR 50 million bank loan into a fixed interest loan was terminated in connection with the refinancing of the bank loan. The fair value of the interest rate swap  EUR 1.3 million  was recognised in financial income in the second quarter. The company had no interest rate swaps at the end of the financial year. In the third quarter  the company repaid the remaining amount of EUR 17.7 million of the bond issued in 2018.The EUR 100.0 million commercial paper programme was unused at the end of the financial year  as was the case in the comparison period. The account limit totalling EUR 10.0 million and the committed credit limit totalling EUR 40.0 million were not in use  as was the case in the comparison period.Net financial expenses amounted to EUR -6.3 million (-5.8). Net financial expenses were increased by the rise in the general interest rate level  which was compensated by the fair value of EUR 1.3 million of an interest rate swap being recognised due to the termination of the interest rate swap. The effect of exchange rate changes on net financial expenses was EUR -0.0 million (-0.2). Net financial expenses were 0.8% (0.7%) of net sales.The equity ratio was 36.8% (34.3%) and the gearing ratio was 69.3% (75.9%). The Group’s total equity was EUR 232.2 million (220.4). Cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 32.9 million (49.5) at the end of the financial year.DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONThe Annual General Meeting held on 23 March 2023 resolved that a dividend of EUR 0.47 per share  totalling EUR 17.9 million  be paid on the basis of the balance sheet that was adopted for the financial year 2022. The dividend was paid to shareholders on 3 April 2023.CAPITAL EXPENDITUREGross capital expenditure for 2023 came to EUR 61.1 million (58.2). The capital expenditure consisted primarily of machine and equipment purchases  as well as investments in information systems. Acquisitions accounted for approximately EUR 21 million of the gross capital expenditure in the comparison period.SUSTAINABILITYEnvironmental responsibilityClimate benefits for customers created by L&T2023 2022 TargetCarbon handprint (tCO 2 e)-453 000-534 500 growth faster than net salesThe carbon handprint illustrates the climate benefits of a product  process or service  i.e. the emission reduction potential for the user. L&T’s carbon handprint reduces the customer’s carbon footprint. Our services generated emission reductions for customers through  for example  customers replacing virgin raw materials with secondary raw materials  and fossil fuels with solid recovered fuels. The decline in L&T’s carbon handprint was due to the decline in waste material volumes  particularly in the construction segment  that reduces the amount material directed to recycling.The carbon handprint of the renewable energy sources business and the joint venture Laania is not reported as part of L&T’s carbon handprint for 2022. The renewable energy sources business was transferred to Laania joint venture in July 2022.Progress towards science-based emission reduction targets  using 2018 as the baseline2023 2022 Target Target to be achieved byCarbon footprint (tCO 2 e)31 20034 20024 4002030L&T’s strategic objective is to halve the carbon footprint of its operations by 2030  using 2018 as the baseline  and to reduce the indirect emissions generated by its supply chain. The emission reduction target set by L&T has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. The achievement of this objective will be promoted by switching to zero-emission transport technologies and fuels and by opting for renewable energy at L&T’s properties. Transport operations account for 95 per cent of the emissions generated by L&T’s own operations. The use of renewable fuels increased significantly year-on-year  particularly in the Industrial Services division’s fleet of heavy vehicles.The fuel distribution obligation was adjusted in 2022 by reducing the biofuel component by 7.5 percentage points. The change was not taken into account in the emissions calculations reported in L&T’s annual report published in March 2023  as Statistics Finland had not yet updated its fuel classification data in accordance with the change. Statistics Finland published the updated fuel classification data later in spring 2023  and they have been taken into account in the emission calculations in this report.Recycling rate and material recovery2023 2022 Target Target to be achieved by Recycling rate of material flows managed by L&T  % 57.8 59.4 65 2026The recycling rate is the weighted average of our customers’ recycling rates. It also includes materials that cannot yet be recycled. To increase our reuse and recycling rate  we actively look for new material streams whose refining rate we can increase. Reporting covers municipal waste collected from corporate customers  hazardous waste  industrial waste and construction waste in Finland. Slurry  contaminated soil and ash are excluded from reporting.Social responsibilityTotal recordable incident frequency (TRIF)2023 2022 Target Target to be achieved by Total recordable incident frequency2323152030L&T eliminates hazards and improves its own safety as well as the safety of customers and other stakeholders through effective proactive measures  such as risk assessments  safety observations  Safety Walks and occupational safety sessions. L&T has provided training on building workplace safety culture to over 80% of the company’s supervisors in Finland as part of the Safety under the helmet training initiative.Well-being at work2023 2022 Target Target to be achieved by Occupational health rate (proportion of employees with no sickness-related absences)4140572026Sickness-related absences (%)5.15.642030The objective of L&T’s personnel policies and plans is to ensure that the number  competence and retention of personnel are at the level required for effective performance. For a labour-intensive company  employees’ ability to work and function and maintain it throughout their careers until retirement on old-age pension is important.CURRENT ISSUES RELATED TO SUSTAINABILITYL&T updated its environmental sustainability target in October 2023. The goal is to halve the emissions of L&T’s own operations by 2030 from the level in 2018 and to reduce indirect (Scope 3) emissions by 18% by 2030 from the level in 2022. The company has set a target of net-zero emissions by 2045.L&T was awarded Gold  which is the second-best rating  in the international EcoVadis sustainability assessment. Each year  EcoVadis assesses approximately 90 000 globally operating companies  of which only 5% reach the Gold level.The sustainability results presented in this report have not yet been verified. L&T’s verified sustainability figures will be published in the Annual Report in week 9.PERSONNELThe average number of employees converted into full-time equivalents was 6 743 (6 820).

Under the reforms to the Waste Act  municipalities take on a larger role in organising the collection of packaging waste materials and biowaste from residential properties. As a consequence of the reform  L&T’s direct customer agreements with residential properties on the separate collection of packaging waste and biowaste will be transferred to municipalities for competitive bidding gradually between 1 July 2022 and 1 July 2025. As a result of municipalisation  approximately EUR 30 million of the Finnish waste management market will be moved out of the scope of free competition and to municipally owned companies between the years 2024-2026. The Environmental Services division participates in competitive tendering for municipal contracts and is a significant player in municipal contracts  but the Group estimates that the overall impact of the change will be negative.The company has several ERP system renewal projects under way. Temporary additional costs arising from system deployments and establishing the operating model may weigh down the company’s result.Production costs may be increased by challenges related to employee turnover and labour availability.The geopolitical situation involves continued uncertainty due to Russia’s war of aggression. The indirect impacts on overall economic activity in Finland and Sweden may have a negative impact on net sales and profit.The Group company Lassila & Tikanoja FM AB is a claimant and a defendant in legal proceedings in Sweden concerning unpaid receivables invoiced from a former customer of the Group. In June 2022  Lassila & Tikanoja FM AB took legal action in the District Court of Solna against the former customer company of L&T  demanding payment for unpaid receivables. At the balance sheet date  the carrying amount of the receivables in the Company’s balance sheet was approximately EUR 1.5 million. L&T’s former customer company in question has rejected Lassila & Tikanoja FM AB’s claims and the payment obligation  and brought a counterclaim demanding compensation totalling approximately SEK 116 million from Lassila & Tikanoja FM AB. The dispute is still pending. Lassila & Tikanoja considers the counterclaim to be without merit and has not recognised any provisions in relation to it.More detailed information on Lassila & Tikanoja’s risks and risk management is provided in the 2022 Annual Review and in the Report by the Board of Directors and the consolidated financial statements.PROPOSAL FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF PROFITAccording to the financial statements  Lassila & Tikanoja plc’s unrestricted equity amounts to EUR 51 335 173.21  with the profit for the period representing EUR 7 420 038.45 of this total. There were no substantial changes in the financial standing of the company after the end of the period  and the solvency test referred to in Chapter 13  Section 2 of the Companies Act does not affect the amount of distributable profits.The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 0.49 per share be paid for the financial year 2023. The dividend will be paid to shareholders entered in the company’s shareholder register maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy on the record date  25 March 2024. The Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the dividend be paid on 3 April 2024.No dividend shall be paid on shares held by the company on the record date of the dividend payment  25 March 2024.On the day the proposal for the distribution of profit was made  the number of shares entitling to dividend was 38 154 102  which means the total amount of the dividend would be EUR 18 695 509.98. The Group’s earnings per share amounted to EUR 0.79. The proposed dividend  EUR 0.49 per share  is 62.1% of the Group’s earnings per share.Lassila & Tikanoja’s Annual Report  which includes the Report by the Board of Directors and the financial statements for 2023  will be published in week 9 at vuosikertomus.lt.fi/en .Helsinki  8 February 2024LASSILA & TIKANOJA PLCBoard of DirectorsEero HautaniemiPresident and CEOFor additional information  please contact:Eero Hautaniemi  President and CEO  tel. +358 10 636 2810Valtteri Palin  CFO  tel. +358 40 734 7749Lassila & Tikanoja is a service company that is putting the circular economy into practice.

Immediately upon completion of this acquisition  VISIATIV's shareholders acting in concert would transfer to ALLIATIV a total of 252 801 VISIATIV shares (representing approximately 5.48% of VISIATIV's share capital) at a price of €37.00 per VISIATIV share (cum dividend).This price per share of €37.00 (cum dividend) values 100% of VISIATIV's share capital (on a fully-diluted basis) at €170 697 872.Laurent Fiard  co-founder and CEO of VISIATIV  as well as certain senior executives and managers  would remain involved in VISIATIV's development project:Laurent Fiard would retain part of his shareholding interest in ALLIATIV; andCertain senior executives and managers would re-invest a portion of their current shareholding interests in ALLIATIV's capital in a dedicated holding company based on a value by transparency equal to a price of €37.00 per VISIATIV share and would sell their remaining shares to Groupe SNEF for a cash payment based on that same value.Groupe SNEF would therefore acquire control of ALLIATIV and  indirectly of VISIATIV  through ALLIATIV (which would  upon completion of the initial acquisition  own approximately 46.90% of the capital[1] and approximately 61.81% of the voting rights in VISIATIV). The VISIATIV group will continue to be run by the current management team.The price of €37.00 per VISIATIV share (cum dividend) reflects premiums of:+35.5% compared with the share closing price on 8 February 2024 €27.30;+38.5% compared with the volume-weighted average share price of the preceding 20 trading days;+51.0% compared with the volume-weighted average share price of the preceding 60 trading days;+46.7% compared with the volume-weighted average share price of the preceding 120 trading days;VISIATIV's Board of Directors reacts favourably to the proposed transactionVISIATIV's Board of Directors  at a meeting held on 7 February  reacted favourably to the prospect of Groupe SNEF acquiring control  subject to receiving a fairness opinion from an independent expert. Laurent Fiard and Christian Donzel did not take part in the discussions or the vote at this board meeting.The Board of Directors decided to initiate an information-consultation procedure with VISIATIV's employee representative bodies.The Board of Directors also decided to appoint an ad hoc committee comprising Benoit Soury  independent director (who will be Chairman of the committee)  Pascale Dumas  independent director  and Hubert Jaricot  independent director  and which will be in charge of the process of examining the offer and of the steps required to issue a reasoned opinion when the time comes.An independent expert will shortly be appointed by the Board of Directors with the task of preparing a report on the financial terms of the tender offer in accordance with the provisions of Article 261-1 of the AMF's General Regulations (Autorité des marchés financiers - the French financial market authority). VISIATIV will keep the market informed of the process for appointing the independent expert  his or her appointment  and the details concerning completion of his or her assignment.Main terms and conditions of the tender offer and timetableAny final agreements could only be signed after completion of the information-consultation procedure with VISIATIV's employee representative bodies. Completion of the transaction therefore is subject to potentially entering into the final documentation and to obtaining the usual regulatory authorisations regarding merger control  as well as to the formal approval of certain VISIATIV's commercial partners.In the event of completion of the proposed transaction  ALLIATIV  controlled by Groupe SNEF  will file a mandatory tender offer for the remaining outstanding VISIATIV shares and all the free shares that may be issued before the close of the tender offer  at a price of €37.00 per share (cum dividend). Any share warrants that have not been redeemed or exercised by 14 June 2024 will lapse.In this respect  VISIATIV's Board of Directors will be required to issue its reasoned opinion on the merits of the tender offer and on its consequences for VISIATIV  its shareholders and its employees. This reasoned opinion will be prepared on the basis of the report drawn up by the independent expert and the opinion of the employee representative bodies  and will be reproduced in the draft response document prepared by VISIATIV.ALLIATIV intends to request the implementation of a squeeze-out following the tender offer if the minority shareholders of VISIATIV who have not tendered their shares in the offer were to represent less than 10% of the capital and voting rights in VISIATIV. The squeeze-out would be carried out based on a compensation equal to the price proposed in the offer  namely €37.00 per share (cum dividend).Completion of the tender offer shall be subject to review and a compliance decision issued by the French financial market authority  the AMF  with such completion possibly taking place in the 2nd half of 2024.

The problems faced by the sector during the reporting year also affected SATO and had an impact on the company’s business. The high interest rates and high inflation that continued until the end of the year raised costs and impacted consumers’ purchasing power. Competition continued to be tough on the rental markets and new construction of rental apartments remained brisk  especially in the Helsinki metropolitan area. Despite this  SATO’s financial position remained strong and SATO’s customer experience continued its positive development.As proof of its owners’ confidence in SATO  a share issue of up to EUR 200 million started up in December  the goal of which is to bolster the company’s equity ratio and balance sheet and to reduce interest-bearing liabilities. The share issue offers us more extensive financing options and strengthens our financial position. The company's majority shareholder  Balder Finska Otas AB (Fastighets AB Balder)  has announced that it will support the issue ending on 14 February 2024.Economic uncertainty continued in Finland in 2023. The high inflation finally turned downward at the end of the year  especially once energy prices fell. However  underlying inflation remained persistently high and exceeded the central banks’ goal of 2%. The European Central Bank continued to raise the key interest rate during the reporting year  as a result of which inflation gradually slowed down throughout Europe. The markets forecasted after all that the peak would be reached in late 2023.Urbanisation continues  and dense urban living is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. There will continue to be demand for rental apartments in growth centres near good public transport connections and services also in the future. Of the major cities  the Helsinki metropolitan area and Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy robust growth. The Helsinki metropolitan area is expected to grow by over 200 000 new residents by 2040. Close to 80% of the area’s residents already live in one- to two-person households  and the number of small households continues to rise. The proportion of immigrants living in the capital area is predicted to grow from the current 17% to 25% by 2030.Despite the downturn  plenty of new apartments were under construction  particularly in the Helsinki metropolitan area. A record number (7 000–8 000) of apartments intended solely for rent were completed in the Helsinki metropolitan area during the reporting year.In 2024  approximately another 4 000 rental apartments will be completed.SATO has focussed its operations on the Helsinki metropolitan area and its surrounding municipalities  and Tampere and Turku. During the reporting year  an era came to an end when we finalised the sale of our Russian business in April. Since the sale  SATO no longer has any business operations in Russia.During the reporting year  close to a thousand new and about 500 renovated rental apartments were completed for SATO in Espoo  Helsinki  Tampere  Turku and Vantaa. As a result of dramatically increased costs and higher financing prices  we decided in October 2022 that we would not initiate new investments for the time being. In 2024  only just over 400 new and renovated rental homes will be completed for SATO.High inflation has also impacted consumers’ purchasing power  which  together with a high cost of living  affects the rental apartment markets. The employment situation became weaker in Finland during the reporting year  and the situation is expected to weaken further in 2024. Finns have less and less income to spend  which means that they have to primarily focus on their necessary expenses  such as housing  as their extra leisure spending decreases.Since the Covid years  competition between housing providers has been tight with the extensive offering of apartments exceeding demand. Housing providers have competed over good tenants and  as a result  rent increases have fallen behind real costs. Inflation and rising costs of financing may show up in higher rents when the housing supply decreases.Regardless of the real estate sector’s challenges  SATO has continued to focus on development work to increase and improve our presence near customers. We have received good feedback on our house experts and service managers who work in our buildings. We have developed and modernised our digital operating environment and operational information systems that enable us to work more efficiently and serve our customers better at all times of the day and night. As a result of our development efforts  our Net Promote Score (NPS) measuring customer satisfaction improved and was 23  and the NPS measuring different customer interactions was 53. Our tenant turnover fell during the reporting year and our economic occupancy rate was 94.9% (95.2).Sustainability is at the core of our operations. Our task is to meet  in particular  the needs of our residents and personnel. We have also discussed how we could collaborate with cities to improve development work around housing. With regard to our building portfolio  our focus is on achieving carbon neutrality in in-use energy consumption by the end of 2030. We continue to increase the use of geothermal heat and we completed the installation of solar power plants in 24 residential buildings around the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. The calculated solar power output generated locally at our properties in 2023 corresponds to the annual power consumption of roughly 250 apartments.We will report in more detail on our sustainability work in our Sustainability Report  which will be published on 16 February.In January 2023  SATO was awarded the Great Place To Work® certificate and ranked tenth in the list of Finland’s Best Workplaces in the large company category. I am extremely proud and grateful for this recognition as the entire organisation has worked long and hard to develop SATO’s culture. A total of 85% of SATO employees feel that SATO as a whole is a great place to work. Diversity  equality and inclusion are key factors through which we will continue to strengthen our understanding and competence among both our personnel and residents.This year has taught us a lot. Despite the sector’s challenges  SATO’s objective is to reinforce its foothold in the markets and achieve sustainable growth.I would like to thank all SATO employees  our partners and the residents living in SATOhomes for our successful co-operation during the past year.Antti Aarnio  President and CEOReport of the Board of Directors 1 January–31 December 2022Operating environmentFor SATO  2023 was marked by a tightened situation in the sector  Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine  higher interest rate costs  an inflation-driven rise in costs and the continued high supply of rental housing in relation to housing demand. The sharp rise in energy prices resulting from the war in Ukraine was reflected in the Finnish economy. Although an energy crisis was avoided  economic momentum remained weak throughout the reporting year as a result of prolonged inflation and high interest rates. The Finnish economy remained in a downturn in 2023  and according to the Bank of Finland’s December projection  the gross domestic product contracted by 0.5% in 2023.In 2023  headline inflation was at a high level  at around 4.4%. Core inflation persistently remained above the two per cent mark  which is why central banks continued their policy to tighten interest rates throughout the year. In late 2023  energy prices fell to a seasonally normal level and inflation began to fall. Consumers’ confidence in their own finances remained low  which translated into cautious spending. The employment rate stopped rising and declined as economic growth stalled. The employment situation is expected to weaken further in 2024. On the other hand  inflation has slowed  interest rate costs are expected to fall and households’ purchasing power is expected to increase. These developments are anticipated to have a positive impact on Finland’s economy.The housing sector was impacted by economic uncertainty  a high interest rate level and a rise in living costs. The outlook for housing construction darkened to an exceptional degree in 2023 as a result of rising costs and weaker demand. The record-low demand for housing also had a significant impact on housing starts for both owner-occupied and rental apartments. According to the Confederation of Finnish Construction Industries  housing starts contracted dramatically in 2023  although previously started projects kept the supply high in the Helsinki metropolitan area during 2023.Strong demographic growth is expected to continue in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku  while growth in the whole country will likely start to decline in 2031. The population of the Helsinki metropolitan area is expected to grow by over 200 000 new residents by 2040. Close to 80% of the area’s residents already live in one- to two-person households  and the number of small households continues to rise. The proportion of immigrants living in the capital area is predicted to grow from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. Ageing populations typically move closer to growth centres and the services they offer  and they also increasingly expect housing-related services. The change in the population structure and development in the prices of owner-occupied apartments create a stable foundation for demand for rental housing especially in the capital area and in Tampere and Turku.Despite positive internal migration  competition for good tenants remained tight during the reporting year  and rent increases remained moderate. Housing providers have not been able to pass the actual cost rises on to rents. The increased cost level creates pressure to increase rents in the upcoming years.Economic uncertainty may have a positive impact on the demand for rental apartments. Some of those looking for an owner-occupied apartment may also consider rental housing as an option.Recovery from the downturn is expected to happen slowly. Prices have risen and consumers’ confidence is weak. The Bank of Finland projected  already in December 2023  that economic growth in 2024 would be negative 0.2%. The employment situation is expected to weaken slightly further in 2024. Economic growth is forecast to improve in 2025  as a result of which the employment situation will also take an upward turn.StrategySATO is a housing investment company operating in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku.

The average maturity of loans was 2.8 years (3.3).The calculated impact of changes in the market value of interest hedging on equity was EUR -13.4 million (48.1). The proportion of unsecured loans was 85.4% of all loans. At the end of the year  the proportion of unencumbered assets was 87.7% of the balance sheet.Issue of sharesMaintenance costs have increased due to persistently high inflation  and the dramatically risen interest rate level has simultaneously led to a significant rise in financing costs. In the current market situation  it has not been possible to pass the costs on to apartment rents in full. Supply has exceeded demand in the Finnish housing market as a result of intense construction activity in recent years.In an effort to improve the company’s financial position  the company’s Board of Directors launched  based on the authorisation granted by the General Meeting in December 2023  a share issue of up to EUR 200.0 million. The share issue is aimed at strengthening the company’s equity ratio and balance sheet and at reducing interest-bearing liabilities. The company’s largest shareholder  Balder Finska Otas AB (Fastighets AB Balder)  has announced that it will support the issue ending on 14 February 2024.Group structureSATO Corporation is the parent company of SATO Group. At the end of the reporting year  the parent company had a total of 13 subsidiaries (21) engaged in business operations. Mergers were completed during the year in order to clarify the Group structure.SATO Corporation’s majority shareholder is Balder Finska Otas AB  whose parent company is Fastighets AB Balder  which is quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.Housing businessOur housing business consists of rental activities  customer service  life-cycle management and maintenance. We strive to provide home-seekers with a quick access to a home  a steady cash flow for the Group through effective rental activities and smooth digital services. High-quality property maintenance ensures the comfort of residents and that the apartments stay in good condition and retain their value. Customer focus and good service are the foundation for our interactions with our customers.During the year under review  apartment rental activities slowed and competition among housing providers tightened especially in growth centres. A large number of new rental apartments were completed in Espoo  Helsinki  Tampere and Turku  giving residents a wider choice.SATO had approximately 43 000 customers at the end of the year under review. The economic occupancy rate decreased compared to the previous year. Our occupancy rate was 94.9%. We boosted the organisation’s activities by improving the service processes  among other things. We also developed customer experience measurement and reporting. Our goal going forward is to further reinforce our presence in our customers’ daily lives and to offer them the best possible service.At the end of the year  67 house experts and 7 team leaders worked in SATO’s house expert organisation. Their primary task is to ensure  together with the maintenance company  that SATO’s buildings are comfortable and well-maintained. The house expert model is now in use to its full extent in the properties wholly owned by SATO in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku.We serve our customers through various channels  also during the weekend. In addition to personal service  our customer service can be reached via the chat service at sato.fi/en  where our customers receive help from our service experts and the SATObot  which is on duty 24/7. Multiculturalism is part of our daily life  and we can serve our customers in about 20 languages. We constantly work on improving our digital services together with our customers.Improved customer service and development measures carried out in different service processes improved the customer experience in many respects. In the beginning of the reporting year  we launched the concept of good encounters for all SATO employees  describing the way we interact with one another  our customers  partners and stakeholders. We want to interact with our customers with the same warmth in both digital channels and face-to-face service situations and settings. We ask our customers for their feedback on how we have succeeded in our interactions through various transactional surveys  and we monitor customer feedback using an indicator measuring interaction.SATO’s customer experience is made up of multiple factors  such as how well the customer’s home meets their needs  home removal situations and digital and face-to-face interaction with SATO employees. The concept of good encounters serves as a tool for all SATO employees and helps us ensure a familiar and consistent service experience. In 2023  we measured the company’s customer satisfaction using the Net Promoter Score (NPS) index. Our NPS during residency was 23 and the NPS for various transactional situations was 53. The latter is based on feedback from customers in various encounters  such as customer service phone calls  maintenance services provided by house experts  apartment offers and apartment viewings.Economic occupancy rate was 94.9% on average (95.2). The external tenant turnover rate for rental apartments was 26.8% (28.4). Rental income decreased 1.0% and was EUR 288.4 million (291.2). The average monthly rent of SATO’s rental apartments at the end of the reporting year was EUR 18.07 (17.84) per m2. Net rental income for apartments was EUR 198.7 million (200.4).Investment propertiesOn 31 December 2023  SATO owned a total of 25 468 apartments (24 999). During the reporting year  978 rental apartments (191) were completed for SATO  and a total of 349 rental apartments (1 327) were under construction. The number of divested rental apartments was 530.EUR 99.1 million (93.9) was spent on repairing and upgrading apartments. During the reporting year  renovation was completed for 545 apartments and renovation was underway in 56 apartments.On 14 April 2023  we completed the divestment of our Russian business. SATO operated in St. Petersburg as of 2007  and the company owned 522 rental apartments there. After the sale  SATO has no business operations in Russia.Fair valueThe development of the value of rental apartments is a key factor for SATO. The housing stock is focussed on areas and apartment sizes that are expected to grow in demand in the long term. The allocation of building repairs is based on life-cycle plans and repair need specifications.The fair value of investment properties on 31 December 2023 totalled EUR 4 885.7 million (5 044.2). The change in the value of investment properties  including investments and divestments in the financial year  was EUR -158.5 million (11.4).The value of properties funded with ARAVA loans or interest-subsidised loans would be EUR 260 million higher when valuated with income value method.The external expert JLL Finland Oy (JLL) issues a biannual statement on the valuation methods applied by SATO  the appropriateness of sources of information used and the quality and credibility of the valuation for Finnish investment properties. JLL’s latest statement was issued on the valuation carried out on 31 December 2023. The criteria for the determination of the fair value are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.The change in value was mainly influenced by the increase in yield requirements.At the end of the year  the Helsinki metropolitan area’s commuting area accounted for some 86.9%  Tampere for some 7.5% and Turku for 5.6% of the value of apartments.Investments  divestments and property developmentInvestment activities are used to manage the housing portfolio and prepare the ground for growth. SATO’s investments in the 2000s in non-subsidised rental apartments total more than EUR 3 billion. SATO acquires and builds entire rental buildings and single rental apartments. Property development allows for new investments in rental apartments. The rental potential and value of rental apartments owned by SATO are developed through repair activities  which help increase comfort and improve energy efficiency.In response to continued strong urbanisation  SATO invests  in addition to Helsinki  Espoo and Vantaa  also in their surrounding municipalities and in Tampere  Turku and their surrounding municipalities. Investments in rental apartments were EUR 150.0 million (190.5). Investments in the Helsinki metropolitan area represented 89.1% of all investments in the reporting year. Investments in new apartments represented 46.1% of the investments. In addition  SATO’s binding purchase agreements in Finland on 31 December 2023 totalled EUR 17.4 million (114.3). During the reporting year  530 rental apartments (2 021) were divested. These totalled EUR 52.6 million (210.6).The book value of plot reserves totalled EUR 44.3 million (40.8) at the end of the reporting year. The value of new plots acquired by SATO by the end of December 2023 totalled EUR 0.8 million (18.4).The permitted building volume for approximately 1 200 apartments is being developed for the plots in the company’s housing portfolio. The aim is to utilise the existing infrastructure  create a denser urban structure and bring more residents close to services and good public transport connections.We engage in urban development together with cities and other operators in the sector. Developing urban districts benefits not only the future residents of new apartments  but also the existing residents  as services improve and the urban environment develops. As a long-term property owner  housing investor and housing provider  SATO has the will to build nice homes  residential areas and pleasant urban areas for decades to come.During the reporting year  we continued the development of  among other areas  Itäkeskus in Helsinki  Soukka in Espoo and Tohloppi  Tampere. In Helsinki  we are involved in developing the Puotila metro station area and the Puhos and Stoa area into a new centre for East Helsinki. In Espoo’s Soukka  we are developing  together with the city  the Soukka centre area through complementary construction of SATO’s residential buildings located in the immediate vicinity of the metro station.In the spring  we launched a complementary planning project in Tohloppi  Tampere  aimed at building two new residential buildings owned by SATO in West Tampere. SATO also has several development projects underway in Espoo  Helsinki  Järvenpää  Kirkkonummi  Tampere  Turku and Vantaa.During the reporting year  plots in areas developed by SATO were sold to construction companies and other partners. This enables the construction of approximately 120 owner-occupied apartments and one grocery store  thus promoting the diverse development of the residential areas.During the reporting year  close to a thousand new rental apartments were completed for SATO. In the Helsinki metropolitan area  apartments were completed in Espoo (Vermonniitty and Karakallio)  in Helsinki (Veräjämäki) and in Vantaa (Hakunila and Keimolanmäki). New rental apartments were also completed in Tampere (Hervantajärvi) and Turku (Skanssi).We renovate the rental homes and properties we own according to the life-cycle principle. Renovations were completed in more than 500 apartments in Helsinki (Etelä-Haaga  Pitäjänmäki  Kallio  Etu-Töölö and Pohjois-Haaga). In Vantaa  renovations were completed at the property located in Martinlaakso.Housing starts have been at an all-time low in the entire sector. The supply of new rental apartments will strongly decrease over the next few years. In autumn 2022  we decided not to initiate any new investments for the time being. Behind the decision were higher financing costs and the rise in construction and maintenance costs driven by dramatically increased inflation. In 2024  SATO will see the completion of a total of 349 new rental apartments in Tuusula (Hyrylä) and Espoo (Finnoo). Renovations will be completed in a 56-apartment property located in Kallio  Helsinki.We are committed to improving the energy efficiency of our properties and we are increasing local production of renewable energy at our properties. More information about our energy efficiency work can be found in the sustainability section.SustainabilityDuring the reporting year  our sustainability work was governed by SATO’s strategy and our sustainability programme for 2023–2026  according to which our goal is to be a forerunner in sustainable rental housing. The themes of our sustainability programme are sustainable housing (environmental responsibility)  the well-being of communities (social responsibility) and profitable business sustainably (financial and administrative responsibility). Our programme’s policies are linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). During the year  we advanced sustainability work in line with the targets in all areas.In line with our sustainability programme  we focussed on the following themes in the area of environmental responsibility: carbon neutrality and energy efficiency  circular economy and biodiversity. SATO’s goal is to be carbon neutral by the end of 2030 when it comes to in-use energy consumption. During the reporting year  we drew up a carbon roadmap  which specifies our interim targets and actions to achieve our carbon neutrality goal. In addition to continuous measures to improve energy efficiency  we invest in locally produced renewable energy. For example  by the end of 2030  we will switch over to geothermal heat in all our homes located in Helsinki wherever possible and where it also makes financial sense. We continuously collaborate with energy suppliers in order to save energy and increase carbon neutral energy solutions  among other things.SATO’s goal is to promote material efficiency and the circular economy both during building use and in new building construction and renovation projects. We participated in the circular economy project of the City of Helsinki  aimed at bringing together construction sector parties to discuss ways to promote circular economy.During the reporting year  we prepared SATO’s first biodiversity roadmap for 2024–2026  which is based on charting the current state and a materiality analysis. Our goal is to slow down biodiversity loss and improve biodiversity in housing development and in the areas where our existing buildings are located. We take biodiversity into consideration in everything we do  initiate actions to improve biodiversity in our properties and develop our competence in biodiversity issues.An external  independent sustainability panel consisting of experts in sustainable production and consumption selected eight of SATO’s renovated buildings for the Ostavastuullisesti.fi website in autumn 2023: Ansaritie 1A and 2–4 (Etelä-Haaga  Helsinki)  Graniittitie 8 and 13 (Pihlajamäki  Helsinki)  Kannelkuja 6 (Itä-Hakkila  Helsinki)  Piispantie 3 and 5 as well as Rikhard Nymanintie 3 (Pitäjänmäki  Helsinki) and Porttikuja 11 (Kontula  Helsinki). For the time being  SATO is the only rental housing provider in the Ostavastuullisesti.fi service. The products or services selected for the website are more sustainable than other available options.We participated for the ninth time in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) assessment. SATO received three stars on a scale of one to five. SATO’s score in the Standing Investments Benchmark (existing properties) rose to 76 from the 73 points received in the previous year and in the Development Benchmark (construction projects)  SATO’s score rose to 79 points from 75 points in the previous year. In its peer group  SATO’s result represents the average of northern European housing investors. SATO’s strengths in the GRESB assessment were  for example  sustainability management  risk management  diverse stakeholder co-operation  a comprehensive health and well-being programme and measures for personnel  and issues related to tenants’ health and safety. Furthermore  based on the GRESB assessment  SATO’s improvement areas are describing processes and documentation related to material selection and monitoring in construction projects in more detail.Some of our sustainable housing measures are described below under “Impacts on the environment and society”.In the area of social responsibility  we focussed not only on supporting our employees’ well-being at work and competence development  but also on improving the comfort and well-being of our residents and promoting diversity and equality. In spring 2023  we launched the concept of good encounters  describing how we interact with other people. The concept creates a consistent approach to all interactions and serves as a tool for SATO employees. Its objective is to ensure that our customers can enjoy a consistent service experience regardless of the situation and the SATO employee and to improve the customer experience  which is a key element of our strategy. The concept was cascaded among SATO employees during spring and early summer  and the related work will continue as an integral part of our daily activities.During the reporting year  we initiated diversity  equity and inclusion work (DEI) at SATO. Our goal is to increase and reinforce SATO employees’ understanding of the topic to even better understand our diverse customer base  promote our personnel’s well-being and achieve better results together. We started the work by conducting a self-evaluation of diversity management and by providing coaching to the Corporate Management Group  supervisors and SATO employees with a interest in DEI work. We launched a DEI plan in a diversity coaching session for the entire personnel in November 2023  conducted theme discussions during the rest of the year in each team and started in-depth supervisor coaching. We will continue building understanding through coaching sessions and discussions also in 2024. We will also  among other things  look into our HR practices  renew our recruitment process to increase diversity and develop indicators for assessing and monitoring the DEI work.In the area of administrative and financial responsibility  we continued to develop consistent and transparent ways of working during the reporting year. In the reporting year  we started the identification and description of our core processes. We completed a compliance charting and renewed our Code of Ethics for employees and co-operation partners. We updated the framework for green financing  which is focussed on energy-efficient properties and improving their energy efficiency. We expanded the remuneration criteria to cover  in addition to customer experience and economic occupancy rate  also sustainability by making the realisation of the annual targets specified in the sustainability programme part of the remuneration paid to all SATO employees.SATO has a First Whistle channel in place  through which SATO employees and external stakeholders can confidentially report detected or suspected misconduct or other inappropriate conduct.We report on our sustainability annually in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) reporting guidelines  and the environmental sustainability and procurement figures presented in the report have been verified by an independent third party  i.e. KPMG Oy Ab.During the reporting year  we continued collaboration with the non-profit organisation No Fixed Abode and the Rehabilitation Foundation in their project to help participants in the project find the two essentials of life – a home and a job. By the end of 2023  10 people who had participated in the project were living in a SATOhome.In 2020  we committed to reporting in accordance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. In the framework  the risks are divided into four main categories: transition risks  acute and chronic physical risks and social risks. During the reporting year  risks caused by climate change were part of SATO’s general risk assessment that is conducted internally each year. Climate-related risks and opportunities and their impact on the company’s operations were addressed in the Corporate Management Group and reported to the Board of Directors twice during the reporting year.The Corporate Governance Statement  SATO’s Code of Ethics and the Group’s sustainability programme are available at sato.fi/en.Impacts on the environment and societyAccording to the Ministry of the Environment  construction and buildings cause approximately one third of Finland’s greenhouse gas emissions. Our most significant climate impacts arise from energy consumption during residency and the construction and repair of our homes. Mitigating climate change and responding to it are at the core of our sustainability work. We aim to reduce the emissions caused by our operations  and our goal is to reach carbon neutrality for in-use energy consumption by the end of 2030.Our objective is to systematically reduce the negative impacts of our operations on the environment. We reduce the load on the environment by regularly and proactively taking care of and repairing homes and properties according to the life-cycle principle  and by building properties primarily in existing urban environments and near good public transport connections.The design of SATO’s new rental apartments always takes into account energy efficiency and solutions that will last for decades. In new properties  SATO’s goal is energy class A (energy performance indicator 75 or below)  which is significantly better than that required by the building code (energy performance indicator 90). All of the buildings that were completed during the reporting year were energy class A. In 2023  we did not start any new construction projects.During the reporting year  we continued to invest in energy efficiency improvements in SATOhomes in connection with renovations. In renovations  our goal is to improve energy efficiency by some 30% compared to earlier. A total of 545 homes were renovated in 2023.We are committed to the Energy Efficiency Agreement targets for the property sector  aiming for a reduction in the total consumption of electricity and heat of 10.5% from the 2015 baseline by 2025. The use of renewable energy in heating significantly reduces the in-use emissions of homes. Our goal is for 80% of our energy consumption to be renewable or carbon neutral by the end of 2026. We increase local energy production and always look into the possibility of using geothermal heat and other locally produced energy and heat recovery. We implement these wherever possible and where it also makes financial sense. In 2023  we added a solar power plant to 24 properties located in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. At the end of the reporting year  among the properties fully owned by SATO  1 820 homes had geothermal heat and 247 homes had hybrid heating with district heat and heat pumps. Thirty properties housing 2 999 SATOhomes had a solar power plant. In 2023  building electricity consisted entirely of emission-free electricity.During the reporting year  specific energy consumption fell by 2.0%  specific electricity consumption rose 8.2% and specific water consumption fell by 1.0% compared to 2022. Specific emissions from SATO’s apartments fell by 10.6% compared to 2022 and were 25.2 carbon dioxide equivalent kilograms per square metre (28.2). Emissions are calculated according to the absolute consumption of district heating. Due to the rise in heating and electricity prices  energy costs rose overall.In addition to the climate  the built environment also has a significant impact on nature  and the construction supply chains also have identified nature impacts. Biodiversity is one of the environmental themes of SATO’s sustainability programme  and our goal is to slow down biodiversity loss and improve biodiversity in housing development and in the areas where our existing buildings are located. The measures to promote biodiversity are described in the biodiversity roadmap 2024–2026 in our Sustainability Report 2023. We are continuously improving our actions to promote biodiversity as our understanding  competence and resources increase.Our business is long-term  transparent and sustainable. For us  sustainability means concrete actions that can be seen in everything we do. We regularly assess and predict the social  economic and environmental risks related to our operations. We strive to systematically reduce the identified negative impacts  for example by following our Code of Ethics  by combating the grey economy  by approving only companies registered with the Reliable Partner service as our co-operation partners  conducting audits and internal control  and by continuously developing our operations.We generate a steady financial benefit for our stakeholders  including shareholders  employees  customers  municipalities  the state  and goods suppliers and service providers and their employees. We support growth opportunities in business and industry by offering rental apartments in Finland’s largest growth centres  in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku.We enable sustainable housing for our residents and encourage them to make sustainable choices in their daily lives. We are a long-term and responsible housing provider for our residents.Development activitiesOur operating model is based on the idea that any needs for improvement and change in the organisation are best identified by the employees whose daily work involves the matters in question. One of the spearheads of SATO’s strategy are SATO employees  and our intent is for each SATO employee to develop and build the SATO of the future.SATO has in place a continuous improvement model for business. We develop our operations as smaller components rather than large units  which speeds up development work and allows processes to be improved effectively. In connection with development work  we identify  prioritise and carry out strategically important actions.SATO’s development activities in 2023 focussed on several aspects that improve the key businesses. Solutions that harmonise business information management were deployed in the property data system KoTI. In KoTI  we are able to manage the key areas of property management centrally and based on consistent data  which makes it easier  for example  to make long-term plans. As a result of the development work  KoTI can be used for identifying and evaluating different repair needs  targeting repairs  as well as for identifying divestment needs.In rental housing  we will continue the harmonisation of processes also during the next reporting year. We invested in developing digital services  as well as our presence near to the customers  and in building a uniform and seamless service experience. Our goal is to serve our customers in the best way possible  regardless of time or place. Customers can  for example  book an apartment viewing digitally whenever they want.During the year under review  we moved the majority of our digital services to cloud service platforms. This has made service maintenance more effective and brought the company savings. This has also saved us time  which we have been able to allocate to developing our core businesses. By making effective use of cloud services  we have also improved the company’s information security  scalability and operational flexibility. An increasing number of business areas can now be managed directly on the property together with the resident.We have improved our collaboration by developing our partner channel in terms of  for example  key management for the properties. In addition  we have developed a parking spot rental process  which improves the overall management of rental activities and enables better service four our customers.OmaSATO  the digital service targeted at residents  turned five during the reporting year. Our goal is to make OmaSATO a better digital rental housing service that makes life easier for residents and encourages them to make more sustainable choices. In 2023  a customer survey was conducted among OmaSATO users  based on which we identified new development areas. We made the user interface more customer friendly using service design. The renewed OmaSATO will be released in early 2024  and its development will be continued.Modern systems make it easier to automate processes and respond to the different needs of the businesses. As part of the work to develop financial administration  SATO introduced a new accounts ledger system in April 2023. In this connection  we outsourced customer invoicing in its entirety to our external partner as of 1 April 2023.A total of EUR 2.3 million (3.2) was spent on development  corresponding to approximately 0.8% of net sales.Risk managementRisk management is used to ensure that risks impacting the company’s business are identified  managed and monitored. The main risks of SATO’s business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.SATO’s most significant risks are related to prolonged inflation and the resulting rise in interest rates. As a result of the war in Ukraine  the prices of energy  food  materials and commodities have increased dramatically and interest rates have risen. Higher cost of living can have a negative impact on consumers’ purchasing power and ability to meet their obligations. If the strong growth in the cost of financing and maintenance costs continues and the market situation does not provide an opportunity to transfer the higher costs into rents in full  this can have a negative impact on the fair value of investment assets and the company’s ability to meet its obligations and to finance investments  which means that new investments and renovations will have to be postponed.The most significant risks in the renting of apartments are related to economic cycles and fluctuations in demand and supply. High new housing construction activity can increase the supply of rental housing to a point that it exceeds demand. This leads to rental housing vacancies and pressure to even out or lower the rent level  especially for the old housing portfolio.A weakening in the housing market and a higher interest rate level could have a negative impact on the market value of SATO’s housing portfolio. In accordance with its strategy  SATO focusses its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing its existing housing portfolio  thus ensuring the rental potential of its apartments and the development of their value.Changes in official regulations and legislation  as well as the uncertainty stemming from them  may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and thus on SATO’s business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group’s treasury policy  which has been approved by SATO’s Board of Directors. Our financial risk management principles are defined in the treasury policy. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other long-term financing commitments. The company has a valid EUR 2.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme.The means for managing the liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  committed credit facilities of EUR 600 million and a commercial paper programme of EUR 400 million. We increase the amount of reserves as the financing requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans form an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by issuing fixed rate loans or by interest rate hedges. According to our treasury policy  our objective is to keep the ratio of fixed rate loans at over 60% of debt portfolio after interest hedging. At the end of the review period  the fixed rate portion of the loan portfolio after hedging was 66.3% (excluding short-term loans).A more detailed description of risks and risk management is available on the Group’s website www.sato.fi/en.Pending legal actionsSATO has no official procedures  legal actions or arbitration proceedings pending that would have a significant impact on the company’s financial standing or profitability  and SATO is not aware of any threat of such proceedings.SharesOn 31 December 2023  the share capital of SATO Corporation was EUR 4 442 192.00 and there were 56 783 067 shares.

According to the Bank of Finland’s December projection  increased prices  higher interest rates and the consumers’ weak confidence in the economy will slow economic growth also in 2024.Inflation slowed strongly in late 2023 as a result of lower energy prices  tightened monetary policy and easing of supply bottlenecks. Core inflation has remained above the European Central Bank’s (ECB) target  but the markets expect the ECB to start interest rate cuts during 2024. The slowing inflation and falling interest rates  coupled with households’ decent income development  will increase households’ purchasing power. Employment is expected to weaken slightly in 2024 but to improve as of 2025.The continued high level of new housing production has kept competition for good tenants tight and rent increases moderate  and it has not been possible to pass the higher maintenance and financing costs on to rents in full. Higher material costs and interest rates have led to housing starts decreasing almost without interruption since early 2022. The construction of new housing has been in a steep fall in 2023 and the fall will continue in 2024.There is demand for housing in growth centres thanks to immigration and internal migration. According to Statistics Finland  the Helsinki metropolitan area’s net positive migration rate in 2023 was clearly higher than in the previous year  whereas the number of people moving out was smaller. Of the municipalities in the area  Helsinki and Espoo experienced the highest net positive migration rates.Decreasing new housing production and population growth in growth centres will reduce supply and increase demand for rental apartments  which will likely translate into higher rents in the future.As tenants have a wider array of choices  a successful customer experience is more important than ever. SATO is investing strongly in increasing its customer presence and developing digital services.In line with its majority shareholder’s operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2024 earnings.

The company’s first site has already been in operation since the second half of 2021  while two other sites in France were inaugurated in December 2023. Several other sites are currently under construction across Europe.,"Lhyfe is building a green hydrogen plant in the seaport city of Brake in Lower Saxony (Germany)• Construction work has started• Production of up to four tonnes of green and renewable hydrogen per day• Potential offtakers to include regional industrial and mobility companiesLhyfe (EURONEXT: LHYFE)  a leading European producer of green and renewable hydrogen for transportation and industrial applications  is building hydrogen production plant in Germany  in Brake (Unterweser). The site project is located on land in the harbour area of Niedersachsen Ports (NPorts)  the largest public seaport operator in Germany. The plant would be the first in the northern German region to make green hydrogen available to the wider market. The groundbreaking ceremony for the production facility will take place today  February 1.The plant will produce up to 1 150 tonnes of green hydrogen per year (installed electrolysis capacity of 10 MW). The electricity will come from wind and photovoltaic plants in the country  through corporate PPAs. Potential offtakers would include various industrial and mobility applications.“We are delighted to be able to realise this 10 MW project. It demonstrates the economic viability of hydrogen solutions in the transport and industrial sectors and supports the state of Lower Saxony in its ambitious goals of building a nationwide hydrogen infrastructure. The port of Brake offers ideal conditions for the construction of green hydrogen plants. This project is also an important signal for Lhyfe and the sign of our ambition to make the future of energy supply more sustainable. Thanks to our many years of experience in the field of green and renewable hydrogen  we are able to meet the growing local demand for clean hydrogen ” says Luc Graré  Head of Central & Eastern Europe at Lhyfe. “With this project  we are also driving value creation in the region. The local availability of green hydrogen will create new jobs and companies in the region will benefit from affordable clean hydrogen.”Lower Saxony Economics Minister Olaf Lies commented: ""Today's groundbreaking ceremony is a great success for the energy transition in our coastal region: it not only marks significant progress towards a sustainable energy supply  but also a clear commitment to regional value creation and decarbonisation. The port location of Brake offers ideal conditions for the production of renewable hydrogen. With this project  we are not only strengthening regional development  but also networking between industry and local stakeholders who are working together on innovative and sustainable solutions. Many thanks for the support of all the partners who have made this ambitious project possible. It combines innovation  sustainability and regional strength and is an example of successful collaboration on the path to a comprehensive and sustainable transformation of our energy system.""“The decision to build a green hydrogen plant in the port of Brake is an important step towards regional decarbonisation. I am delighted that Lhyfe is realising this together with us and at the same time I am very proud that we as the town of Brake (Unterweser) are positioning ourselves as a pioneer for clean energy technologies. The project is helping to strengthen the local economy and our town in the long term ” says Michael Kurz  Mayor of Brake (Unterweser). “The availability of hydrogen locally creates new opportunities for companies and promotes the development of environmentally friendly technologies. The port of Brake will become a hub for green innovation and sustainable growth. I firmly believe that this initiative will lead not only our industry but also our region into a successful and low-carbon future.”The project in Lower Saxony will play a major role in decarbonising the industrial port complex and maritime transport.“By supplying green hydrogen  our seaport of Brake has even more to offer. This will enable the port industry to increasingly dispense with fossil fuels. A broad network is served over short distances. We see this as an important contribution to the energy transition and circular economy in the region. The port of Brake offers the complete package  including the available space and trimodal connections to rail  road and waterways. We look forward to working together to develop the site’s sustainable future ” explains Holger Banik  Managing Director of Niedersachsen Ports GmbH & Co. KG and JadeWeserPort Realisierungs GmbH & Co. KG.The project represents a further milestone in the market ramp-up of green hydrogen and is embedded in the region’s local value creation thanks to the diverse areas of application in mobility and industry. Lhyfe recently announced the start of construction of the largest hydrogen production plant in Baden-Württemberg  in Schwäbisch Gmünd. The ground-breaking ceremony of this 10 MW production plant took place in October.Lhyfe produces green and renewable hydrogen by water electrolysis  in production facilities powered by renewable energy.
