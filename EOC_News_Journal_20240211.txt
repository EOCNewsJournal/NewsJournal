36034,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/592215-eus-seizure-money-communist/,EU member state calls threat to seize Russian money ‘communist’,Hungary’s foreign minister says the EU’s plan to hand over the profits from frozen Russian assets to Kiev is reminiscent of communism Read Full Article at RT.com,The bloc unanimously backed the idea of using frozen assets to help UkraineThe EU’s planned seizure of billions of euros of interest payments arising from frozen Russian assets is reminiscent of communism  Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told RIA Novosti on Thursday.The EU is facing increasing pressure from the US and its allies to find ways to seize hundreds of billions of euros in frozen sovereign Russian funds.Asked if Hungary would support the initiative to use profits generated from financial assets which belong to the Russian central bank and are now frozen by the EU  Szijjarto said the idea reminds him of how the communists used to confiscate assets from people in Hungary.“These sorts of measures usually set off warning lights in our mind  that communist heritage is not what we’d like to see in our day and age ” he said  adding that Budapest has not heard any concrete plans on how this initiative would be implemented. “If one is available  we’ll definitely look over and discuss it ” he stated.Last week  it was revealed that the biggest holder of frozen Russian assets  Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear  had accrued almost €4.4 billion ($4.74 billion) last year in net interest earnings from funds in sanctioned Russian accounts. Euroclear is estimated to be holding €196.6 billion in Russian assets  mostly belonging to the country’s central bank.In total  the US and its allies froze an estimated $300 billion in Russian assets at the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February 2022.EU ambassadors have agreed on the idea of using profits from sanctioned assets to support Ukraine  the Belgian Presidency of the EU Council announced following January’s summit in Brussels  although nothing has been officially implemented yet.The US has been pushing for the confiscation of Russian funds  while $60 billion in aid to Ukraine has been stalled in Congress. The EU  however  has agreed on a €50 billion aid package for Kiev over the next four years  after Hungary withdrew its veto due to pressure from Brussels.While Russia’s central bank had been in the process of weaning itself off the dollar and euro and switching to the Chinese yuan and gold since US sanctions in 2018  significant holdings in dollars  euros  British pounds  Japanese yen  and others were frozen in 2022.The head of the Russian central bank  Elvira Nabiullina  has said that the seizure of profits from frozen Russian funds  as well as the seizure of the funds themselves  would lower the attractiveness of the euroand the dollar as a reserve currency in the international arena.,negative,0.02,0.19,0.79,mixed,0.08,0.3,0.62,True,English,"['EU member state', 'Russian money', 'threat', 'Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto', 'next four years', 'net interest earnings', 'Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear', '€50 billion aid package', 'Russian central bank', 'sovereign Russian funds', 'frozen Russian assets', 'interest payments', 'Russian accounts', 'frozen assets', 'RIA Novosti', 'warning lights', 'communist heritage', 'concrete plans', 'biggest holder', 'Russia-Ukraine conflict', 'Belgian Presidency', 'Chinese yuan', 'significant holdings', 'British pounds', 'Japanese yen', 'Elvira Nabiullina', 'reserve currency', 'international arena', 'financial assets', 'increasing pressure', 'EU ambassadors', 'EU Council', 'The US', 'The EU', 'US sanctions', 'bloc', 'idea', 'seizure', 'billions', 'euros', 'communism', 'Thursday', 'allies', 'ways', 'hundreds', 'Hungary', 'initiative', 'profits', 'communists', 'people', 'sorts', 'measures', 'mind', 'Budapest', 'country', 'total', 'beginning', 'February', 'January', 'summit', 'Brussels', 'confiscation', 'Congress', 'Kiev', 'veto', 'process', 'dollar', 'gold', 'others', 'head', 'attractiveness', 'euroand']",2024-02-10,2024-02-11,rt.com
36035,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/592230-frozen-russian-assets-racketeering/,Tapping frozen Russian assets is ‘economic racketeering’ – Moscow,Using profits from frozen Russian assets to aid Kiev would be a gross violation of international law  Moscow has warned Read Full Article at RT.com,The EU has unanimously backed the idea of using profits from the funds to help UkraineThe EU’s plan to seize the profits from frozen Russian assets and hand them over to Ukraine would be a gross violation of international law  the Foreign Ministry in Moscow has told RIA Novosti.Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear  which holds an estimated €196.6 billion ($211 billion) in Russian assets  accumulated nearly €4.4 billion in interest from funds in sanctioned Russian accounts last year. EU ambassadors recently agreed to use the profits to support Ukraine. The proposal has yet to be approved by the European Council and would reportedly stop short of touching the assets themselves.Russia  however  regards any actions against its sovereign assets and those belonging to its citizens and companies “as economic racketeering on the part of the collective West ” the Foreign Ministry stated on Saturday.“[The EU’s] invention of openly fraudulent schemes for the seizure of income from Russian assets is dictated by the need to create the illusion of legitimacy over attacks on our property and thereby camouflage what is in fact an outright theft ” the ministry added.It claimed that EU members “clearly do not want to continue paying for the doomed ‘Ukrainian project’ from their own wallets ” which is “why they are so tempted by the idea of spending funds stolen from our country to support the Zelensky regime.”Last week  the EU agreed on a €50 billion aid package for Kiev over the next four years  although the decision was reached only after Hungary withdrew its veto amid pressure from Brussels. Meanwhile  a $60 billion US aid package for Ukraine has stalled in Congress  as Washington pushes for the confiscation of Russian assets to secure alternative funding.In total  the US and its allies have frozen an estimated $300 billion in Russian assets and reserves since the start of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Moscow has condemned the measures  warning of tit-for-tat responses and lawsuits.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.04,0.51,0.44,mixed,0.08,0.27,0.65,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'economic racketeering', 'Moscow', '$60 billion US aid package', '€50 billion aid package', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'next four years', 'gross violation', 'international law', 'RIA Novosti', 'Russian accounts', 'European Council', 'economic racketeering', 'collective West', 'fraudulent schemes', 'outright theft', 'Ukrainian project', 'Zelensky regime', 'alternative funding', 'tat responses', 'business section', 'Russian assets', 'sovereign assets', 'Foreign Ministry', 'EU ambassadors', 'EU members', 'Ukraine conflict', 'idea', 'profits', 'funds', 'plan', 'Moscow', 'Euroclear', 'interest', 'proposal', 'actions', 'citizens', 'companies', 'part', 'Saturday', 'invention', 'seizure', 'income', 'need', 'illusion', 'legitimacy', 'attacks', 'property', 'fact', 'doomed', 'wallets', 'country', 'Kiev', 'decision', 'Hungary', 'veto', 'pressure', 'Brussels', 'Congress', 'Washington', 'confiscation', 'total', 'allies', 'reserves', 'start', 'measures', 'lawsuits', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2024-02-10,2024-02-11,rt.com
