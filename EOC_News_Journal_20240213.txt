Undiscovered pegmatites of complex-type could exist to the west in the direction of increasing fractionation and are exemplified at the nearby North and South Aubry pegmatites of Green Technology Metals (cf. Breaks  Selway and Tindle 2006). The lithochemistry and structural data from this early phase of drilling will greatly aid in the continuing development of a lithium pegmatite exploration model.""This initial drilling was designed to test the five spodumene-bearing pegmatites discovered during Volta's 2023 exploration program which screened a small section of the large 13km2 property.

Dekabank also confirmed to IPE its participation.“As a leading insurer and investor  we routinely contribute with our expertise to economic policy and government-related advisory committees at various levels ” a spokesperson for Allianz said  declining to comment specifically on the WIN-Initiative.BlackRock did not reply to a request for comment. Deutsche Bank declined to comment.With the WIN-Initiative for venture and growth capital  the German government plans to rework the framework conditions for investments in the tech and green tech sectors with the help of a group of experts  under the leadership of state development bank KfW  according to Handelsblatt.Germany wants to create a framework akin to the Tibi-Initiative in France that is pulling institutional investors to invest €6bn over a three-year period to close funding gaps for tech start-ups.“We have to think about the fact that  with the same European regulations  in France the capital collection agencies invest far more in asset classes such as private equity and venture capital ” said finance minister Christian Lindner explaining the WIN-Initiative plan.“This cannot be due to European rules  but only to “specifically German framework conditions”  he added.The plan to channel capital towards growth companies comes as German institutional investors increasingly opt to allocate in funds abroad.Over the past few years institutional investors in Germany have opted to invest €600bn in funds abroad  according to figures published by the fund industry association BVI.“We estimate that in the field of infrastructure financing  for every euro invested in projects in Germany  up to €99 are invested abroad ” said Sebastian Oys  head of tax policy at BVI  in a LinkedIn post.Assets under management of German institutional investors in foreign funds have increased 3.35 times over the past 10 years  while assets in domestic funds have only grown 1.98 times over the period  he added.“We need more investments and asset managers in Germany  that must become more competitive and attractive [for funds].

The company went public via a 2021 IPO on the Euronext Paris exchange. Believe’s board of directors has unanimously welcomed the proposal “without prejudice to the outcome of its detailed study of its terms”.That will involve an independent expert assessing the offer  as well as a committee of three independent directors – the ones who are not linked to the consortium or have agreed to sell their shares to it.In his statement  Ladegaillerie outlined the reasons why he wants to take Believe private again.“Since being a public company  Believe has systematically outperformed its objectives  delivering its IPO plan two years ahead of schedule. However the strength of its operational performance has not been reflected in the share price evolution ” he said.Believe went public in June 2021  with an offering price of €19.50 per share valuing the company at €1.9bn. However  at points in 2023 its share price dipped below €9  although at the close of trading last Friday it was €12.40  giving the company a market cap of €1.2bn.“Believe has a significant opportunity ahead to consolidate the independent music market and create the first global major independent  at the service of artists at all stages of their career ” maintained Ladegaillerie.His backers agreed. “Believe has significant potential to continue thriving  through organic expansion and strategic acquisitions ” said EQT partner Nicolas Brugère.“We at TCV  see Believe’s focus on local content  coupled with its full stack offering addressing all artist segments and focusing on digital artist development over the long term  as highly differentiated ” added TCV general partner John Doran.,neutral,0.42,0.56,0.02,negative,0.01,0.42,0.57,True,English,"['Believe board', 'EQT-backed consortium', 'offer', 'TCV', 'TCV general partner John Doran', 'first global major independent', 'current exchange rates', 'Euronext Paris exchange', 'Nicolas Brugère', 'independent music market', 'full stack offering', 'digital artist development', 'three independent directors', 'CEO Denis Ladegaillerie', 'French music company', 'share price evolution', 'independent expert', 'EQT partner', 'offering price', 'market cap', 'artist segments', 'average price', 'investment firms', 'last month', 'detailed study', 'operational performance', 'significant opportunity', 'significant potential', 'organic expansion', 'strategic acquisitions', 'local content', 'long term', 'IPO plan', 'public company', 'acquisition offer', '2021 IPO', 'Rumours', 'Believe', 'weeks', 'details', 'Funds', 'chairman', 'shares', 'premium', 'goal', 'board', 'proposal', 'prejudice', 'outcome', 'terms', 'committee', 'consortium', 'statement', 'reasons', 'objectives', 'schedule', 'strength', 'June', 'points', 'close', 'trading', 'service', 'artists', 'stages', 'career', 'backers', 'focus']",2024-02-12,2024-02-13,musically.com

The capability will allow Telstra to expand mobile coverage as it supports new site deployments.Cyril Dujardin  Co-General Manager of Eutelsat Group’s Connectivity Business Unit said: “We are delighted to support Telstra in delivering consistent  leading-edge connectivity to its customers in Australia  regardless of location. We are honoured to count Telstra among our most trusted partners  with whom we will continue to collaborate to test and deploy current and future technology.”Iskra Nikolova  Telstra Executive for Network and Technology added: “Eutelsat OneWeb’s LEO solution will help us improve the customer experience in regional and remote areas with lower latency  higher speeds  and a more consistent experience. There’s also potential for OneWeb  as a backup backhaul solution  to improve reliability in areas where terrestrial backhaul is susceptible to natural disasters  and where communities find themselves in isolation to have a LEO backhaul that guarantees that level of quality service.”Australia is one of several markets now fully operational  as Eutelsat OneWeb completes the roll-out of its ground segment to enable true global coverage.About Eutelsat GroupEutelsat Group is a global leader in satellite communications  delivering connectivity and broadcast services worldwide.

With this investment  we are protecting jobs and ensuring the future of the Szentgotthárd plant.”Szentgotthard-produced EDMs will be used in vehicles built on an upcoming BEV-centric STLA platform. Production of EDMs will be housed in existing buildings at the plant. New work related to electric drive production at the plant will include machining of certain key components and final assembly and testing of 3-in-1 EDMs that combine the electric motor  reduction gearset and inverter into a single unit.The Szentgotthard plant currently builds 1.2-liter turbocharged three-cylinder and 1.6-liter four-cylinder internal combustion engines used in a variety of Stellantis brand vehicles. Stellantis employees will undergo upskilling training to support the machining and assembly requirements of EDM production.Stellantis is investing more than €50 billion in electrification over the next decade to deliver on the Dare Forward 2030 targets of reaching a 100% passenger car battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales mix in Europe and 50% passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the United States by 2030. To achieve these sales targets  the Company is securing approximately 400 GWh of battery capacity  including support from six battery manufacturing plants in North America and Europe.

It's a perfect example of how technology is boosting productivity across the audit — and a great help for firms that are finding it harder and harder to staff engagements.”Wolters Kluwer was also recognized for its recently launched CCH Axcess Beneficial Ownership solution  which automates the beneficial ownership information filing process for accounting firms that need to file large volumes of reports.

The dwindling capital…,"(Adds value of Milan bourse  comparison with Paris  Amsterdam bourse  other recent delistings in paragraph 3-4)MILAN  Feb 12 (Reuters) - Shares in Italian luxury shoemaker Tod's jumped on Monday and those of oil refiner Saras fell after the two received buyout offers over the weekend  with both preparing to join peers that have left the Milan bourse.The dwindling capitalisation of Italy's stock exchange and a steady flow of firms relocating abroad has become a hot topic in Italy  with listing professionals and large foreign investors criticising planned government measures to stem the trend.With a market value of 762 billion euros at the end of last year  the Milan bourse represents one fifth of Paris's stock exchange  or half of Amsterdam's.Since 2022  Borsa Italiana  which is owned by French group Euronext  has seen the delisting of truck maker CNH  airport caterer Autogrill  and both Exor and Atlantia  the holding companies of Italy's Agnelli and Benetton families  respectively.Shares in Tod's rose 18% after private equity firm L Catterton offered to buy 36% of the group in agreement with the Della Valle founding family to take it private.By contrast  shares in Saras fell 4% to trade below the 1.75 euros a share offered by commodity trader Vitol to acquire the Moratti family's stake in the oil refiner and buy out other investors to delist it.Saras' main asset is the 300 000 barrel-per-day Sarroch refinery in Sardinia  the biggest plant in the Mediterranean  whose location has grown in importance in light of the Red Sea route disruption.""Saras's business is highly complementary to Vitol's core operations  and this transaction will strengthen European energy security and enhance supply for a key European energy asset ” Vitol CEO Russell Hardy said in a statement.Unlike the Morattis  the Della Valle brothers will retain control of Tod's with a 54% stake  while they will tender another 10.45% stake.LVMH  backer of L Catterton and a longstanding Tod's shareholder  will also keep its 10% stake.L Catterton will own the remainder of Tod's if the offer  which values Tod's just over 1.4 billion euros  is successful.L Catterton has said that if its 43 euro-a-share bid fails to meet the necessary threshold  it will still delist Tod's by merging it into the offer vehicle.A previous attempt in 2022 by the Della Valles to take Tod's private and manage its diverse brands separately fell through  but analysts said this time the prospect of the delisting was credible.In addition to the eponymous brand  famous for its Gommino loafers  Tod's also owns the Roger Vivier shoe brand and the Fay and Hogan labels.Citi analysts said shareholders may think that the bid price  which is only 7.5% above the failed 2022 offer price  does not fully reflect the ongoing turnaround of the Tod's brand and undervalues Roger Vivier.However  broker Equita said the alliance between majority and minority shareholders in Tod's lent credibility to the threat that investors who snub the bid will end up with stock in an unlisted group.

The product ensures supporting evidence is correctly validated by using optical character recognition (OCR) technology to extract text from scanned documents  including photographs of crumpled documents  to automatically match and dynamically link the sample or workpaper to the source document. TeamMate Document Linker functions within the Microsoft Excel interface  eliminating the need to switch between tools and windows to verify required data.Accounting Today notes that the solution is “the kind of tool junior auditors have been dreaming of for years: It automates the tying of samples to supporting evidence  using AI-powered optical character recognition technology to extract text from scanned documents to match everything up in seconds  and then making it all available for review in Excel. It's a perfect example of how technology is boosting productivity across the audit — and a great help for firms that are finding it harder and harder to staff engagements.”Wolters Kluwer was also recognized for its recently launched CCH Axcess Beneficial Ownership solution  which automates the beneficial ownership information filing process for accounting firms that need to file large volumes of reports. The expert solution is aimed at helping the nearly 33 million U.S. businesses impacted by the beneficial ownership reporting rule under the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) comply with the new regulation. By offering beneficial ownership interest compliance as part of a business advisory relationship  accounting firms can enhance their role as trusted advisors.Wolters Kluwer TAA enables tax and accounting professionals and businesses of all sizes to drive productivity  navigate change  and deliver better outcomes.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024 by a 357 - 70 vote on January 31  2024. The tax briefing analysis follows:SummaryAfter overwhelming bi-partisan passage in the House on January 19  the plan was to pass the bill in the House under rules that would limit the ability to amend the text but would require approval by two-thirds of the chamber.After a delay caused by some Republican members who were trying to get an increase in the state and local tax deduction limit added to the bill  as well as modifications of the child tax credit  an agreement was made to consider those in a separate bill in the near future. As a result  the legislation passed by the House is the same version that was passed out of committee.Key provisions in the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024The bill provides for increases in the child tax credit  delays the requirement to deduct research and experimentation expenditures over a five-year period. It also extends the 100% bonus depreciation through 2025  and increases the Code Sec. 179 deduction limitation  among other business-friendly provisions. The bill would also extend tax treaty-like benefits to Taiwan and extend some disaster-related tax relief.What's next for the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024? The bill now goes to the U.S. Senate. Due to the large number of provisions that are retroactively applicable to the 2023 tax year  and in some cases even earlier  the original hope was to get the bill passed before the start of the filing season. Since that deadline has passed  the goal would still be to get the bill to President Biden as soon as possible to minimize the administrative burdens on the Internal Revenue Service.Currently  there is no clear timeline established for the Senate to take up consideration of the bill  and many Senators have indicated a desire to make changes to the bill.Expert InterviewsWolters Kluwer experts are available to reporters wishing to discuss any of the following key tax bill provisions including:Expansion of the Child Tax CreditBonus Depreciation extensionsBusiness interest limitationDisaster reliefImmediate deduction of Research and Experiment expendituresTax treaty-like benefits for Taiwan ResidentsEnd of Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) claimsReporters are invited to contact Shannon Wherry  Associate Director  External Communications  to arrange interviews with either of the following Wolters Kluwer TAA experts:Mark A.

JDE Peet’s has partnered with Enveritas to leverage a combination of satellite imagery  artificial intelligence  and on-the-ground verification to measure the extent of coffee-related deforestation  allowing local operators  governments  NGOs  and farmers to better mitigate their deforestation risks.After a successful pilot programme in Vietnam  JDE Peet’s has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with Ethiopia  Papua New Guinea  Tanzania  and Uganda  and expects to sign MOUs with additional coffee producing countries over the next several months. These agreements aim to ensure that coffee producers export coffee grown on land that was not deforested after 2020. If the coffee does not meet these requirements  JDE Peet’s will support local authorities  NGOs  and farmers to reforest the land.Fabien Simon  CEO of JDE Peet's  commented: “At JDE Peet’s  we are committed to delivering sustainable growth that creates both shareholder return and societal value. This means making sure our supply chain is inclusive  regenerative  and authentic  which is exactly what our Common Grounds sustainability programme is designed to do. I am excited that this innovative new programme  which is fully aligned with the EU's Regulation on Deforestation-free products  will ensure continued access to the EU market for the millions of smallholder farmers we work with around the world.”David Browning  CEO of Enveritas  commented: “Millions of smallholder farmers around the world rely upon coffee income to pay for their children’s health  education  and nutritional needs. The new EU regulation risked significant new complexities and processes in the coffee supply chain which could mean new costs for vulnerable populations least able to afford it  and also risk market access. We are honoured to be a part of this innovative collaboration with JDE Peet’s which brings together public  private  and philanthropic organisations to address deforestation in a manner which also protects smallholder farmers.”Story continues# # #EnquiriesMediaWill Hummel+31 6 3917 7280Media@JDEPeets.comInvestors & AnalystsRobin Jansen+31 6 1594 4569IR@JDEPeets.comAbout JDE Peet’sJDE Peet’s is the world's leading pure-play coffee and tea company  serving approximately 4 200 cups of coffee or tea per second.
