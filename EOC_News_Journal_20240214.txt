His comments came shortly after the European Council enacted measures that could allow the interest earned by frozen Russian assets to be confiscated and sent to Ukraine.The US and the EU have blocked an estimated $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian central bank since the start of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Of that amount  €196.6 billion ($211 billion) is being held by the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear  which last year accumulated nearly €4.4 billion in interest on the funds.While there have been calls to confiscate the money outright and hand it to Ukraine  skeptics have warned that this could erode global trust in the EU’s banking sector  as well as being dubious from a legal standpoint.When asked to comment on the European Council’s decision during a press briefing on Monday  Miller said the US is “encouraged by any action the EU may take to use Russian assets for the benefit of Ukrainians.”“We continue to be in active conversations with our allies and partners  including the G7  on what additional steps may be possible within respective legal systems and under international law… to ensure Russia pays for the damage it has caused ” the US official added.Earlier on Monday  the European Council ordered depositors holding frozen Russian assets to keep separate accounts of “extraordinary cash balances accumulating due to EU restrictive measures ” and prohibited them from disposing of any interest or profits from the funds.“This decision paves the way for the Council to decide on a possible establishment of a financial contribution to the EU budget raised on these net profits to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction at a later stage ” officials in Brussels explained.Moscow has repeatedly denounced the freezing of its assets as illegal  warning of tit-for-tat responses and “decades” of lawsuits in the event that they are confiscated.“[The EU’s] invention of openly fraudulent schemes for the seizure of income from Russian assets is dictated by the need to create the illusion of legitimacy over attacks on our property and thereby camouflage what is in fact an outright theft ” the Russian Foreign Ministry told RIA Novosti on Saturday.,neutral,0.04,0.88,0.08,negative,0.02,0.25,0.73,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'G7 partners', 'talks', 'State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller', 'Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear', 'frozen Russian sovereign funds', 'other G7 nations', 'extraordinary cash balances', 'Russian central bank', 'Russian Foreign Ministry', 'respective legal systems', 'EU restrictive measures', 'legal standpoint', 'Russian assets', 'potential ways', 'global trust', 'banking sector', 'press briefing', 'active conversations', 'additional steps', 'international law', 'separate accounts', 'possible establishment', 'financial contribution', 'later stage', 'tat responses', 'fraudulent schemes', 'outright theft', 'RIA Novosti', 'The US', 'European Council', 'US official', 'The EU', 'EU budget', 'net profits', 'Ukraine conflict', 'plans', 'interest', 'Moscow', 'discussions', 'comments', 'start', 'amount', 'calls', 'money', 'skeptics', 'decision', 'Monday', 'action', 'benefit', 'Ukrainians', 'allies', 'partners', 'damage', 'depositors', 'recovery', 'reconstruction', 'officials', 'Brussels', 'freezing', 'decades', 'lawsuits', 'event', 'invention', 'seizure', 'income', 'need', 'illusion', 'legitimacy', 'attacks', 'property', 'fact', 'Saturday']",2024-02-13,2024-02-14,rt.com

Of that amount  €196.6 billion ($211 billion) is being held by the Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear  which last year accumulated nearly €4.4 billion in interest on the funds.Earlier this week  the European Council took steps toward the potential seizure of that interest income. Later  the US State Department revealed that Washington continues to be “in active conversations with our allies and partners  including the G7” on potential ways to seize the Russian assets.“The decision of what to do with Russia’s frozen assets rests solely with the countries that are holding these assets and the negotiations among them ” Gopinath said.She added that IMF analysts would evaluate the impact of any decisions made on the fund’s members and on the global economy  if and when that happens.“I think the broad contour always is that you want to make sure that whatever you are doing has sufficient legal support  so that you don’t end up with risks down the line ” she emphasized.The official declined to comment on the effectiveness of Western sanctions imposed on Russia but acknowledged that the country has been able “to export large quantities of oil despite the price cap  having earned a large amounts in terms of export earnings.”For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.03,0.61,0.36,negative,0.04,0.28,0.68,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'IMF issues', 'warning', 'IMF First Deputy Managing Director', 'Foreign Policy magazine', 'Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'sufficient legal support', 'Russian central bank', 'US State Department', 'IMF analysts', 'legal grounds', 'The US', 'Ukraine conflict', 'European Council', 'potential seizure', 'active conversations', 'potential ways', 'broad contour', 'Western sanctions', 'large quantities', 'price cap', 'large amounts', 'export earnings', 'business section', 'Russian assets', 'senior official', 'frozen reserves', 'Gita Gopinath', 'interest income', 'global economy', 'fund', 'assessment', 'steps', 'interview', 'Monday', 'beginning', 'Washington', 'allies', 'partners', 'G7', 'decision', 'countries', 'negotiations', 'impact', 'members', 'risks', 'line', 'effectiveness', 'country', 'oil', 'terms', 'stories', 'finance']",2024-02-13,2024-02-14,rt.com

Her comments came after the European Council took steps for the potential seizure of interest earned on Moscow’s frozen sovereign funds.Western countries have blocked an estimated $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian central bank since the start of Moscow’s military campaign against Ukraine in February 2022. Of that amount  €196.6 billion ($211 billion) is being held by the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear  which last year earned nearly €4.4 billion worth of interest on the funds.While there have been calls to confiscate the money outright and transfer it to Ukraine  skeptics have warned that this could erode global trust in the EU’s banking sector  with such drastic measures being far from watertight legally.Speaking on Tuesday  Zakharova declared that the confiscation of Russian funds would be “theft ” adding that “this is the appropriation of what you don’t own.” The diplomat claimed that the West has already begun tempering its appetite and calculating the potential impact of Russian countermeasures  after it “realized that our response would be extremely harsh.”Zakharova concluded by warning that Moscow would consider Western states to be “thieves” and would treat them accordingly should they seize its sovereign funds.Over the weekend  the Russian Foreign Ministry accused Brussels of attempting to “create the illusion of legitimacy over attacks on our property and thereby camouflage what is in fact an outright theft.”The European Council ordered on Monday that “extraordinary cash balances accumulating due to EU restrictive measures” be kept in separate accounts  with depositors holding frozen Russian assets prohibited from disposing of any interest or profits from the funds.“This decision paves the way for the Council to decide on a possible establishment of a financial contribution to the EU budget raised on these net profits to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction at a later stage ” officials in Brussels clarified in a statement.The US State Department was quick to applaud the decision  while spokesperson Matthew Miller revealed that Washington continues to be “in active conversations with our allies and partners  including the G7” on potential ways to seize Russian assets.Earlier this month  EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni acknowledged that Brussels is treading carefully on the issue. He noted that the bloc had overcome a Hungarian veto on a new aid package to Ukraine  meaning that the EU no longer had to address the issue of frozen Russian funds “in a rushed way.”,neutral,0.04,0.78,0.19,negative,0.02,0.31,0.67,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'West', 'thieves', 'Moscow', 'EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni', 'Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear', 'The US State Department', 'Russian Foreign Ministry', 'extraordinary cash balances', 'spokesperson Matthew Miller', 'new aid package', 'Russian central bank', 'The European Council', 'EU restrictive measures', 'frozen Russian assets', 'drastic measures', 'Russian countermeasures', 'EU budget', 'Russian funds', 'Western nations', 'harsh” countermeasures', 'potential seizure', 'Western countries', 'military campaign', '€4.4 billion worth', 'global trust', 'banking sector', 'potential impact', 'Western states', 'outright theft', 'separate accounts', 'possible establishment', 'financial contribution', 'later stage', 'active conversations', 'potential ways', 'Hungarian veto', 'sovereign funds', 'net profits', 'rushed way', 'response', 'comments', 'steps', 'interest', 'Moscow', 'start', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'amount', 'calls', 'money', 'skeptics', 'Tuesday', 'confiscation', 'appropriation', 'diplomat', 'appetite', 'weekend', 'Brussels', 'illusion', 'legitimacy', 'attacks', 'property', 'fact', 'Monday', 'depositors', 'decision', 'recovery', 'reconstruction', 'officials', 'statement', 'Washington', 'allies', 'partners', 'G7', 'issue', 'bloc']",2024-02-13,2024-02-14,rt.com

It requires central securities depositaries (CSDs) to separately account for extraordinary cash balances accumulated as a result of the EU restrictive measure. In addition  CSDs are prohibited from using net profits generated by the frozen assets.The EU and the Group of Seven (G7) froze some $323 billion of Russian central-bank assets following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.Two-thirds of these funds held are in the EU  largely by Belgium's Euroclear clearing house. So far  only taxes on the assets in Belgium have been earmarked to a dedicated fund for Ukraine handled by the Belgian government.""Today's decision  in line with the G7 position  clarifies...the legal status of the revenues generated by the CSDs in connection with [the] holding of Russian immobilized assets and sets clear rules for the entities holding them "" said the EU Council  a legislative body that groups member states.The EU and G7 have been debating how the funds could be used to help Ukraine. The United States floated the idea of confiscating the assets outright  but EU officials viewed this as legally too risky.The EU estimates $16 billion in profits on Russian assets could be carved out for Ukraine over the next four years.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the decision on X  formerly Twitter.""We encourage further steps to enable their practical use for Ukraine's benefit. These steps must be ambitious and prompt "" he said.The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment  Reuters reported.Moscow has said that any attempt to use frozen Russian assets as collateral to raise funds for Ukraine would be illegal and Moscow would challenge it.After Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  the EU decided to ban any operations related to the management of reserves and assets of the Bank of Russia.In connection with the growth of inflation and interest rates in the EU  these funds began to generate significantly higher profits than before. Euroclear said the frozen Russian assets it holds generated 3 billion euros in profits in just nine months of 2023.With reporting by ReutersSource: https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-frozen-assets-profits-eu- ukraine/32816838.htmlCopyright (c) 2024.

So far  only taxes on the assets in Belgium have been earmarked to a dedicated fund for Ukraine handled by the Belgian government.EU member states had given their political green light last month as part of the bloc’s show of support for Ukraine ahead of the second anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February.The legislation passed on Monday means central securities depositaries (CSDs)  such as Euroclear  will be prohibited from using net profits and must keep revenues from the Russian assets separate and stored until EU member states unanimously decide to set up a mechanism for them to be used.The European Commission would then be expected to transfer the money to the EU budget and subsequently to Ukraine  though it is not specified when it would arrive there to be used.The proposal only targets future profits and will not apply retrospectively.It applies to institutions holding over €1 million of Russia’s Central Bank assets.“Today’s decision  in line with the G7 position  clarifies (…) the legal status of the revenues generated by the CSDs in connection with holding of Russian immobilised assets and sets clear rules for the entities holding them ” said the Council of the EU.“This decision paves the way for the Council to decide on a possible establishment of a financial contribution to the EU budget raised on these net profits to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction at a later stage ” it added.EU officials said this could generate an estimated €15-17 billion over four years that could be transferred to Ukraine.Ukraine welcomes step  but asks for moreUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the announcement  saying Kyiv would “encourage further steps to enable their practical use for Ukraine’s benefit. These steps must be ambitious and prompt.”“Ukraine is ready to continue working with partners on reaching our ultimate goal: making Russian assets available to Ukraine. The aggressor must pay ” Kuleba said.The EU immobilised around €200 billion of Russian assets shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Beyond the profits from the frozen assets  the United States has also floated the idea of confiscating the assets outright  but EU officials so far view this as too risky legally.The separate push led by the US and backed by the UK  Japan and Canada to confiscate all Russia’s assets  rather than just profits  is facing resistance from European G7 members  especially Germany  Italy and France.EU officials and critical member states have voiced concern not only with the legality of such an unprecedented confiscation of sovereign assets but also due to European Central Bank concerns over the potential consequences for the euro currency.Investors could pull out of euro assets out of concern their money might one day be seized too  they say.Russia warns WestRussia warned the West on Tuesday (13 February) that it would react should the US and EU seize hundreds of billions worth of Russian assets.“This is theft: It’s the appropriation of something that doesn’t belong to you ” Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Sputnik radio  TASS reported.Zakharova said the response from Moscow would be “extremely tough” as Russia felt it was essentially dealing with thieves.“Considering that our country has qualified this as theft  the attitude will be towards thieves ” Zakharova said. “Not as political manipulators  not as overplayed technologists  but as thieves.”Moscow has pledged Russia would retaliate by confiscating Western assets in Russia  which some reports put at $288 billion.[Edited by Alice Taylor]Read more with Euractiv,neutral,0.24,0.63,0.13,mixed,0.07,0.27,0.67,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets profits', 'EU', 'step', 'Ukraine', 'Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba', 'European Central Bank concerns', 'Russian central bank assets', 'central securities depositaries', 'The European Union', 'The European Commission', 'critical member states', 'political green light', 'European G7 members', 'Russian immobilised assets', 'clearing house Euroclear', 'EU member states', 'Russian assets', 'United States', 'political manipulators', 'frozen assets', 'sovereign assets', 'euro assets', 'Western assets', 'new law', 'legislative route', 'specific circumstances', 'dedicated fund', 'Belgian government', 'second anniversary', 'G7 position', 'legal status', 'clear rules', 'possible establishment', 'financial contribution', 'later stage', 'four years', 'practical use', 'ultimate goal', 'separate push', 'unprecedented confiscation', 'potential consequences', 'euro currency', 'billions worth', 'Sputnik radio', 'Alice Taylor', 'EU budget', 'EU officials', 'full-scale invasion', 'net profits', 'future profits', 'Ukraine', 'reconstruction', 'adoption', 'Monday', 'February', 'move', 'line', 'steps', 'way', 'funds', 'Two-thirds', 'majority', 'Belgium', 'taxes', 'part', 'bloc', 'show', 'support', 'legislation', 'CSDs', 'revenues', 'mechanism', 'money', 'proposal', 'institutions', 'Today', 'decision', 'connection', 'holding', 'entities', 'Council', 'recovery', 'announcement', 'Kyiv', 'benefit', 'aggressor', 'Moscow', 'idea', 'Japan', 'Canada', 'resistance', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'France', 'legality', 'Investors', 'Tuesday', 'hundreds', 'theft', 'appropriation', 'something', 'TASS', 'response', 'thieves', 'country', 'attitude', 'technologists', 'reports', 'Euractiv']",2024-02-13,2024-02-14,euractiv.com

We also continued to build Orion's future step by step. It is embodied in our decisions to increase our production capacity and to open an R&D office in the US  to name a few. Our new organisational structure came into effect at the beginning of 2023 and  as expected  has already shown its benefits by allowing the business divisions to focus more on their strengths  respective markets and customers. As always  during the year we also faced some challenges and demanding projects  such as the closure of our business in Russia and the transfer of Orion Pension Fund's statutory pensions to an external pension insurance company. These were also handled very well and I would like to take this opportunity to warmly thank all our employees for their achievements and accomplishments in 2023!The R&D pipeline and Nubeqa® are also at the heart of our refined strategy. In the strategy period 2024-2028  Innovative Medicines and Nubeqa® will drive Orion's revenue and profit growth  and the other business divisions will also play an important role in the strategy. The Branded Products  Generics and Consumer Health  and Animal Health business divisions have the task of generating a stable revenue stream and pursuing growth. Fermion's key role is to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for Orion's current and future innovative medicines. Our goal is that a growing revenue stream will enable the increased rational investment in R&D and other growth projects required to build Orion's future  and a growing dividend for shareholders. The updated financial targets for 2024-2028 will guide and help us to deliver on our strategy.Our clinical development pipeline progressed in a number of ways during 2023. In total  we initiated no less than three new Phase III clinical projects in prostate cancer during the year. One trial with Bayer on darolutamide and two with MSD on ODM-208. We also started a Phase IIa clinical trial with ODM-105 for the treatment of insomnia and a Phase I clinical trial with ODM-212 for the treatment of solid tumours. Other clinical trials progressed as planned during the year. The results of our Phase III ARANOTE clinical trial  conducted in collaboration with Bayer  are expected to be completed in the first half of 2024  and we plan to start Phase II clinical trials in both acute and chronic pain with our pain molecule ODM-111  a NaV 1.8 inhibitor  during 2024. Our clinical development pipeline is currently solid  especially for late-stage projects. Our aim and desire is to strengthen the earlier stage as well and bring a steadier flow of new projects into the clinical development pipeline. To this end  we have also been determined to advance and grow our early-stage research pipeline  which should eventually lead to new projects entering the clinical phase.In January–December 2023  our net sales were EUR 1 189.7 (1 340.6) million and operating profit was EUR 274.9 (439.6) million. The decline in both reported net sales and operating profit is due to a significant EUR 228 million upfront payment recorded in 2022. Excluding this upfront and its EUR 208 million net impact on profits in 2022 as well as the EUR 30.7 million item related to the transfer of the Orion Pension Fund's B fund in 2023  both net sales and operating profit increased slightly in 2023. The most important drivers for this positive development were the increase in Nubeqa® royalties  the increase in sales of the Easyhaler® product portfolio as well as EUR 30 million Nubeqa® sales milestone. Overall  2023 progressed as expected  with the exception of lower than expected deliveries to our partners of entacapone products and some animal health products.In our outlook for 2024 Orion's net sales is estimated to be EUR 1 340 million to EUR 1 410 million and operating profit EUR 270 million to EUR 310 million. Both net sales and operating profit assume that during 2024 Orion will receive one Nubeqa® sales milestone payment of EUR 70 million.The guidance range in the operating profit estimate is mainly due to Nubeqa's sales booked by Orion and the development of R&D costs. The exact level of Nubeqa® royalties and timing of deliveries are difficult to predict and any variances from the predicted levels and timings may have notable impact on our operating profit.Over the past few years  we have been determined to increase our investment in early-stage research in line with our growth strategy. This work is now starting to bear fruit and several projects are approaching the clinical development phase. Progressing these projects will also require significantly higher R&D expenditure than in the past. At the same time  projects in the clinical development phase have advanced and will advance during 2024  which will increase project costs. However  there are uncertainties related to the progress and timing of projects  which may mean that not all the costs projected for 2024 will materialise. The assumptions behind the outlook are explained in the section of this review entitled 'Basis for outlook in more detail'.Orion enters 2024 with confidence and in a good position. We expect net sales and operating profit to improve year-on-year. In line with our refined strategy  the growing revenue stream will provide us with opportunities to invest more in R&D and other growth projects. The road is open for profitable growth!""StrategyOrion’s Board of Directors has confirmed the Company’s strategy for 2024–2028.Global trends and operating environment for pharma IndustryThe following key global trends drive growth opportunities and challenges in pharma industry and affect Orion’s operating environment:Demographics and aging of population: as population ages  the prevalence of various diseases increases  causing increased demand for drugs and treatments.Cost pressure in healthcare and pharmaceuticals: the share of healthcare costs of available funds continues to increase  both at national and individual level  creating needs for cost-effective drugs and treatments.

Orion’s financial objectives for 2024–2028 are:To grow net sales with a compound average annual growth rate (CAGR) of at least 8%.To grow operating profit faster than net sales.To maintain an equity ratio of at least 50% and to generate return on equity (ROE) of 25% or higher.To increase the dividend per share annually with a payout ratio of 50% to 100%.Achievement of these objectives requires continuous and sufficient investments in development of the product portfolio and growth. Received milestone payments which are part of Orion’s business model can generate volatility in short term growth on net sales and operating profit.Proposal by Orion Corporation’s Board of Directors on use of profit funds from the financial year 2023Orion Corporation’s distributable funds at 31 December 2023 are EUR 596 791 619.35 of which the profit for the financial year is EUR 231 377 914.00. The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 1.62 per share be paid for the financial year that ended on 31 December 2023. No dividend shall be paid on treasury shares held by the Company on the record date for dividend payment. On the date of the proposal on the distribution of profits there are 140 351 305 shares entitling to dividend  and thus the total dividend would be EUR 227 369 114.10.According to the proposal  the dividend would be paid in two instalments. The first instalment of EUR 0.81per share would be paid to a shareholder who is on the record date for the payment of the dividend  22 March 2024  registered in the Company’s shareholders’ register maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy. The Board of Directors proposes that the first instalment would be paid on 3 April 2024. The second instalment of EUR 0.81 per share would be paid to a shareholder who is on the record date for the payment of the dividend  16 October 2024  registered in the Company’s shareholders’ register maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy. The Board of Directors proposes that the second instalment would be paid on 23 October 2024.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting would authorise the Board of Directors to resolve  if necessary  on a new record date for payment and payment date for the second instalment of the dividend in case of changes in the rules of Euroclear Finland Oy or the regulations regarding the Finnish book-entry system or if other rules binding the Company so require.In addition  the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that EUR 350 000 of the Company’s distributable funds be donated to medical research and other purposes of public interest as decided by the Board of Directors. Any remaining distributable funds would be allocated to retained earnings.There have been no material changes in the Company’s financial position since the end of the financial year. The liquidity of the Company is good and  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  the proposed profit distribution would not compromise the liquidity of the Company.Outlook for 2024Net sales are estimated to be EUR 1 340 million to EUR 1 410 million.Operating profit is estimated to be EUR 270 million to EUR 310 million.Basis for outlook in more detailCollaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical companies are an integral part of Orion’s business model. Agreements often include payments recorded in net sales and operating profit that vary greatly from year to year. Forecasting the timing and amount of these payments is difficult. In some cases  they are conditional on terms such as R&D outcomes which are not known until studies have been completed  the progress of R&D projects or the attainment of specified sales levels. Regarding possible new contracts under negotiation  neither the outcome nor the schedule of contract negotiations is generally known before the final signing of the agreement.Orion is eligible to receive milestone payments from Bayer based on sales of the Nubeqa® product upon meeting certain global annual sales thresholds for the first time. In 2023 Orion received one such milestone payment of EUR 30 million. The outlook for 2024 includes one Nubeqa® sales-related milestone payment of EUR 70 million which is included in both the net sales outlook and the operating profit outlook. The outlook does not include any other material milestone payments or one-offs.The outlook assumes that Orion's own production and other operations will be able to operate normally throughout the year  and the supply chains of raw materials or ready-made products are not facing significant disruptions. These and other risks are discussed in more detail under 'Near-term risks and uncertainties'.The outlook does not include income  expenses or other impacts related to any future material product or company acquisition or divestment.Milestone payments received by Orion in 2019–2023Year 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 EUR million 51 42 3 234 32Net salesThe outlook assumes that the net sales of Nubeqa® booked by Orion  and thus the net sales of the Innovative Medicines business division  will clearly increase in 2024. Orion’s assumption is based on forecasts received from its partner Bayer. However  it is difficult to predict the exact level of product sales and royalties for the whole year of a strongly growing product. In addition  the EUR 70 million Nubeqa®-related milestone is expected to increase the net sales of the Innovative Medicines business division.Branded Products and Animal Health business divisions are also estimated to improve their net sales in 2024. Branded Products growth is anticipated to be driven by the Easyhaler® product portfolio. The sales of entacapone products are assumed to recover somewhat after challenging year 2023. At the same time  however  the market conditions for the entacapone products continue to be tough with increasing competition and declining prices in many markets  and as a result  the sales of the entacapone products are anticipated to be flat in 2024. Animal Health growth is anticipated to be driven by sedatives portfolio  products in launch phase and improving market conditions.Generics and Consumer Health business division continues to suffer from the decline of Simdax® and dexmedetomidine products due to generic competition and falling prices  but less than in the recent years. Overall volume of generic products are expected to grow but at the same time prices are expected to decline. Due to the aforementioned reasons  the net sales of the Generic and Consumer Health business division is assumed to decrease slightly in 2024.Fermion has been operating at very near full capacity over the past few years. The share of manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredients of Orion's own proprietary drugs is estimated to increase  which may restrict capacity allocated to external business.Operating profitGross profit is expected to increase clearly driven by growing Nubeqa® royalties and the anticipated EUR 70 million Nubeqa®-related sales milestone.The wide range in the operating profit estimate is mainly due to Nubeqa's sales booked by Orion and the development of R&D costs. It is difficult to predict the exact level of royalties for the whole year of a strongly growing product. Any variance from the predicted level can have notable impact on Orion's operating profit. Also  the mechanism by which each quarter's product deliveries are always fully deducted from the next quarter's royalty payments  is causing variance to operating profit. Even though this impact on operating profit is only temporary  the timing of product deliveries may have notable impact on Orion's operating profit in one calendar year.Over the past few years  Orion has been determined to increase its investment in early-stage research in line with its growth strategy. This work is now starting to bear fruit and several projects are approaching the clinical development phase. Progressing these projects will also require significantly higher R&D expenditure than in the past. At the same time  projects in the clinical development phase have advanced and will advance during 2024  which will increase project costs. However  there are uncertainties related to the progress and timing of projects  which may mean that not all the costs projected for 2024 will materialise. Currently Orion is not booking any costs related to the development of ODM-208 and thus the outlook does not include any ODM-208 related R&D costs.Sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase mainly due to growing investments to the Easyhaler® sales and increasing Nubeqa® royalty payable due to an agreement with Endo Pharmaceuticals.Capital expenditureThe Group’s total capital expenditure in 2024 is expected to be at a similar level as in 2023  when capital expenditure was EUR 93 million. The estimate of capital expenditure does not include any investments related to any future material product or company acquisition.Near-term risks and uncertaintiesThe outlook assumes that Orion's own production and other operations will be able to operate normally. The realisation of sales of Orion-manufactured products requires that production and the related supply chains and other operations are able to operate at the planned level. There are a number of risks that could even materially disrupt Orion's production or other operations. Such risks include  for example  accidents  strikes  employee illness  poor availability of supplies  equipment  spare parts  products  energy  starting materials or semi-finished products  and the failure of logistics chains or serious disruptions to information or communication systems. Current risks to supply and logistics chains include geopolitical conflicts and unrest around the world. In addition to conflicts and unrest  any other unforeseen changes in the operating environment could cause disruptions to Orion's production  supply chains or other operations. Such risks may include accidents  strikes  natural disasters  epidemics and pandemics  wars  terrorism  cyber-attacks or hybrid influencing.Sales of individual products and also Orion’s sales in individual markets may vary  for example depending on the extent to which the ever-tougher price and other competition prevailing in pharmaceutical markets in recent years will specifically focus on Orion’s products. Changes in pharmaceutical regulation in individual markets or more broadly  for example at EU level  may affect the sales and profitability of Orion's products. Changes in overall market demand may also have negative impact on sales.Product deliveries to key partners are based on timetables that are jointly agreed in advance. Nevertheless  they can change  for example as a consequence of decisions concerning adjustments of stock levels. In addition  changes in market prices and exchange rates affect the value of deliveries.Currently no single currency is posing a material exchange rate risk for Orion. In Orion’s total net sales  the share of invoicing in US dollars has fallen to around ten per cent. At the same time  the value of purchases in dollars has increased. The weight of the US dollar will increase due to increasing sales of Nubeqa®. Other key currencies that carry an exchange rate risk are European currencies other than EUR. However  the overall effect of the risk arising from currencies of European countries will be abated by the fact that Orion has organisations of its own in most European countries  which means that in addition to sales income there are also costs in these currencies. The exchange rate performance of the Japanese yen is significant due to sales of Parkinson’s drugs in Japan.The current geopolitical conflicts and unrest  and other challenges in the global supply and logistics chains of pharmaceuticals have increased the already elevated risk of supply disruptions. Moreover  the disruptions  production volume changes and logistical challenges experienced in other industries may also have unexpected and sudden ramifications that can manifest as shortages of necessary raw materials  supplies and equipment in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and as increases in prices. The possible rise of raw material prices and other supply chain costs deteriorates the profitability of Orion's products  since in the pharmaceuticals industry it is very difficult to pass on cost increases to the prices of own products  especially prescription medicines  particularly in Europe. If high cost inflation occurs  it will pose a risk to Orion's profitability.Authorities and key customers in different countries carry out regular and detailed inspections of drug development and manufacturing at Orion’s production sites. Any remedial actions that may be required may at least temporarily have effects that decrease delivery reliability and increase costs. Orion’s product range also contains products manufactured by other pharmaceutical companies and products that Orion manufactures on its own but for which other companies supply active pharmaceutical or other ingredients and components or parts (among these the Easyhaler® products). Possible problems related to the delivery reliability or quality of the products of those manufacturers may cause a risk to Orion’s delivery reliability. The single-channel system used for pharmaceuticals distribution in Finland  in which Orion’s products have been delivered to customers through only one wholesaler  may also cause risks to delivery reliability.Research projects always entail uncertainty factors that may either increase or decrease estimated costs. The projects may progress more slowly or faster than assumed  or they may be discontinued. Nonetheless  changes that may occur in ongoing clinical studies are reflected in costs relatively slowly and are not expected to have a material impact on earnings in the current year. Owing to the nature of the research process  the size and costs of new studies that are being started are known relatively well in advance. However  there are uncertainties in the timing and progression of any individual study. Any changes in the timing of new research or development phases that are being launched may have a material impact on the projected cost structure within a single year. Orion often undertakes the last  in other words Phase III  clinical trials in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies. Commencement of these collaboration relationships and their structure also materially affect the schedule and cost level of research projects.Collaboration arrangements are an important component of Orion’s business model. Possible collaboration and licensing agreements related to these arrangements also often include payments to be recorded in net sales that may materially affect Orion’s financial results. The payments may be subject to conditions relating to the progress of research projects or sales or to new contracts to be signed  and whether these conditions or contracts materialise and what their timing is  will always entail uncertainties.Webcast and Conference CallA webcast and a conference call for analysts  investors and media representatives will be held on Tuesday  13 February 2024 at 13.30 EET.A link to the live webcast is available on Orion's website at www.orion.fi/en/investors .

The greater the volume and the higher the quality of the data (standardized big data)  the more ‘intelligent' the models they are used to train become. This process corresponds exactly to the core DNA of Artprice by Artmarket's operating model which masters both the computer science of programming and the computer science of induction which defines AI.Our progress in the field of AI was substantially accelerated by our targeted acquisition (initially by Groupe Serveur  then by Artprice) of innovative companies like Xylologic (in 1999) a Swiss company of prestigious scientists (from CERN  WHO  etc.) that was considerably ahead of its time and which already prefigured the birth and development of AI (see our reference document).A rare occurrence for a company listed on a regulated market  Artprice by Artmarket has twice consecutively obtained the state label “Innovative Company”  subject to strict eligibility conditions  awarded by France's Public Investment Bank (BPI).According to thierry Ehrmann  founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com: “With its proprietary AI – baptized “Intuitive Artmarket ®” – in 2024 Artprice by Artmarket will be able to take each of its 7.2 million customers and members on superb customized journeys of art discover y with lightning speed……In the cozy world of major global professional database publishers  it is vital for the long-term development of our industr y that we integrate proprietary AI into our c ore businesses  which is why Artprice by Armarket has acquired a substantial headstart in this domain since 1999 and made 2024 the key year for its Intuitive Artmarket ®. In economic term s   this tool will generate more so ph isticated subscription options and therefore more recurring turnover (ARR).I nvestors are looking for serious investment opportunities in the field of AI on both sides of the Atlantic.O ur algorithms and billions of proprietary log s along with our texts and tens of millions of artworks from the Artprice databases allow us to i dentify all the terminology that qualify artist s' universes  their inspiration  the mediums they use  their themes  their shapes and volumes  etc... and then create a syntony by opening up the worlds of the 833 000 artists we follow with their biographies and certified data  going far beyond classic academic visual criteria via the neural networks of our Intuitive Artmarket ® AI. ”Intuitive Artmarket ® will notably calculate the values of artworks based on an analysis of past sales that is specific to Artprice; but it will also be able to anticipate future fluctuations  including for totally unique works. It will also make it possible to identify highly complex transversal artistic trends that largely escape the academic  institutional and university worlds.Our Intuitive Artmarket® AI will have numerous applications within the scope of Artprice by Artmarket  all offering high-added value and featuring numerous paid services.Of the many new service projects in 2024 for Artmarket's clients  we plan to link Intuitive Artmarket® with our Standardized Marketplace® which was created in 2005 and offers over 77 000 artworks at a fixed or biddable price. We also plan to link our Intuitive Artmarket® to all of Artprice by Artmarket's databases.Intuitive Artmarket® will constantly assist Artmarket clients – whether art enthusiasts  art market professionals or museum curators – to build and/or manage their collections.With the analysis of billions of logs  125 million clipped and tokenized images of artworks  more than ten million auction results (word embedding)  Intuitive Artmarket® will be able to provide extremely relevant solutions for customers wishing to start  or manage  an art collection.To build the collection  Intuitive Artmarket® will provide suggestions for works to acquire based on criteria the client has provided such as the budget allocated over time  the artistic movement(s) the customer is interested in  the preferred medium(s)  the favorite artist(s) or similar artists  the preferred dimensions of the works  the favorite acquisition location(s) (in full compliance with the different legislative frameworks on personal data security). It will also be able to identify from the behavioral analysis of the client's searches certain preferences that neither the client nor an appointed expert might have been aware of. It goes without saying that this analysis via Intuitive Artmarket® will be conducted with the consent of the client as part of his/her paid subscription (in accordance with the terms and conditions enumerated in the General Conditions of Sale and Use attached to his or her subscription).As regards collection management  Intuitive Artmarket® will update the value of the collection in real-time  not only by taking into account the latest auction results but also by projecting trends with expected results  built on in-depth data analysis.Intuitive Artmarket® will notify the collector and/or art market professional of sale and/or purchase opportunities  depending on the objectives identified by the collector or the professional over time. These may range from the desire to enhance the pecuniary value of a portfolio to the desire to enhance the artistic value of a collection; everything will be possible via an intuitive configuration.Contemporary artists will also be able to use this tool to offer their works for sale on our Standardized Marketplace® with higher probabilities of reaching buyers  particularly artists producing NFTs. Bearing in mind all the underlying parameters and data  Artprice is the only platform on the global market that can deal effectively with the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs in an environment of cryptocurrencies alongside the major international currencies.With Intuitive Artmarket®  it has never been so easy and intuitive to discover the parallel worlds of ‘Online Art' and ‘Auction House Art' (we are directly linked to 7 200 auction operators around the world).In today's extraordinarily busy world  every minute counts and Intuitive Artmarket® will allow users to explore the Standardized Marketplace® and monitor the global art market with infinitely better results and much more quickly. Less time spent also means less energy spent  which is perfectly in line with Artmarket.com's eco-responsible approach.Artificial Intelligence has opened the door to a deluge of IP conflicts such as the legal dispute surrounding Stability AI  the creator of an AI generating synthetic photos  now accused by Getty Images of having extracted millions of images from Getty Images databanks.ChatGPT is regularly the subject of professional news media headlines like “ Is ChatGPT violat ing copyrights?”... to which the vast majority of lawyers respond that it is nothing more and nothing less than a veritable copyright pillage – and therefore a massive copyright violation engine – which makes OpenAI  for its part  an outright counterfeiter.And then there is the historic initiative by the Authors Guild  the largest professional association of American writers  which  according to Rolling Stone magazine  filed a class action on 20 September 2023 in a New York Supreme Court against the company Open AI (creator of ChatGPT)  accusing it of ‘feeding' or ‘training' its large language model (LLM) with their copyright-protected works. Authors Guild President  Maya Shanbhag Lang said  “This is just the beginning... We do not bring this suit lightly. We are here to fight.”In contrast  Artmarket's AI (Intuitive Artmarket ®) is based exclusively on its massive proprietary content which is protected under intellectual property law  thereby allowing us to overcome these obstacles and potential prohibitions. In other words  our Intuitive Artmarket ® has no need to look elsewhere for data or for responses to very specific searches from art market amateurs or professionals.This fact will underpin and generate constant growth in our turnover and guarantee the sustainability of our model  which  in turn  will generate considerable upside potential and peace of mind for Artprice by Artmarket.com's shareholders. Over the last two decades Artprice has recorded  observed and induced hundreds of millions of human decisions in relation to the art market. This market is of course infinitely complex due to the heterogeneous and singular nature of art on the other hand  and the abstract notion of beauty at the limits of human emotion on the other.The algorithmic learning that has fueled our AI has allowed Artprice to create AI models that are unique to the specific world of the Art Market and which constitute Artprice by Artmarket's strongest revenue-generating power.For over 20 years  Artprice by Artmarket has gradually stabilized its ‘alignment problem'  a key issue for the successful genesis then construction of its AI (Intuitive Artmarket®). For the Artprice group  the so-called ‘alignment problem' means all of the scientific and ethical questions raised by the relationship of its artificial intelligence system (and its induced results) with the values  expectations and human sensitivities specific to the Artprice by Artmarket group  its clients and the intangible and centuries-old rules of the art market.Artmarket's AI (Intuitive Artmarket ®) will be supervised by ‘prompt engineers'  a new career that includes the programming and management of proprietary AI.The possibilities offered by properly managed AI are therefore immense  which explains its popularity: Microsoft ® Bing Chat now attracts more than 100 million active users per day with a commitment to responsible AI that respects copyright and copyright-related rights.Microsoft has already started rolling out Bing Chat for Business and Microsoft Copilot in paid subscription mode.Microsoft's Copilot® works with GPT-4 Turbo  the new DALL-E 3 model  and is now Microsoft's spearhead service at the heart of its 365 Business Premium and Business Standard licenses. Indeed  Microsoft has clearly demonstrated that its AI Copilot® is a very powerful accelerator of its sales of ‘365' subscriptions to its cloud  thereby confirming the viability of this AI economic model for Artprice and its Intuitive Artmarket®.Via thousands of beta test searches on the art market and on artists  Artprice by Artmarket.com has observed that Bing IA GPT-4 regularly cited Artprice and Artmarket.com URLs in reference to its sources. Microsoft® Bing works in partnership with OpenAI to deliver an experience that encourages responsible use. Likewise  Chat GPT-4 Pro is in paid mode on Apple iOS and Android.For reference  one of the best-known neural networks is the Google search algorithm that Artprice has studied and analyzed daily since 1999. Since the beginning of 2023  Artprice Inc.  our American subsidiary  has been following the development of Google Bard and notably since the release on 8 February 2024 of its Gemini Pro AI with its Ultra 1.0 interface  a direct competitor to GPT-4. Gemini is a prototype chatbot (an experimental conversational AI service) built by Google based on its LaMDA language model. Here too  Artprice engineers measured the searches on Google Bard and Gemini specific to the art market and noted a high volume of responses relative to links to Artprice databases.One of the G7's major concerns is the rapid adoption of regulations on AI.Europe  and particularly France  wants to make the European continent one of the world leaders in AI  and it is interesting to note that the first texts regulating artificial intelligence are currently being passed into law.“The Council of the European Union approves a text to regulate artificial intelligence”On Friday 2 February 2024  representatives of EU member states approved new legislation on artificial intelligence. Once voted by the European Parliament  this legislation will constitute a global first. Artprice by Artmarket has participated in the debates that have contributed to this legislation via its lawyers and advisors. This new legislation establishes specific constraints  notably regarding personal data  as well as copyright protection and thorough source quotation.Initially drafted in 2021  the first version of the text had to be completely overhauled because of the evolution of artificial intelligence in recent years.The European project to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) reached a new milestone on Friday  2 February 2024. “Today the 27 Member States unanimously approved the political agreement concluded in December recognizing the balance found by the negotiators between innovation and security”  announced the European Commissioner for the Internal Market  Thierry Breton  on X. The negotiators of the European Parliament and the Council  co-legislators  had reached an agreement in principle on 8 December 2023.The regulation  called the “AI Act”  aims to regulate both the use and the development of artificial intelligence. It is the first such legislative framework in the world. According to a press release from the European Parliament in December 2023  the text “aims to ensure that fundamental rights  democracy  the rule of law and ecological sustainability are protected against high-risk AI  while boosting innovation and making Europe a leader in the field”.Certain uses of these new technologies will be prohibited  such as social rating and behavior manipulation. The most risky practices will have to meet reinforced requirements  such as an obligation of transparency or the implementation of human control over the software.These various provisions and amendments are very positive for Artprice by Artmarket.According to the best Anglo-Saxon financial analysts  who are one step ahead of Europe on this subject  the only economically viable model – i.e. one that does not expose the economic entity (whatever its size) to incessant legal proceedings – is an AI-based on an extremely well-defined economic segment.The economic segment must have information that plays an absolutely vital role  full intellectual property of the entirety of Big Data (including Data Mining)  of the copyright and related rights confirmed on all algorithms  databases  with machine learning (deep learning) and neural networks.In short  the AIs that will triumph with very substantial economic gain and without major industrial or legal risk  are the economic entities that own  in full intellectual property  all of the different stages of the proprietary AI in a defined market segment where expensive high added-value information plays a vital role. And this is exactly the case of the Intuitive Artmarket ® AI developed by Artprice by Artmarket.comOur Intuitive Artmarket ® AI has been designed in total recognition of this reality.The following paragraph was largely generated by our Intuitive Artmarket ® AI systemAccording to thierry Ehrmann  a pioneer of the Internet and databanks since 1987 with his Groupe Serveur  parent company of Artprice (Who's Who In France biography: https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2024/02/2024_Biographie_thierry_Ehrmann_WhosWhoInFrance.pdf)  and Founder of Artprice & CEO of Artmarket  the Group's guiding principle for its AI is very simple: “There cannot be artificial intelligence without human intelligence”.The c ertification by Artprice of NFT primary issuesRelease of the ARTE documentary in 5 languages: “NFT  Chaos in the art world”https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/RC-024624/nft-chaos-dans-le-monde-de-l-art/Throughout this documentary  thierry Ehrmann  visual artist  NFT artist and Founding CEO of Artprice.com  delivers his analysis accompanied by other artists  experts and international players in the world of Art NFTs.Any attempt to understand the significance of NFTs in Art History requires an appreciation of the digital and cultural revolution that they represent and some kind of prediction regarding their role and impact over the short and medium term.Artprice by Artmarket.com can confirm that for the first half of 2024  the Art NFT phenomenon is becoming a lasting segment of the art market on all continents  with new legislation that is currently much more favorable in the USA. Meanwhile  European lawmakers are working on a regulatory framework that will prevent cryptocurrencies being used for money laundering and bring confidence to consumers  investors and operators.This framework has been the subject of studies  conferences and proposals to major French and European government bodies by the Art & Law Institute with which Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a historical member since 1997.According to thierry Ehrmann “In its various annual reports on the Art Market and the regulated information it publishes as a listed company  Artprice by Artmarket.com has always said with regard to NFTs that it is impossible to apprehend this new market without a true understanding of Blockchain  crypto-currencies and their cultural origins among the Cypherpunks (period of PGP-type data encryption at the beginning of the 1990s).”Indeed  OpenSea  the leading NFT platform  itself declared that 80% of primary issues of Art NFTs are likely to impact third-party intellectual property rights. Faced with this observation  Opensea announced it is considering solutions to counter this problem and thereby protect sellers and buyers. This can only lead to the certification of the primary issue market by Artprice.Bearing in mind all the underlying parameters and data required  Artprice by Artmarket is the only organization on the global art market to be able to truly respond to the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs in an environment of cryptocurrencies and major international currencies.This capacity to certify the primary issues of Art NFTs is based on the fact that Artprice by Artmarket has been the Global Leader in Art Market Information for more than 27 years and is the creator and owner of its globally recognized databases. It also has the world's largest documentary collection of art market notes  manuscripts  codices and annotated sales catalogs from 1700 to the present day  which act as a guarantee of the authenticity and historical veracity of its databases.More precisely  we cannot allow the offer of an artwork or of an Art NFT to be posted online without validation of the identity of the artist and of the professional seller  via a very strict and draconian control procedure. In the context of the sale of NFTs  this is all the more important as there is a certain laxity at this level  which has led to numerous problems on other sites.The added value of Artprice by Artmarket is quite simply its knowledge of the artists  either through their previous auction results or through their emerging notoriety. In addition  an Artprice Intranet messaging system is made available to buyers and sellers  so that they can agree on their transaction in a confidential and consensual manner.With its Metaverse – the ultimate and inevitable outcome of the NFT revolution – Artprice by Artmarket aims to be the most successful and competitive Art NFT platform.The Metaverse will guarantee the exponential and continued growth of the art market through NFTs. Alongside the Metaverse  there is the Blockchain and its smart contracts to allow fair remuneration for artists  with copyright bodies such as the ADAGP (in France)  to which Artprice has long been affiliated in order to support artists.Three years ago Artprice recognised that Ethereum would become the reference Blockchain for smart contracts in the Art NFT Market. Christie's 3.0 is also based on the Ethereum Blockchain since 2022.According to a study conducted by Artprice by Artmarket:“All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum /art gallery industry are starting to publish their own NFTs. The vast majority of the major players in the art market have chosen the Ethereum Blockchain whose smart contract ensures a transparent and tamper-proof market.Digital Art – first created in the 1980s – is finally emerging and is appealing to nearly half a billion Art NFT enthusiasts at costs that are now very accessible. The authenticity and traceability of the purchase or sale of Art NFTs is now guaranteed by Blockchain. Samsung TV's Tizen OS  loaded on several hundred million Smart TVs  offers direct access to the “ NFT Art” application among its automatically installed apps  between Netflix and YouTube.There are already more than 54 000 artists identified by Artprice who directly produce their NFTs for their buying public  and this is only the very beginning of a total paradigm shift.According to many sociologists  art historians and analysts  the advent of NFTs is a major event that definitively modifies the structure of the art market and its players as it has been since 1950.Artmarket.com: after including cryptocurrencies alongside traditional currencies for auction results in 2022  the Artprice Standardized Marketplace® has now integrated Bitcoin and Ethereum for buying and selling artworksthierry Ehrmann  the CEO of Artprice by Artmarket: “We were patiently waiting for the right moment to launch this key deployment in the history of Artprice by Artmarket in the best conditions for both the art market and for cryptocurrencies. It is now time for us to take the step of deploying our authoritative Standardized Marketplace® and opening it to the world of cryptocurrencies and NFTs  by entering Web 3.0. which is quite simply the immediate future of the Internet. This step would not have been possible without the knowledge and experience of Artprice  which has been the Global Leader in Art Market Information for more than 25 years.Every day Artprice's Standardized Marketplace® offers more than 77 000 artworks from all over the world. These works are bought and sold by 7.2 million customers and members of Artprice  generating an annual trading volume estimated at several hundred million euros. This platform demonstrates the trust built over more than 18 years between buyers and sellers. It was therefore natural that after adding cryptocurrencies to the means of payment  Artprice should also endow the platform with a new category/medium  Art NFTs  as a sign of their legitimate entry into Art History and the history of the art market.”The decision to quote cryptocurrency prices on our Standardized Marketplace® was taken after a long and careful observation of an increasing consultation of auction results in Bitcoin and Ethereum across all of Artprice's databases since their effective integration into our system in September 2022.These two main cryptocurrencies (ETH and BTC) account for more than 92% of the total value of the approximately 23 000 currently existing cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins).By analyzing its hundreds of millions of connection logs  Artprice has observed – over 17 months – a regular increase in consultations of the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices in its databanks  which are now  in statistical terms  close to the consultations of the major international reference currencies such as the dollar  the euro  sterling and the yen.This evolution at Artprice reflects the growing place of cryptocurrencies in the mentalities and habits of art professionals as well as among collectors and art enthusiasts.But the major event in cryptocurrencies is notably BlackRock's (the largest asset manager in the world) and Fidelity's introduction of ETFs directly invested in Bitcoin (Bitcoin spot ETFs) authorized by the SEC on 11 January 2024. This is a real consecration for Bitcoin which on 9 February 2024 was quoted at around 49 000 dollars  while Ethereum was at $2 500 (ETH ETFs are expected very soon).BlackRock and Fidelity have achieved the best ETF launches in 30 years thanks to Bitcoin. In their first month of trading  the “IBIT” and “FBTC” funds raised $6.5 billion  which is more than any of the 5 500 other index funds launched before them (according to Les Échos of 10 January 2024: “Bitcoin ETF: the SEC opens the doors of Wall Street wide to Bitcoin”.This is a new record for Bitcoin. Of the 5 535 ETFs launched over the last thirty years  none have gotten off to such a strong start as BlackRock's ‘IBIT' and Fidelity's ‘FBTC'  said Bloomberg expert Eric Balchunas.This allows retail and professional investors to gain exposure to the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization  without having to directly hold the asset.Via cryptocurrencies  new collectors and art enthusiasts have been attracted to the art market  often younger than their predecessors. Not averse to speculation and the excitement of taking risks  these art enthusiasts and collectors solidly welded to their crypto-universe of Web 3.0.The near future of Artprice by Artmarket is the meeting place between Web 3.0. (Metaverse and NFT) and Artprice's artificial intelligence  its Intuitive Artmarket ® AI.For this reason  Artprice is currently finalizing the Metaverse of its head office located in the heart of its illustrious L'Organe  Museum of Contemporary Art which manages the Demeure du Chaos / Abode of Chaos (dixit The New York Times). To create the Metaverse of this edifice with its highly singular architecture (that falls into the category “total work of art”) created by thierry Ehrmann (who is also a visual artist)  the European group TT Géoomètres Experts with its 3D Lab and Groupe Serveur (Artprice's parent company) carried out the complete digitization of the 6 300 artworks integrated into the buildings  offices  outbuildings and surrounding walls  covering a surface area of over 7 555 m²  leading to the creation of a digital asset of 12 terra-bytes. This work was conducted from 2018 to 2023. For more information see:https://ftp1.serveur.com/abodeofchaos_singular_architecture.pdfAll the necessary investments have already been fully covered by Groupe Serveur.The Artprice Metaverse  accessible in AR (augmented reality) and/or VR (virtual reality)  currently being finalized  must be designed to make people forget rigid IT with Web 2.0  a real obstacle to creation. It should allow crypto-universe enthusiasts to live their experience fully  in particular through the general release in the USA on 2 February 2024 of the Apple® Vision Pro  which offers spatial computing. Meanwhile  all of the American tech giants are massively investing in AR/VR headsets and glasses.Furthermore  the difficult economic context did not stop Ethereum's transition to “The Merge” on 15 September 2022 for the completely decarbonized Ethereum 2.0 Blockchain (against the backdrop of a global energy crisis. Indeed  according to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to “The Merge”  the electricity consumption of the ETH Blockchain shrank by more than 99.95% by switching from ‘Proof of Work' (PoW) to ‘Proof of Stake' (PoS). The year 2024 will see the new version “The Surge” (EIP-4844) allowing transaction costs to shrink as well (Source Ethereum Foundation).The near future is approaching fast and Artprice by Artmarket is at the forefront of this paradigm shift.Copyright 1987-2024 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Since then  Washington  Brussels  and Kyiv have discussed legal ways of channeling these funds to aid Ukraine's reconstruction efforts but have yet to come to a definitive conclusion.Roughly two-thirds of Russian assets are held in the EU  mainly at the Brussels-based securities depository Euroclear.The EU has been hesitant to confiscate Russian assets outright  fearing legal pitfalls and possible retribution by Russia. Instead  the EU proposed a plan last December to seize about 15 billion euros ($16 billion) in projected profits generated by frozen assets of Russia's Central Bank and transfer them to Ukraine.According to Mudra  the European Commission has already made the decision to concentrate frozen Russian assets in one institution  which is a necessary first step. The EU recently agreed to isolate the immobilized Russian funds  possibly paving the way for the revenue to be eventually redirected to Ukraine.As a second step  the EU must introduce legislation that would enable the bloc to transfer the money to Ukraine  Mudra added.""We had talks with representatives of Belgium  which currently chairs the EU Council.

This was mainly due to index-based rent increases and the most recent acquisitions  which only generated rental income in the same quarter of the previous year partially. Net rental income declined slightly  mainly due to lower income from operating cost allocations compared to the previous year.Funds from operations (""FFO"") decreased by 21.1% year-on-year to EUR 8.0 million (Q1 2022/2023: EUR 10.2 million) or EUR 0.23 per share (Q1 2022/2023: EUR 0.29 per share). This decline was primarily due to the increase in net interest expenses of around EUR 1.5 million.The aFFO (FFO after deduction of capitalised modernisation measures)  on the other hand  increased significantly and amounted to around EUR 6.0 million (Q1 2022/2023: EUR 2.2 million). In the same quarter of the previous year  above-average investments were made in the existing portfolio due to two major revitalisation projects.Property portfolio comprises 184 properties with a balance sheet value of EUR 1.0 billion as at the reporting dateIn the first quarter of the new financial year  no additional properties were acquired  and no existing properties were sold  meaning that the portfolio recognised as at 31 December 2023 still comprised 184 properties with a carrying amount of EUR 1.0 billion. As at the reporting date  the portfolio generated an annual rent of EUR 79.3 million.After the balance sheet date  the sale of the vacant property in Trier/Kenn was completed in January 2024 with the transfer of benefits and encumbrances  meaning that the pro forma portfolio now comprises 183 properties.The gross acquisition yield of the overall portfolio averaged more than 10% as at 31 December 2023.EPRA NTA (fully diluted) at EUR 7.78 per share / Net LTV amounts to around 60.7%The EPRA NTA (fully diluted) increased slightly as a result of the positive result for the period and amounted to EUR 7.78 per share as at 31 December 2023 (30 September 2023: EUR 7.64 per share). The intrinsic value of the share therefore remains significantly higher than the current share price.Due to the ongoing repayments of property financing  the net LTV fell to 60.7% as at the reporting date (30 September 2023: 61.6%).Refinancing of maturing bonds still under negotiation / Communication of an earnings forecast intended for the second half of the financial yearDKR is still in constructive talks with the bondholder of the corporate bonds maturing in April and May 2024. The Company assumes that a mutually acceptable solution will be reached soon.In addition  the Company is working on selective property sales at book value in order to gradually reduce debt.Due to the bond refinancing which is being in progress and the possible property sales  the Management Board is not yet able to make a reliable forecast of the key financial figures for the current financial year 2023/2024.

The EFOY ProShelter is not only 10 times more efficient than a conventional diesel generator  but also reduces emissions by up to 99%. With savings of 30-50% of the total cost of ownership compared to alternative off-grid technologies  this solution effectively contributes to improving the carbon footprint "" says Hans Pol  COO of SFC Energy AG.The EFOY ProShelter ensures a continuous energy supply for off-grid telecoms sites. It is extremely sustainable  especially at locations with low solar irradiation  as it requires little maintenance and the refueling intervals are variable. For example  the fuel cell switches on automatically if the solar system does not provide enough power to charge the battery. As soon as this process is complete  the fuel cell returns to standby mode. The performance of the EFOY ProShelter has been tested in a climate chamber and is classified for use at temperatures down to -40° C. The energy autonomy is designed for approx. 12-18 months.The client is Groupe CLR. The Canadian company was founded more than 40 years ago and has developed into one of the most important players in the field of radio and telecommunication in the province of Quebec.“EFOY ProShelter offer an unmatched power solution for isolated telecommunication sites when dealing with low sun exposure locations such as in Northern Quebec. The low maintenance  customizable refuelling intervals  low emissions and self-heating feature of the solution makes it a no-brainer choice in the autonomous power source market for mission-critical telecommunications infrastructures”  says Réjean Brousseau  Sales Manager of Groupe CLR.Further information on SFC Energy's Clean Energy and Clean Power Management solutions can be found at sfc.com.About SFC Energy AGSFC Energy AG is a leading provider of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions.

Shares in Tui have fallen 33% over the past 12 months.In order to be approved  the proposals now require the support of a supermajority of 75% of Tui’s shareholders  in a vote that will take place during its annual general meeting on Tuesday.If completed  Tui’s exit will come as another blow to the LSE  which some analysts have said is now in a “doom loop ” as major companies have increasingly started to shun Britain’s main bourse.Analysts at Peel Hunt  led by Charles Hall  have argued a lack of initial public offerings (IPOs) on the LSE has led to a drop in liquidity that is in turn leading to low valuations  as investors are increasingly pulling their money out of U.K. equity funds.In a roundtable attended by MarketWatch in November  London Stock Exchange Group CEO David Schwimmer hit back at the notion Britain’s top market is in decline  instead blaming the wider global macroeconomic environment.Schwimmer also challenged the notion that the LSE suffers from low valuations and a lack of liquidity  as he instead said companies were opting to turn away from the market due to the U.K.’s executive compensation practices and a negative media environment.Concerns over the state of the LSE follow a series of blows to the stock market that have seen an array of top companies either switch their primary listings over to U.S. markets or instead simply opt to avoid the U.K. exchange entirely by having their IPOs in New York.In August 2023  British microchip designer Arm Holdings’ ARM  +5.35% decision to list on the U.S. Nasdaq was seen as a major blow to the LSE  following extensive efforts by the U.K. government to persuade the Cambridgeshire tech company to launch its IPO in London instead.Decisions by two of Ireland’s top companies – building materials seller CRH CRH  +3.22% and cardboard packaging maker Smurfit Kappa SK3  +0.13% – to switch their main listings to the New York Stock Exchange in 2023 were also seen as major blows.Irish gambling giant Flutter Entertainment’s FLTR  +1.40% April 2023 decision to switch its secondary listing from the Euronext Dublin to the NYSE also heightened fears the FTSE 100 company may also drop its primary London listing altogether in the near future.Worsening its problems  the LSE has over the previous years suffered a series of outages that have halted trading on the market.The LSE’s data and analytics business currently generates the bulk of firm-wide revenues following its $27 billion acquisition of Refinitiv in 2021.LSEG was approached by MarketWatch for comment.,negative,0.05,0.34,0.61,negative,0.02,0.25,0.73,True,English,"['troubled stock exchange', 'Tui', 'investors', 'plans', 'delisting', 'London', 'British microchip designer Arm Holdings’ ARM', 'London Stock Exchange Group CEO David Schwimmer', 'wider global macroeconomic environment', 'U.K. equity funds', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'U.K. exchange', 'negative media environment', 'annual general meeting', 'initial public offerings', 'executive compensation practices', 'U.S. markets', 'U.S. Nasdaq', 'U.K. government', 'building materials seller', 'cardboard packaging maker', 'Smurfit Kappa SK', 'Irish gambling giant', 'The Hanover-headquartered airline', 'primary London listing', 'German travel company', 'Cambridgeshire tech company', 'Tui Group', 'stock market', 'primary listing', 'secondary listing', 'troubled bourse', 'low valuations', 'ownership structure', 'recent years', 'record high', 'past 12 months', 'doom loop', 'main bourse', 'Peel Hunt', 'Charles Hall', 'extensive efforts', 'CRH CRH', 'main listings', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Euronext Dublin', 'FTSE 100 company', 'near future', 'previous years', 'analytics business', '$27 billion acquisition', 'major companies', 'top companies', 'The LSE', 'market shift', 'top market', 'major blow', '1.40% April 2023 decision', 'firm-wide revenues', 'analysts’ expectations', 'Tui TUI', 'Tui shares', 'blows', '+5.35% decision', '6.31% shares', 'investors', 'favor', 'plans', 'exodus', 'firms', 'concerns', 'lack', 'liquidity', 'proposals', 'June', 'trading', 'place', 'Germany', 'Tuesday', '14.7% uptick', 'order', 'support', 'supermajority', 'shareholders', 'vote', 'exit', 'Britain', 'IPOs', 'drop', 'turn', 'money', 'roundtable', 'MarketWatch', 'November', 'notion', 'decline', 'state', 'series', 'array', 'August', 'Decisions', 'Ireland', 'FLTR', 'NYSE', 'fears', 'problems', 'outages', 'data', 'bulk', 'Refinitiv', 'LSEG', 'comment']",2024-02-13,2024-02-14,marketwatch.com

""With today’s approval  this Onivyde (NALIRIFOX) regimen can now offer a potential new standard-of-care treatment option with proven survival benefits for people living with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the U.S.”Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common type of cancer that forms in the pancreas  with more than 60 000 people diagnosed in the U.S. each year and nearly 500 000 people globally.3 4 Since there are no specific symptoms in the early stages  PDAC is often detected late and after the disease has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic or stage IV).5 Characterized as a complex cancer due to rapid tumor progression  limited genetic targets and multiple resistance mechanisms 6 mPDAC has a poor prognosis with fewer than 20% of people surviving longer than one year.4 5 Overall  pancreatic cancer has the lowest five-year survival rate of all cancer types globally and in the U.S.4 5“Metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a difficult disease to manage with very few available treatment options. Given the reality of this aggressive form of cancer and the complexity of the disease  every advance in the treatment landscape represents a meaningful improvement in patient outcomes.” said Dr. Zev Wainberg  Professor of Medicine and Co-Director of the UCLA GI Oncology Program. “The approval of this Onivyde regimen is an important milestone for people living with mPDAC  their families and healthcare providers  with the NAPOLI 3 trial having demonstrated survival benefits versus a current standard of care treatment option.”“We are pleased that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued this new approval of the NALIRIFOX regimen. With each new approved treatment  there is more hope for those who will be diagnosed in the future and people currently living with pancreatic cancer may have more time with their loved ones ” said Julie Fleshman  JD  MBA  President and CEO of Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN)  a patient advocacy organization committed to providing evidence-based information and resources to patients and caregivers  along with advancing research to improve patient outcomes. “We are thankful to the patients who participated in this clinical trial as they play a crucial role in advancing treatments for pancreatic cancer.”NAPOLI 3 dataThe FDA approval was based on efficacy and safety data from NAPOLI 3  a randomized  open-label  Phase III pivotal trial that enrolled 770 people living with mPDAC between the ages of 20 and 85 without prior treatment across 187 trial site locations in 18 countries. The study  which met the primary and secondary endpoints  was presented as a late-breaking presentation at the ASCO Gastrointestinal conference 2023 and subsequently published in The Lancet.1 7Additionally  NALIRIFOX was recognized by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN) guidelines* and recommended as a preferred  Category 1 treatment option in first-line metastatic disease and as a preferred option in first-line locally advanced disease.8The study demonstrated NALIRIFOX (n=383) provided a statistically significant improvement in median overall survival (mOS) of 11.1 months (95% confidence interval (CI) (10.0  12.1)) compared to 9.2 months (95% CI (8.3  10.6)) in nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine treated patients (n=387); (hazard ratio (HR) 0.84 [95% CI 0.71–0.99]; p=0.0403). 9NALIRIFOX regimen also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 7.4 months (95% CI (6.0  7.7)) versus 5.6 months (95% CI (5.3  5.8)) for nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine treated patients (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.59–0.85]; p=0.0001). 9The objective response rate was 41.8% (36.8%-46.9%; 95% CI) for patients treated with the NALIRIFOX regimen versus 36.2% (31.4%-41.2%; 95% CI) for patients treated with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. 9The safety profile of the Onivyde regimen was manageable and consistent with the profiles of the treatment components  with the potential of serious adverse events of fatal neutropenic fever and severe diarrhea. The most common Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea  fatigue  nausea  vomiting  decreased appetite  abdominal pain  mucosal inflammation  constipation and decreased weight.9 In NAPOLI 3  Grade 3 and 4 diarrhea (early and late-onset) occurred in 20% receiving NALIRIFOX. In the clinical trial  diarrhea was managed following institutional guidelines and appropriate antidiarrheal medications.9*NCCN makes no warranties of any kind whatsoever regarding their content  use or application and disclaims any responsibility for their application or use in any way.ENDSAbout Onivyde (irinotecan liposome injection)Onivyde is a cancer medicine that blocks an enzyme called topoisomerase I  which is involved in copying cell DNA needed to make new cells. By blocking the enzyme  cancer cells are prevented from multiplying and eventually die. In Onivyde  irinotecan is enclosed in tiny fat particles called ‘liposomes’  which accumulate in the tumor and release slowly over time. Onivyde is administered via intravenous infusion over 90 minutes every two weeks  with recommendations on dosing modifications. Onivyde may be prescribed immediately in the U.S. for eligible people living with mPDAC who are treatment naïve or following gemcitabine-based therapy.To support access to Onivyde for eligible individuals in the U.S.  Ipsen Cares patient support program is available as a resource to people living with mPDAC and their caregivers to provide educational support and address coverage  access and reimbursement questions (1-866-435-5677).Onivyde is currently approved in most major markets including the U.S.  Europe and Asia in combination with fluorouracil (FU) and leucovorin (LV) for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy. Onivyde is not indicated as a single agent for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.In 2020  the FDA granted Ipsen Fast Track designation for Onivyde as a first-line combination treatment for mPDAC. The FDA’s Fast Track program facilitates the development and expedites the review of medicines that treat serious conditions and have the potential to address an unmet medical need.Ipsen has exclusive commercialization rights for the current and potential future indications for Onivyde in the U.S. Servier  an independent international pharmaceutical company with an international presence in 150 countries  is responsible for the commercialization of Onivyde outside of the U.S. and Taiwan. PharmaEngine is a commercial stage oncology company headquartered in Taipei and is responsible for the commercialization of Onivyde in Taiwan.About PDACPDAC is the most common type of cancer that forms in the pancreas  with more than 60 000 people diagnosed in the U.S. each year and nearly 500 000 people globally.3 4 Since there are no specific symptoms in the early stages  PDAC is often detected late and after the disease has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic or stage IV).5 Weight loss  abdominal pain and jaundice are the most common symptoms  making PDAC difficult to detect.10 Despite significant advances in cancer treatments since the 1970s  no treatment options for PDAC significantly extend life.5 Currently  fewer than 20% of people diagnosed with PDAC survive longer than one year and  overall  pancreatic cancer has the lowest five-year survival rate of all cancer types globally and in the U.S.3 4About the NAPOLI 3 trial1NAPOLI 3 is a randomized  open-label Phase III trial of an investigational Onivyde treatment regimen (NALIRIFOX) in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for mPDAC. NAPOLI 3 enrolled 770 patients across 187 trial site locations in 18 countries across Europe  North America  South America  Asia  and Australia. Patients were randomized to receive Onivyde plus oxaliplatin  fluorouracil and leucovorin (NALIRIFOX regimen; n=383) twice in a month (days 1 and 15 of 28-day cycle) compared to an injection of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (n=387) administered three times a month (days 1  8  15 of a 28-day cycle).About IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 100 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance.

This is what emerges from an analysis by the Ember think tank on the production of fossil fuels and the role of green energy in the EU. The data highlights how not only did the weight of coal and gas in the European Union's electricity production collapse in 2023  recording an unprecedented decline  but for the first time in history their decline was compensated by the increase in green sources and renewables have exceeded 40% of EU electricity  reaching 44%. ""Clean"" sources  in total  exceed two thirds of the energy mix. Wind and solar produced 27% of the EU's electricity in 2023. With an increase of 13%  wind rose to 18% of the mix  or 475 TWh  and overtook gas for the first time (which fell to 17% of the mix).A boost to the green transition that also comes from the Net Zero Industry Act. The European institutions have in fact reached a provisional agreement on the regulation that establishes a framework of measures to strengthen the European ecosystem to produce zero-emission technological products (Net Zero Industry Act - NZIA). The legislative proposal  deriving in turn from the Green Deal industrial plan  aims to increase the European Union's productivity of strategic zero-emission technologies to support the transition towards clean energy. The objective is for the Union's global strategic production capacity for net-zero emissions technologies to reach at least 40% of the annual deployment needs by 2030.A positive context for Energy S.p.A.  an integrated energy storage systems producer and listed on the Euronext Growth Milan market  (ISIN Code IT0005500712  Ticker ENY). The use of storage systems will be fundamental in guaranteeing the objectives of the energy transition. Energy S.p.A.'s proprietary technology is adaptable to all types of renewables  guaranteeing a timely and effective switch to the constantly evolving needs of customers. Furthermore  storage systems overcome the problems deriving from the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources as they compensate for power fluctuations and make the stored energy available  depending on usage needs.“The integration of storage systems is fundamental to achieving the decarbonization objectives set by Europe. Their use will also be an accelerator of the renewable energy mix""  stated Davide Tinazzi  CEO of Energy S.p.A.. ""We also warmly welcome the Net Zero Industry Act  of which we have always shared the assumptions and objectives. Our investment in the construction of the Gigafactory to produce Made in Italy LFP batteries  in our headquarters in Veneto  is an important step in this direction. The batteries that will be made in Energy's Gigafactory will equip storage systems that will guarantee the value of Made in Italy"".***Energy S.p.A.  founded in 2013 by Davide Tinazzi  Andrea Taffurelli  and Massimiliano Ghirlanda  and listed on the Euronext Growth Milan market of Borsa Italiana since August 1  2022  is a company based in the province of Padua  a leading player in the field of energy storage systems  catering to both residential and large-scale applications.

In this context  the Airwell Group announces that it has acquired a minority shareholding in Synerpod.Founded in 2021  Synerpod is an innovative start-up aiming to implement large-scale energy renovation for collective and individual housing affected by fuel poverty. On 9 February  Synerpod opened its plant in Montaigu (Saint-Hilaire-de-Loulay  western France) which focuses on producing the ""Enerpod""  a prefabricated outdoor unit (off-site) designed for social landlords to deliver energy renovation in individual housing that can be quickly installed. This unit is fitted with a silent dual-service heat pump supplied by Airwell  a hot water tank  dual flow controlled mechanical ventilation and an electronic circuit board. It provides multiple benefits: time saved and cost savings  quality assurance and increased safety  enhanced durability  easier maintenance and reduced on-site pollution. With this innovative concept  Synerpod aims to implement large-scale energy renovation for collective and social housing impacted by fuel poverty.Considering that 4.8 million buildings are poorly insulated in France  the task of combating fuel poverty is huge. To address this major challenge  the Airwell Group has acquired an equity interest in Synerpod  alongside the CETIH (Compagnie des Équipements Techniques et Industriels pour l'Habitat) group – 13% and 6% respectively – as part of an overall capital increase of €500k.Building on this alliance  the Airwell Group  Synerpod  and CETIH plan to develop a range of complementary products. The three players have also responded to a call for tenders from ADEME (French ecological transition agency) to ""develop off-site construction and renovation"". By responding through a consortium of companies  the three partners are taking an innovative  fully integrated and more efficient approach.A pan-European project - The first major order to renovate 400 homes for social landlordsSynerpod's innovation is part of the European EnergieSprong movement  which aims to massively scale up comprehensive energy renovation for housing  with a focus on new methods of industrialising renovation  and on specifications based on requirements for results rather than means.In France's Pays de la Loire region  this movement has given rise to the MASH (Shared purchasing for housing services) initiative led by the USH (France's non-profit organisation for social housing) and an association of 14 social landlords. The project aims to introduce a grouped order for EnergieSprong renovations in around 2 000 housing units. Against this backdrop  since 1 January 2024  Synerpod has helped social landlords implement energy renovation in 400 homes thanks to its Enerpods.A second project is scheduled to renovate 32 houses in Roanne (Loire department  central France) for the property manager  Opheor  serving as a demo for landlords in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region (southeast-central France).Next release: Full-year 2023 results  23 April 2024  before the market opensAbout AirwellFounded in 1947 in France  Airwell is France's leading designer of heat pumps in the field of climatic and thermal engineering.

Feb. 13  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today  InterDigital  Inc. (Nasdaq: IDCC)  a mobile  video and AI technology research and development company  and Broadpeak (Euronext Growth: ALBPK)  a global leader in CDN and advanced video streaming solutions  announced a collaboration to develop content delivery networks capable to stream MPEG Visual Volumetric Video-based Coding (V3C) immersive content at scale.Volumetric video is a critical component in the creation and enjoyment of increasingly immersive experiences and the MPEG V3C standard defines the general mechanism for coding and streaming volumetric content. Unlike traditional video  volumetric video is comprised of a sequence of frames  where each frame is a 3D representation of a real-world object or scene capture from a moment in time. Volumetric content requires significant bandwidth  and the compression codecs within the MPEG V3C standard play an important role in achieving sustainable and viable data rates for the industry. The wide-scale distribution of volumetric content to broad audiences also depends on efficient and V3C-compliant distribution networks  and this is a key area of focus for the InterDigital-Broadpeak collaboration.The collaboration will leverage each partner’s research expertise. InterDigital will contribute the V3C end-to-end implementation platform built jointly with its partner Philips  and Broadpeak will contribute on packaging and content delivery network (CDN) technologies. Together the partners will demonstrate and benchmark efficient delivery of immersive media  including through industry trade shows.“As we innovate and push the boundaries of distributing immersive content and experiences  it is our collaboration and joint research with partners like Broadpeak that further amplify our research impact ” said Rajesh Pankaj  EVP  and Chief Technology Officer  InterDigital. “Together  our technology contributions foster crisper outcomes and enhanced efficiency when processing volumetric content to deliver the increasingly immersive experiences we all demand.”“Video service providers seek to offer new experiences to their customers to differentiate in their market  increase their ARPU and lower their churn. Volumetric content streaming is one of the most attractive immersive use cases  but it is a challenge to deliver these bandwidth-intensive formats at scale ” said Guillaume Bichot  Head of Exploration at Broadpeak. “Thanks to our collaboration with InterDigital  we will further enhance our Origin-Packager and CDN to stream standardized V3C volumetric content to wide audiences.”InterDigital and Broadpeak will showcase the latest results of their collaboration on immersive content distribution at scale at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona from February 26 – 29. Located at the Broadpeak booth #CS299 in Congress Square  the partners will display the innovative ability to stream volumetric video content to wide audiences on commercially available  off-the-shelves devices.About InterDigital ®InterDigital is a global research and development company focused primarily on wireless  video  artificial intelligence (“AI”)  and related technologies.

JDE Peet’s has partnered with Enveritas to leverage a combination of satellite imagery  artificial intelligence  and on-the-ground verification to measure the extent of coffee-related deforestation  allowing local operators  governments  NGOs  and farmers to better mitigate their deforestation risks.After a successful pilot programme in Vietnam  JDE Peet’s has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with Ethiopia  Papua New Guinea  Tanzania  and Uganda  and expects to sign MOUs with additional coffee producing countries over the next several months. These agreements aim to ensure that coffee producers export coffee grown on land that was not deforested after 2020. If the coffee does not meet these requirements  JDE Peet’s will support local authorities  NGOs  and farmers to reforest the land.Fabien Simon  CEO of JDE Peet's  commented: “At JDE Peet’s  we are committed to delivering sustainable growth that creates both shareholder return and societal value.

At constant structure and exchange rates  organic growth was 6.2%  driven by solid momentum in all Linedata businesses.Thanks to its highly recurrent business model and tight cost control  Linedata reports a solid EBITDA margin of 29.1% in 2023  stable compared with the previous financial year.EBITDA margin 2022 2023 Asset Management 26.8% 27.1% Lending & Leasing 34.7% 33.2% Total 29.3% 29.1%Asset ManagementOnce again in 2023  the Services business substantially contributed to growth in the Asset Management segment. Its revenue amounted to €122.1m  representing organic growth of 6.1%. As a result of the fall of the main currencies against the euro in 2023  the increase in reported terms is limited to 3.9%. EBITDA totalled €33.0m  representing a slightly improved margin of 27.1%.Lending & LeasingThe Lending & Leasing segment accelerated its growth in the final quarter (+22.0%)  driven by the signing of a significant contract with a leading car manufacturer. Revenue amounted to €61.2m  an increase of 10.9% in reported terms. EBITDA totalled €20.3m  or 33.2% of revenue. Excluding exchange rate effects and the acquisition of Audaxys  revenue was up 6.4%  and the EBITDA margin was stable compared with the previous year at 34.7%.Analysis of resultsGroup EBITDA came in at €53.3m  up 5.3% compared with 2022. In an inflationary context  Linedata has implemented higher-than-usual salary increases to maintain its human capital and has also turned to external subcontracting to support the growth of its services. Conversely  the company recorded a higher level of perpetual licences and benefited from the development of its centres of excellence. The EBITDA margin came in at 29.1% of revenue  virtually unchanged from the previous year.Operating profit  at €37.9m  increased by a more substantial 11.0%  thanks to a lower level of depreciation and provisions than in the previous year and to a reduction in depreciation relating to property  plant and equipment leases.Financial income totalled -€4.3m  compared with +€1.3m the previous year  a difference of €5.6m. On the one hand  the cost of net financial debt rose by €2.6m due to the increase in the average loans outstanding and the rise in interest rates. On the other hand  the drop in the Group's main currencies led to a foreign exchange result of virtually nil in 2023  compared with foreign exchange income of €3.1m in 2022.After factoring in a tax burden of €8.0m  net profit came to €25.5m  giving a net margin of 13.9%.Earnings per share (EPS) reached €5.14 in 2023 vs. €4.30 in 2022  benefiting from the drop in the number of shares in issue following the share buyback offer in December 2022.Balance sheet analysisOn December 31  2023  the share capital stood at €113.0m vs. €99.0m on December 31  2022.Net debt* stood at €75.4m  or 1.5x consolidated EBITDA 2023 excluding the impact of IFRS 16.DividendA dividend of €1.75 will be proposed at the next Annual General Meeting.OutlookLinedata will step up its sales efforts in its target jurisdictions and continue to migrate its installed base to the new software platforms in order to maintain a sustainable organic growth trajectory.Next communication: Q1 2024 revenue on April 23  2024 after trading.*excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities but including the property lease portfolioABOUT LINEDATAWith 25 years’ experience and 700+ clients in 50 countries  Linedata’s 1200 employees in 20 offices provide global humanized technology solutions and services for the asset management and credit industries that help its clients to evolve and to operate at the highest levels.Headquartered in France  Linedata achieved revenues of EUR 183.3 million in 2023 and is listed on Euronext Paris compartment B FR0004156297-LIN – Reuters LDSV.PA – Bloomberg LIN:FPwww.linedata.com,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.43,0.2,0.37,True,English,"['Linedata Services', 'Full-year 2023 results', '+6.1% EBITDA margin', 'Revenue growth', '29.', 'next Annual General Meeting', 'global humanized technology solutions', 'sustainable organic growth trajectory', 'French Regulatory News', 'leading car manufacturer', 'usual salary increases', 'new software platforms', 'Euronext Paris compartment', 'exchange rate effects', 'recurrent business model', 'foreign exchange income', '1.5x consolidated EBITDA', 'credit finance industries', 'tight cost control', 'net financial debt', 'share buyback offer', 'Balance sheet analysis', 'IFRS 16 lease liabilities', 'property lease portfolio', 'strong full-year results', 'outsourcing services provider', 'sustained organic growth', 'foreign exchange result', 'previous financial year', 'Asset Management segment', 'solid EBITDA margin', 'results Group EBITDA', 'global solutions', 'Financial income', 'Next communication', 'credit industries', 'Full-year 2023 results', 'exchange rates', 'solid momentum', 'previous year', 'net profit', 'net margin', 'Services business', '+6.1% EBITDA margin', 'unaudited figures', 'operating profitability', 'constant structure', 'main currencies', 'final quarter', 'significant contract', 'inflationary context', 'human capital', 'external subcontracting', 'perpetual licences', 'lower level', 'equipment leases', 'one hand', 'average loans', 'interest rates', 'other hand', 'tax burden', 'share capital', 'sales efforts', 'target jurisdictions', 'installed base', '25 years’ experience', 'highest levels', 'Reuters LDSV', 'Leasing segment', 'EQS Group', 'LIN:FP', 'Bloomberg LIN', 'higher level', '700+ clients', 'The Lending', 'Linedata businesses', 'Revenue growth', 'Change REVENUE', 'Q1 2024 revenue', 'Linedata Services', 'Feb', 'CET', 'CEST', 'Dissemination', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'Rounded', 'Neuilly', 'Seine', 'Total', 'fall', 'terms', 'signing', 'acquisition', 'Audaxys', 'company', 'development', 'centres', 'excellence', 'depreciation', 'provisions', 'reduction', 'plant', 'difference', 'rise', 'drop', 'Earnings', 'EPS', 'number', 'shares', 'December', 'impact', 'Dividend', 'Outlook', 'order', 'April', 'trading', '50 countries', '1200 employees', '20 offices', 'France', 'revenues', '29.', '3.']",2024-02-13,2024-02-14,marketscreener.com

Reflecting the macroeconomic context  all our main markets are experiencing weaker momentum than in the last two years.Constant growth in FranceIn France  the SII Group recorded revenue of €117.3m in the third quarter of the 2023-2024 financial year  showing organic growth close to that of the first half of the year.The Activity Rate Excluding Holidays (AREH) deteriorated again during the third quarter due to the time lag between recruitment and new projects. As a result  the quarterly operating margin for France has been impacted by this situation.Stronger international growthInternationally  the SII Group recorded revenue of €170.5m in the third quarter of the 2023-2024 financial year  up 13.9% (of which 8.1% on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates) compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. Although on a downward trend  some countries are still posting sustained growth on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates: Poland (+7%)  Germany (+28%)  Romania (+22%) and Czech Republic (+26%).In this context  operating margin outside France remains at a satisfactory level.OutlookThe first few weeks of 2024 have not reversed the trend seen over the past 9 months. Annual revenue is expected to fall within a range of between €1.12 billion and €1.13 billion. This would represent annual revenue growth of around 10%  still outperforming our sector.***Next financial announcement:Fiscal 2023-2024 annual revenue  Tuesday  May14  2024 after the close of trading-Contacts :SII - Eric Matteucci - : 01.42.84.82.22-Receive all of our communications by subscribing on our website: www.sii-group.comEuronext Paris Compartment BLEI: 96950044FWV7YEJCKR65ATTACHEMENT: Revenue by quarterin €mQ12023-2024 Q22023-2024 Q32023-2024 Nine-month 2023-2024 France 109.36 105.00 117.29 331.65 Changeof which organic* +7.3%+3.3% +8.0%+3.5% +7.0%+3.0% +7.4%+3.2% International operations 159.96 164.03 170.52 494.51 Changeof which organic* +17.1%+15.2% +15.9%+11.1% +13.9%+8.1% +15.6%+12.1% SII Group Total 269.32 269.03 287.81 826.16 Changeof which organic* +12.9%+10.1% +12.8%+8.0% +11.0%+6.0% +12.2%+8.4%* excluding external growth and exchange rate effects (exchange rate 2022-2023 applied to 2023-2024 revenue)About SIIFounded in 1979 by qualified engineer Bernard Huvé  the SII Group’s activity is balanced between engineering and technology consulting (ETC) and digital services (DSC).The SII Group provides employment for more than 16 000 people  structured in a way that offers all the responsiveness and flexibility of a local service.

The Company's management team  consisting of Ulrich Krasilnikoff (CEO and CFO)  Andreas Kjær (CSO/CMO and co-founder) and Hanne Damgaard Jensen (CDO/COO)  have committed to subscribe for shares in the rights issue for a total of approx. DKK 1.3 million   corresponding to 2.5 percent of the rights issue.(CEO and CFO)  (CSO/CMO and co-founder) and (CDO/COO)  have committed to subscribe for shares in the rights issue for a total of approx.   corresponding to 2.5 percent of the rights issue. The Company intends to publish an information memorandum regarding the Rights Issue around 22 February 2024 (the "" Information Memorandum "").(the "" ""). The proceeds are intended to be used to strengthen the Company's capital structure and secure funding for the acceleration of clinical activities  including the preparation  planning and enrolment of the first patients in a therapy phase I/IIa basket trial in various cancer types (brain  neuroendocrine  head and neck  non-small cell lung and pancreatic cancer)  as well as to strengthen Curasight's preclinical pipeline through development of new peptide-based radioligands.Reasons for the Rights IssueCurasight focuses on addressing the need for improved diagnosis and treatment of several cancer indications and has developed a highly specific PET imaging ligand  uTRACE (radioactive tracer) and uTREAT - both targeting the uPAR receptor. uPAR is expressed in many types of human cancers and the expression levels of uPAR have been shown to be strongly associated with metastatic disease  i.e. cancer aggressiveness  and subsequent poor prognosis. Curasight's clinical PET ligand uTRACE has been succesfully validated in more than 400 patients in several clinical PET imaging trials with uTRACE in brain  prostate  head & neck  neuroendocrine  oral  breast and urinary bladder cancer with promising results.Based on these results with uTRACE  combined with the strong preclinical results with uTREAT  both targeting the strong biomarker (uPAR) in human cancer  Curasight's Board and management projects that uTREAT  together with its companion diagnostics  the uPAR-PET imaging ligand uTRACE  could become a successful radioligand therapy. It is foreseen that such a targeted radioligand therapy could become a game-changer in the treatment and management of cancer patients across several cancer indications.Curasight will therefore pursue uPAR targeted radioligand therapy using the uTRACE ligand but ""armed"" with radiation therapy. By combining anti-cancer radiotherapy uTREAT (therapy) with uTRACE (diagnostics)  the technology jointly known as theranostics  is foreseen to treat cancer in a much more gentle and efficient way than today's method of external radiation therapy.To further advance and commercialize the uPAR Theranostics platform with uTREAT and uTRACE for improved diagnosis and treatment across several cancer diseases  Curasight is now conducting a Right Issue of shares of up to DKK 51.2 million.The proceeds from the Rights Issue will primarily finance the preparation  planning and enrolment of the first patients in a therapeutic phase I/IIa basket trial that will in parallel assess the therapeutic safety and efficacy of uTREAT in brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme)  neuroendocrine tumors  head and neck cancer  non-small scell lung cancer  and pancreatic cancer. Furthermore  the proceeds from the issue will be used to broaden the pipeline through development of new next generation peptide-based radioligand therapies.Subscription CommitmentsThe Company's management team  consisting of Ulrich Krasilnikoff (CEO and CFO)  Andreas Kjær (CSO/CMO and co-founder) and Hanne Damgaard Jensen (CDO/COO)  have committed to subscribe for shares in the rights issue for a total of approx.

The greater the volume and the higher the quality of the data (standardized big data)  the more ‘intelligent' the models they are used to train become. This process corresponds exactly to the core DNA of Artprice by Artmarket's operating model which masters both the computer science of programming and the computer science of induction which defines AI.Our progress in the field of AI was substantially accelerated by our targeted acquisition (initially by Groupe Serveur  then by Artprice) of innovative companies like Xylologic (in 1999) a Swiss company of prestigious scientists (from CERN  WHO  etc.) that was considerably ahead of its time and which already prefigured the birth and development of AI (see our reference document).A rare occurrence for a company listed on a regulated market  Artprice by Artmarket has twice consecutively obtained the state label “Innovative Company”  subject to strict eligibility conditions  awarded by France's Public Investment Bank (BPI).According to thierry Ehrmann  founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com: “With its proprietary AI – baptized “Intuitive Artmarket ®” – in 2024 Artprice by Artmarket will be able to take each of its 7.2 million customers and members on superb customized journeys of art discover y with lightning speed……In the cozy world of major global professional database publishers  it is vital for the long-term development of our industr y that we integrate proprietary AI into our c ore businesses  which is why Artprice by Armarket has acquired a substantial headstart in this domain since 1999 and made 2024 the key year for its Intuitive Artmarket ®. In economic term s   this tool will generate more so ph isticated subscription options and therefore more recurring turnover (ARR).I nvestors are looking for serious investment opportunities in the field of AI on both sides of the Atlantic.O ur algorithms and billions of proprietary log s along with our texts and tens of millions of artworks from the Artprice databases allow us to i dentify all the terminology that qualify artist s' universes  their inspiration  the mediums they use  their themes  their shapes and volumes  etc... and then create a syntony by opening up the worlds of the 833 000 artists we follow with their biographies and certified data  going far beyond classic academic visual criteria via the neural networks of our Intuitive Artmarket ® AI. ”Intuitive Artmarket ® will notably calculate the values of artworks based on an analysis of past sales that is specific to Artprice; but it will also be able to anticipate future fluctuations  including for totally unique works. It will also make it possible to identify highly complex transversal artistic trends that largely escape the academic  institutional and university worlds.Our Intuitive Artmarket® AI will have numerous applications within the scope of Artprice by Artmarket  all offering high-added value and featuring numerous paid services.Of the many new service projects in 2024 for Artmarket's clients  we plan to link Intuitive Artmarket® with our Standardized Marketplace® which was created in 2005 and offers over 77 000 artworks at a fixed or biddable price. We also plan to link our Intuitive Artmarket® to all of Artprice by Artmarket's databases.Intuitive Artmarket® will constantly assist Artmarket clients – whether art enthusiasts  art market professionals or museum curators – to build and/or manage their collections.With the analysis of billions of logs  125 million clipped and tokenized images of artworks  more than ten million auction results (word embedding)  Intuitive Artmarket® will be able to provide extremely relevant solutions for customers wishing to start  or manage  an art collection.To build the collection  Intuitive Artmarket® will provide suggestions for works to acquire based on criteria the client has provided such as the budget allocated over time  the artistic movement(s) the customer is interested in  the preferred medium(s)  the favorite artist(s) or similar artists  the preferred dimensions of the works  the favorite acquisition location(s) (in full compliance with the different legislative frameworks on personal data security). It will also be able to identify from the behavioral analysis of the client's searches certain preferences that neither the client nor an appointed expert might have been aware of. It goes without saying that this analysis via Intuitive Artmarket® will be conducted with the consent of the client as part of his/her paid subscription (in accordance with the terms and conditions enumerated in the General Conditions of Sale and Use attached to his or her subscription).As regards collection management  Intuitive Artmarket® will update the value of the collection in real-time  not only by taking into account the latest auction results but also by projecting trends with expected results  built on in-depth data analysis.Intuitive Artmarket® will notify the collector and/or art market professional of sale and/or purchase opportunities  depending on the objectives identified by the collector or the professional over time. These may range from the desire to enhance the pecuniary value of a portfolio to the desire to enhance the artistic value of a collection; everything will be possible via an intuitive configuration.Contemporary artists will also be able to use this tool to offer their works for sale on our Standardized Marketplace® with higher probabilities of reaching buyers  particularly artists producing NFTs. Bearing in mind all the underlying parameters and data  Artprice is the only platform on the global market that can deal effectively with the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs in an environment of cryptocurrencies alongside the major international currencies.With Intuitive Artmarket®  it has never been so easy and intuitive to discover the parallel worlds of ‘Online Art' and ‘Auction House Art' (we are directly linked to 7 200 auction operators around the world).In today's extraordinarily busy world  every minute counts and Intuitive Artmarket® will allow users to explore the Standardized Marketplace® and monitor the global art market with infinitely better results and much more quickly. Less time spent also means less energy spent  which is perfectly in line with Artmarket.com's eco-responsible approach.Artificial Intelligence has opened the door to a deluge of IP conflicts such as the legal dispute surrounding Stability AI  the creator of an AI generating synthetic photos  now accused by Getty Images of having extracted millions of images from Getty Images databanks.ChatGPT is regularly the subject of professional news media headlines like “ Is ChatGPT violat ing copyrights?”... to which the vast majority of lawyers respond that it is nothing more and nothing less than a veritable copyright pillage – and therefore a massive copyright violation engine – which makes OpenAI  for its part  an outright counterfeiter.And then there is the historic initiative by the Authors Guild  the largest professional association of American writers  which  according to Rolling Stone magazine  filed a class action on 20 September 2023 in a New York Supreme Court against the company Open AI (creator of ChatGPT)  accusing it of ‘feeding' or ‘training' its large language model (LLM) with their copyright-protected works. Authors Guild President  Maya Shanbhag Lang said  “This is just the beginning... We do not bring this suit lightly. We are here to fight.”In contrast  Artmarket's AI (Intuitive Artmarket ®) is based exclusively on its massive proprietary content which is protected under intellectual property law  thereby allowing us to overcome these obstacles and potential prohibitions. In other words  our Intuitive Artmarket ® has no need to look elsewhere for data or for responses to very specific searches from art market amateurs or professionals.This fact will underpin and generate constant growth in our turnover and guarantee the sustainability of our model  which  in turn  will generate considerable upside potential and peace of mind for Artprice by Artmarket.com's shareholders. Over the last two decades Artprice has recorded  observed and induced hundreds of millions of human decisions in relation to the art market. This market is of course infinitely complex due to the heterogeneous and singular nature of art on the other hand  and the abstract notion of beauty at the limits of human emotion on the other.The algorithmic learning that has fueled our AI has allowed Artprice to create AI models that are unique to the specific world of the Art Market and which constitute Artprice by Artmarket's strongest revenue-generating power.For over 20 years  Artprice by Artmarket has gradually stabilized its ‘alignment problem'  a key issue for the successful genesis then construction of its AI (Intuitive Artmarket®). For the Artprice group  the so-called ‘alignment problem' means all of the scientific and ethical questions raised by the relationship of its artificial intelligence system (and its induced results) with the values  expectations and human sensitivities specific to the Artprice by Artmarket group  its clients and the intangible and centuries-old rules of the art market.Artmarket's AI (Intuitive Artmarket ®) will be supervised by ‘prompt engineers'  a new career that includes the programming and management of proprietary AI.The possibilities offered by properly managed AI are therefore immense  which explains its popularity: Microsoft ® Bing Chat now attracts more than 100 million active users per day with a commitment to responsible AI that respects copyright and copyright-related rights.Microsoft has already started rolling out Bing Chat for Business and Microsoft Copilot in paid subscription mode.Microsoft's Copilot® works with GPT-4 Turbo  the new DALL-E 3 model  and is now Microsoft's spearhead service at the heart of its 365 Business Premium and Business Standard licenses. Indeed  Microsoft has clearly demonstrated that its AI Copilot® is a very powerful accelerator of its sales of ‘365' subscriptions to its cloud  thereby confirming the viability of this AI economic model for Artprice and its Intuitive Artmarket®.Via thousands of beta test searches on the art market and on artists  Artprice by Artmarket.com has observed that Bing IA GPT-4 regularly cited Artprice and Artmarket.com URLs in reference to its sources. Microsoft® Bing works in partnership with OpenAI to deliver an experience that encourages responsible use. Likewise  Chat GPT-4 Pro is in paid mode on Apple iOS and Android.For reference  one of the best-known neural networks is the Google search algorithm that Artprice has studied and analyzed daily since 1999. Since the beginning of 2023  Artprice Inc.  our American subsidiary  has been following the development of Google Bard and notably since the release on 8 February 2024 of its Gemini Pro AI with its Ultra 1.0 interface  a direct competitor to GPT-4. Gemini is a prototype chatbot (an experimental conversational AI service) built by Google based on its LaMDA language model. Here too  Artprice engineers measured the searches on Google Bard and Gemini specific to the art market and noted a high volume of responses relative to links to Artprice databases.One of the G7's major concerns is the rapid adoption of regulations on AI.Europe  and particularly France  wants to make the European continent one of the world leaders in AI  and it is interesting to note that the first texts regulating artificial intelligence are currently being passed into law.“The Council of the European Union approves a text to regulate artificial intelligence”On Friday 2 February 2024  representatives of EU member states approved new legislation on artificial intelligence. Once voted by the European Parliament  this legislation will constitute a global first. Artprice by Artmarket has participated in the debates that have contributed to this legislation via its lawyers and advisors. This new legislation establishes specific constraints  notably regarding personal data  as well as copyright protection and thorough source quotation.Initially drafted in 2021  the first version of the text had to be completely overhauled because of the evolution of artificial intelligence in recent years.The European project to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) reached a new milestone on Friday  2 February 2024. “Today the 27 Member States unanimously approved the political agreement concluded in December recognizing the balance found by the negotiators between innovation and security”  announced the European Commissioner for the Internal Market  Thierry Breton  on X. The negotiators of the European Parliament and the Council  co-legislators  had reached an agreement in principle on 8 December 2023.The regulation  called the “AI Act”  aims to regulate both the use and the development of artificial intelligence. It is the first such legislative framework in the world. According to a press release from the European Parliament in December 2023  the text “aims to ensure that fundamental rights  democracy  the rule of law and ecological sustainability are protected against high-risk AI  while boosting innovation and making Europe a leader in the field”.Certain uses of these new technologies will be prohibited  such as social rating and behavior manipulation. The most risky practices will have to meet reinforced requirements  such as an obligation of transparency or the implementation of human control over the software.These various provisions and amendments are very positive for Artprice by Artmarket.According to the best Anglo-Saxon financial analysts  who are one step ahead of Europe on this subject  the only economically viable model – i.e. one that does not expose the economic entity (whatever its size) to incessant legal proceedings – is an AI-based on an extremely well-defined economic segment.The economic segment must have information that plays an absolutely vital role  full intellectual property of the entirety of Big Data (including Data Mining)  of the copyright and related rights confirmed on all algorithms  databases  with machine learning (deep learning) and neural networks.In short  the AIs that will triumph with very substantial economic gain and without major industrial or legal risk  are the economic entities that own  in full intellectual property  all of the different stages of the proprietary AI in a defined market segment where expensive high added-value information plays a vital role. And this is exactly the case of the Intuitive Artmarket ® AI developed by Artprice by Artmarket.comOur Intuitive Artmarket ® AI has been designed in total recognition of this reality.The following paragraph was largely generated by our Intuitive Artmarket ® AI systemAccording to thierry Ehrmann  a pioneer of the Internet and databanks since 1987 with his Groupe Serveur  parent company of Artprice (Who's Who In France biography: https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2024/02/2024_Biographie_thierry_Ehrmann_WhosWhoInFrance.pdf)  and Founder of Artprice & CEO of Artmarket  the Group's guiding principle for its AI is very simple: “There cannot be artificial intelligence without human intelligence”.The c ertification by Artprice of NFT primary issuesRelease of the ARTE documentary in 5 languages: “NFT  Chaos in the art world”https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/RC-024624/nft-chaos-dans-le-monde-de-l-art/Throughout this documentary  thierry Ehrmann  visual artist  NFT artist and Founding CEO of Artprice.com  delivers his analysis accompanied by other artists  experts and international players in the world of Art NFTs.Any attempt to understand the significance of NFTs in Art History requires an appreciation of the digital and cultural revolution that they represent and some kind of prediction regarding their role and impact over the short and medium term.Artprice by Artmarket.com can confirm that for the first half of 2024  the Art NFT phenomenon is becoming a lasting segment of the art market on all continents  with new legislation that is currently much more favorable in the USA. Meanwhile  European lawmakers are working on a regulatory framework that will prevent cryptocurrencies being used for money laundering and bring confidence to consumers  investors and operators.This framework has been the subject of studies  conferences and proposals to major French and European government bodies by the Art & Law Institute with which Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a historical member since 1997.According to thierry Ehrmann “In its various annual reports on the Art Market and the regulated information it publishes as a listed company  Artprice by Artmarket.com has always said with regard to NFTs that it is impossible to apprehend this new market without a true understanding of Blockchain  crypto-currencies and their cultural origins among the Cypherpunks (period of PGP-type data encryption at the beginning of the 1990s).”Indeed  OpenSea  the leading NFT platform  itself declared that 80% of primary issues of Art NFTs are likely to impact third-party intellectual property rights. Faced with this observation  Opensea announced it is considering solutions to counter this problem and thereby protect sellers and buyers. This can only lead to the certification of the primary issue market by Artprice.Bearing in mind all the underlying parameters and data required  Artprice by Artmarket is the only organization on the global art market to be able to truly respond to the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs in an environment of cryptocurrencies and major international currencies.This capacity to certify the primary issues of Art NFTs is based on the fact that Artprice by Artmarket has been the Global Leader in Art Market Information for more than 27 years and is the creator and owner of its globally recognized databases. It also has the world's largest documentary collection of art market notes  manuscripts  codices and annotated sales catalogs from 1700 to the present day  which act as a guarantee of the authenticity and historical veracity of its databases.More precisely  we cannot allow the offer of an artwork or of an Art NFT to be posted online without validation of the identity of the artist and of the professional seller  via a very strict and draconian control procedure. In the context of the sale of NFTs  this is all the more important as there is a certain laxity at this level  which has led to numerous problems on other sites.The added value of Artprice by Artmarket is quite simply its knowledge of the artists  either through their previous auction results or through their emerging notoriety. In addition  an Artprice Intranet messaging system is made available to buyers and sellers  so that they can agree on their transaction in a confidential and consensual manner.With its Metaverse – the ultimate and inevitable outcome of the NFT revolution – Artprice by Artmarket aims to be the most successful and competitive Art NFT platform.The Metaverse will guarantee the exponential and continued growth of the art market through NFTs. Alongside the Metaverse  there is the Blockchain and its smart contracts to allow fair remuneration for artists  with copyright bodies such as the ADAGP (in France)  to which Artprice has long been affiliated in order to support artists.Three years ago Artprice recognised that Ethereum would become the reference Blockchain for smart contracts in the Art NFT Market. Christie's 3.0 is also based on the Ethereum Blockchain since 2022.According to a study conducted by Artprice by Artmarket:“All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum /art gallery industry are starting to publish their own NFTs. The vast majority of the major players in the art market have chosen the Ethereum Blockchain whose smart contract ensures a transparent and tamper-proof market.Digital Art – first created in the 1980s – is finally emerging and is appealing to nearly half a billion Art NFT enthusiasts at costs that are now very accessible. The authenticity and traceability of the purchase or sale of Art NFTs is now guaranteed by Blockchain. Samsung TV's Tizen OS  loaded on several hundred million Smart TVs  offers direct access to the “ NFT Art” application among its automatically installed apps  between Netflix and YouTube.There are already more than 54 000 artists identified by Artprice who directly produce their NFTs for their buying public  and this is only the very beginning of a total paradigm shift.According to many sociologists  art historians and analysts  the advent of NFTs is a major event that definitively modifies the structure of the art market and its players as it has been since 1950.Artmarket.com: after including cryptocurrencies alongside traditional currencies for auction results in 2022  the Artprice Standardized Marketplace® has now integrated Bitcoin and Ethereum for buying and selling artworksthierry Ehrmann  the CEO of Artprice by Artmarket: “We were patiently waiting for the right moment to launch this key deployment in the history of Artprice by Artmarket in the best conditions for both the art market and for cryptocurrencies. It is now time for us to take the step of deploying our authoritative Standardized Marketplace® and opening it to the world of cryptocurrencies and NFTs  by entering Web 3.0. which is quite simply the immediate future of the Internet. This step would not have been possible without the knowledge and experience of Artprice  which has been the Global Leader in Art Market Information for more than 25 years.Every day Artprice's Standardized Marketplace® offers more than 77 000 artworks from all over the world. These works are bought and sold by 7.2 million customers and members of Artprice  generating an annual trading volume estimated at several hundred million euros. This platform demonstrates the trust built over more than 18 years between buyers and sellers. It was therefore natural that after adding cryptocurrencies to the means of payment  Artprice should also endow the platform with a new category/medium  Art NFTs  as a sign of their legitimate entry into Art History and the history of the art market.”The decision to quote cryptocurrency prices on our Standardized Marketplace® was taken after a long and careful observation of an increasing consultation of auction results in Bitcoin and Ethereum across all of Artprice's databases since their effective integration into our system in September 2022.These two main cryptocurrencies (ETH and BTC) account for more than 92% of the total value of the approximately 23 000 currently existing cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins).By analyzing its hundreds of millions of connection logs  Artprice has observed – over 17 months – a regular increase in consultations of the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices in its databanks  which are now  in statistical terms  close to the consultations of the major international reference currencies such as the dollar  the euro  sterling and the yen.This evolution at Artprice reflects the growing place of cryptocurrencies in the mentalities and habits of art professionals as well as among collectors and art enthusiasts.But the major event in cryptocurrencies is notably BlackRock's (the largest asset manager in the world) and Fidelity's introduction of ETFs directly invested in Bitcoin (Bitcoin spot ETFs) authorized by the SEC on 11 January 2024. This is a real consecration for Bitcoin which on 9 February 2024 was quoted at around 49 000 dollars  while Ethereum was at $2 500 (ETH ETFs are expected very soon).BlackRock and Fidelity have achieved the best ETF launches in 30 years thanks to Bitcoin. In their first month of trading  the “IBIT” and “FBTC” funds raised $6.5 billion  which is more than any of the 5 500 other index funds launched before them (according to Les Échos of 10 January 2024: “Bitcoin ETF: the SEC opens the doors of Wall Street wide to Bitcoin”.This is a new record for Bitcoin. Of the 5 535 ETFs launched over the last thirty years  none have gotten off to such a strong start as BlackRock's ‘IBIT' and Fidelity's ‘FBTC'  said Bloomberg expert Eric Balchunas.This allows retail and professional investors to gain exposure to the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization  without having to directly hold the asset.Via cryptocurrencies  new collectors and art enthusiasts have been attracted to the art market  often younger than their predecessors. Not averse to speculation and the excitement of taking risks  these art enthusiasts and collectors solidly welded to their crypto-universe of Web 3.0.The near future of Artprice by Artmarket is the meeting place between Web 3.0. (Metaverse and NFT) and Artprice's artificial intelligence  its Intuitive Artmarket ® AI.For this reason  Artprice is currently finalizing the Metaverse of its head office located in the heart of its illustrious L'Organe  Museum of Contemporary Art which manages the Demeure du Chaos / Abode of Chaos (dixit The New York Times). To create the Metaverse of this edifice with its highly singular architecture (that falls into the category “total work of art”) created by thierry Ehrmann (who is also a visual artist)  the European group TT Géoomètres Experts with its 3D Lab and Groupe Serveur (Artprice's parent company) carried out the complete digitization of the 6 300 artworks integrated into the buildings  offices  outbuildings and surrounding walls  covering a surface area of over 7 555 m²  leading to the creation of a digital asset of 12 terra-bytes. This work was conducted from 2018 to 2023. For more information see:https://ftp1.serveur.com/abodeofchaos_singular_architecture.pdfAll the necessary investments have already been fully covered by Groupe Serveur.The Artprice Metaverse  accessible in AR (augmented reality) and/or VR (virtual reality)  currently being finalized  must be designed to make people forget rigid IT with Web 2.0  a real obstacle to creation. It should allow crypto-universe enthusiasts to live their experience fully  in particular through the general release in the USA on 2 February 2024 of the Apple® Vision Pro  which offers spatial computing. Meanwhile  all of the American tech giants are massively investing in AR/VR headsets and glasses.Furthermore  the difficult economic context did not stop Ethereum's transition to “The Merge” on 15 September 2022 for the completely decarbonized Ethereum 2.0 Blockchain (against the backdrop of a global energy crisis. Indeed  according to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to “The Merge”  the electricity consumption of the ETH Blockchain shrank by more than 99.95% by switching from ‘Proof of Work' (PoW) to ‘Proof of Stake' (PoS). The year 2024 will see the new version “The Surge” (EIP-4844) allowing transaction costs to shrink as well (Source Ethereum Foundation).The near future is approaching fast and Artprice by Artmarket is at the forefront of this paradigm shift.Copyright 1987-2024 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

We cannot wait to work closely to create hero moments in the run-up to Royal Ascot in June and beyond ” said Alexandra Bertram  brand and creative lead at Ascot Racecourse.Daniel Fletcher CourtesyQueen Anne founded the Royal Ascot races in 1711 and since then they have become a fixture for the British royal family to attend as a unit. The late monarch Queen Elizabeth II was an avid hippophile  while her daughters-in-law  the late Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson; and Catherine Middleton and Meghan Markle  the wives of Prince William and Prince Harry  have always captured the attention of the press for what they wear.“Although there are long-standing dress codes to follow  there’s a real sense of creativity where people can experiment with styles they may not wear in their day-to-day lives ” said Fletcher  pointing out that the event didn’t allow jumpsuits until 2017 and navy morning suits were only permitted in the Royal Enclosure in 2021.The Royal Enclosure requires all women to wear hats and  in most cases  skirts or dresses to the knee  while men must wear top hats and morning suits.“The lines are more fluid than ever before and I look forward to bringing a contemporary take to some more traditional styles  as well as celebrating the accessibility of great tailoring for everyone and anyone ” he added.Jerry Hall and Marie Helvin at Royal Ascot in 1982.

The Royal Ascot was considered a pinnacle event for him.Fletcher said that his favorite looks at the Royal Ascot have been from the ‘80s because of the pencil skirts  nipped-in-at-the-waist jackets and big hats.“Jerry Hall wore a black and white ensemble in 1982 which I loved  it was very ‘Death Becomes Her’ and so of the time in terms of silhouette ” he said.Fletcher left his post as menswear artistic director of Fiorucci in June 2023 to focus on his own brand. — HIKMAT MOHAMMEDBIGGER REACH: Noah is expanding its retail footprint.The buzzy New York-based brand founded by Brendon Babenzien and his wife  Estelle Bailey-Babenzien in 2015  has taken the storefront next door to their SoHo flagship and will create a space dedicated to the brand’s tailored clothing and more elevated products this spring. The brand is using the space as a wholesale showroom.Noah’s Mulberry Street store has already been expanded once. It was originally housed in a small space on the block but when the store next door became available  the Babenziens took the location and broke through the walls to allow for a larger shopping experience for customers. The store now spans around 1 500 square feet.But Brendon Babenzien said there are no plans at this point to break through again. Instead  the 600-square-foot space will stand on its own.“We want to create a different experience ” he said. “Sometimes this store can get pretty rambunctious and we want it to be quiet in there.”Brendon Babenzien Kyle EricksenHe said Noah’s updated tailored clothing has become popular among his customers  but selling a $2 000 cashmere jacket next to a T-shirt may not be the best strategy  hence the new storefront. “We make suiting for people who don’t have to wear suits  but want to ” he said. For this fall  Noah is offering a Western-inspired suit in a Donegal fabric and a leather jacket filled with Cashball  a product created from leftover cashmere sweater production.In addition to his New York City unit  Noah also operates a store in Amagansett in the Hamptons as well as a unit in the Sycamore district of Los Angeles. There are also two stores in Japan and another in Korea. Although the stores are successful  Babenzien said there are no immediate plans to add more units since he’s already busy juggling two significant design jobs. In addition to Noah  Babenzien  the former creative director for streetwear brand Supreme  has been the creative director for men’s at J. Crew since the spring of 2021. — JEAN E.
