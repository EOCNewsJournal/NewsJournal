However  if the aggregate principal amount of all Notes validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Participation Date by Holders exceeds the Maximum Principal Amount (subject to any increase in such Maximum Principal Amount at our discretion)  then Verizon will (i) accept for purchase all validly tendered Notes of each series starting at the highest Acceptance Priority Level (level 1) and moving sequentially to Notes of each series having a lower Acceptance Priority Level (the lowest of which is level 5) until the aggregate principal amount of all validly tendered Notes of a series  combined with the aggregate principal amount of all accepted Notes of series with higher Acceptance Priority Levels  is as close as possible to  but does not exceed the Maximum Principal Amount  (ii) accept on a prorated basis validly tendered Notes of the series with the next lower Acceptance Priority Level and (iii) not accept for purchase (x) any such Notes of a series with an Acceptance Priority Level below the prorated series or (y) any Notes validly tendered after the applicable Early Participation Date; and• second  if the Maximum Principal Amount is not exceeded at the applicable Early Participation Date  Verizon will repeat the steps described in the prior bullet using the principal amount with respect to Notes validly tendered after the applicable Early Participation Date  but at or prior to the applicable Expiration Date  in order to determine the aggregate principal amount of such Notes that Verizon will accept for purchase. All Notes  regardless of Acceptance Priority Level  that are validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Participation Date will have priority over any Notes validly tendered after the applicable Early Participation Date.If the Financing Condition is not satisfied due to a shortfall in gross proceeds from the New Offering  then we will accept for purchase Notes of each series tendered in accordance with the applicable Acceptance Priority Levels after giving effect to proration  such that the amount of gross proceeds from the New Offering is equal to the aggregate Total Consideration or Tender Consideration  as further provided in the Offer to Purchase.Provided that all conditions to the Offers have been satisfied or timely waived by Verizon  Verizon will settle all Notes validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Participation Date and accepted for purchase promptly following the applicable Early Participation Date (the “Early Settlement Date”)  which is expected to be the third business day thereafter.

International law generally prohibits expropriation of foreign private property without fair compensation and confers particular protections for foreign states and even more for the assets of central banks  regarded as cornerstones of the international financial system. The Biden administration  while supporting Ukraine with military and humanitarian aid  has gone to great lengths to avoid any suggestion that it is directly engaged in a military conflict with Russia. Credit: AP Freezing an asset is one thing  as the funds remain the property of the Russian government. Seizing them would open up a can of worms and likely lead to both retaliation by Russia (which via its capital controls  holds billions of dollars of foreign company cash and assets within Russia) and legal actions in domestic and international courts that could tie up the funds and deny the EU and US access to them for decades.Russia has already branded any attempt to use the frozen funds for Ukraine’s benefit as “outright theft” and “banditry”. It has reportedly already lined up foreign law firms to challenge any attempt to access them. Loading There something jarringly ironic and discordant that a country that mounted an invasion of a sovereign nation that is illegal under international laws  and which has wrought extraordinary destruction and losses and impairments of lives  could now seek to use international laws to protect its financial assets. Targeting the earnings on the assets rather than the principal could  however  be a way to make what would otherwise be illegal under international law (and probably domestic laws). While earnings on an asset belong to the owner of the underlying asset  the EU could impose a 100 per cent tax or levy on those earnings or create some similar mechanism  adding them to its own finances and then handing over a similar amount to Ukraine.That would also leave the corpus of Russia’s assets intact and potentially available as a bargaining chip if ever there were serious negotiations about ending the war  which would probably have to involve Russia’s withdrawal from Ukraine’s territory to be acceptable to Ukraine and its Western allies. If the EU and/or the US were to seize some or all of the trapped assets (and there’s another $US58 billion or so of frozen assets belonging to Russian oligarchs that might also be accessed)  there have been concerns raised in Europe  particularly by Germany and France  and the US about the potential non-legal consequences. Russia has already branded any attempt to use the frozen funds for Ukraine’s benefit as “outright theft” and “banditry”. Ukraine has been urging the EU and US to act. Credit: Getty Images Such action is  as indicated  unprecedented and would be an assault on a core principle of international law but it would also send a very clear signal to other governments outside the EU and US that their foreign exchange reserves might also be vulnerable.European opponents of the proposal and  until very recently US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (who seems to have come on board with the Europeans this week)  have cited the risks to their currencies’ status as reserve currencies and the US dollar’s dominance of global trade and finance  the potential for large-scale capital outflows and increases in borrowings costs and inflation as risks. Loading The Europeans are also concerned about undermining Euroclear’s role as a trusted and critical clearing house for international securities transactions. The counterargument against those concerns is that the Russian funds were frozen  albeit not actually seized  nearly two years ago but that didn’t produce any significant shifts in capital flows or loss of trust in the European and US financial systems. There was no panicky exodus of capital. There’s also the question of where else could foreign governments and their central banks safely hold their assets.,neutral,0.23,0.52,0.25,negative,0.03,0.25,0.72,True,English,"['$460b treasure chest', 'The West', 'Russia', 'US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', '100 per cent tax', 'critical clearing house', 'foreign company cash', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'The Biden administration', 'international securities transactions', 'potential non-legal consequences', 'large-scale capital outflows', 'foreign law firms', 'international financial system', 'foreign private property', 'US financial systems', 'foreign states', 'foreign governments', 'International law', 'international courts', 'US Congress', 'fair compensation', 'particular protections', 'central banks', 'humanitarian aid', 'great lengths', 'one thing', 'Russian government', 'capital controls', 'legal actions', 'US access', 'outright theft', 'sovereign nation', 'extraordinary destruction', 'similar mechanism', 'similar amount', 'bargaining chip', 'serious negotiations', 'Western allies', 'Russian oligarchs', 'Getty Images', 'Such action', 'core principle', 'clear signal', 'other governments', 'US dollar', 'global trade', 'borrowings costs', 'The Europeans', 'significant shifts', 'capital flows', 'panicky exodus', 'financial assets', 'military conflict', 'frozen funds', 'domestic laws', 'European opponents', 'Russian funds', 'underlying asset', 'frozen assets', 'currencies’ status', 'bill', 'authority', 'America', 'breach', 'capabilities', 'enforcer', 'expropriation', 'cornerstones', 'Ukraine', 'suggestion', 'Credit', 'worms', 'retaliation', 'dollars', 'decades', 'attempt', 'benefit', 'banditry', 'something', 'country', 'invasion', 'losses', 'impairments', 'lives', 'earnings', 'principal', 'way', 'owner', 'levy', 'finances', 'corpus', 'war', 'withdrawal', 'territory', 'concerns', 'Germany', 'France', 'assault', 'proposal', 'board', 'risks', 'dominance', 'increases', 'inflation', 'Euroclear', 'role', 'trusted', 'counterargument', 'question']",2024-02-15,2024-02-15,smh.com.au

However  if the aggregate principal amount of all Notes validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Participation Date by Holders exceeds the Maximum Principal Amount (subject to any increase in such Maximum Principal Amount at our discretion)  then Verizon will (i) accept for purchase all validly tendered Notes of each series starting at the highest Acceptance Priority Level (level 1) and moving sequentially to Notes of each series having a lower Acceptance Priority Level (the lowest of which is level 5) until the aggregate principal amount of all validly tendered Notes of a series  combined with the aggregate principal amount of all accepted Notes of series with higher Acceptance Priority Levels  is as close as possible to  but does not exceed the Maximum Principal Amount  (ii) accept on a prorated basis validly tendered Notes of the series with the next lower Acceptance Priority Level and (iii) not accept for purchase (x) any such Notes of a series with an Acceptance Priority Level below the prorated series or (y) any Notes validly tendered after the applicable Early Participation Date; and• second  if the Maximum Principal Amount is not exceeded at the applicable Early Participation Date  Verizon will repeat the steps described in the prior bullet using the principal amount with respect to Notes validly tendered after the applicable Early Participation Date  but at or prior to the applicable Expiration Date  in order to determine the aggregate principal amount of such Notes that Verizon will accept for purchase. All Notes  regardless of Acceptance Priority Level  that are validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Participation Date will have priority over any Notes validly tendered after the applicable Early Participation Date.If the Financing Condition is not satisfied due to a shortfall in gross proceeds from the New Offering  then we will accept for purchase Notes of each series tendered in accordance with the applicable Acceptance Priority Levels after giving effect to proration  such that the amount of gross proceeds from the New Offering is equal to the aggregate Total Consideration or Tender Consideration  as further provided in the Offer to Purchase.Provided that all conditions to the Offers have been satisfied or timely waived by Verizon  Verizon will settle all Notes validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Participation Date and accepted for purchase promptly following the applicable Early Participation Date (the “Early Settlement Date”)  which is expected to be the third business day thereafter. The “Final Settlement Date ” if any  is the date on which Verizon will settle all Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase that were not previously settled on the Early Settlement Date. The Final Settlement Date is expected to be the third business day after the applicable Expiration Date  unless extended with respect to any Offer. Each of the Early Settlement Date and the Final Settlement Date is referred to as a “Settlement Date.”Verizon reserves the right  but is under no obligation  to increase the Maximum Principal Amount at any time  subject to compliance with applicable law. There is no assurance that Verizon will increase the Maximum Principal Amount. If Verizon increases the Maximum Principal Amount  it does not expect to extend the Withdrawal Date  subject to applicable law.The Total Consideration (which includes the Early Participation Payment) or Tender Consideration (which does not include the Early Participation Payment)  as applicable  payable by Verizon for each €1 000 principal amount of each series of Notes validly tendered  and not validly withdrawn  and accepted by Verizon will be paid in cash on the relevant Settlement Date.Promptly after the Price Determination Date  Verizon will issue a press release specifying  among other things  the Total Consideration for each series of Notes  the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Participation Date and accepted in each Offer and the proration factor (if any) to be applied.Verizon has retained Barclays Bank PLC  BNP Paribas  Deutsche Bank AG  London Branch and J.P.

The EFOY ProShelter is not only 10 times more efficient than a conventional diesel generator  but also reduces emissions by up to 99%. With savings of 30-50% of the total cost of ownership compared to alternative off-grid technologies  this solution effectively contributes to improving the carbon footprint "" says Hans Pol  COO of SFC Energy AG.The EFOY ProShelter ensures a continuous energy supply for off-grid telecoms sites. It is extremely sustainable  especially at locations with low solar irradiation  as it requires little maintenance and the refueling intervals are variable. For example  the fuel cell switches on automatically if the solar system does not provide enough power to charge the battery. As soon as this process is complete  the fuel cell returns to standby mode. The performance of the EFOY ProShelter has been tested in a climate chamber and is classified for use at temperatures down to -40° C. The energy autonomy is designed for approx. 12-18 months.The client is Groupe CLR. The Canadian company was founded more than 40 years ago and has developed into one of the most important players in the field of radio and telecommunication in the province of Quebec.“EFOY ProShelter offer an unmatched power solution for isolated telecommunication sites when dealing with low sun exposure locations such as in Northern Quebec. The low maintenance  customizable refuelling intervals  low emissions and self-heating feature of the solution makes it a no-brainer choice in the autonomous power source market for mission-critical telecommunications infrastructures”  says Réjean Brousseau  Sales Manager of Groupe CLR.Further information on SFC Energy's Clean Energy and Clean Power Management solutions can be found at sfc.com.About SFC Energy AGSFC Energy AG is a leading provider of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions.

These results will enable us to close this trial very soon  after 18 months of treatment  and we will make together with BBDF every effort to continue offering this treatment to trial patients in view of its favorable risk-benefit profile. We are currently exploring every option – financing or a partnership – to ensure we have the necessary resources to implement our pivotal Phase III trial in Europe and the United States. At the same time  we will shortly be announcing the start of preclinical development of a new drug candidate.""As a reminder  the results after 6[2]and 12 months of treatment were the subject of communications  and the FDA[3] and the EMA[4] have also validated the design of the upcoming phase 3 study.On 31 December 2023  total available funds stood at €4.9 M (compared with €6.0M on 30 September 2023)  reflecting a careful and rigorous approach to expenditure control. Aside from the upcoming launch of the Phase III trial to evaluate Batten-1  which is subject to availability of additional resources (in the form of a capital raise or an industrial partnership)  the rate of expenditure will fall significantly from Q2 2024 onwards due to completion of Phase I/II underway.

This plant will include the installation of a state-of-the-art continuous anodising line for the architectural market. The Chinese company has secured a comprehensive package of funding for the construction of the factory and working capital for the new business.Under the terms of the agreement  the Chinese company will leverage COIL's advanced technology  including technical assistance and engineering support for the construction of the production line. All third-party purchases related to the construction of this line will be for the account of the Chinese company.COIL will also grant the Chinese company an exclusive and permanent license to use the technology and the brands of COIL in the People's Republic of China  Southeast Asia  and Northeast Asia.In return  COIL will receive upfront and milestone payments for the construction of the production line and the exploitation of its technology. Coil will receive royalties on future sales by the Chinese company. In addition  as part of the technological and commercial licensing agreement  Coil will acquire a 5% stake in the Chinese company.COIL has been selling its products to customers in Asia for many years. However  the Company has not been able to create a business model to exploit the full potential of this market due to the long logistics chain and costs associated with supplying this market from Europe. By stocking high quality European anodising quality metal – homologated by Coil - in the PRC  the new company will be able to anodise at lower prices locally and ship rapidly to order. Further the new company will be able to establish and police the highest quality standards in the local market.In a changing global environment  this collaboration agreement should help accelerate the development of the COIL brand in Asia and realize its significant potential through an adapted industrial and commercial model that creates value for COIL.About COILCOIL is the world's leading anodiser in the building and industrial sectors and trades under the ALOXIDE brand name.Anodising is an electrochemical process (electrolysis) which develops a natural  protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium and can be coloured in a range of UV-proof finishes. It gives the metal excellent resistance to corrosion and/or reinforces its functional qualities. Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion. The metal remains totally and repeatedly recyclable through simple re-melting. Anodised aluminium is used in a wide variety of industries and applications: architecture  design  manufacturing  and the automotive sector.COIL deploys an industrial model that creates value by leveraging its unique know-how  its operational excellence  the quality of its investments and the expertise of its people. COIL has around 110 employees in Belgium and Germany and generated a turnover of €21 8 million in 2023.Listed on Euronext Growth Paris | Isin: BE0160342011 | Reuters: ALCOI.PA | Bloomberg: ALCOI: FPFor more information  please visit www.aloxide.comContactCOILTim Hutton | Chief Executive Officertim.hutton@coil.be | Tel.: +32 (0)11 88 01 88 CALYPTUSCyril Combecyril.combe@calyptus.net | Tel.: +33 (0)1 53 65 68 68Attachment,neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,positive,0.72,0.26,0.02,True,English,"['Coil Signs', 'Agreement', 'Technology', 'Brand', 'China', 'high quality European anodising quality metal', 'Chief Executive Officer tim', 'natural, protective oxide layer', 'highest quality standards', 'long logistics chain', 'changing global environment', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'Cyril Combe cyril', 'continuous anodising line', 'commercial licensing agreement', 'ALOXIDE brand name', 'LEVERAGE ITS TECHNOLOGY', 'COIL SIGNS AGREEMENT', 'high rigidity', 'commercial model', 'Tim Hutton', 'aluminium anodising', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'collaboration agreement', 'Jiangxi province', 'comprehensive package', 'working capital', 'new business', 'technical assistance', 'engineering support', 'production line', 'third-party purchases', 'permanent license', 'milestone payments', 'future sales', 'many years', 'business model', 'full potential', 'lower prices', 'significant potential', 'leading anodiser', 'electrochemical process', 'UV-proof finishes', 'excellent resistance', 'functional qualities', 'ecological properties', 'excellent strength', 'weight ratio', 'magnetic properties', 'exceptional resistance', 'simple re-melting', 'wide variety', 'automotive sector', 'unique know-how', 'operational excellence', 'Chinese company', 'new company', 'advanced technology', 'World leader', 'industrial sectors', 'industrial model', 'Eastern Asia', 'Southeast Asia', 'Northeast Asia', 'Anodised aluminium', 'new factory', 'architectural market', 'local market', 'COIL brand', 'Contact COIL', 'coil.be', 'Brussels', '14 February', 'CHINA', 'signing', 'PRC', 'construction', 'Fuzhou', 'People', 'Republic', 'plant', 'installation', 'state', 'funding', 'terms', 'account', 'exclusive', 'brands', 'return', 'upfront', 'exploitation', 'royalties', 'addition', 'technological', '5% stake', 'products', 'customers', 'costs', 'development', 'value', 'building', 'trades', 'electrolysis', 'surface', 'range', 'corrosion', 'industries', 'applications', 'architecture', 'design', 'manufacturing', 'investments', 'expertise', '110 employees', 'Belgium', 'Germany', 'turnover', 'Reuters', 'ALCOI', 'Bloomberg', 'FP', 'information', 'Tel.', 'CALYPTUS', 'Attachment']",2024-02-14,2024-02-15,globenewswire.com

Our portfolio valuations have been stabilizing  while our sector-leading balance sheet leaves us room for maneuver. These results are a testimony of our leadership position in the continental European mall industry and we are fully confident in our capacity to pursue our growth next year. In a changing retail landscape  our portfolio of top-quality malls will continue to provide the most desirable stores to leading omnichannel retailers and further gain market shares. Thanks to the same operating levers  we plan to deliver at least 4% EBITDA growth in 2024 and generate a net current cash flow per share of €2.45-€2.50.”KEY FINANCIALS(9)12/31/2022 12/31/2023 Like-for-like change(10) In millions of euros  total share Total revenues 1 430.7 1 501.0 Net Rental Income (NRI) 926.6 1 005.0 +8.8% EBITDA 841.1 921.4 In euros  Group share Net current cash flow per share 2.24 2.48 12/31/2022 12/31/2023 In millions of euros  total share Portfolio valuation (including transfer taxes) 19 832 19 331 Net debt 7 479 7 349 Loan-to-Value (LTV) 37.7% 38.0% Net debt to EBITDA 7.9x 7.4x In euros  Group share EPRA Net Tangible Assets (NTA) per share 30.90 30.10STRONG GROWTH MOMENTUMIn 2023  Group net rental income reached €1 005 million  up 8.8% on a like-for-like basis(10)  outpacing the 5.8% indexation by 300 basis points. This record growth was fueled by the combination of a 110 basis-point increase in the collection rate (to 97.5%)  the delivery of a 21% like-for-like increase in additional revenues (turnover rents  car park revenues and mall income) and a disciplined management of property charges which translated into a wider operating margin.On a like-for-like basis  total retailer sales at Klépierre malls rose 6%(11) in 2023 compared to 2022. All countries contributed to the growth and exceeded 2022 levels. Segment wise  this upward trajectory was mainly fueled by food & beverage  while leisure and entertainment also posted double-digit growth. Sports and health & beauty were on the same outperforming trend.This performance  coupled with the Group’s asset management and development actions to adapt its offering to an evolving retail environment  has been driving solid leasing tension for its assets identified as key destinations for expanding banners. In 2023  this translated into a 22% increase in volume of leases signed to 1 658  including 1 317 renewals and re-lettings  generating a 4.4% positive reversion.Meanwhile  Klépierre’s operating fundamentals remained very solid with an occupancy rate of 96.0%  up 20 basis points over the year and an occupancy cost ratio of 12.8% as of December 31  2023. The average remaining duration of leases stood at 5.1 years (versus 5.0 years in 2022)  reflecting the Group’s strategy of favoring long-term leases providing high visibility on rents.GROWING EARNINGS AND DISTRIBUTIONIn 2023  net current cash flow amounted to €811.6 million (total share)  or €2.48(12) per share (Group share)  a record 10.7%(13) increase over one year. With more than €1.6 billion in disposals since 2021  this strong performance demonstrates Klépierre’s capacity to continue to grow the net current cash flow significantly while selling assets.The Supervisory Board will recommend that the shareholders  at the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 3  2024  approve the payment of a cash distribution in respect of fiscal year 2023 of €1.80 per share to be paid in two installments: (i) a cash distribution of €0.90 per share from Klépierre’s tax exempt activities (SIIC) on March 26  2024; and (ii) the balance of €0.90 per share (comprising a €0.7983 per share “SIIC” dividend; and €0.1017 per share distribution of share premiums qualifying as an equity repayment(14))  to be paid on July 11  2024.STABILIZING PORTFOLIO VALUEIncluding transfer taxes  the like-for-like(15) value of the portfolio remained stable over six months  at €19 331 million on a total share basis (down 0.2%).As of December 31  2023  the appraisers’ main assumptions were the following:Discount rate at 7.8% and exit rate at 6.1%; andCompound annual growth rate of 2.8% for the next 10 years.This stabilization in valuation of the portfolio should pave the way for values bottoming out.As of December 31  2023  the average EPRA NIY(16) for the portfolio stood at 5.9%.EPRA NTA per share amounted to €30.10 as of December 31  2023  stable over six months.INVESTING IN HIGH-RETURN OPPORTUNITIESWith conservative credit metrics and strong cash flow generation  Klépierre is pursuing an accretive capital rotation policy  reinvesting the proceeds from disposals of non-core assets or land banks into retail development projects (extensions and refurbishment) and targeted acquisitions.As such  in 2023  Klépierre disposed or signed promissory agreements for €169 million (excluding transfer taxes)  20% above appraised values for a blended EPRA Net Initial Yield of 5.5%.Meanwhile  the Group continued to invest in extensions of its dominant malls crystallizing strong leasing tension. As of today  before launching any new projects  Klépierre ensures that the expected yield on cost is at least 8%. In November 2023  the 16 200 sq.m. extension of Grand Place (Grenoble  France) was delivered  while the Maremagnum rooftop (Barcelona  Spain) will be finalized in the first half of 2024. In early 2024  Klépierre engaged a new development project with the extension of Odysseum (Montpellier  France).Lastly  Klépierre’s leverage enables it to consider opportunities and complete targeted acquisitions as demonstrated by the acquisition of O’Parinor  a 100 000 sq.m. super-regional shopping mall in the Paris region. Klépierre will own 25% of the property and act as an asset  property and leasing manager. This investment is expected to generate a strong double digit levered annual cash return from year one. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2024.SECTOR-LEADING LEVERAGE AND AMPLE ACCESS TO FINANCINGKlépierre continued to have good access to debt capital markets  raising more than €1.0 billion with an average maturity of 6.7 years. Furthermore  the Group signed or renewed €725 million of revolving credit facilities. At the end of 2023  Klépierre’s liquidity position(17) stood at €3.0 billion.The Group’s strong cash flow generation led to a €130 million decrease in consolidated net debt to €7 349 million as of December 31  2023. This translated into sector-leading credit and cost-of-debt metrics including net debt to EBITDA at 7.4x  a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio at 38.0% and an interest coverage ratio (ICR) of 8.4x  leaving the Group room for maneuver. Thanks to an active hedging policy  the average cost of debt stood at 1.5% at the end of the year with an average maturity of the Group’s debt of 6.3 years. As of December 31  2023  the hedging rate(18) stood at 98% for 2024 and 84% for 2025.Since May 2023  Fitch has assigned an A− rating with a stable outlook to Klépierre’s senior unsecured debt (F1 short-term rating). Standard & Poor’s currently assigns Klépierre a long-term BBB+ rating (A2 short-term rating) with a stable outlook (affirmed on June 9  2023).ACT4GOODTM: CONSOLIDATING OUR LEADING POSITION IN ESGIn early 2024  Klépierre was once again included in the CDP’s “A List” of the most advanced companies fighting climate change at global level.

It is an oral solution containing the locally-acting antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid. Positive data in a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) trial in healthy subjects suggested the treatment was well tolerated under varied conditions with no serious adverse events following tooth extraction  while effectively controlling procedural bleeding without delaying clot formation. Data from this Phase 1 allowed Hyloris to define the optimal administration regimen for its proprietary oral solution for the current Phase 3 trial.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: “Preventing bleeding with a convenient oral rinse to be self-administered at home  at work or in a dental office would improve patient outcomes after generally unpleasant tooth extraction procedures. The health care system is also served by shorter times to discharge and reducing the incidence of clinically relevant bleeding and thus the need for hospitalization.”“Our proprietary mouth rinse demonstrates once again the opportunity that lies in reinventing existing medicines. We believe the potential for Tranexamic Acid Oral Rinse reaches even further than what is currently being tested  and we are exploring opportunities in broader related indications in patients undergoing oral surgical procedures with or without bleeding disorders that could benefit from a locally acting antifibrinolytic agent.”Close to 2 in 3 U.S. adults aged 18-64 visit dental professionals every year1. Around 8 million people in the U.S. take blood thinner medication2. A market study conducted by Hyloris indicated that more than 80% of U.S. based dental professionals would stock a locally acting tranexamic acid mouth rinse to use during and following relevant procedures such as tooth extractions.Hyloris will seek regulatory approval in the United States first  before expanding to other territories. Conditional to a successful clinical study program  Hyloris expects to license the product candidate to a partner for commercialization in the U.S.About this Phase 3 trialThis randomized  double-blind  multicenter  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial is designed to demonstrate efficacy  safety and acceptability of the oral solution containing tranexamic acid to prevent possible oral haemorrhaging in patients treated with anticoagulants (blood thinners) and undergoing extraction of one or more teeth.This study will measure and compare efficacy of the proprietary oral solution containing tranexamic acid against placebo in reducing the number of both clinically relevant and irrelevant bleeds in patients treated with anticoagulants and undergoing tooth extraction. Clinically relevant bleeds are defined as the need for medical attention or intervention.An estimated 280 patients will be recruited at approximately 20 clinical sites across Europe and the United States. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive tranexamic acid oral solution or placebo for 7 days and followed for approximately one month. Recruitment is expected to be completed around the end of 2024 with final results available in the first half of 2025.About Tranexamic Acid Oral RinseHyloris’ proprietary reformulated oral rinse was developed for use in minor surgical procedures with complications/bleedings. The formulation can be used by dental care professionals for patients on anti-coagulant therapies who benefit from the opportunity to continue their anti-coagulant treatments when scheduled for dental procedures. By addressing the unique challenges faced by individuals on blood thinners  this oral care solution seeks to enhance the overall dental experience and improve the oral health of these patients.About Tranexamic AcidTranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that has been used for decades to reduce or prevent postoperative bleeding in patients with bleeding problems. The drug is currently approved for intravenous administration (CYKLOKAPRON® IV) in the U.S. for reduction or prevention of bleeding in patients having a high risk of intra and post-operative haemorrhage (during general and oral surgery  such as tooth extractions) due to a bleeding disorder such as haemophilia (as indicated). The drug is also approved in the U.S. as an oral tablet (LYSTEDA®) for cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding.About Hyloris Pharmaceuticals SAHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.The Company’s development strategy primarily focuses on leveraging established regulatory pathways  such as the FDA’s 505(b)2 pathway in the U.S. or equivalent regulatory frameworks in other regions which are specifically designed for pharmaceuticals for which safety and efficacy of the molecule have already been established. This approach can reduce the clinical burden required for market entry  and significantly shorten the development timelines  leading to reduced costs and risks.Hyloris has built a broad  patented portfolio of 18 reformulated and repurposed value-added medicines that have the potential to offer significant advantages over existing alternatives. Two products are currently in early phases of commercialization in collaboration with commercial partners: Sotalol IV for the treatment of atrial fibrillation  and Maxigesic® IV  a non-opioid post-operative pain treatment. In addition to its core strategic focus  the Company has 1 approved high barrier generic product launched in the U.S. and 2 high barrier generic products in development.Hyloris is based in Liège  Belgium.

If the trial meets the primary endpoint and demonstrates a clinical benefit over the current gold standard of immunotherapy for this indication  ipilimumab and nivolumab  it represents a significant accomplishment. From an industry perspective  it will be the first time an off-the-shelf cancer vaccine shows such an additional clinical benefit in a randomized trial in the most serious form of skin cancer”  said Carlos de Sousa  CEO of Ultimovacs.“Our mission is to demonstrate UV1’s value for patients. Because of the ground-breaking potential of a positive topline result  we will seek to present the full analysis at a major oncology conference and publish the results in a top-tiered medical journal. Sharing clinical trial results in peer-reviewed forums represents a validation from experts in the field  as well as an effective outreach to leaders in the global medical  investment and pharmaceutical sectors. We look forward to communicating the topline result in March and to share the full study results at the best peer-reviewed opportunity thereafter.”Fourth Quarter 2023 HighlightsNear-term readout of UV1 Phase II study INITIUM in unresectable or metastatic malignant melanomaOn January 16  2024  Ultimovacs announced that the last patient enrolled in the INITIUM trial has now been followed for 18 months  thereby enabling readout of the primary endpoint. The Company expects to announce topline results from the randomized Phase II clinical trial in March this year. With a positive topline result from the trial  the ambition is to present the study results at an upcoming international oncology conference and in a high impact medical journal.On October 31  2023  Ultimovacs announced that a suggested INITIUM study protocol amendment allowing data cut-off 18 months after inclusion of last patient if 70 endpoints have not occurred was accepted by relevant regulatory authorities. The amendment followed the observation that very few endpoints occurred during 2023. By mid-January 2024  the last enrolled patient had completed follow-up time of 18 months triggering data cut-off. The protocol amendment maintains the integrity of the study statistics without materially affecting the scientific value of the clinical trial. The topline result from the study is expected in March 2024.On November 2  2023  the Company announced the completed enrollment of 21 patients in the INITIUM supplementary single-arm study in malignant melanoma. Study objectives are to investigate how immune responses against telomerase transfers into anti-tumor activity and further to clinical benefit for patients.Clinically meaningful survival data reported at the ESMO Congress in UV1 Phase II study NIPU in malignant mesotheliomaNIPU trial principal investigator  Professor Åslaug Helland  MD  PhD  reported the results from the study in second-line treatment of patients with malignant mesothelioma as an oral presentation at the ESMO Congress 2023 in Madrid in October. The data presented showed that UV1  as add-on to the checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab and nivolumab  demonstrated a clinically meaningful overall survival benefit after a relevant observation period  with no added toxicities compared to ipilimumab and nivolumab alone. The study also reported that 31% of the patients treated with UV1 experienced an objective response  as compared to 16% in the control arm. An analysis of the Hazard Ratio in Overall Survival showed that UV1 cancer vaccination combined with ipilimumab and nivolumab reduced the risk of death by 27%.On October 9  2023  Ultimovacs announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug designation (ODD) to the Company’s therapeutic cancer vaccine UV1 for the treatment of patients with mesothelioma.On February 5  2024  Ultimovacs announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to the Company’s therapeutic cancer vaccine UV1 in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma to improve overall survival.Demonstrated sustained long-term survival in Phase I study UV1-103 in malignant melanomaOn October 12  2023  Ultimovacs reported sustained long-term overall survival in patients treated with UV1 cancer vaccine in the UV1-103 Phase I study in malignant melanoma. No confirmed patient deaths occurred in Cohort 1 between the 3-year and 4-year follow-up period.Exploratory Phase I TENDU study of TET technology met primary endpointOn December 18  2023  Ultimovacs announced that the dose-escalation  first-in-human Phase I trial showed good safety and tolerability across all dose cohorts and met the primary endpoint of the study. Data included observations of immune activation with vaccine specific T cell responses. In addition to the trial results  advancements in preclinical research  technology development and product manufacturing provide a valuable foundation for the future development of the TET technology and TET-based vaccine candidates.Clinical trials updateUV1 Phase II programINITIUM (malignant melanoma): Evaluating ipilimumab and nivolumab +/- UV1.

After a strong 2022  2023 proved to be challenging. Strong pricing to offset very high input and energy cost inflation and volatile macro-economic conditions in some key markets affected our volume momentum. Notwithstanding these difficult conditions  we continued investing in our brands and capabilities. We gained or held volume market share in over half of our markets as volume performance moderately improved quarter by quarter. We recorded operating profit (beia) organic growth in 3 out of 4 regions while we adapted to the challenges in Asia Pacific.We continue to make progress on our EverGreen priorities. The Heineken® brand celebrated its 150 year anniversary and delivered another year of volume growth  up 3.4% excluding Russia. We made excellent progress with our digital business-to-business platforms and now capture close to €11 billion of gross merchandise value. We significantly beat our productivity commitment  delivering €0.8 billion of gross savings in 2023. We also further evolved our portfolio footprint with the acquisition of Distell and Namibia Breweries to form Heineken Beverages  a new beverages champion for Southern Africa  and the exit from Russia in the third quarter.Looking to 2024  we remain cautious about the global economic and geo-political outlook. Our focus going forward will be on revenue growth  balanced between volume and value  by continuing to invest behind our brands  innovations  commercial capabilities and route-to-consumer to deliver long-term sustained value creation.""Financial Summary1IFRS Measures € million Totalgrowth BEIA Measures € million Organicgrowth2 Revenue 36 375 4.9 % Revenue (beia) 36 310 4.6 % Net revenue 30 362 5.7 % Net revenue (beia) 30 308 5.5 % Operating profit 3 229 -24.6 % Operating profit (beia) 4 443 1.7 % Operating profit (beia) margin (%) 14.7 % Net profit 2 304 -14.1 % Net profit (beia) 2 632 -4.3 % Diluted EPS (in €) 4.09 -12.3 % Diluted EPS (beia) (in €) 4.67 -5.2 % Free operating cash flow 1 759Net debt / EBITDA (beia)3 2.4 x1 Consolidated figures are used throughout this report  unless otherwise stated. Please refer to the Glossary for an explanation of non-GAAP measures and other terms. Page 26 includes a reconciliation versus IFRS metrics. These non-GAAP measures are included in internal management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Board of HEINEKEN  as management believes that this measurement is the most relevant in evaluating the results and in performance management..2 Organic growth shown  except for Diluted EPS (beia)  which is total growth.3 Includes acquisitions and excludes disposals on a 12-month pro-forma basis.Outlook 2024As we continue to advance on our EverGreen journey  we remain committed to our medium-term ambition to deliver superior growth  balanced between volume and value  and to drive continuous productivity improvements to fund investments behind EverGreen and enable operating profit (beia) to grow ahead of net revenue (beia) over time.Our volume performance at the closing of 2023 was under pressure from external factors  with a moderate sequential improvement quarter by quarter. For 2024  we expect the macroeconomic environment and geopolitical developments to remain a factor of uncertainty that may impact our business. In this context  our focus going forward will be on restoring our volume growth by continuing to invest behind our brands  innovations  commercial capabilities and route-to-consumer.We expect our variable costs to increase by a low-single-digit on a per hectolitre basis  benefitting from lower commodity and energy prices  but more than offset by local input cost inflation and currency devaluations  particularly in Africa. We also expect higher than historical average wage inflation to impact our cost base.Our continuous productivity programme will deliver at least €500 million of gross savings in 2024  ahead of our medium term commitment of €400 million for the near-term  enabling investments behind our growth agenda  our digital transformation  strategic capabilities and our Brew a Better World activities.Overall  we expect to grow operating profit (beia) organically in the range of a low- to high-single-digit. The wide range corresponds to the volatility in geo-political and economic conditions we have also witnessed in the past months and the fact that we will continue to invest behind EverGreen for long-term sustained value creation.We also expect:An average effective interest rate (beia) of around 3.5% (2023: 3.4%)Other net finance expenses to further increase  mainly due to the impact from significant devaluations and the scarcity of hard currency in some key emerging markets  like we are experiencing currently in NigeriaAn increase in our effective tax rate (beia) to around 29%  mainly driven by changes in tax laws in Brazil (2023: 26.8%).The factors above result in a net profit (beia) organic growth that is lower than the operating profit (beia) organic growth.Finally  we expect investments in capital expenditure related to property  plant and equipment and intangible assets to be below 9% of net revenue (beia) (2023: 8.8%)Total Dividend For 2023The Heineken N.V. dividend policy is to pay a ratio of 30% to 40% of full year net profit (beia). For 2023  a total cash dividend of €1.73 per share  a similar amount to last year (2022: €1.73)  representing a payout ratio of 36.8%  within the range of our policy  will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2024 (""2024 AGM""). If approved  a final dividend of €1.04 per share will be paid on 7 May 2024  as an interim dividend of €0.69 per share was paid on 10 August 2023. The payment will be subject to a 15% Dutch withholding tax. The ex-dividend date for Heineken N.V. shares will be 29 April 2024.Translational Calculated Currency ImpactThe translational currency impact for 2023 was negative on net revenue (beia) by €864 million and on operating profit (beia) by €102 million and positive on net profit beia by €6 million.Applying spot rates as of 12 February 2024 to the 2023 financial results as a base  the calculated currency translational impact would be negative  approximately €440 million in net revenue (beia)  €60 million at operating profit (beia)  and positive by €40 million at net profit (beia).EnquiriesMedia Investors Joris Evers José Federico Castillo Martinez Director of Global Communication Investor Relations Director Michael Fuchs Mark Matthews / Chris Steyn Corporate & Financial Communications Manager Investor Relations Manager / Senior Analyst E-mail: pressoffice@heineken.com E-mail: investors@heineken.com Tel: +31-20-5239355 Tel: +31-20-5239590Investor Calendar Heineken N.V.Combined financial and sustainability annual report publication 22 February 2024 Trading Update for Q1 2024 24 April 2024 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders 25 April 2024 Quotation ex-final dividend 2023 29 April 2024 Final dividend 2023 payable 7 May 2024 Half Year 2024 Results 29 July 2024 Quotation ex-interim dividend 2024 31 July 2024 Interim dividend payable 8 August 2024 Trading Update for Q3 2024 23 October 2024Conference Call DetailsHEINEKEN will host an analyst and investor video webcast about its 2023 FY results today  14 February  at 14:00 CET/ 13:00 GMT/ 08.00 EST.

Without this change  revenue would have been stable compared to 2022 at €81 million. In order to come back to revenue growth and improve the group's profitability  Prodways Group is taking a number of measures that will have an impact as early as 2024.2023 revenue: €75 millionFull-year 2023 revenues were down compared to last year  mainly due to the change in revenue recognition of the Software business since the month of July (impact of -€6.5 million  with no effect on current EBITDA in absolute terms). In addition  weak sales of new 3D printers and related materials  notably in the fourth quarter  weighed on Prodways' performance. The Products division remains well oriented with growth of +11% in 2023.(€ million) Q4 2023 Q4 2022 Change [1](%) FY2023 FY2022 Change (%) Organic change 1(%) Systems 9 3 13 5 -31% 39 6 49 3 -20% -20% Products 8 6 8 4 +3% 35 3 31 7 +11% +5% Structure & intra-groupeliminations -0 1 0 0 n.a -0 3 -0 3 n.a n.a Consolidated revenue 17 8 21 9 -18% 74 6 80 7 -8% -10%Systems Division: a decrease related to printers ‘sales and the change in Software revenue recognitionAs expected for several months  sales of new printers decreased in 2023  by nearly 20%  both in the jewellery business  which is being shut down  but also in the MovingLight range. In the latter  the wait-and-see attitude of customers has slowed down new investments. Prodways Group has therefore suffered from this cyclical effect but remains confident about the structural growth of sales of industrial printers.Sales of Materials remained relatively stable in 2023 despite an unfavorable comparison with 2022  which benefited from orders by anticipation and inventory effects. The recurring sales model of 3D materials and the high satisfaction of our customers have once again made it possible to generate significant profitability.The Software business had a good year in terms of gaining new customers. The new sales organization  set up in mid-2023  began to produce effects at the end of the year. The change in the classification of Prodways Group as an Agent instead of Principal as of July 1  2023 results in a decrease in revenue (-€6.5 million compared to the previous classification) with no impact on current EBITDA in absolute terms[2]. In addition  the transition to the SaaS (Software as a Service) model accelerated in the fourth quarter 2023  resulting in the smoothing of revenues over the duration of contracts (between 12 and 36 months). On the other hand  this unfavorable effect is partially offset by the strong increase in sales based on this SaaS model  of around +70% in 2023  thanks in particular to the gains of new customers.Products Division: Acceleration of Digital Manufacturing and Progress in AudiologyThe Digital Manufacturing business performed well  growing by 9% over the whole of 2023  with an acceleration in the fourth quarter (+11% growth). In particular  Prodways Group has signed contracts for small series with renowned customers that will continue in 2024  particularly in the automotive and leisure sectors.Audiology revenues increased by nearly 20% this year  notably with the acquisition of Auditech  which was successfully integrated. Sales of noise protection for industrial clients continued to drive the performance  with volume and price increases reflecting the high quality of this custom-made equipment (+11% organic growth).Multiple measures are being implemented to improve Prodways' prospectsProdways remains one of the most successful players in 3D printing on a global scale  both technologically and financially. But the insufficient performance in 2023  in terms of revenue and profitability  is now leading the company to take measures to significantly improve its development trajectory with:The refocusing of the Printers business on the industrial segment and the discontinuation of small printers for jewelry  announced at the end of January 2024. This refocusing will result in a reduction in the Group's headcount and fixed cost structure. The sale of the Cristal laboratory  which has become a competitor of our customers in the dental sector. This sale should allow Prodways to form a partnership with one of the largest dental prosthesis laboratories in France around 3D Printers and Materials. The professionalization of the Sales & Marketing teams  which began in 2023  will continue in 2024 with the aim of achieving greater sales efficiency without a significant increase in team size. As a result  the company expects a structural increase in business opportunities in the coming year. A reduction in headcount and revenue-generating recruitment: thanks to the refocusing on profitable activities  the group's total headcount will decrease this year. By the end of 2024  they should be equivalent to those at the end of 2021 (~460 people) but generate higher revenue on a comparable basis.All of these actions should therefore have a significant effect on operating leverage thanks to a reduction in fixed costs of a few million euros. As a result  the company's current EBITDA and structural cash generation are expected to improve in 2024.Refocusing of the Printers business on the industrial segment and discontinuation of small printers for jewelleryFor several years  Prodways Group has been marketing small printers for the high-end jewellery sector under the Solidscape brand. The sales of these small printers (with a unit value of around €15k)  as well as the associated materials and services  generated a turnover of close to €5 million in 2023 and a significant operating loss. The cessation of this activity will therefore have a positive impact on Prodways' profitability. This strategic refocusing was announced at the end of January 2024 and more details are available in the dedicated press release.The shutdown of the jewellery activity is being implemented since the end of January 2024 and should be finalised by the end of the summer. The impact in the 2023 financial statements is estimated at this stage at around €15 million in asset impairments[3] (with no impact on cash). In 2024  the costs related to this shutdown are expected to represent just over €1 million  mainly in the first half of the year.Sale of the Cristal dental prosthesis laboratorySince 2017  Prodways Group has been operating a small digital dental prosthesis laboratory within the Products Division  under the brand “Cristal”. This activity served as an applied R&D laboratory during the early adoption of 3D by the dental sector in order to demonstrate the relevance of Prodways' 3D Printers and Materials. It has now fulfilled its role and has even become a competitor to our customers.Prodways Group does not intend to develop this activity and has therefore decided to sell it to a leading French group in the field of dental prosthesis laboratories. This sale should make it possible to create a technological partnership around MovingLight printers and associated 3D materials. Discussions are ongoing  and details on this partnership may be provided at a later date.In 2023  Cristal's business generated revenue of around €3 million and a break-even current EBITDA. The sale is effective from the beginning of February 2024 and will therefore have a positive impact on the group's profitability.Basis of comparison for 2024All the measures implemented and the change in revenue recognition in the Software business significantly change the Group's revenue profile in 2024  while structurally improving current EBITDA generation in absolute terms.As an indication  if all the measures and changes previously announced had been effective as of January 1  2023  the revenues generated by Prodways Group in 2023 would have been around €60 million[4].Outlook for 2024The measures aimed at improving the Group's profitability  combined with the reorganization and professionalization of the Sales & Marketing teams  are expected to produce structural effects as early as the second half of 2024. Important elements to look out for in the next few semesters include:The closure of the jewellery business and the refocusing on the MovingLight® range should be finalised by the end of the summer. This action plan will weigh in particular on profitability in the 1st half of 2024 but will have a positive impact on current EBITDA from the second half of the year. The recognition of Software revenues as an ""Agent"" in full year and the transition to SaaS model  with a smoothing effect of revenues over time. This latest change  however  opens up an opportunity to gain new customers in a changing market. The acceleration of certain industrial projects for new applications of the MovingLight  currently in shared R&D with customers  could open up opportunities in 2024  potentially for high value-added parts in aeronautics. Demand for 3D Printers and Materials for orthodontic aligners could regain positive momentum in 2024. The strong year-end performance of 2023 and the expansion outlook announced by the global leader in the sector  Align Technology  are encouraging[5].The company does not provide 2024 revenue guidance at this stage. The combination of actions to improve revenue and measures to reduce costs is expected to be fully effective by the end of the year. Prodways Group's strategy of focusing on business segments that generate significant profitability has enabled the company to be one of the most profitable listed players in its sector. This strategy will be stepped up in 2024. Prodways Group should thus be able to effectively transform its revenue growth into results and cash.About Prodways GroupProdways Group is a specialist in industrial and professional 3D printing with a unique positioning as an integrated European player.

For Q4 2023  the organic change is equal to the current change.[2] From an accounting point of view  the recognition of revenues from this activity is changing due to the classification of Prodways Group as an ""agent"" under IFRS 15 as of July 2023  whereas the company was considered ""principal"" until that date. As an agent  Prodways Group now recognises the gross margin earned on these sales as turnover. This change therefore reduces the absolute value of revenues recognized by €6.5 million in the second half of 2023.[3] The final figure will be finalized during the consolidation of the 2023 financial statements and published during the 2023 annual results.[4] This figure gives an indicative estimate of full-year 2023 revenues adjusted with the following assumptions: Agent classification in the Software business for the full year 2023 (vs. only H2 2023 under IFRS)  exclusion from the Solidscape scope  exclusion from the Cristal scope.[5] Link to Align Technology's 2023 annual results release: linkThis publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: mW1ulpeXlJmYnZ1yl8uZb2OVapxlw2KWZWSblmaZmJ2cm55jlG1kmJaeZnFll2hq- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Inside Information:- Information on annual revenues Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/84234-cp_prodways_ca-t4-2023_en.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2024 ActusNews",positive,0.54,0.44,0.01,mixed,0.35,0.26,0.38,True,English,"['rapid action plan', 'Prodways Group', 'Stable activity', 'performance', 'February', '11:50', 'largest dental prosthesis laboratories', 'The Digital Manufacturing business', 'fixed cost structure', 'The Software business', 'The Products division', 'greater sales efficiency', 'FY2023 FY2022 Change', 'recurring sales model', 'new sales organization', 'new 3D printers', 'Software revenue recognition', 'dental sector', 'jewellery business', 'Printers business', 'business opportunities', 'new printers', 'new investments', 'Service) model', '3D printing', 'current EBITDA', 'fourth quarter', 'MovingLight range', 'see attitude', 'industrial printers', 'unfavorable comparison', 'high satisfaction', 'other hand', 'strong increase', 'small series', 'leisure sectors', 'noise protection', 'industrial clients', 'price increases', 'high quality', 'custom-made equipment', 'successful players', 'global scale', 'development trajectory', 'industrial segment', 'small printers', 'Cristal laboratory', 'Marketing teams', 'significant increase', 'team size', 'structural increase', 'revenue-generating recruitment', 'profitable activities', 'comparable basis', 'Systems Division', 'new customers', 'SaaS model', ""Prodways' prospects"", 'last year', '3D materials', 'good year', 'coming year', 'Full-year 2023 revenues', 'cyclical effect', 'unfavorable effect', 'insufficient performance', 'weak sales', 'Consolidated revenue', 'higher revenue', 'structural growth', '+11% organic growth', 'absolute terms', 'related materials', 'Organic change', 'several months', 'inventory effects', 'previous classification', 'renowned customers', ""Prodways' performance"", 'Prodways Group', 'significant profitability', 'Multiple measures', 'total headcount', 'revenue growth', 'Audiology revenues', 'Q4 2022 Change', '+11% growth', '36 months', 'February', 'order', 'number', 'impact', 'July', 'addition', 'eliminations', 'decrease', 'wait', 'anticipation', 'mid-20', 'end', 'Agent', 'Principal', 'transition', 'smoothing', 'duration', 'contracts', 'gains', 'Acceleration', 'Progress', 'automotive', 'acquisition', 'Auditech', 'volume', 'company', 'refocusing', 'discontinuation', 'jewelry', 'January', 'reduction', 'competitor', 'partnership', 'France', 'professionalization', 'aim', 'result', '~460 people', 'actions', '12', '2021']",2023-02-15,2024-02-15,marketscreener.com

Today  Lectra’s Board of Directors  chaired by Daniel Harari  reviewed the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2023. Audit procedures have been performed by the Statutory Auditors. The certification report will be issued at the end of the Board of Director’s meeting of February 28  2024.Comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are based on 2022 exchange rates unless otherwise stated (“like-for-like”). As the impact of the acquisition of TextileGenesis on the financial statements for 2023 is not material  like-for-like changes exclude only the variations in exchange rates.Currency changes between 2022 and 2023 mechanically decreased revenues and EBITDA before non-recurring items by 3.9 million euros (-3%) and 1.7 million euros (-8%) respectively in Q4  and by 11.2 million euros (-2%) and 4.8 million euros (-6%) respectively in the year  at actual exchange rates compared to like-for-like figures.1. Q4 2023In Q4  uncertainties continued to weigh on investment decisions by the Group's customers. Against this backdrop  orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (38.3 million euros) were 19% lower than in Q4 2022. Orders for the first nine months of the year decreased by 29%.In parallel  new subscriptions for software (with an annual value of 3.1 million euros) were down 6% from Q4 2022  when several exceptionally high value orders were booked.Q4 2023 revenues (119.3 million euros) decreased by 5%  EBITDA before non-recurring items (19.8 million euros) declined by 8% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items came to 16.6% (-0.6 percentage points).2. 2023The year 2023 was marked by a severely degraded macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  with many companies worldwide delaying investment decisions. Against this backdrop  orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (145.4 million euros) decreased by 26% while new subscriptions for software sold in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) mode  of which the annual value amounted to 10.8 million euros  continued to grow (+15%)  confirming their success and increasing adoption by Group customers.Results in line with revised objectivesRevenues (477.6 million euros) and EBITDA before non-recurring items (79.0 million euros) were in line with the expectations published on October 25 (revenues in the range of 474 to 481 million euros and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 78 to 82 million euros).Strong improvement in the fundamentals of the Group's business modelThe 2023 results showed a strong improvement in the fundamentals of the Group's business model  largely due to synergies arising from the Gerber acquisition. Revenues from recurring contracts rose by 10% and the gross profit margin increased by 3.5 percentage points  on a like-for-like basis. Moreover  the Group decided to raise salaries  twice in 2022 and again in early 2023  in order to protect employees from inflation; it also continued to invest for the future by strengthening its R&D teams. These decisions raised fixed costs in the first quarter of 2023 by 11%  compared to the first quarter of 2022. Measures to reduce certain overhead costs brought the increase down to 2% in the fourth quarter  without sacrificing investments for the future.These improvements  many of which can be considered permanent  will have a positive impact on the Group's future earnings growth  in addition to the positive impact of the rebound in new systems orders.Decline in revenues and earningsRevenues (477.6 million euros) decreased by 6%. While revenues from software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (154.3 million euros) were down 24%  those from recurring contracts (181.3 million euros) rose by 10%. Revenues from consumables and parts (141.9 million euros) increased by 1%. Overall  recurring revenues (323.2 million euros) were up 6% and accounted for 68% of total revenues.Gross profit amounted to 333.2 million euros  down 1% compared to 2022  while revenues fell by 6%. The gross profit margin came to 69.8%  up 3.5 percentage points. This increase stems mainly from the synergies coming from the Gerber acquisition.EBITDA before non-recurring items (79.0 million euros) decreased by 15% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items came to 16.5%  down 1.7 percentage points.Income from operations came to 48.5 million euros. This includes a 12.6-million-euro charge for amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisitions carried out since 2021  as well as non-recurring items  the net amount of which is a charge of 0.6 million euros.Net income (32.6 million euros) was down 26% at actual exchange rates.Free cash flow before non-recurring items totaled 45.3 million euros (43.7 million euros in 2022). It is higher than net income.A particularly robust balance sheetAt December 31  2023  the Group had a particularly robust balance sheet with a consolidated shareholders’ equity of 417.9 million euros and a positive net cash position of 17.0 million euros  consisting in financial debt of 98.1 million euros and cash of 115.0 million euro3. ASSESSMENT OF THE 2023-2025 STRATEGIC ROADMAPLaunched in 2017  the Lectra 4.0 strategy aims to position the Group as a key Industry 4.0 player in its three strategic market sectors  fashion  automotive and furniture  before 2030. The strategy has been implemented up to now through three strategic roadmaps.The first strategic roadmap  which covered the 2017-2019 period  established the key fundamentals for the future of the Group.The second roadmap  which ran from 2020 through 2022  achieved a new dimension for the Group – primarily through the acquisition of Gerber in June 2021 – and opened new perspectives  with a financial position stronger than ever before  an extended worldwide presence  a broader customer base  a powerful product portfolio  a growing number of customers using its new offers for Industry 4.0  and a new brand image.For the 2023-2025 period  the Group intends to take full advantage of its change in dimension to accelerate growth  to significantly increase the volume of SaaS in its revenues  and to seize acquisition opportunities. With the commitment of employees  and recognition by customers  Lectra will be at the forefront in building a more sustainable future.The Group has set six strategic priorities for 2023-2025  which guided the actions led by Lectra in 2023:reinforce implementation of ethical  social  societal and environmental best practices both internally and for customers;leverage all synergies arising from the Gerber acquisition;accelerate the transition of software sales to the SaaS model;accelerate the transformation of the Group's customer relationship and customer engagement model;continue to pursue external growth;prepare Lectra for the 2026-2030 period.Details of the first progress report on this 2023-2025 strategic roadmap can be found in the December 31  2023 Management Discussion  available on Lectra.com.Financial objectivesIn February 2023  Lectra announced its ambition to achieve 2025 revenues of over 700 million euros (including 10% in SaaS revenues)  combining both organic growth and acquisitions  and an EBITDA margin before non-recurring items of over 20%.In light of the improved fundamentals of the Group’s business model and the acquisition of the majority of the capital of the company Launchmetrics  and despite a degraded environment  Lectra’s ambition now is to achieve 2025 revenues of over 600 million euros (including 90 million euros in SaaS revenues)  and an EBITDA margin before non-recurring items of over 20% (based on the closing exchange rates on December 29  2023  in particular $1.10/€1).4. DIVIDENDThe Board of Directors will propose to the Shareholders’ Meeting of April 26  2024  the payment of a dividend at €0.36 per share in respect of fiscal year 2023.5. OUTLOOKWhile the 2023 full-year results were affected by the adverse environment  they also attest to the substantial improvement in the fundamentals of the Group's business model  which will have a positive impact on 2024 results. Persistent macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties could nevertheless continue to weigh on investment decisions by the Group's customers.While the most recent indicators seem to suggest that the situation is unlikely to deteriorate further  the timing and magnitude of a rebound in new system orders remain uncertain.Outlook for 2024To facilitate analysis  the accounts of Lectra excluding the Launchmetrics acquisition (""Lectra 2023 Scope"") will be analysed separately from the Launchmetrics accounts in 2024.The Group has based its 2024 objectives on the exchange rates in effect on December 29  2023  in particular $1.10/€1. When converting 2023 results using the exchange rates retained for 2024  2023 revenues are mechanically reduced by 4.7 million euros (to 472.9 million euros) and 2023 EBITDA before non-recurring items is reduced by 2.2 million euros (to 76.8 million euros). Thus  for the Lectra 2023 Scope  the comparisons between 2024 and 2023 printed below are based on constant exchange rates.At this early stage of 2024  continuing low visibility regarding orders and revenues from new systems makes it impossible to predict the actual timing and scale of the future rebound in this area. On the other hand  visibility is high for recurring revenues  which accounted for 68% of total revenues in 2023 and will continue to grow in 2024.In light of the above  Lectra has set as its objective for 2024  for the Lectra 2023 Scope  to achieve revenues in the range of 480 to 530 million euros (+2% to +12%) and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 85 to 107 million euros (+10% to +40%).The low end of the revenues range is based on the absence of a rebound in new systems orders  which would remain stable in 2024 relative to 2023  with a 6% decline in revenues from perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software and non-recurring services  as the order backlog was lower on December 31  2023 than a year before.The high end of the revenues range reflects a gradual rebound in new systems orders  which at year-end 2024 would be back to year-end 2022 level.In addition  Launchmetrics revenues (for the consolidation period from January 23 to December 31) are projected to be in the range of 42 to 46 million euros  with an EBITDA margin before non-recurring items of more than 15% (assuming an exchange rate of $1.10/€1).Confidence in prospects for growth in the medium termBolstered by a robust business model and balance sheet  contributions from new products launched in recent years and others planned for the coming years  and by synergies achieved through the acquisitions of Gerber Technology  Neteven  Gemini CAD Systems  TextileGenesis and Launchmetrics  the Group is confident in its medium-term growth prospects.The Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and the financial statements for Q4 and the fiscal year 2023 are available on lectra.com. First quarter earnings for 2024 will be published on April 24  2024.

Persistent macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties could nevertheless continue to weigh on investment decisions by the Group's customers.While the most recent indicators seem to suggest that the situation is unlikely to deteriorate further  the timing and magnitude of a rebound in new system orders remain uncertain.Outlook for 2024To facilitate analysis  the accounts of Lectra excluding the Launchmetrics acquisition (""Lectra 2023 Scope"") will be analysed separately from the Launchmetrics accounts in 2024.The Group has based its 2024 objectives on the exchange rates in effect on December 29  2023  in particular $1.10/€1. When converting 2023 results using the exchange rates retained for 2024  2023 revenues are mechanically reduced by 4.7 million euros (to 472.9 million euros) and 2023 EBITDA before non-recurring items is reduced by 2.2 million euros (to 76.8 million euros). Thus  for the Lectra 2023 Scope  the comparisons between 2024 and 2023 printed below are based on constant exchange rates.At this early stage of 2024  continuing low visibility regarding orders and revenues from new systems makes it impossible to predict the actual timing and scale of the future rebound in this area. On the other hand  visibility is high for recurring revenues  which accounted for 68% of total revenues in 2023 and will continue to grow in 2024.In light of the above  Lectra has set as its objective for 2024  for the Lectra 2023 Scope  to achieve revenues in the range of 480 to 530 million euros (+2% to +12%) and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 85 to 107 million euros (+10% to +40%).The low end of the revenues range is based on the absence of a rebound in new systems orders  which would remain stable in 2024 relative to 2023  with a 6% decline in revenues from perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software and non-recurring services  as the order backlog was lower on December 31  2023 than a year before.The high end of the revenues range reflects a gradual rebound in new systems orders  which at year-end 2024 would be back to year-end 2022 level.In addition  Launchmetrics revenues (for the consolidation period from January 23 to December 31) are projected to be in the range of 42 to 46 million euros  with an EBITDA margin before non-recurring items of more than 15% (assuming an exchange rate of $1.10/€1).Confidence in prospects for growth in the medium termBolstered by a robust business model and balance sheet  contributions from new products launched in recent years and others planned for the coming years  and by synergies achieved through the acquisitions of Gerber Technology  Neteven  Gemini CAD Systems  TextileGenesis and Launchmetrics  the Group is confident in its medium-term growth prospects.The Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and the financial statements for Q4 and the fiscal year 2023 are available on lectra.com. First quarter earnings for 2024 will be published on April 24  2024. The Annual Shareholders' Meeting will take place on April 26  2024.As a major player in the fashion  automotive and furniture markets  Lectra contributes to the Industry 4.0 revolution with boldness and passion by providing best-in-class technologies.

On a like-for-like basis  organic growth2 was 1.2%  demonstrating the Group's ability to profit from its diversified and balanced positioning between its three activities in a mixed environment for the IT sector.In accordance with the One econocom 2024-2028 strategic plan announced last November  the French “Apps  Cloud & Data” and “Les Abeilles” activities have been restated as “Assets held for sale” in accordance with IFRS 5. These companies are expected to be sold in the near future; talks are under way with potential buyers. The 2022 income statement has been adjusted accordingly as explained in the notes to this press release.Over the period  trends in continuing operations were as follows:• Products & Solutions (P&S) revenue totalled €1 207 million  down1 by 2.5% in reported terms and by 6.1% organically2. The market4 for distribution of digital workplace assets was in poor shape in 2023 (estimated to have decreased in Europe by between -11% and -15% for PCs  between -14% and -19% for smartphones and tablets). Even so the Group managed to limit the decline in its activity thanks largely to its combined offers with its other business lines. 2022 had benefited from a strong rebound effect (with organic growth of just over 15%)  particularly in France  Germany and the United Kingdom  as the market recovered from post-Covid supply chain challenges. P&S operating margin3 accordingly was €43.3 million  an operating margin of 3.6%.• Technology Management & Financing (TMF) accelerated its growth with revenue of €998 million in 2023  an increase1 of 11.2%  including 10% organic growth2. TMF's solutions  offering personalised independent advice as well as a flexible contractual model  are particularly appreciated by customers in a context of tougher borrowing terms and increased pricing by banks. On the back of this revenue growth  particularly in Germany and Italy  the TMF operating margin3 rose1 strongly to €47.6 million  i.e. 4.8% of revenue compared to 3.3% in 2022.• In line with previous quarters  Services maintained momentum at the end of the year. With revenue of €476 million  growth1 was an annualised 4.6% (4.5% in organic terms2). In a context marked of rising staff and energy costs  the Group was better at passing through these inflationary effects in the second half of the year. Margin increased from 4.3% in the first half of 2023 to 5.3% for the full-year with an operating margin3 of €25.3 million.Total Group operating margin3  driven by the improvement of 1.5 points1 in margins at TMF  was €116.2 million compared to €114.2 million in 2022 restated.Annual net income from continuing operations was €59.5 million compared to €49.3 million in 2022  after:other net operating expenses of €8.4 million  down significantly compared to 2022 financial income of -€19.8 million  compared to -€13.5 million in 2022  impacted by the significant increase in interest rates  andtax expense of €26.1 million  representing an effective tax rate5 of 28.6%.After deducting the €3.1 million loss from discontinued operations  consolidated profit amounts to €62.6 million.Econocom's 2023 performance  in particular revenue  operating margin and net profit  are broadly in line with the starting key markers of the One econocom strategic plan  presented at the Capital Markets Day on 16 November 2023.Net financial debt6 limited to 1.2x EBITDA and operating cash surplus of €28 millionNet financial debt6 remains well controlled; it stands at €181 million at 31 December 2023  representing 38% of shareholders' equity and 1.2 times 2023 EBITDA.Operating cash surplus (after taking into account €209 million of discounted future cash receipts from TMF own booked leases at the end of 2023)  amounts to €28 million at 31 December 2023.Shareholder remunerationThe Board of Directors will propose at the next General Meeting to repay shareholders €0.16 per share from the share premium  unchanged vs. 2023. Based on the average closing share price over the last 20 days  this represents a yield of 6.8%.Total planned pay-outs in July 2024 would accordingly amount to €27.6 million  or 44.1% of 2023 net profit.OutlookIn an expected more favourable context  particularly for the IT equipment distribution markets (P&S)  the Group will continue in 2024 to roll out its One econocom plan  aimed at accelerating the organic growth of its business lines  strengthening synergies between the various business segments and developing its growth drivers in the audiovisual sector (launch of the Gather with Econocom brand). To achieve this  Econocom plans to significantly increase its sales force in the target regions and recruit new talent to strengthen the appeal and distribution of its offers.Given a controlled level of net debt and cash flow strengthened by the disposals planned during the year  Econocom will also continue its search for external growth targets in 2024 looking to acquire specific expertises.For 2024  the Group forecasts a total revenue growth between 3% and 5%.Beyond 2024 and over the timeframe of its strategic plan to reach €4 billion in revenue and €130 million in net profit by 2028  Econocom will seek to capitalise on:strong growth expected in the workplace  audiovisual  infrastructure and network markets  growth partly driven by the investments made necessary by the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence;an acceleration of the deployment of Econocom's offers covering end-to-end customer needs in terms of digital assets;a clear roadmap with ambitious objectives that can get all teams onboard;a self-financing plan with a now well-advanced disposal programme that will enable the Group to execute its strategic plan  including external growth.Econocom has also built its 2024-2028 strategic plan around strong ambitions in terms of extra-financial performance  with a particular focus on the repairability and extending the life of its customers' digital assets  carbon footprint and strengthening equal opportunities for all employees. Econocom thus confirms that it is aiming to achieve the Platinum level of the Ecovadis® Sustainability Rating by 2028.Information meeting on the full-year 2023 results in Brussels on 15 February 20241 For continuing operations  at constant accounting standards.2 For continuing operations  at constant scope and accounting standards  including organic growth of acquired companies.3 Going forward  the term “operating margin” will replace the term “recurring operating profit”.4 Context study for the period 2023/2022.5 Effective income tax rate (excluding CVAE and IRAP).6 Net financial debt including current and non-current financial debt excluding debt resulting from the application of IFRS 16 to leases (premises  vehicles  etc.) for which Econocom is lessee and all assets and liabilities held for sale.ABOUT ECONOCOMThe Econocom Group  created 50 years ago  is a pioneer in supporting the digital transformation of companies.

This performance once again reinforces the strength and resilience of our business model. Results  fully in line with our upgraded guidance  were driven both by supportive electrification trends  which grew at four times the pace of traditional electric distribution sales  and by the excellent execution of our action plans. I am proud of these results and wish to thank our teams in all our geographies. It is their hard work  dedication and commitment that have made Rexel a more agile  more digital and more profitable company. Rexel’s enhanced resilience allows us to target an Adjusted Ebita margin of between 6.3% and 6.6% in 2024  even in a more mixed environment.

Cables accounted for approximately 15% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group’s sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group’s total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

HEINEKEN does this to future-proof and deliver superior  balanced growth in a fast-changing world  with an ambition to become the best digitally connected brewer  raise the bar on sustainability and responsibility and evolve HEINEKEN's operating model  capabilities and culture. HEINEKEN also focuses on productivity to fund the investments required and progressively improve profitability and capital efficiency.Over time  HEINEKEN aims for a healthy balance between volume and value growth  achieved by building and scaling premium and strategic core mainstream brands everywhere  innovating in fast-growing consumer segments and further developing HEINEKEN's geographic and portfolio footprint. This year  HEINEKEN had to prioritise pricing to offset unprecedented levels of commodity and energy inflation  often leading the market  which impacted consumer off-take. During the second half  HEINEKEN saw pricing moderate and volume trends sequentially improve in the majority of HEINEKEN's markets.Revenue for the full year was €36.4 billion (2022: €34.7 billion) a total increase of 4.9%. Net revenue (beia) increased by 5.5% organically  with net revenue (beia) per hectolitre up 10.8% and total consolidated volume declining by 4.7%. The underlying price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 10.2%  driven by pricing for inflation and positive mix effects. Currency translation negatively impacted net revenue (beia) by €864 million or 3.0%  mainly from the devaluation of currencies in emerging markets partially offset by a stronger Mexican Peso. Consolidation effects positively impacted net revenue (beia) by €887 million or 3.1%  mainly from the consolidation of Distell and Namibia Breweries.Beer volume declined 4.7% organically for the full year. Vietnam and Nigeria represented over 60% of the decline  with both markets affected by challenging economic conditions. HEINEKEN gained or held volume market share in more than half of HEINEKEN's markets in 2023.Beer volume 4Q23 Organicgrowth FY23 Organicgrowth (in mhl) 4Q22 FY22 Heineken N.V. 59.4 63.3 -3.2% 242.6 256.9 -4.7%In the fourth quarter  net revenue (beia) grew organically by 4.8%. Total consolidated volume declined by 3.2%  improving sequentially relative to the third quarter. Beer volume declined organically by 3.2%  driven by declines in Asia Pacific  Africa and Europe  partially offset by modest volume growth in the Americas. HEINEKEN's exit volume momentum was a low-single-digit decline adjusted for the pre-Tet season trade loading at the end of 2022 that led to an overstock in the first quarter of 2023. More than half of HEINEKEN's markets grew volume in the last quarter. Net revenue (beia) per hectolitre was up 8.2% organically with price-mix on a constant geographic basis up 7.6%  driven by pricing and positive mix effects.Premium beer volume declined by 5.9% organically  mainly driven by Vietnam and HEINEKEN's exit from Russia. Outside of these markets premium beer grew by 1.1%  outperforming the total portfolio in the majority of HEINEKEN's markets. This growth is led by Heineken®  complemented by HEINEKEN's international and local premium brands including El Aguila  Birra Moretti  Kingfisher Ultra and Bedele Special.Heineken® continued to lead our portfolio and grew volume by 2.5% versus last year (3.4% excluding Russia). Growth was broad-based across 39 markets  most notably in China  Brazil  Ethiopia  Indonesia and Taiwan. Heineken® Silver is now present in 50 markets with a volume growth in the high thirties  led by China  Vietnam and the USA.Heineken® volume 4Q23 Organicgrowth FY23 Organicgrowth (in mhl) Total 15.4 4.0% 56.3 2.5%Outlook 2024As HEINEKEN continues to advance on HEINEKEN's EverGreen journey  HEINEKEN remains committed to its medium-term ambition to deliver superior growth  balanced between volume and value  and to drive continuous productivity improvements to fund investments behind EverGreen and enable operating profit (beia) to grow ahead of net revenue (beia) over time.HEINEKEN's volume performance at the closing of 2023 was under pressure from external factors  with a moderate sequential improvement quarter by quarter. For 2024  HEINEKEN expects the macroeconomic environment and geopolitical developments to remain a factor of uncertainty that may impact HEINEKEN's business. In this context  HEINEKEN's focus going forward will be on restoring its volume growth by continuing to invest behind its brands  innovations  commercial capabilities and route-to-consumer.HEINEKEN expects its variable costs to increase by a low-single-digit on a per hectolitre basis  benefitting from lower commodity and energy prices  but more than offset by local input cost inflation and currency devaluations  particularly in Africa. HEINEKEN also expects higher than historical average wage inflation to impact its cost base.HEINEKEN's continuous productivity programme will deliver at least €500 million of gross savings in 2024  ahead of HEINEKEN's medium term commitment of €400 million for the near-term  enabling investments behind HEINEKEN's growth agenda  its digital transformation  strategic capabilities and HEINEKEN's Brew a Better World activities.Overall  HEINEKEN expects to grow operating profit (beia) organically in the range of a low- to high-single-digit. The wide range corresponds to the volatility in geo-political and economic conditions HEINEKEN has also witnessed in the past months and the fact that HEINEKEN will continue to invest behind EverGreen for long-term sustained value creation.HEINEKEN also expects:An average effective interest rate (beia) of around 3.5% (2023: 3.4%)Other net finance expenses to further increase  mainly due to the impact from significant devaluations and the scarcity of hard currency in some key emerging markets  like HEINEKEN is experiencing currently in NigeriaAn increase in HEINEKEN's effective tax rate (beia) to around 29%  mainly driven by changes in tax laws in Brazil (2023: 26.8%).The factors above result in a net profit (beia) organic growth that is lower than the operating profit (beia) organic growth.Finally  HEINEKEN expects investments in capital expenditure related to property  plant and equipment and intangible assets to be below 9% of net revenue (beia) (2023: 8.8%)Total Dividend For 2023The Heineken N.V. dividend policy is to pay a ratio of 30% to 40% of full year net profit (beia). For 2023  a total cash dividend of €1.73 per share  a similar amount to last year (2022: €1.73)  representing a payout ratio of 36.8%  within the range of Heineken N.V.'s policy  will be proposed to the Heineken N.V. Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2024. If approved  a final dividend of €1.04 per share will be paid on 7 May 2024  as an interim dividend of €0.69 per share was paid on 10 August 2023.If Heineken N.V. shareholders approve the proposed dividend  Heineken Holding N.V. will  according to its Articles of Association  pay an identical dividend per share. A final dividend of €1.04 per share of €1.60 nominal value will be payable as of 7 May 2024.Both the Heineken Holding N.V. shares and the Heineken N.V. shares will trade ex-dividend on 29 April 2024. The dividend payment will be subject to a 15% Dutch withholding tax.Translational Calculated Currency ImpactThe translational currency impact for 2023 was negative on net revenue (beia) by €864 million and on operating profit (beia) by €102 million and positive on net profit beia by €6 million.Applying spot rates as of 12 February 2024 to the 2023 financial results as a base  the calculated currency translational impact would be negative  approximately €440 million in net revenue (beia)  €60 million at operating profit (beia)  and positive by €40 million at net profit (beia).Board of Directors CompositionMr J.F.M.L. van Boxmeer will have completed his four-year appointment term upon conclusion of the Heineken Holding N.V.

Our results illustrate the strength of our positioning  our agility and our resilience.Our clients recognize the value we bring as their business and technology transformation partner. In 2023  the Group continued to invest in building the capabilities and solutions to help them transition to an increasingly digital and sustainable economy.This was notably the case for generative AI  which is top of mind for all large organizations. We are positioned as a leading player enabling our clients to explore  test and scale solutions for tangible business impact. Through our €2 billion investment plan announced last July  we continue to strengthen and upskill our teams  invest in solutions and leverage a broad ecosystem of technology partners including Microsoft  Google  AWS  Salesforce and Mistral AI.In terms of sustainability offerings  we also stepped up our efforts in 2023. We continue to help our clients accelerate their transition towards Net Zero through strategy definition  business model adaptation and design of sustainable products and services. 2023 was also an important year on our own ESG roadmap  with major progress achieved towards a more sustainable and inclusive world.The Group is well-equipped to improve its performance in 2024  while the environment is expected to remain soft in the first half. This year again  the Group expects to grow  with the trough in Q1  improve its operating margin and maintain a superior free cash flow conversion.”KEY FIGURES(in millions of euros) 2022 2023 Change Revenues 21 995 22 522 +2.4% Operating margin* 2 867 2 991 +4% as a % of revenues 13.0% 13.3% +30 basis points Operating profit 2 393 2 346 -2% as a % of revenues 10.9% 10.4% Net profit (Group share) 1 547 1 663 +7% Basic earnings per share (€) 9.09 9.70 +7% Normalized earnings per share (€)* 11.52 a 12.44 +8% Organic free cash flow* 1 852 1 963 +€ 111m Net cash / (Net debt)* (2 566) (2 047) a excluding tax expenses of €73 million in 2022 related to the impact of the US tax reformCapgemini delivered a solid performance in 2023 despite the weak economic environment  with results exceeding or in line with its financial targets for the year.After two years of record growth  persisting macroeconomic challenges and rising geopolitical tensions led to a gradual market slowdown in 2023 that came in line with Group expectations. Capgemini reported revenues of €22 522 million in 2023  up +2.4% vs. 2022 published figures. Constant currency growth* was +4.4%  within the 2023 target range of +4% to +7%. With acquisitions contributing +0.5 points to growth  organic growth* (i.e.  excluding the impact of currency fluctuations and changes in Group scope) reached +3.9%.Bookings totaled €23 887 million in 2023  a year-on-year increase of +2.6% at constant exchange rates  representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.06 for the year  and 1.18 in Q4. This reflects sustained commercial momentum despite lengthened decision cycles.While large corporations and organizations hold firm on their digital and sustainability ambitions  they are increasingly prioritizing operational agility and cost efficiency. This translates into strong demand for transformation programs with short payback  which leverage the Group’s high value-added service offerings most notably in Intelligent Industry  as well as in activities driven by Cloud  Data & Artificial Intelligence.This ongoing shift in Capgemini’s offerings portfolio towards more value creating services  combined with strengthened operational efficiency  generated a 40 basis points increase in gross margin  despite the rising inflation and market slowdown.As a result  the operating margin* increased to 13.3% of revenues  or €2 991 million  up +4% in value compared to 2022. This year-on-year improvement of 30 basis points exceeds the target of 0-20 basis points set for 2023.Other operating income and expense was a net expense of €645 million  compared with €474 million in 2022. This increase is mainly attributable to higher restructuring charges  which increased by €97 million  and to a change in French accounting practices as set by the French National Accounting Council (ANC)  which resulted in an additional €63 million non-cash expense related to the annual employee share ownership plan.Capgemini’s operating profit was €2 346 million  or 10.4% of revenues  compared with €2 393 million in 2022.The net financial expense was €42 million compared with €129 million in 2022  this evolution being mainly driven by higher interest income in a context of rising interest rates.The income tax expense was €626 million compared with €710 million last year. The effective tax rate was slightly down at 27.2%  compared with 28.1% in 2022 (excluding €73 million tax expenses related to the impact of the US tax reform).Taking into account the share of profits of associates and non-controlling interests  the Group share in net profit rose by +7% year-on-year to €1 663 million. Basic earnings per share increased also by +7% to €9.70. Normalized earnings per share* was €12.44  compared with €11.09 in 2022 and €11.52 excluding the tax expenses related to the impact of the US tax reform.Organic free cash flow* amounted to €1 963 million  above the target of “around €1.8 billion” set for the year. Capgemini invested €343 million in acquisitions during the past year. The Group also paid dividends of €559 million (€3.25 per share) and allocated €883 million (net) to share buyback programs. Finally  the 10th employee share ownership plan  which proved highly successful and thus contributed to maintaining employee shareholding between 8 to 9% of the share capital  led to a gross capital increase of €467 million.The Board of Directors has decided to recommend the payment of a dividend of €3.40 per share at the Shareholders’ Meeting of May 16  2024. The corresponding payout ratio is 35% of net profit (Group share)  in line with the Group’s historical distribution policy.OPERATIONS BY REGIONAt constant exchange rates  the United Kingdom and Ireland region (12% of Group revenues) maintained a robust momentum in 2023 with revenues growing +7.9%. This performance was primarily driven by the Public Sector as well as the Consumer Goods & Retail and Manufacturing sectors  while activities in the Financial Services and TMT sectors were roughly stable year-on-year. The operating margin reached a record level of 18.6% compared with 18.0% in 2022.The Rest of Europe region (30% of Group revenues) also performed well with revenue growth of +7.6% fueled to a large extent by the Public Sector and the Manufacturing sector. The Energy & Utilities sector was also buoyant while growth in Financial Services was limited. The operating margin was 11.7%  up from 11.6% a year earlier.France (20% of Group revenues) revenues grew +6.1%  mainly supported by strong growth in the Manufacturing and Consumer Goods & Retail sectors. TMT was the only sector to contract in 2023. The operating margin further improved by 50 basis points year-on-year to 12.6%.Conversely  revenues in North America (29% of Group revenues) decreased slightly by -1.3%. The Manufacturing and Services sectors showed good growth. Revenue decline was particularly visible in the TMT and Consumer Goods & Retail sectors  but more limited in the Financial Services sector. The operating margin was 15.6% as in 2022.Finally  revenues in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America region (9% of Group revenues) grew +4.6%. Growth was mostly driven by the Asia-Pacific region where Consumer Goods & Retail  Services  Manufacturing and the Public Sector enjoyed double-digit growth rates  whereas Financial Services remained virtually stable  and TMT contracted visibly. The operating margin improved substantially to 12.2% compared with 10.6% the year before.OPERATIONS BY BUSINESSAt constant exchange rates  Strategy & Transformation consulting services (9% of Group revenues) reported a +8.6% growth in total revenues* in 2023. This sustained momentum illustrates the strength of the Group's strategic positioning as a partner for its clients' digital and sustainable ambitions.Applications & Technology services (62% of Group revenues and Capgemini’s core business) reported a +4.5% increase in total revenues.Finally  Operations & Engineering services total revenues (29% of Group revenues) grew +2.8%.OPERATIONS IN Q4 2023As expected  the progressive deceleration in Capgemini revenue growth observed since the beginning of the year continued in Q4. Group revenues totaled €5 616 million  virtually stable at -0.2% at constant exchange rates  and -0.9% when adjusted for Group scope and exchange rate impacts.At constant exchange rates  revenues in the United Kingdom and Ireland region grew +2.7% at constant exchange rates  underpinned by fairly broad-based growth but weighed down by sizeable contraction in the Financial Services and TMT sectors. Revenue growth in the Rest of Europe region  which also stood at +2.7%  was driven by solid momentum in the Energy & Utilities and Public sectors. In France  the Manufacturing and Energy & Utilities sectors fueled revenue growth of +2.5%. With revenues down by -6.6% year-on-year  the deceleration in North America compared to Q3 growth rates (-4.0% year-on-year) was in line with Group average  with the largest revenue declines in the Consumer Goods & Retail and TMT sectors. Finally  revenues in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America region grew by +1.1% despite the visible decline in the Financial Services and TMT sectors  thanks to solid growth in most of the other sectors.Bookings rose +1.7% in Q4 at constant exchange rates to reach €6 643 million  corresponding to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18.HEADCOUNTAt December 31  2023  the Group’s total headcount stood at 340 400  down by 5% year-on-year.The onshore workforce decreased slightly at 145 800 employees  down by 2% year-on-year  while the offshore workforce was down by 7% to 194 600 employees  i.e.  57% of the total headcount.BALANCE SHEETCapgemini continued to strengthen its financial structure in 2023 on the back of its strong cash flow generation.At December 31  2023  the Group had cash  cash equivalents and cash management assets of €3.7 billion. After accounting for borrowings of €5.7 billion and derivative instruments  Group net debt* is €2.0 billion  down compared with €2.6 billion at December 31  2022.CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITYIn line with the commitments of its ESG (Environment  Social and Governance) Policy presented in December 2021  Capgemini continued to deliver visible progress on the front of corporate sustainability in 2023.Firstly  the Group further strengthened its position as a leader committed to fostering diversity and inclusion in various dimensions. On gender diversity specifically  the proportion of women in the total workforce reached 38.8% at the end of 2023  up by 1 point year-on-year and almost 6 points since 2019. The proportion of women among executive leadership positions reached 26.2%  up by 1.8 points year-on-year and more than 9 points since 2019.In human capital development  the Group provided 17.8 million learning hours to employees during the past year  compared with 17.4 million in 2022. The average number of learning hours per employee stands at 53.8 hours  up +5% year-on-year in line with the Group’s commitment.The scale of impact through digital inclusion initiatives expanded significantly in 2023. Among the largest projects in terms of new beneficiaries  the Pi Lab program provides an easily accessible technology platform to equip Indian teachers and students with digital skills. Overall  Capgemini’s various programs and partnerships with leading non-profit organizations benefited almost 2.5 million individuals in 2023  bringing the cumulative number of beneficiaries to 4.4 million since 2018.Regarding environmental sustainability  as a reminder  Capgemini set in 2022 ambitious near-term (2030) and long-term (2040) carbon footprint targets. These targets imply notably a 90% reduction in all emissions (Scope 1  2 and 3) by 2040 to reach its “net zero emissions” targets as validated by the SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative). At the end of 2023  the Group’s absolute carbon emissions (Scope 1  2 and 3) have fallen by 30% against the 2019 baseline. As regards its carbon neutrality target for own operations by 2025  Capgemini’s operational carbon emissions2F2 have decreased by 47% since 2019  and by 75% net of high-quality carbon credits. Among other tangible progress achieved in 2023  the share of renewable energies in the Group’s electricity consumption reached 96% compared with 88% in 2022.In recognition of its continued ESG performance  the Group’s inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) Europe was confirmed at the end of the year. Capgemini also maintained its position on the “A list” in the 2023 CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) assessment  as released in early February 2024.OUTLOOKThe Group’s financial targets for 2024 are:Revenue growth of 0% to +3% at constant currency;Operating margin of 13.3% to 13.6%;Organic free cash flow of around €1.9 billion.The inorganic contribution to growth should be marginal at the lower end of the target range  and up to 1 point at the upper end.CONFERENCE CALLAiman Ezzat  Chief Executive Officer  accompanied by Nive Bhagat  Chief Financial Officer  and Olivier Sevillia  Chief Operating Officer  will comment on this publication during a conference call in English to be held today at 8.00 a.m. Paris time (CET).

The Group scope and exchange rates used are those for the reported period. Exchange rates for the reported period are also used to calculate growth at constant exchange rates.Reconciliation of growth rates Q12023 Q22023 Q32023 Q42023 FY2023 Organic growth +10.1% +4.7% +2.0% -0.9% +3.9% Changes in Group scope +0.6 pts +0.5 pts +0.3 pts +0.7 pts +0.5 pts Growth at constant exchange rates +10.7% +5.2% +2.3% -0.2% +4.4% Exchange rate fluctuations +0.2 pts -2.0 pts -3.6 pts -2.2 pts -2.0 pts Reported growth +10.9% +3.2% -1.3% -2.4% +2.4%When determining activity trends by business and in accordance with internal operating performance measures  growth at constant exchange rates is calculated based on total revenues  i.e.  before elimination of inter-business billing. The Group considers this to be more representative of activity levels by business. As its businesses change  an increasing number of contracts require a range of business expertise for delivery  leading to a rise in inter-business flows.Operating margin is one of the Group’s key performance indicators. It is defined as the difference between revenues and operating costs. It is calculated before “Other operating income and expense” which include amortization of intangible assets recognized in business combinations  expenses relative to share-based compensation (including social security contributions and employer contributions) and employee share ownership plan  and non-recurring revenues and expenses  notably impairment of goodwill  negative goodwill  capital gains or losses on disposals of consolidated companies or businesses  restructuring costs incurred under a detailed formal plan approved by the Group’s management  the cost of acquiring and integrating companies acquired by the Group  including earn-outs comprising conditions of presence  and the effects of curtailments  settlements and transfers of defined benefit pension plans.Normalized net profit is equal to profit for the year (Group share) adjusted for the impact of items recognized in “Other operating income and expense”  net of tax calculated using the effective tax rate. Normalized earnings per share is computed like basic earnings per share  i.e.  excluding dilution.Organic free cash flow is equal to cash flow from operations less acquisitions of property  plant  equipment and intangible assets (net of disposals) and repayments of lease liabilities  adjusted for cash out relating to the net interest cost.Net debt (or net cash) comprises (i) cash and cash equivalents  as presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (consisting of short-term investments and cash at bank) less bank overdrafts  and also including (ii) cash management assets (assets presented separately in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position due to their characteristics)  less (iii) short- and long-term borrowings. Account is also taken of (iv) the impact of hedging instruments when these relate to borrowings  intercompany loans  and own shares.RESULTS BY REGIONRevenues Year-on-year growth Operating margin rate 2023(in millions of euros) reportedat constant exchange rates 2022 2023 North America 6 462 -4.1% -1.3% 15.6% 15.6% United Kingdom and Ireland 2 709 +5.8% +7.9% 18.0% 18.6% France 4 537 +6.1% +6.1% 12.1% 12.6% Rest of Europe 6 837 +6.2% +7.6% 11.6% 11.7% Asia-Pacific and Latin America 1 977 -0.4% +4.6% 10.6% 12.2% TOTAL 22 522 +2.4% +4.4% 13.0% 13.3%RESULTS BY BUSINESSTotal revenues* Year-on-year growth 2023(% of Group revenues) At constant exchange rates in Total revenues* of the business Strategy & Transformation 9% +8.6% Applications & Technology 62% +4.5% Operations & Engineering 29% +2.8%SUMMARY INCOME STATEMENT AND OPERATING MARGIN(in millions of euros) 2022 2023 Change Revenues 21 995 22 522 +2.4% Operating expenses (19 128) (19 531) Operating margin 2 867 2 991 +4% as a % of revenues 13.0% 13.3% Other operating income and expense (474) (645) Operating profit 2 393 2 346 -2% as a % of revenues 10.9% 10.4% Net financial expense (129) (42) Income tax income/(expense) (710) (626) Share of profit of associates (4) (10) (-) Non-controlling interests (3) (5) Profit for the period  Group share 1 547 1 663 +7%NORMALIZED AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE(in millions of euros) 2022 2023 Change Average number of shares outstanding 170 251 066 171 350 138 BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE (in euros) 9.09 9.70 +7% Diluted average number of shares outstanding 176 019 736 177 396 346 DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (in euros) 8.79 9.37 +7% (in millions of euros) 2022 2023 Change Profit for the period  Group share 1 547 1 663 +7% Effective tax rate 28.1% 27.2% (-) Other operating income and expense  net of tax 340 469 Normalized profit for the period 1 887 2 132 +13% Average number of shares outstanding 170 251 066 171 350 138 NORMALIZED EARNINGS PER SHARE (in euros) 11.09 12.44 +12%In 2022  the Group recorded a tax expense of €73 million related to the impact of the US tax reform.

Euronext successfully expanded Euronext Clearing as the pan-European clearing house for Euronext cash markets. Following the expansion of clearing activities to Euronext Brussels cash markets on 6 November 2023  Euronext expanded its clearing offering  on schedule  to the cash markets in France  Ireland  the Netherlands  and Portugal on 27 November 2023. Euronext Clearing now clears equities  ETFs  structured products  warrants  and bonds across six Euronext markets. The implementation of harmonised clearing allows market participants to streamline their entire trade lifecycle within Euronext and to leverage on Euronext Securities to access T2S. Euronext is well on track for the delivery of the last major milestones of the ""Growth for Impact 2024"" strategic plan in 2024. The migration of Italian derivatives trading to Optiq ® in Q1 2024 and the expansion of Euronext Clearing to Euronext listed financial and commodities derivatives by Q3 2024 will significantly contribute to reaching the targeted €115 million synergies by end of 2024.Dividend proposal:A dividend of €256.8 million will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2024. This represents 50% of 2023 reported net income  in line with Euronext's dividend policy. Based on the number of outstanding shares at the end of 2023  this represents a dividend of €2.48 per share  up +11.7% compared to 2022.Cost guidance for 2024:In 2023  underlying expenses excluding D&A were positively impacted by a one-off accruals release of €6.3 million and by a positive impact of €11.4 million from the NOK depreciation. Consequently  Euronext reported €610.0 million underlying expenses excluding D&A in 2023  compared to an initial guidance of €630 million.In 2024  Euronext will continue its costs control policy and expects that savings and synergies will offset inflation and 2023 costs ramp-up. As a result  Euronext expects its 2024 underlying expenses excluding D&A to be around €625 million  including around €10 million to finance growth projects and excluding potential impact from FX over the year.Continued innovation in trading with the launch of Euronext Mid-Point MatchFollowing the successful opening of the test environment for Euronext's new dark trading facility at the end of January 2024  Euronext confirms the launch of Dark  Mid-Point and Sweep functionalities in Q1 20245. The whole Euronext ecosystem of trading members  local brokers  market makers and global banks  will benefit from zero latency in pegging to Euronext midpoint  and zero latency for sweeping from dark to lit on Euronext stocks.Stéphane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:""In 2023  Euronext reached record revenue and income close to €1.5 billion. Robust organic growth in our non-volume related businesses and double-digit growth in fixed income and power trading drove Group revenue's growth to +3.9%  despite negative FX impacts and the softer cash trading environment. Despite an inflationary environment  Euronext was able to finance growth projects and to beat its revised cost guidance. This was allowed by our trademark cost discipline  FX impacts and a one-off release. We reached an adjusted EBITDA of €864.7 million  which translated into an adjusted EBITDA margin of 58.6%. Our strong operating performance  combined with around €56 million of capital gains  allowed our net reported profit to grow double-digit to €513.6 million  and our adjusted EPS to increase by +5.9% to €5.51. In line with our dividend policy  we will propose a total dividend of €256.8 million  representing 50% of our reported net income  at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2024. Our strong cash generation capabilities have enabled us to already return €200 million of capital to our shareholders through the share repurchase programme implemented during the second half of 2023. We continued our deleveraging path as we reached a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.9x at the end of 2023  down from 3.2x post acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.We have made great progress with the delivery of our 'Growth for Impact 2024' strategic plan. We have expanded Euronext Clearing as a pan-European clearing house for the clearing of cash products. This new harmonised post-trade set-up allows clients to execute their entire trading lifecycle through Euronext.These strategic milestones have materially contributed to the €74 million cumulated run-rate EBITDA synergies delivered by the end of 2023  ahead of the €70 million interim guidance.The migration of Borsa Italiana's derivatives to Optiq in Q1 2024 and the expansion of Euronext Clearing to Euronext listed derivatives by Q3 2024 will complete our presence on the entire trading value chain and will position Euronext ideally to capture future growth opportunities.As we celebrate the 10 year anniversary of our IPO in 2024  I am looking forward to deep-dive into the opportunities that this transformation will offer for Euronext in the coming years at our Investors Day in November 2024.""2023 financial performanceIn €m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

Consequently  costs previously reported as exceptional items have from Q1 2023 been included in their respective lines within Euronext operating expenses as non-recurring items.The €150 million of implementation costs to deliver on the 'Growth for Impact 2024' strategic plan targets are therefore considered as non-recurring items and have been withdrawn from the underlying recurring costs.The computation of adjusted net income and earnings per share has been adjusted accordingly. The computation of reported net income and earnings per share is not impacted.2024 strategic plan targets remain unchanged and are not affected by this change in reporting.The new non-IFRS indicators are defined below.Non-IFRS financial measuresFor comparative purposes  the company provides unaudited non-IFRS measures including:Operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA  EBITDA margin  adjusted EBITDA  adjusted EBITDA margin.Non-IFRS measures are defined as follows:Operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation as the total of salary and employee benefits  and other operational expenses;Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation as the total of salary and employee benefits  and other operational expenses  excluding non-recurring costs;Underlying revenue and income as the total of revenue and income  excluding non-recurring revenue and income;Non-underlying items as items of revenue  income and expense that are material by their size and/or that are infrequent and unusual by their nature or incidence are not considered to be recurring in the normal course of business and are classified as non-underlying items on the face of the income statement within their relevant category in order to provide further understanding of the ongoing sustainable performance of the Group. These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable IFRS measures and should be read only in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.Non-volume related revenue definitionNon-volume related revenue includes Listing excl.

Feb. 15  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vantiva (Euronext Paris: VANTI)  a global supply chain leader that helps clients solve complex  end-to-end logistics challenges  chose Softeon   the only tier-1 warehouse management system (WMS) provider focused on optimizing warehouse and fulfillment performance to increase operational efficiency  resulting in faster new customer onboarding and fulfillment times.For over 100 years  Vantiva  formerly Technicolor   has been the film and entertainment leader. Now with decades of experience leading the supply chain industry in high-precision manufacturing  logistics  fulfillment and distribution for game publishers  music labels  software developers  and book publishers  Vantiva’s service expansion to include many more markets and customers required a platform that could meet increasing consumer demand.""As we diversified our service model  now working with companies that need direct-to-consumer fulfillment  Vantiva needed a WMS with more flexibility to do more than fulfill huge business-to-business orders for retail  for example ” said Fred Holmes  Director of Information Technology  Vantiva. “What we found was that our tools that we built into our legacy systems did not really line up with the tools needed to complete high volume  smaller orders versus one order with a huge volume. It's different processes on the floor. It's totally different.”Needing faster onboarding of new customers and fulfillment capabilities for business-to-business (B2B) and direct-to-consumer (D2C) channels  Vantiva turned to Softeon for a more flexible  composable  scalable  and efficient WMS to fulfill sales orders for so many new clients. Unlike legacy systems Vantiva previously leveraged to fulfill orders for most of its customers  Softeon’s WMS enhanced operational efficiency  expanded integration capabilities  provided real-time visibility data insights  and improved inventory accuracy.Story continues“I don’t think we would have been as successful with getting our customers on the system if we went with a different provider ” said Holmes.From start to finish the WMS deployment time was three months or less  including Vantiva’s initial user acceptance testing (UAT) and then the UATs for each of Vantiva’s clients transitioning to Softeon’s platform.“Softeon is honored to provide limitless warehouse management solutions and around-the-clock customer support for Vantiva and other customers with highly automated warehouses globally ” said Jim Hoefflin  CEO of Softeon. “The service we’ve been able to provide for Vantiva since 2019 is an example of Softeon’s commitment to delivering limitless customer-centric solutions that propel businesses as their warehousing and fulfillment needs diversify and become more complex.""Softeon is committed to providing forward-looking software solutions to help companies worldwide scale successfully.

This was partly offset by lower settlement volumes and the negative FX impact. Like-for-like at constant currencies  revenue was up +5.5%; Listing revenue grew to €220.6 million (+1.0%)  thanks to the continued expansion of the Corporate Services offering. In 2023  Euronext remained the leading venue for equity listing in Europe  recording 64 new equity listings  and the leading venue for debt listing globally. Listing performance was negatively impacted by FX impact. Like-for-like at constant currencies  revenue was up +3.2%.Story continuesClearing revenue was stable year-on-year at €121.3 million  thanks to the additional business captured by Euronext Clearing following its expansion for equities on 27 November 2023 and dynamic bond clearing  that offset softer equity and derivatives clearing volumes. Net treasury income for Euronext Clearing was €46.7 million (+6.0% compared to 2022 underlying net treasury income 1 ).Trading revenue was €490.0 million (-4.7%)  reflecting the softer environment for cash trading (€265.4 million  -12.0%) and derivatives trading (€54.2 million  -7.2%) offset by record results in fixed income (€107.4 million  +15.6%) and power trading (€37.4 million  +14.5%).Underlying operating expenses excluding D&A 2 were €610.0 million (+0.6%)   better than guided at €618 million (revised from €630 million 3 due to FX impact) thanks to continued cost control  and a one-off accruals release of €6.3 million.Adjusted EBITDA 2 was €864.7 million (+0.4%) and adjusted EBITDA margin was 58.6% (-0.1 pts).Adjusted net income 2 was €584.7 million (+5.3%) and adjusted EPS was €5.51 (+5.9%).Reported net income was €513.6 million (+17.3%)  reflecting €53.0 million of capital gains  positive interest rates environment and positive comparison base in 2022.Net debt to reported EBITDA was at 2.0x at the end of 2023 and net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 1.9x .Key figures for full year 2023:In €m  unless stated otherwise 2023 2022 % var % var l-f-l4 Revenue and income 1 474.7 1 418.8 +3.9% +1.6% Underlying revenue and income1 1 474.7 1 467.8 +0.5% Underlying operational expenses excluding D&A2 (610.0) (606.1) +0.6% +3.3% Adjusted EBITDA 864.7 861.6 +0.4% +0.4% Adjusted EBITDA margin 58.6% 58.7% -0.1pts -0.7pts Net income  share of the parent company shareholders 513.6 437.8 +17.3% Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders 584.7 555.3 +5.3% Adjusted EPS (basic  in€) (share count differs between the two periods) 5.51 5.21 +5.9% Reported EPS (basic  in€) (share count differs between the two periods) 4.84 4.10 +18.0% Adjusted EPS (diluted  in€) (share count differs between the two periods) 5.50 5.19 +5.8% Reported EPS (diluted  in€) (share count differs between the two periods) 4.83 4.10 +17.9%Great progress with Borsa Italiana Group integration leads to accelerated synergies delivery: €74 million of cumulated run-rate annual EBITDA synergies were achieved at end of 2023  above the €70 million interim target. €26 million run-rate annual EBITDA synergies were delivered in Q4 2023  mainly related to the first phase of the Euronext Clearing European expansion to equity clearing. €103 million cumulated implementation costs were incurred since the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group  of which €8 million were incurred during Q4 2023 . Euronext successfully expanded Euronext Clearing as the pan-European clearing house for Euronext cash markets. Following the expansion of clearing activities to Euronext Brussels cash markets on 6 November 2023  Euronext expanded its clearing offering  on schedule  to the cash markets in France  Ireland  the Netherlands  and Portugal on 27 November 2023. Euronext Clearing now clears equities  ETFs  structured products  warrants  and bonds across six Euronext markets. The implementation of harmonised clearing allows market participants to streamline their entire trade lifecycle within Euronext and to leverage on Euronext Securities to access T2S. Euronext is well on track for the delivery of the last major milestones of the “Growth for Impact 2024” strategic plan in 2024. The migration of Italian derivatives trading to Optiq ® in Q1 2024 and the expansion of Euronext Clearing to Euronext listed financial and commodities derivatives by Q3 2024 will significantly contribute to reaching the targeted €115 million synergies by end of 2024.Dividend proposal:A dividend of €256.8 million will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2024. This represents 50% of 2023 reported net income  in line with Euronext’s dividend policy. Based on the number of outstanding shares at the end of 2023  this represents a dividend of €2.48 per share  up +11.7% compared to 2022.Cost guidance for 2024:In 2023  underlying expenses excluding D&A were positively impacted by a one-off accruals release of €6.3 million and by a positive impact of €11.4 million from the NOK depreciation. Consequently  Euronext reported €610.0 million underlying expenses excluding D&A in 2023  compared to an initial guidance of €630 million.In 2024  Euronext will continue its costs control policy and expects that savings and synergies will offset inflation and 2023 costs ramp-up. As a result  Euronext expects its 2024 underlying expenses excluding D&A to be around €625 million  including around €10 million to finance growth projects and excluding potential impact from FX over the year.Continued innovation in trading with the launch of Euronext Mid-Point MatchFollowing the successful opening of the test environment for Euronext’s new dark trading facility at the end of January 2024  Euronext confirms the launch of Dark  Mid-Point and Sweep functionalities in Q1 20245. The whole Euronext ecosystem of trading members  local brokers  market makers and global banks  will benefit from zero latency in pegging to Euronext midpoint  and zero latency for sweeping from dark to lit on Euronext stocks.Stéphane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:“In 2023  Euronext reached record revenue and income close to €1.5 billion. Robust organic growth in our non-volume related businesses and double-digit growth in fixed income and power trading drove Group revenue's growth to +3.9%  despite negative FX impacts and the softer cash trading environment. Despite an inflationary environment  Euronext was able to finance growth projects and to beat its revised cost guidance. This was allowed by our trademark cost discipline  FX impacts and a one-off release. We reached an adjusted EBITDA of €864.7 million  which translated into an adjusted EBITDA margin of 58.6%. Our strong operating performance  combined with around €56 million of capital gains  allowed our net reported profit to grow double-digit to €513.6 million  and our adjusted EPS to increase by +5.9% to €5.51. In line with our dividend policy  we will propose a total dividend of €256.8 million  representing 50% of our reported net income  at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2024. Our strong cash generation capabilities have enabled us to already return €200 million of capital to our shareholders through the share repurchase programme implemented during the second half of 2023. We continued our deleveraging path as we reached a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.9x at the end of 2023  down from 3.2x post acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.We have made great progress with the delivery of our ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan. We have expanded Euronext Clearing as a pan-European clearing house for the clearing of cash products. This new harmonised post-trade set-up allows clients to execute their entire trading lifecycle through Euronext.These strategic milestones have materially contributed to the €74 million cumulated run-rate EBITDA synergies delivered by the end of 2023  ahead of the €70 million interim guidance.The migration of Borsa Italiana’s derivatives to Optiq in Q1 2024 and the expansion of Euronext Clearing to Euronext listed derivatives by Q3 2024 will complete our presence on the entire trading value chain and will position Euronext ideally to capture future growth opportunities.As we celebrate the 10 year anniversary of our IPO in 2024  I am looking forward to deep-dive into the opportunities that this transformation will offer for Euronext in the coming years at our Investors Day in November 2024.”2023 financial performanceIn €m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

Adjusted EPS (basic) was up +5.9% in 2023  at €5.51 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of €5.21 per share in 2022.

Consequently  costs previously reported as exceptional items have from Q1 2023 been included in their respective lines within Euronext operating expenses as non-recurring items.The €150 million of implementation costs to deliver on the ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan targets are therefore considered as non-recurring items and have been withdrawn from the underlying recurring costs.The computation of adjusted net income and earnings per share has been adjusted accordingly. The computation of reported net income and earnings per share is not impacted.2024 strategic plan targets remain unchanged and are not affected by this change in reporting.The new non-IFRS indicators are defined below.Non-IFRS financial measuresFor comparative purposes  the company provides unaudited non-IFRS measures including:Operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA  EBITDA margin  adjusted EBITDA  adjusted EBITDA margin.Non-IFRS measures are defined as follows:Operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation as the total of salary and employee benefits  and other operational expenses;Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation as the total of salary and employee benefits  and other operational expenses  excluding non-recurring costs;Underlying revenue and income as the total of revenue and income  excluding non-recurring revenue and income;Non-underlying items as items of revenue  income and expense that are material by their size and/or that are infrequent and unusual by their nature or incidence are not considered to be recurring in the normal course of business and are classified as non-underlying items on the face of the income statement within their relevant category in order to provide further understanding of the ongoing sustainable performance of the Group. These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable IFRS measures and should be read only in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.Non-volume related revenue definitionNon-volume related revenue includes Listing excl.

The program  to be executed on the market  will involve the repurchase of common shares with the intention to cancel most of them  aside from a portion reserved for share-based compensation and employee stock purchase plans. The initiative  authorized by the general meeting of shareholders  underscores Stellantis’ confidence in its cash flow generation and balance sheet strength  providing flexibility to navigate economic uncertainties while enhancing shareholder returns.

The shares will be purchased over a period ending December 31  2024 on NYSE / Euronext Milan / Euronext Paris and other multilateral trading facilities.The opportunity to initiate the buyback program stems from the Company’s significant cash flow generation and strong balance sheet. These factors enable the Company to ensure adequate liquidity to manage a wide variety of economic and market scenarios  while simultaneously facilitating attractive capital returns to shareholders  and to support the extension of the employee stock purchase plan to several countries.The share buyback program will be carried out under the authority granted by the general meeting of shareholders held on April 13  2023  which may be renewed or extended  up to a maximum of 10% of the Company’s capital. The remaining authorization granted on April 13  2023 stands at approximately 181 million shares. The purchase price per common share will be no higher than an amount equal to 110% of the market price of the shares on the NYSE  Euronext Milan or Euronext Paris. The market price will be calculated as the average of the highest price on each of the five days of trading prior to the date on which the acquisition is made  as shown in the official price list of the NYSE  Euronext Milan or Euronext Paris.As of February 15  2024  the Company held in treasury a total of 142 090 297 common shares equal to 3.52% of the total issued share capital including common shares and special voting shares.Stellantis will provide updates on the start of buybacks and on the buyback program via a press release posted on the Investors section of the corporate website under “Stock and Shareholder Info”.
